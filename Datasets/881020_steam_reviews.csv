The story is straight forward, yet compelling enough to keep you interested. It feels like your typical anime where friendship beats evil, but it never overstates its welcome and honestly its a nice change of passe, especially in a market where most releases these days aim for a doom and gloom type of vibe.

The graphics of the game are stylised to look like an anime (obviously) and it achieves this with great success. Its one of the things that will make this title age like fine wine. The world has been beautifully crafted and contains a varied selection of levels, ranging from your typical ancient forest, deserts and laval caverns to gothic designed castles. This all is paired with a fantastic OST, which never really becomes overbearing. Personally I liked most of them with exception of the final boss in proud mode.

That said, the true star of the show is the gameplay. While this might look like your basic hack and slash title, it couldn't be further from the truth. Based on the character you play, your whole gameplay plan changes. You have perfect input characters like Zeta and Siegfried, charge characters like Vaseraga and Percival, ranged mages like io, meter characters like katalina and vane, puppet characters like Rosetta, finally if you really want that button smash experience, you still have characters like Charlotte.

Gameplay revolves around having a balanced team that allows you to enter link time and sky art reliably. Ofcourse you can also play with a single character, but thats more for challenge runs. You're expected to have a balanced team where every character fills a roll (CC / DPS / Support / Stunner / Debuffer) and while every character leans towards a certain archetype, all of them multi class in some way or another, so feel free to choose whatever character you like to have in a team and play with friends in COOP.

Ofcourse, the game isnt without its flaws. When it comes to the technical aspects of the game, it lacks settings and has forced TAA. FoV cant be adjusted and there is no official support for ultrawide screens. Camera auto adjustments cant be fully disabled, which can become annoying in certain fights. Though since this game lacks an anti cheat or anti tamper DRM, most of these issues can be easily rectified with a mod.

The other issue the game suffers from is RNG in the late game. Grinding for the optimal sigil setup for a character is rather time consuming, since for the most part its all RNG based. You can determine what base sigil you get by doing specific quest, but the secondary attribute will always bee random. That said, you can consume bad sigils and roll for new ones and if you dont like the results, you can simply savescum by just going to the title screen without saving and afterwards playing a quest. This also applies to mastery.

The main issue comes from the final boss fight that drops a random terminus weapon, which isnt even guaranteed (at least you dont get dupes). This is incredibly enraging, cause you can repeat this quest 50+ times and not get what you want and since the drop rates are not guaranteed, you can go for 10 cycles without getting a single drop. This is especially egregious, since the final boss fight is one of the few bad bosses in the game in my opinion.

This all though pails in comparison to the RNG involved in getting two of the most vital sigils in the game, war element and supplementary damage. These sigils are important, since this game has a mechanic called damage cap, which means that at a certain point, normal damage boosting sigils no longer have any benefit. The two sigils I mention are the only ones that bypass this limitation, which as you can imagine make them very valuable on any character. That said, these sigils can only be obtained through drops called curio, which only drop once per quest and its not even guaranteed.  Pair that with below single digit drop rates and you get a recipe for disaster. Some players can get their sigils in their first 60 curios, while others like myself might have to roll upwards of 2000 to get one of these sigils to drop, which is infuriating.

With all of that said, I still believe this game is a solid 7.5/10, which in my book is solid. The only thing stopping this game from being an amazing release, is the RNG involved when it comes to sigils.",1708825597,1708825597,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

At the core of Relink is very satisfying gameplay mechanics centered around nearly two dozen different playable characters, all with their own unique styles.  When you find yourself content with one character, there are many more waiting for your attention.  Pair this with some very beautiful graphics, both in battle and out, and it paves the way for a ton of fun, especially with friends.

However, there are downsides.

For starters, in order to play with friends, you essentially have to get through several hours of single-player content first.  While it's possible to do so before that, you won't have access to everything.  And even then, that wouldn't be quite so bad if the story wasn't incredibly shallow.  But once you clear the story, you'll spend a lot of your time fighting RNG, whether it be for particular Sigils, materials, or endgame weapons.  The worst part of all this is you will take all this time making your character better, not so you can take on harder content, but rather so you can clear the content you've already cleared faster and/or easier.

I'll start with my criticism for what i think are the negatives of this game
- The story is not very long ( 12-15 hrs)
- There are a bunch of reused bosses throughout the story and late game content

Now, this game has (in my opinion) some of the best combat out of any party-based rpg. It feels like Final Fantasy 16, Genshin Impact, and Monster Hunter mixed together. Theres a solid roster of characters that play differently and can add value to your party as companions. It has a addictive gameplay loop of going out on missions to fight bosses for materials to upgrade and craft new gear, similar to monster hunter, and its amazing. The story is kind of short but there's harder difficulties and way higher gear tiers and much more content to do. Not to mention there's co-op that works well.
I love this game and highly recommend it to any Final Fantasy, Monster Hunter, or Genshin Impact fans.",1708798661,1708798849,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

It does not feel fluid, compare with Nier, Bloodborne, or Sekiro which use the same. Finished them and unlike this game, I still wanna play it when I lost, why, because I know the mistake I did when my char dies.

To do a successful dodge, I need to instill Goku's ultra instinct and if I want to cheap by guarding, it has limit. To add, HP does not really matters with hit mostly can down me in 3 hits, in addition, there is no iFrame after getting hit like most games (MonHun) and dodge had cooldown after 3 attempts so if I didn't out of the cont AOE circle, might as well pray I went to heaven. Another thing to add, the Developer was doing a demo stream before and even them are having problem doing it when trying to showcase it, yet, they didn't think that's a problem.

Let's say I made the dodge successfully, it really does not matter as most of the time the BOSS atk are continuous, so out from Lion's mouth jz to know a Crocodile mouth is waiting. Continue if I got the perfect dodge and become invisible, there is no countdown until when the buff last and so I can't tell when I should be prepared to do another dodge.

Lastly, enemies atk is not telegraphed properly. They will give the usual glint that an atk is coming, but the wind up is questionable. Imagine someone said that they will poison your drink but didn't tell when, so you become aware of every water you drink. In addition, you got a choice to announce that it is poisoned but whenever it is wrong, you got slapped and the time you know it, you already lost the chance to announce it (3x dodge). Then, the enemies jz throw as many as atk they can do, like Neo fighting the Agents in the Matrix but you are not Neo.

Hitbox is also questionable. There are times I was out of the AOE area yet still got hit. I believe it is due to the weapon goes over. So, if the character forgot to cut their nails and it is inside the AOE, it damage the whole body, not just the nail.

My only issue with this is the roster choice again, forcing the entire fujo knight squad and randos like Ghanda instead of Ilsa, Bea, Aliza, Naoise or the infinite number of great characters they have, instead of Lance and Vane again.

Another small annoying thing is the utter pointless censorship. And with pointless I mean they cover like 1% more of someone's skin which you usually see in ports to china or SEA.

Gameplay is very satisfying. There are many different characters to choose from and it takes forever to fully build them, but they have different skills and playstyles. 

Bosses are ok, not amazing nor bad, but re-used a bit too much. 

Music department is lacking a bit, nothing to write home about.

Multiplayer experience is a mixed bag for me. When it works it is fun, but it is sometimes hard to find any people to play with on specific missions with MM. When MM to lower level missions the game adjusts character power so it is not one shotting everything, but I think that mechanic nerfs too much sometimes and takes away the whole point of building used character.

Story is dogwater. First 6 chapters are almost digestable, but anything chapter 7+ makes 0 sense. AI, given few iterations, would write something better. I cannot believe so much effort and polish went to this game just to tell such chaotic, idiotic, nonsensical story, without good (or any resonable) pacing and with terrible villains. Misstranslation of some dialogues is not helping either.

Overall it is ok. It heavily depends on what you expect to get from the game.



EDIT after ""enjoying"" endgame for 40+ hours:

Endgame grind is crazy. It takes forever to upgrade weapons and get best sigils. It took me around 30h to get last weapon for the character I wanted and upgrade it. It is random so depending on luck it may be faster or even slower. Farming last boss 150 times is not fun. I got weapons for half of characters. Best case scenario first try drops you the weapon, worst case statistically is around 400 runs. I cannot even imagine how many hours it will take to upgrade all characters. Clear influence of endless grind in the gatcha game that is the source material here. It should not be that bad in fully priced game! Even with 10x rates of drops I would be still having only half of rooster geared at this point... 
Then again I am not sure why I even farmed that much, since I already killed last boss 150 times.

The more I play the game the less I like it.

Any extra click in UI required to replay the mission will drive you crazy! Since you will have to grind same boss 10 times to get a single material piece to upgrade your weapon (and other boss 150+ times to get the weapon you want). 

It has same issues every single JRPG has, stupid & useless drop screens and point counting screens after the battle. Useless animations when fight starts and ends (useful first 10 times, the more you play the more annoying they are and you feel that time is being wasted). 

Boss battles will lock your movement and teleport you around the battlefield when phases change - this doesn't seem bad until it happens to you many, many times, but it will since you will have to grind same stupid bosses again and again and again. 

Not to mention lock-on system that doesn't work well with multiple enemies on the screen and camera that will kill you in fights when there is more than 1 boss on the field. 

Trading/upgrading system is pretty messy because it requires a lot of different mats for no reason, other than to make things more complex and harder to remember.

I am still leaving this as recommended, but be aware of what you are siging up for end-game wise.",1707471429,1708758931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It kinda works except the game retains way to much of its gacha roots. Drops rates are just way to low for no reason. There is way to much emphasis on maining a character rather letting you use the large and diverse styles of the characters.
The camera is abysmal and no matter settings you use it remains totally awful. Upgrades that you need for things while you are playing the story are not available until way after you need them, deep into proud mode and they are already completely obsolete. I want to like this game but it just makes me annoyed more than anything. There is also a bug that stops some drops from registering so you will probably need to use SAM complete them.
The controller stopped working like every 15 minutes for the first week which was pretty annoying. They thankfully patched that but they still dont have dual sense support even though the game is on PS which is pretty slack. The inventory system is inherently broken in regards to sigils. There is no way to get rid of them without generating more and you get stuck in a self sustaining infinite feedback loop. The knickknack cap needs to be increased atleast 10x and the game needs a use all knickknack voucher option as well just for basic QOL. The save system is also a complete dumpster fire as well. And lastly but not least attack canceling and exploits shouldn't be the optimal way to dps for like 90% of the roster. It totally sucks that actually getting good at most characters is completely pointless since just running up and jumping and spamming triangle in some cases does 500% more damage. The combat, voice acting and art in general is really good but it's just unfortunately let down in many other areas.

Mainly because this game is a 10-20 single-player story tutorial followed by a 100+ hour end-game progression grind. Note, about 20-25% of my hours are AFK farming lol.

tl;dr - This is a 5/5 game for me personally. Granted, I'm into games with character/weapon variety, buildcrafting, boss encounters, and co-op. In general, if you like Monster Hunter, you'll probably like this game. It feels like a mix of Genshin/Nier Automata combat with Monster Hunter battles and progression. Also, the music is EPIC.
-----
The game drops you into what feels like the middle of the Granblue Fantasy story, and it's serviceable. The plot is very anime trope-y, and nothing to write home about. Honestly, the story is there to teach you the game and drip feed you boss mechanics. There are Fate episodes which are bits of text that give you more insight on each character plus give you free stats/sigil slots. If you want to see more, check out the Granblue anime which has 2 seasons.

The gameplay loop revolves around starting a quest with a party of four characters and completing a particular objective. Most of these will be boss fights, especially in end game. Each character (of which there are 20 currently) has a mechanic and passives specific to them which dictate their playstyle, along with up to 4 out of 7 skills to choose from (with one exception who has 12ish skills).

The end game grind is where the game is really at. Aside from mastering your chosen character, you will be upgrading your weapons, upgrading masteries (akin to skill trees), and farming for sigils. To achieve all this, you'll be taking on lots of quests, the most exciting and challenging of which are boss fights. These fights feel like raid bosses you would find in an MMO, requiring you to dodge attacks, pull off certain mechanics, and pass DPS checks.

The variety of characters plus the different ways to customize each character combine to give a huge degree of options to suit your playstyle.

Aside from all this, the game released in a relatively polished technical state. I haven't had any crashes, and matchmaking has been mostly great (most players are going to be at the higher difficulties, so matching at lower ones may not happen). Also, I feel like it's not talked enough but the music is BANGER. Every boss fight feels incredibly epic in part thanks to the great soundtrack. 

The other nice thing is that future content has already been announced, to include a boss raid in March and two new characters in April.

Minor gripes to keep in mind:
- The game will feel easy if you're used to boss battlers. Maniac (2nd hardest) is where you might sweat a little and fail some boss quests, but will mostly be alright. Proud ends up being a big difficulty spike, where you might fail more than you win if you're not careful.
- Getting the best gear in the game is a lot of RNG. This is especially so with each character's final weapon. Only one fight drops it, and not only is there only a chance to drop, but there's also a chance for it to be your main character's weapon. IE, it might not drop, and if it does, it might not be for the character you want.
- This also leads to one other gripe. You'll be fighting the same bosses a lot in order to farm, which might get stale if you're not into the grind. I hope they add more bosses in the future.
- If you plan on playing mostly solo, know that you're increasing your grind for character mats 3-4 fold. This is because every quest always has 4 characters. If you matchmake, you just have to worry about building the character you control and the other three players are the same. If you're solo, you have to build up the three AI characters in addition to your own character.
- Characters all have battle talk, and it might be grating or annoying if you're not used to it. Imagine Xenoblade Chronicles level of battle talk lol.
- The story is basically a really cliche anime. I thought it was fun, but it's not something to expect to be good..

Overall, I love this game. There's a lot to sink your teeth into, and the character variety really adds to the game for someone that likes to rotate and switch out every now and then. There is also confirmed future content through May, and this isn't even a live-service game.

If you're at all into character progression, boss raid encounters, and a whole lot of grinding, I highly recommend giving this game a go.",1706898825,1708742420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It lost a point for a horrid lock on system with a lot of camera jank and weird snapping (Especially as Eugen when getting in sniper stance) 

It lost another point for its endgame being kill proto bahamut 100 times to get 4 weapons you want for characters you want to play. Also then actually regrind everything to level them up and max out every single weapon you own just to get the last level of upgrade. Also don't forget to kill Griffin x2 and Icy Eyeball x2 about 100 times each too so you can afford upgrading everything (Grants 30-40 Fortitude L's as well as other useful things). 

At least when I grind in a game like Monster hunter I can and have obtained multiples of the ""Rare drop"" at times where as in this game its 1 per max, for most fights aside from some proud missions.
Please Buff the drop rates it heavily makes players lean into autobattling and not actually playing the game. If i kill something in Monster Hunter I really only ever need to do it about 10 times to get everything. In this game you need to kill some things 1 time and never again and then others 100 times because things like Vulcan bolas dreaded tails are used in every single attack type sigil and a load of recipes.

These gripes are not taking away from the core game play being actually fun but the repetitiveness of grinding 50 dreaded tails, 9999 fortitude L's and 100's of Bahamut runs needs some flexibility or increased drop rates. Example Vulcan bola nihilla should also drop dreaded tails as more common drops and proto weapons should also drop from Pyet-A to shake up the fights as P.Bahamut is very scripted.",1708729309,1708729309,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Bahamut is there. Lyria even got some shoes.
Now that I've finished main story I can grind for the rest of my life just like a normal GBF player. Thank you Cygames! <3

In all seriousness, the art direction is astonishing and soooo faithful to the original. Truly obviously a labour of love and a pleasure to play. So happy this game came out after it being in development for so long! I can imagine it being difficult to follow or get into for newcomers to GBF, but it sounds like lots of people have been loving it regardless! Very deserved on the developers part.

The only thing is I wish there were more long ranged characters. There are only three options really, with loads of close ranged options. Looking forward to Tweyen but would love some more, as someone who generally plays ranged in MMOs and is not super confident with action games it feels pretty unbalanced right now.

Anyway back to this game, really beautiful settings, that makes this world feel lived in without having to make an oversized open-world area. The areas feel the perfect size for the amount of things you have to do there while still looking great. The controls feel a little clunky, and should be more customizable (without having to use the steam controller configuration thing, which won't change the button icons on screen). But still enjoyable once you get used to it.

You can max every skill out for every character if you grind missions enough, but before then the skill tree is nice as it lets you go down a few different paths to max out different skills first. There are some characters that play similar roles, but generally most of them play differently still even then. I hope more content is added in the future with more content, and characters with more different playstyles.

Maybe there could be more content to experience the story of previous games in a new way, but in multiplayer, rather than being locked to single player only. Just so we dive more in the backstory of how the main characters got here, without having to  play the first GBF game.

I think some of the different gameplay we were introduced to in the story could be utilized more as possible mission types for multiplayer too. Overall though this was a really fun game, and I hope to see even more added onto it eventually, and more games like it. There is enough content don't get me wrong, it's a full game worth of content.

That being said the game in its self isnt bad, reminds me a lot of Monster Hunter series as well as Toukiden Kiwami. Not quite as difficult (at least yet) as Monster Hunters but not quite as easy as Toukiden Kiwami was.

Overall if you do not mind the EXTREME amount of anime, anime tropes and at times quite cringy dialogue and story elements, it is a very fun game with big ol´ boss fights and plenty of unique characters to play, with some build customization and a lot of stuff to grind for.

Rather than the comparisons to Monster Hunter I'd compare it more to something like Phantasy Star Online, Stranger of Paradise, and Toukiden - if you enjoyed those, you'll feel at home here. It kinda feels like an MMO-lite (complete with the hellish grind) action game but for 4 players, and I'm here for it.

The story was not for me, and is honestly some real generic anime garbage that was painful to wade through at times, but once you can finally play with friends - the gameplay loop is where it's at. Every time I'd start getting tired of the grind or how my character plays, I'd just play a different one and have a blast again. They all feel quite distinct and I haven't disliked any of them, when I normally do in similar games. Beyond just building for pure damage, there's a lot of room for goofy gimmick builds, which is always fun. There's just so many ways to consistently get a bit more powerful even in the endgame, it's an endless crack loop. But dear god, whoever decided it was a cool idea to have us kill [strike]Training Dummy[/strike] Proto Bahamut hundreds of times to obtain all of the endgame weapons, especially when several fights before it were both more interesting and difficult, is a bit of a dunce.

Aside from the story and a mild annoyance with sigil management, the only other gripe I have with the game is (unfortunately a big one) - a lack of different enemies, and difficulty. There's not much challenge when you become so powerful so quickly in the endgame, that there comes a point where you can just faceroll most things without even bothering to pay attention to much. Sure, you can impose difficulty on yourself by going in undergeared or with certain sigils - but I honestly just wish there was an extra difficulty that was actually challenging with more going on and doesn't let you die 20 times in a fight with zero repercussions, especially when the combat is on the simple side. We need a G rank. 

I hope that beyond the planned updates they consider doing a larger expansion one day, because the base here is so damn good, and I don't want this to be the end of it.

Mostly I'm writing this review because I was tricked by a lot of people in the positive reviews section who compared the game to Monster Hunter.

It's not. It's really, really not. The only similarity it has with Monster Hunter even slightly is that you go to a hub area to prep, and then select a mission and head out. Other than that, it's a completely linear action game, with a very thin veneer of RPG mechanics on top that offer little more than make the experience grindy but ultimately unrewarding. Perhaps if I knew that going in, my review wouldn't be so negative.

Granblue: Relink isn't a BAD game, don't get me wrong, but it has far, far too many actual issues for me to consider it a good one. To get the positives out of the way, the combat feels punchy, the character synergies are quite good, and the MMO-meets-action style of combat is unique, kinda like a smoother and more streamlined Phantasy Star. That, and the main story's campaign missions have quite a lot of production value, both in its (poorly written) cutscenes and in its set piece battles.

But the core thing holding it all together just isn't good.
For starters, the best part of the game is hands-down the campaign (though it's really just a series of corridors where you have to survive waves of enemies), whilst the side missions in the co-op range from boring to tedious. This is a bad thing because the game has clearly been designed to be played in co-op from the get-go (although it's functional in single player), yet you don't even truly unlock the co-op mode until you complete the game. That is to say, each chapter unlocks a miniscule handful of 3-minute-long missions that somehow feel too long and too short at the same time. It's only these missions that can be played in co-op, not the campaign which is far more interesting and better paced, and worse is that you can't progress through the co-op missions to unlock new ones. If you bought this game to play with a friend like I did, you better hope all your friends have the patience to spend upwards of 12 hours of EXTREMELY linear missions to finish the story before you sit down to play together. Otherwise you're going to be playing for about 15 minutes at a time before you have to venture out for a half-to-an-hour quest solo before you can continue playing co-op with the scraps that is the side content.

Moreover, it doesn't take long for you to realize how stale the combat actually becomes. While each character does function differently, which is pretty nice and gives you incentive to switch between fights, all combat really boils down to is pressing the same combo for each character over and over again, then dodge, then use the Link skill when the meters fill. It is very flashy and has a nice feedback to it, but mechanically it's very drab and uninteresting. There's no real need to switch up your tactics, to change how you're fighting an enemy depending on the scenario or the location you're in, save for when you come to a boss fight which MAY offer some additional objectives, but those are few and far between.

Lastly, and I get that this part is where your mileage may vary, so far the story was just lousy. A lot of people are claiming that the issue lies in the localization, but I really don't think that localization is the issue as opposed to just the story and world itself. I'll probably come back and finish the story eventually just to see where it goes, and I won't be making a comment on the story other than it seems to just have literally every trope in the book so far. But as it stands this just isn't the 10/10 JRPG people are making it out to be. It's not even an RPG to begin with, for that matter.",1708706829,1708707133,False,7,6,0.473578691482543945,4,True,False,False

Some thoughts: 
(1) The true beginning of this game is after you've finished the main story. Everything will start to get harder and you will be expected to do some grinding along the way.
(2) There are RNG (i.e. luck element involved in terms of getting the genes and loot drops), but since you'll be doing lots of grinds, having a healthy mindset will make you last longer.
(3) This game expects you to go grindy and farming. The game may not be for you if you are expecting a no grind and no farm.

otherwise if you're a tourist, i think its a decent buy, but nothing long-lasting. give it a try anyways(or watch some gameplay), it is quite fun.

music is solid, ranging from classics to some bangers

art design, level design, and graphics are top notch, other than the occasional run animation that throws me off a little(and the big ass desert level)

combat is fantastic and fluid, only complaint is some late-game duo bosses are just straight aids, and the final endgame grind is just a punching bag. it's interesting to learn the tech to reduce the time spent on the raid, but in the end its no threat; just a time sink.

the story might as well not exist. just like the gbf gacha game, the story mode is just a tutorial so you get introduced to the raids that do exist in the game; difficulty isn't there unless you handicap yourself.

90% of this game is utterly fantastic. The combat is fluid and snappy. Every character is unique with its own moveset and skills. The bosses are great and the story, although generic, is passable. This game is an odd mix of Tales combat with Monster Hunter progression and does amazingly at both.

However, that last 10% can make or break you. Where the game falls flat is the post-game (proud mode) progression. The endgame grind consists of some of the worst gacha-style mechanics with drop rates less than 1% effectively capping progression on super rng. This is made worse due to the multiple layers of this gacha-style mechanics and low drop rates for upgrade materials. This in turn makes the end game a grind fest of doing the same few missions at an excessive rate for no real progression.

I would still recommend this game as everything leading up to the endgame grind is utterly fantastic. Most people probably won't reach that grind until they are 20-40hrs in and you may find yourself willing to overlook the bad gacha. As of this review, there are no true microtransactions, everything minus a few colors are free, and the devs plan on adding more content.

-Combat is very satisfying and a lot of fun. Each character feels unique, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Not much to say outside of that, I don't personally have any issue with any of its mechanics its just a lot of fun to smack enemies and will probably keep returning to the game in the future because of it.

-Story is ok and roughly 20-30 hours long, generic enough jrpg plot but that's not really a negative. Not knowing any of the story of Granblue to begin with and the story expecting you to already know all the characters makes it really hard to follow along. And locking HP and attack power behind individual character lore/stories is kinda messed up but whatever lol.

-Voice acting is alright, Siegfried is a bit rough but its the cut in voice lines characters make in the levels so horrendously bad I had to mute the dialogue. I never hated a character more than I did Io.

-Graphics and Performance was stellar. Gorgeous game that ran wonderfully. Never had frames drops or any noticeable bugs despite how busy the screen gets.

I got drawn in by the gorgeous artwork, grand and beautiful music, and the admittedly very fun gameplay . The story though is short. I spent just a little over 20 hours in-game to beat it, and I only had to do side quests twice to buff up my party a little bit. The story is not great, but not awful either. It's fairly generic fare, and the characters don't really get a whole lot of development.

Each recruitable party member has their own unique combat style. If you're the kind of person who loves to try all sorts of different things, you won't be bored. 

I have heard it said that the real game starts after the story. I suppose that is true in a sense. After the main quest, the game gives you a lot more side quests. You can grind for XP and mastery points to level up your characters and gear. It's like it's trying to be like Monster Hunter, except I feel there is nowhere near enough variety and depth to justify hours of grinding when the story has long ended.

tl;dr: Game is worth it for the gameplay, art, and music, but in my opinion does not offer a great deal of long term value. Grab on a sale.",1708654328,1708654328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it's a hard recommend from me.

[b]story: 5/10[/b]

the only disappointing part of the game imo. as someone who has step foot in the gbf universe before, i really wasn't expecting too much in terms of plot depth and complexity or any overarching themes. really is just your cookie-cutter fantasy story: lacking in true tension and substance and really doesn't engage me enough. characters are just thrown in without any real consideration or gravitas and half-explored: which does slightly hurt the immersion, but not by too much.

however the story isn't catastrophic, and serves as decent stepping stones and gives enough context and world building for the true endgame later on.


p.s IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A STORY-FOCUSED GAME DO NOT COP THIS.

[b]production: 10/10[/b]

phenomenal. a very fucking well-polished game; probably one of the best ones in the industry atm. 

the visuals are stunning and perfectly encapsulates the fantasy in granblue: towns are intricately designed with attention to detail. no choppy character models and well thought-out levels. nothing much else to be said here: gbf relink is vibrant, colorful and filled with passion.

the cast of voice actors (i play with jp dub/eng sub) have done an excellent job in portraying their respective characters and brimming them with life. a few familiar ones too. (for those who enjoy anime)

the soundtrack is insane. almost all the boss osts gave me goosebumps on my playthrough. it really kept me captivated and my experience elevated.

[b]gameplay: 9/10[/b]

having played quite a bit of action rpgs and mmos before, i'm a big fan of the raiding system and it's elements. gbf relink has a fluid and well-crafted action system that leaves the player satisfied after every fight. personally i really dig the full-burst attack as it really emphasises on a collaborative effort.

variety is great, like how in monhun gameplay varies by weapon, in gbf relink it varies by character. characters are very in-depth in their individual mechanics and personally it's really fun discovering a new character's kit for the first time.

have to state that multiplayer runs very smoothly as well for the few times i've tried it so far.

[b]replayability: 9.5/10[/b]

with these games, i often adopt a very completionist mindset where i want to collect every achievement, max every weapon/characters, etc. 

with how the game is stylised similar to monhun, completing quests and killing bosses repeatedly is something i really enjoy. additionally, nothing is timegated so it really does appeal to people who occasionally may not have the time to log on (me too sometimes) and allows you to progress at your own pace.

despite probably not being a live-service game, i'm sure cygames will pump out significant updates in the future; so hopefully we'll enjoy more content down the road.

[b]final thoughts[/b]

the game's great and is a must-cop for any action-rpg fan: i can definitely foresee myself dumping hundreds of hours into completing the game in the future.

This game is stable unlike any other games. It just doesn't crash. It works. I saw some games crashing even they are 2D, made with major engines like Unity, Unreal, etc. And I cannot be silent about Diablo IV, MW III, they were nightmares and headaches.
I'm telling that those kinds of games are crashing like Hell, often, not just sometimes.
Actually Diablo IV was better than its released version. It just had to stay as an early access.
It's hard to see normal, standard, sane games these days. So many games are crashing, they don't work with controllers, they've got errors, bugs, faults, and they are too many, and they got paid, they keep selling. Oh, how on earth they get money with those products with so many errors!
Even NVIDIA's RTX 4090 flickers, blinks, especially with G-Sync.
Yes, it's a future we dreamed about yesterday, but is it really better than before? Cutting-edge techs, better looking, but they've got so many bugs, errors, faults than before. And it causes crashes. They cost more, they provide more errors. Is this common sense? Is this sane?
Some people said ""They are blinded, they are crazy about money."" I didn't agree, but now I agree, because I can see this, I saw.
Oh, RTX 4090 flickered again. Gotta turn off that stupid G-Sync again.
Oh, I bought ultimate editions and I haven't played Diablo IV, MW III for long time.

BUT

This game was easy to beat even before awakening the first weapon. After getting a Terminus Weapon...man with a decent team even the last boss with power level 17500 is so easy, you beat him by skipping 2 of his phases with stuns, dmg and the 2+2 burst strat.

Hardest fight is maglie and gallanza at power level 16000. Your character reaches that level even before awakening a weapon. And with terminus weapon you are 22000+ power level. There are no fights in this game where you need insane gear like that.

Just one new ""very hard"" raid they promised us won´t cut it...

And btw, having only 1 boss fight to farm terminus weapons (best weapon for all of the 20 characters) is also not good...gets a bit boring to rinse and repeat 1 boss only.

Also getting 1 char to max is pretty nice from the game pacing perspective, but if you want to do more, then it is not worth your time...ppl even startet to AFK farm because of this issue. just check youtube.
Balance the damn loot table and difficulties (or add one above proud with new boss moves at least)

Summary:
x If the devs dont give us content that is hard to beat...why should we farm stronger gear? Just to kill the bosses even faster than 2mins? Pls...harder bosses/difficulty.
x If we get so many playable characters, it should be more accessable to get multiple chars up to max weapon level without afk farm. (again, higher difficulty with higher %drop chance could fix that if done right)",1706869314,1708617415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

9 hours in I'm still stuck in the story mode and can't play the *proper* online multiplayer content which is kinda locked behind the main campaign.
The story is a steaming pile of horse dung that feels it was made up in 30 minutes by a 15yo with hero syndrome and a sadistic nature. 

Without spoiling too much, the story goes like:
Day 1: kill some goblins
Day 2: princess got kidnapped by cultists
Day 3: You attempt rescue, the cultists stomped you and sh*t on your face.
Day 4: You attempt rescue, the cultists stomped you and sh*t on your face.
Day 5: You attempt rescue, the cultists stomped you and sh*t on your face.
(no, these have nothing to do with you actual skill,  just scripted fights which you lose.)
Day 6: With the power of friendship you finally get the rescue, but the cultist boss already got the what they need to screw the entire world. 
Day 6.5: You try to stop them by beat the sh*t out of the super badass demigod-monster-creature summoned by the baddie in an epic battle (before which you again get stomped by scripted fight).
Day 6.75: Nevermind, baddie summons another super badass demigod-monster-creature, and all of your efforts went futile. F*ck you I guess?
Day 7: idk didn't play, I'm currently looking for a mod that skips the entire campaign.

So yeah no would not recommend, unless you love being the stereotypical JRPG hero or you love seeing all of your effort goes to waste.
One might argue that the gameplay is pretty neat and I agree. You get many options to choose from, and the bosses are generally quite fun to play against. But, I'm paying for the whole game so I wish to enjoy the whole game. Would you order a pizza just to find out that 1/3 of it is spoiled, and yet still give it a 5 star rating?

Got through the main campaign and to the prologue, was hoping issues with combat would get better, but so far they havent. The lock-on is both too hard of a lock on and too soft. Unlike the souls-like I've played, it doesnt track very well, so bosses/targets will often be off screen or at the very edge (and some of the larger bosses, you cant see your character). Additionally, when locked on, it doesnt allow for changing the camera, so you have to unlock do do mechanics. So it just feels like you are fighting the camera more then then the bosses themselves. Some of the character side stories have you fight bosses that are anti the character you are forced to play, and without a party, which makes some of the side stories unnecessarily tedious. Fighting ranged mobs is just a pain, since multiple of them will target you at once and attack at different times, without constant stagger resistance, you'll either be stun locked or constantly dodging and unable to kill the mobs.

After 35 hours and finishing Chapter 0, I would to like stand myself corrected with my previous review.

The game actually offers destructible parts in the boss. And what's more is that the player will also be able to use and control Bahamut. [SPOILER ALERT] The Bahamut against Bahamut Versa is so satisfying. It reminds me of the dot hack GU.

As to the difficulty, the more you unlock, like the Maniac and Proud, the game actually offers a lot of challenging gameplay, which is contrary to the difficulty I earlier stated in my previous review. Yes. The game is actually hard at some point.

The only thing I have reservation with, is the full auto assist mode, which allows you to farm afk for materials. It's just a Quality of Life option but it becomes a necessity at the end of the game if you want to Min-Max the game. Thus, making one player leave the game on even in their sleep, if they intend to maximize the efficiency in farming for the materials they would need.
--------End of New Review---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previouse Review:
You don't need a controller to enjoy the game. The default keybinds are already keyboard friendly. The mouse sensitivity for the camera needs a work (requires high DPI, to feel the smoothness)

still 5 hours into the game with hard mode, and the game mechanics is really enjoyable and promising already. 
Music wise, especially in every battle is very nostalgic to the old JRPGs, 10/10; 
Gameplay is similar to Tales of Arise meets Monster Hunter, 10/10; 
The Story so far is okish, and a bit engaging. 8/10 
Difficulty is a bit easier than most other games because even with the hard mode, it felt easy with the right gear and party set up. 8/10
Enemy battle mechanics is so good but I wish we could also break some parts similar to MHW(But who knows I'm still 5 hours into the game), 9/10

Current Overall 9/10

P.S.Will update this review as I go further to the game.

The game is very well optimized and runs well with no framerate drops or problems even with all the chaos of a big fight going on

The only downside to this game is the story, which really just feels like it gets in the way for the first 15 hours or so. When you complete the main story, it feels like you can finally just play the game and enjoy everything that's great about it

The bosses are what impressed me most and I'm not usually into games that are so focused on boss fights. But the boss designs, the music choices, the brief cinematics that play and presentation of the fights as a whole are so good, and every new boss you face just seems to outdo the last

This is just a great fun game with amazing gameplay and is definitely worth the price. Again, I typically don't like boss fight games or JRPGs but this game just did so many things so well.

The music is amazing. The UI and art-style of the game is so phenomenally constructed and put together , that it creates both an immersive and intuitive experience for the player all the way through. 

Definitely a must buy if you're an avid fan of games such as Tales of or Monster Hunter.",1706836592,1708570602,True,0,0,0.523463547229766846,0,True,False,False

Combat is the main focus of the game and it feels damn good, no matter what class of characters you pick. All 17 characters feel good in their own way, though some are, of course, better than others. Overall, the combat is fluid and responsive. The end-game loop revolves around min-maxing your characters to complete harder and harder content. This process is kind of grindy, but not as grindy as an MMO and is also not time-gated, which is a big plus for me.

The game in itself is really enjoyable and fun, i spend 400h so far and im more than hyped for the upcoming updates however..
Some stuff is really annoying and that is curio sigils for the most parts, people cheat them and get away with it.
If you would adjust some stuff like making attack buffs/defense down debuffs have their own dmg cap increase so they at least be a little bit usefull and also make v+ curio sigils easier to obtain the endgame wouldnt be so annoying and frustraiting.
Right now im just auto assisting the majority of the time to get curio, its boring and kills the vibe for me.
As mentioned earlier the fact that the majority of character kit´s are useless considering dmg cap exist is also pretty annoying, at the current state of the game you dont need defense buff for anything, healing is completly irrelevant since potion sigil is the most broken utility sigil in the game and stuff like defense down also does nothing, make stuff more relevant, the game is great but some aspects lack alot of flavor.

No gacha, FOMO, stamina, actual character stamina (from sprinting or dodging/dashing), paywalls (excluding the paid boosters/weapon), etc. Whenever I wish this was open world I'm actually reminded of how painful Genshin Impact was to explore. Its system where you had to collect a billion tiny spirits to get a tiny bit of max character stamina. If I wanted to do that, I'd just switch to Breath of the Wild, which respects my time. I'm glad this is as pure as a game can be and more.

I never played the original Granblue so I cannot say with certainty how many of these mechanics are granblue originals or not, but essentially, the game comes across as a high-octane and much easier and forgiving monster hunter style game with many other elements from different titles. The combat feels similar to a tales-esk game but pushed to the maximum in terms of how over-the-top it is.

Unfortunately, this game is also plagued with similar problems as modern monster hunter 5, but worse. It lacks a sufficient end game of any kind, does not provide any sort of ""endless"" or randomly generated missions to grind, and no obvious account ranking system. Despite this, the game still manages to bar your ability to build and max out your team of four characters through rng systems and the requirement of many many low drop chance items. Additionally, virtually every character is funneled through basically the same end game build: stack damage cap gems as high as possible. If Granblue Fantasy was going for a much more casual style of game that you beat and then move on from, then why require such a grind?

This game would be greatly improved with the addition of:
1) A random matchmaking lobby to accelerate matchmaking speed
2) The ability to move around towns while waiting in queue
3) Additional rewards for completing random hunts with strangers online
4) Copy monster hunter and add ""investigations"", ""anomaly hunts"", or missions that randomly generate a combination of enemies you have to beat in waves, instead of all at once, as well as more mission structures that aren't centered around just killing a boss
5) After maxing a weapon to level 150, make every subsequent weapon easier and cheaper to upgrade or craft; Same for character levels. The game forces you to hard commit to one main character for too long before you farm out enough materials to play other characters comfortably.
6) remove damage cap entirely, it is a bad system and forces you into always using gems to upcap it, making more versatile builds impossible. 
7) Rushing through the story feels sort of bad. Advancing the story isn't barred behind an account level system, so you can ignore every side mission, put the game on journalist difficulty, and speed run through the whole game in about 6 hours or less. Makes the game feel empty.
8) Having chests, slimes, and crabs really only farmable by replaying story missions after finishing the game is a drag. Make more game modes that are open world, where you go to an overworld, explore it as your own pace, and hunt monsters that spawn there, then leave when you feel like it. That, or just dont have collection systems in a game like this, it doesn't work that well in my opinion. 

Overall, the game feels pretty light weight. Its fun, sure, but I completed every single mission in the game from easy to proud difficulty in 30 hours and really dont feel much of an incentive as a player to continue on. Its a good starting point and framework as a start to a potential franchise, but needs a lot more work on content, endgame, pacing, systems, and scope to feel like a fully realized game.",1708544761,1708544761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It delivers a seamless experience across platforms, performing admirably on both PC and the Steam Deck, with minor hiccups such as an unplayable cutscene on the latter device only slightly marring an otherwise smooth presentation.

The game, while accessible to newcomers of the Granblue Fantasy series, offers depth and complexity that will satisfy veterans. Its combat system, favorably compared to Platinum Games' offerings, blends strategic depth with accessible mechanics, ensuring a rewarding experience for players of all skill levels. Characters are distinct and versatile, allowing for a range of playstyles and strategic experimentation, further enriched by a system of mastery points, weapons, and levels that encourages players to delve into post-story content.

Despite its strengths, ""Granblue Fantasy: Relink"" is not without its flaws. Some players have noted the generic nature of its story, critiquing it as a conventional tale of good versus evil that fails to innovate within the genre. The voice acting and localization have also drawn criticism, with a strong recommendation to switch to the Japanese voice acting for a superior auditory experience. Additionally, the game's approach to multiplayer and difficulty balancing has been a point of contention, with disparities in challenge between solo and co-op play and an overreliance on DPS checks in boss fights.

The game's visual and audio presentation has been universally praised, with stunning environments, character designs, and a soundtrack that elevates the overall experience. The attention to detail in the game's art direction and the quality of life features stand out as highlights, providing a visually cohesive and user-friendly experience.

""Granblue Fantasy: Relink"" positions itself as a must-play for fans of the action RPG genre, offering a satisfying blend of combat, exploration, and character progression. Its gameplay loop is addictive, drawing players into its world with the promise of new challenges and rewards. The planned updates and expansions indicate a commitment to the game's longevity, promising to address some of the current criticisms and expand on its already rich foundation.

In conclusion, ""Granblue Fantasy: Relink"" is a testament to the potential of the Granblue Fantasy franchise in the realm of action RPGs. Despite its imperfections, the game offers a compelling experience that rewards player investment with deep gameplay, a diverse cast of characters, and a world that begs to be explored. It stands as a beacon for what the genre can offer, inviting both newcomers and seasoned players to partake in its grand adventure.

This game draws heavily from Monster Hunter and from Final Fantasy XIV, and does what it does in many ways better than those games do. Excellent! Perfect! That's exactly what I would want! Who doesn't want more of something they like that's better?

I have no interest in gacha and will never play one, so it was a huge surprise to me to learn that this setting is actually REALLY COOL and the narrative, while not innovative in any way, is a fun exploration of an offshoot of this setting that goes out of its way to illustrate just how WILD it can be.

Yes, Relink does not have as many enemies or as much enemy variety as a series that has been building up a monster catalog since the PS2. Yes, Relink does not have as many boss fights or as in-depth a story as FFXIV (which is over 10 years old). What it does have is an EXCELLENT base with plenty to do.

I'm 63 hours in and find some of the complaints I've seen to be extremely amusing. I've heard the game described as ""grindy"". This is not grindy. Doing things that you enjoy doing to Make Number Get Bigger is not really a [i]grind[/i], it's playing a game?

Moreover, it's far easier and more consistent to get materials that you want from doing late-game fights in this game than in any of its peers. I'm currently working on maxing out weapons and characters, and I have thus far found exactly one material that is ""difficult"" to farm, and what that actually means is that sometimes when I do the mission to get it I don't get it.

Meanwhile, this game is competing with Monster Hunter, where wyvern gems are the bane of my existence. It has a built-in pity system for most resources, too, which is very nice!

I cannot emphasize enough how much, gameplay-wise, this is Monster Hunter Final Fantasy XIV. The characters control like Monster Hunter and many have really fascinating and awesome tech that makes them have way more depth than they initially seem (as two big examples: Percival can dodge cancel his offensive skills to rapidly charge his heavy attack for BIG damage, and Katalina can cancel the end of her Ares combo into any damaging skill and right back into Ares for HUGE sustained damage. There's plenty of this kind of thing.)

My biggest complaint is that even though the game explains a LOT (and has a LOT to explain to a brand new player to this series) it could still stand to explain a lot of the more advanced gameplay concepts better than it does. There are tutorials, but they're fairly short and come very quickly early on. I also find it odd that the journal is a completely separate loading screen and can make it feel a bit clunky to look things up. Also if the game DOES tell you to go to the trophies menu so you can claim rewards that you get from getting trophies, I sure didn't see that until I went to the menu 60 hours into playing and had a huge pile of rewards to claim. (Thankfully, you can get them all in a single button press.)

My only other complaint is that I feel like the difficulty curve is a cliff. Easy, normal, hard, and extreme missions are all fairly straightforward and easy. Then you hit Maniac and suddenly boss fights ROCK YOUR ASS and you had BETTER have learned how to survive the now much more complicated and aggressive boss patterns. One in particular has been kicking my ass (not that that's a bad thing; I appreciate the challenge!) and I really think the game could stand to have made Hard and Extreme more difficult so there was more of a curve there, because it definitely felt like hitting a brick wall.

I also wish that Quick Mission would check your character's stats before deciding what mission to send you on; I may have accidentally gone into a mission once with a character at /half/ the recommended strength because I wasn't thinking (the previous four had all been low level!)

In short: Character progression is straightforward, pretty much every character is fun (Charlotta hurts my hands to play, too much mash </3), unlocking characters isn't obnoxious or RNG based, and the only real RNG I'm running into is basically just Decorations from Monster Hunter World, with the caveat being that it's pretty straightforward and easy to get GOOD sigils, it's just RNG heavy to get THE BEST sigils. So you don't have that feeling of being useless that World gives you if you dare to fail to at acquiring multiple Attack gems when the acquisition rate is something absurd like 1%.

Some people have complained that there's a damage cap mechanic here in Granblue. I think it's brilliant. If you think about it, EVERY game has a damage cap, the game just doesn't tell you you've hit it - and the 'meta' is to tailor your entire build around meeting it. At the end of the day, you've hit ""damage cap"" in Monster Hunter when you've fully minmaxed your offensive stats, right?

Granblue finally solves the issue that is at the heart of Monster Hunter: the divide between ""people using maxed out glass cannon high skill builds"" VS ""people that want some comfiness in their build"". Here in Granblue, when you're at the end of the game and have a completely turbomax meta endgame perfect super special build, you're going to STILL have slots open you can put into any utility or QoL you want. That's AWESOME. This is a brilliant way to enable and encourage build creativity that every game in this genre should steal.

(Key to it is that the damage caps are rather high, and easy to raise a significant amount with your build)

This game RULES. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Monster Hunter and/or wants to experience a pretty damn cool setting with VERY GOOD gameplay.",1708535117,1708535117,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is...Monster Hunter levels of engaging. Serviceable, but only as a vehicle to get you to kill things. The game does nothing to get you invested in the characters or story, save for putting walls of text onto a static png, which you unfortunately can't ignore if you want to increase your characters' stats. The questionable localization doesn't help either. If you understand Japanese but play with English subtitles, be prepared to be very distracted by how different the dialogue is. Fortunately, mashing the A button is a thing that exists. But if you're in it only for the action anime gameplay, then you'll have a pretty fun time.

Grinding is a huge pain, expect to spend gatcha game level of hours grinding and grinding if you want to max out a single character. On the other hand, if you like grinding endlessly on the same content over and over, then this is the game for you. Just be aware that, if you think Monster Hunter grinding is long, then this game is even more so.

However, if you're someone who likes arcade-y action games who honestly doesn't care about the story and doesn't mind the limited amount of bosses, then this game will be a pretty fun time.

Yes, this game is censored. I'm not going to tell you what to feel about it, if this is something preventing you from buying it, then all the power to you. If this is something, that you don't care about, then good for you. Lets all be adults here and acknowledge that different things have different levels of importance to different people.

For me, I've gotten a crap ton of fun out of this game. However, the reason why I can't earnestly wholeheartedly recommend it currently, is the limited amount of content has you running the same bosses over and over, and the constant network errors and region and platform lock means that you'll be spending a lot of your time just waiting in the lobby.

first 20-40 hour of the game is fun, the story is nice, the small grind is nice. it is just like any other jrpg

once you get into the endgame, building power is tons of grinding and rng
the base gameplay of fighting bosses in small arena make the grinding not fun in a long run

if you enjoy grinding or only want the story then this game is ok. for me the grind is kind of ok, not sure for other people. ps: i have fully awakened terminus weapon.

+ ok story
+ ok performance
+ good visual for jrpg
+ good audio for jrpg
+ interesting gameplay and character

If you're a solo player and expecting fun times at random, I would not recommend this game. If you have friends that play, heck yeah, this is the game for you. That said, the end game grinds solo is rough, you have 4 characters to max out, and each one takes a good 10–15 hours depending on how efficient you are. But when you have those initial 4 characters maxed out, you have another end game grind to your character and that is where the game falls off. You're stuck doing the same quest over and over. Matchmaking has no intensive other than daily tickets you can spend on special items. There is a chance you will lose a match at random, and they won't restart, or you, join a match, and you can't hold your own and die pretty much instantly.

Again, as a solo player, this game is fun till the end of the game and match-making is horrible because most people beat the game, so good luck matching with, random people. I'm about half way, heck not even halfway through the end game and I'm stuck and bored with the repetitive nature of the end game. If match making was better, I'd have a lot more fun, but there just aren't enough players to make it fun. 

Solo game is fun, but it just doesn't compare with playing with real people. The CPU AI is good and all, but like I said, you can't beat a human. ",1706815014,1708474389,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game story is something you can play throught in about a single day if you don't focus on grinding items to get stronger, since even on hard mode, you can easily finish it even if you're underleveled as long as you're skilled in dodging and blocking.
On hard mode I easily defeated a challenge lvl 60 when my group was all lvl 30's.

The biggest issue the game has, would probably be called a feature by the developer team... basically after you play through the story, there is a lot of ""content"", doing quests on the guild/hub or having a new start with a new unlocked difficulty.
Why is that an issue?
Well, when the main story is completed, we consider the game finished, done, finito.
Besides starting a new game difficulty, why would I care to go back, grind more and finish side quests then?
Making it an option to play certain chapters again to find stuff you missed instead of having an open explorable map that isn't limited to finishing the story first... is a huge mistake.

Something else worth mentioning, would be the ship you travel around with.
There could've been so much potential on adding all kinds of mechanics and character development, but no, you just have a single layered platform in form of a ship were everyone is on top of.
It hurts so bad, not being able to enter the doors, interact with the crew when you feel like it or even have something casual there. Instead it's working as a kind of a passage to go to the mission only.

Now something that makes me actually grind my teeth or slap my own face, is the fact that during the story the group meets an enemy and instead of jumping on them to start a fight, they just start having a long speech. 
The main antagonist, keeps repeating herself to no end after each encounter, so much that I can't hear her talking anymore.
This besides mentioning, that it's a bit of sad that the female voices of the playable characters in English Dub, are shocking to hear, since you would expect something more... japanese kind of cute and not... woman with a deeper voice.

The combat system is quite irritating, to the point someone could break the keyboard if you play as ""Io"".
The camera focus is a pain sometimes, and the worst of all are the boss fights.
I'm not so good with close combat, I do like to play as siegfried though, but after hearing him say all the time, ""This is power"" I decided to just play as ""Io"".
""Io"" is a character that channels a lot during combat. While fighting bosses, her channel gets canceled a lot because of transformations or ""cinematic moments"", this is specially painful during quests you want to kill the boss in less than 2 minutes to get the highest ranking.
This could be considered a game breaking bug for people that mainly play as ""Io"" since the impact of it on her is so big.

Overall, the game does also have a fair amount of good aspects.
But sometimes it just feels a bit like ""copy paste"" because of the lack of polish.
And the main issue that the game gives the players the best part of what they want, when it's already finished and it doesn't really matter anymore to some players.

To put it short, the game was a potential gem, but it ended up as it is, because there was some lack of consideration towards players and for some reason everything was made in a rush???",1708458640,1708458640,False,2,0,0.47539210319519043,0,True,False,False

However, the English translation is pretty weird. I do understand the context of what they're going for but it feels mostly unnecessary for what they're trying to achieve, creating weird characterizations with certain characters and even makes some events feel odd. I'm not asking for a direct Japanese-English translation but it could've been way better than what we have right now. Usually things like this don't bother me but this one is very noticeable and is so far the only thing that I've been concerned with throughout my current playtime.

TLDR; A good JRPG hindered by its story's pacing and bland cast. Incredible visual art style, smooth animations, responsive and snappy combat, epic combat scenarios and a good endgame loop. 

I have not played any Granblue game but I do know that this franchise exists. Having said that, I have not found the story of this game overwhelming. It eases you into knowing the cast, their history, and the world they live in. While that is a good thing, as someone new to this franchise, the story fails to keep me interested with these individuals. Additional info per character IS available through reading a wall of text, unlike some JRPGs where they take time introducing you to the cast. Another problem with the story is how it is paced. Characters introduced throughout the main scenario aren't given enough screen time for character development. The crew jumps from one battle to another with not enough downtime in between to help you digest what has happened. My last gripe with the story is the dialog. Yes, JRPGs are notorious for corny and cringey dialog, but in my opinion, this one takes the cake. With the lack of proper pacing plus the lack of historical knowledge of these characters and their bond with each other, it feels cornier than usual when they say their corny lines. While the story lacks individual character arcs, proper pacing, and better dialog. It is still digestible since the game only has 10 chapters and the story can be finished in 10-15 hours, maybe less. 

If you can treat the story as background noise, then you will be treated with artistic visuals, responsive combat, epic boss fights and combat scenarios, and an endgame loop that will make you want to keep playing long after the story is over. 

Oh yeah, there is also online co-op. So participate in Jolly Cooperation!

✔ Good optimization at day 1 with no stutter or fps drop at 1080p ultra (Ryzen 5 5600, RX6700XT, 32GB RAM, SSD)
✔ Engaging boss battle (like monster hunter/god eater)
✔ No micro-transaction or P2W element

✔ Smooth and fluid animation during combat mechanic (doing combo+skill+link+break+art+burst) 
✔ Interesting world where the island floating in the sky
✔ Have 19 playable character with unique combat mechanic for each character
✔ Beautiful cel-shaded graphic

✖ The story mode are entirely solo (need to able to play coop with friend like borderland or monster hunter)
✖ No side activity or mini game (side quest are too simple and not engaging)
✖ Not open world or at least explorable world like monster hunter world when doing boss quest

I am intending to awaken the rest of the characters in due time. Fully farmed all content in the game both with online matchmaking and AI companions. Let me give a quick review for this game.

PROS:
* Excellent combat engine with fast paced and deep mechanics and high ceiling on some characters.
* Fluid, lifelike, and gorgeous art and animations. The Cygames team have an excellent engine on their hands.
* None of the characters that I've tried and learned play similarly to each other. Each character have their own strength, weakness, and key mechanics.
* Characters are very endearing and there are unique banters within special set of characters.
* For your first character, very few grind is required even to fully awaken your terminus weapon.
* Some of the bosses have great and interesting mechanics.

CONS:
* Currently (February 2024) none of the endgame bosses require high damage or mechanical mastery.
* Sigils which are a big part of power progression are mainly received from a menu that requires too many clicks. Highly recommend setting up your Steam Controls with a way to turbo the Sigil opening with vendor.
* When you want to make your other characters stronger, you will have to grind for many materials and sometimes due to efficiency you end up farming lower level contents instead of the Proud (highest difficulty) contents. Probably need to tweak Proud fight rewards.
* Story is very weak but serviceable.

A very interesting part of this game is also the possibility to farm materials and fights with your AI. Your AI companions will always have AI control, but your player character can only use AI up until Extreme difficulty. For Maniac and Proud difficulty, your character cannot be controlled by AI however if your other 3 companions are strong enough it is possible to farm Proud content fully AFK with AI.

One important point about AI farming is that it will only do it for 10 times before a prompt will show up on your screen asking you if you want to continue. This means AI farming can be done in the day while you are doing your daily errands and work but it cannot farm by itself while you sleep. I think it's an important disctinction.

Overall, I find the game to be truly refreshing for not using any Gamepass or FOMO tactics to make people keep playing. People keep playing due to its gameplay and all we're missing are harder bosses and various contents. Looking at other Granblue franchise history, they seem to have enough things cooking to be able to do this similar to Monster Hunter. Give some time limited collaborations, add harder bosses overtime, and drop a full-fledged DLC after a year or two.",1708448786,1708448786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[hr][/hr]
[h3][i] Overview [/i][/h3]
[i] If you're a fan of immersive, action-packed gameplay experiences akin to Monster Hunter or the expansive worlds and diverse character options found in Final Fantasy XIV, then Granblue Fantasy Relink is an absolute must-play. Its robust endgame content ensures that the adventure doesn't end with the main story, providing ample opportunities for continued excitement and challenge. With a vast array of characters boasting unique playstyles, abilities, and backgrounds, there's something to suit every taste and preference, whether you prefer to dive into the fray with a heavy-hitting warrior, support your allies with powerful magic, or outmaneuver foes with swift and agile tactics. Granblue Fantasy Relink offers a breadth of gameplay possibilities that will undoubtedly capture your imagination and keep you coming back for more.[/i]

[h3]Story[/h3]
[hr][/hr]
Embark on an epic journey through the vast skies and mystical realms of the Granblue Fantasy universe. Set in a world where islands float among the clouds and ancient civilizations thrive, the story follows a young hero who teams up with a diverse cast of companions, including skyfarers, magical beings, and powerful warriors. Together, they must uncover the secrets of the Astrals, formidable beings threatening the balance of the world, while unraveling the mysteries of their own pasts and forging bonds that will shape the fate of the skies. As they battle formidable foes, explore breathtaking landscapes, and encounter a myriad of colorful characters, players will immerse themselves in a captivating tale of adventure, friendship, and destiny. This all sounds incredible right? If you strip out the gameplay, and fantastic visuals, the story itself feels a bit phoned in. I found myself losing interest far before the credits rolled. All the characters are interesting in their own right, but the Story doesn't build on these connections in any meaningful way. You can do Fate missions, which are separate from the story, and delve deeper into the characters. But for the most part these become a slog as they gate stats for each of the characters and feel very low effort. As a whole, if you are buying Gran Blue Fantasy: Relink for the story alone, I fear you may walk away disappointed. 

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
[hr][/hr]
Granblue Fantasy Relink bears the unmistakable imprint of Platinum Games, evident in its fluid movement mechanics and meticulously crafted character abilities. Each character boasts a diverse skill set that resonates with a global appeal, reminiscent of the intricate combat dynamics found in titles like Final Fantasy XIV. The game seamlessly incorporates elements like animation cancels and combo chains, lending depth and dynamism to every encounter. What sets it apart is its flexible character roles, mirroring the versatility seen in multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs). Whether players prefer to tank incoming damage, provide crucial support, or unleash devastating damage, every character can adeptly fulfill multiple roles, albeit with varying degrees of proficiency, ensuring a diverse and engaging gameplay experience for all.

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
[hr][/hr]
The cel-shaded art style in Granblue Fantasy Relink reaches new heights of visual splendor, surpassing even the notable achievements of titles like Borderlands. While Borderlands may have introduced cel shading to widespread acclaim, GBF: Relink elevates it to an art form all its own. Reminiscent of the enchanting visuals of Ni No Kuni, the hand-drawn aesthetic captivates players from cutscenes to gameplay, maintaining a harmonious balance that prevents screen clutter even during the most intense boss battles. This seamless integration of artistic design is a testament to the meticulous attention to detail exhibited by Cygames, showcasing a level of craftsmanship rarely seen in modern gaming. Every aspect of the game exudes a sense of care and dedication, solidifying Granblue Fantasy Relink as a visual masterpiece deserving of commendation.

[h3]Port / Bugs[/h3]
[hr][/hr]
From a port perspective, its easy to tell this game was made for the Playstation 5 and then ported over. No ultrawide support is a big miss in my opinion.For a game that was ported from Playstation to PC, its strange that Playstation inputs are not available but Xbox inputs are. As bugs go, I have had no issues, everything has run smoothly since release.
Endgame & The Grind
[hr][/hr]
The journey doesn't end with the credits in Granblue Fantasy Relink; in fact, that's just the beginning of the thrilling endgame experience that awaits players. After approximately 20 hours trenching through the main story mission,, adventurers will find themselves diving headfirst into a challenging grind, taking on progressively tougher bosses until they face the formidable foe, [spoiler]Proto-Bahamut[/spoiler]. The grind intensifies as players strive to level up their characters, acquire powerful sigils, and enhance their arsenal of weapons, immersing themselves in a cycle of resource farming that, while repetitive at times, is undeniably addictive. Despite the grind, the game's engaging gameplay mechanics and captivating world make it easy to invest countless hours, ensuring that players will find themselves eagerly sinking more and more time into the rich and rewarding experience that Granblue Fantasy Relink offers.

It's main story is pretty short with most people beating it in around 15 hours of exploring areas with set piece story and boss fights, while the bigger post game portion is more Phantasy Star Online/Monster Hunter style quests against standalone bosses and the like. It's a game that switched developers midway though and is related to a browser/phone game that's English version is almost an unkempt secret. So with all of these things seemingly going against it... why is this game still an absolute joy to play?

The plot is approachable for newcomers to the series (like me when I started), as it is more it's own thing like an anime license game story. It's not something I would call great, but it has fun bits and great set pieces and fun characters with great designs.

Speaking of character design and the visuals, this game is absolutely gorgeous. Technically it is a bit behind, but the art design and the colorful aesthetic are just something I love. The music is also fantastic, with a fairly varied soundtrack, going from typical fantasy tracks to things like rock with certain bosses.

Gameplaywise, it's an action RPG with a bunch of characters that all have their own quirks so there is absolutely someone for anyone to love using (I personally really like Racham's mad daka-daka and Percival's charge focus) and the gameplay itself is fast paced, exciting and my god we have an action game like this were blocking is not a waste of time!

Gameplay is pretty simplistic, gearing is generally accessible up until late game where it becomes a 0.45% chance^3 to get that final 1.2x damage multiplier per character (friends are still stuck on it), the problems with save files seems to finally have been addressed with a secondary back up save being produced (though idk if it's fool proof).

 :Story: 

-Plot; It's not really bad or anything, just generic and meh

-Characters; Decent

-Mission Structure; Very good

-Set Pieces; Definitely epic, reminds me of Final Fantasy 16 and that's not just because both games have Bahamut. Story boss fight's are better than they have any right being (this could also fall into gameplay below).


 :Gameplay (why you buy it):

-Combat; It's awesome, flashy and feels amazing

-Classes/playstyles; Great variety, even the same ""class"" can fill different playstyles

-Content; Plentiful, you will fight the same bosses multiple times though but it hasn't felt repetitive yet. Also helps if you play other classes/characters


:Misc:

-Not really any exploration but has similar structure to Monster Hunter without feeling like Monster Hunter (this is not a bad thing either). If you're wondering about any paid cosmetics or pay for characters then worry not, what is on the steam dlc page is all there is (a few skin colors I believe is all?). No ""premium"" currency or anything. This is not a live service game even if it easily could have been one.

-Issues; Had a few at launch that were genuinely frustrating but they seem to have been fixed now. 

-Performance; Seems pretty good but your hardware may vary. It's always smooth in my experience though. 

-No Ultra-wide support (yet) but there is easy to use mods for that available.

:steamthis:
1.) Harder content that greatly benefits from healers (Things are so ez as it is people are already getting bored.
2.) Sex sells! You'll want a few more unique characters with attractive female bodies. Keeping players interested goes far beyond just combat and your playerbase/audience are of the ages 18+ for the majority!
3.) MUSIC! Nothing gets players EXCITED for battle like genuinely good music that gives the option to be CHOSEN before entering into battle! This should also contain a ""Random"" function which will choose from a set of a player's favorited choices.

I wish there was a little more build variety between characters, you can pretty reliably copy over all but like two or three sigils from one character to another and have a functional build. But the uniqueness in playstyles between each character makes up for that.

Many people complain about the endgame grind, but I think it's only a problem if you're just wanting to beeline it to an optimal damage build. I'm focusing on playing different characters, leveling up their weapons, and I'll sprinkle in a few final boss fights here and there. I'll get what I get and make the best use of what I have. You can more than comfortably play and complete all content right now without the strongest weapon which is a rare drop. At this point I haven't really missed out on anything and I'm lacking some of the stronger coveted gear.

My only real complaint is that the full story is a prerequisite to the majority of the multiplayer content. I'm real tired of forced single player in great co-op games. I wish the story was completely optional. They have the ""Chapter Select"" feature which lets you play the story again whenever you want, if it was completely relegated to that I would love it. A 10-15 hour story is huge hurdle to convincing people to play with me who don't have investment in Granblue.

edit: 
now that im done with all the endgame grind except supp v+ from curio, i can safely say this is an amazing game and has the skeleton to become a fun grinding game in the future. the most notable aspect are the different types of engaging action combat that are as fun as MHW. 

however, to me, there are few questionable designs which are:
1. frequent cutscene interrupting the flow of combat; 
2. certain item's abysmal droprate that ends up promotes afk farming somewhat similar to bitcoin mining;
3. huge difficulty and performance gap between characters due to their skill sets, especially invincibility;
4. the lack of any targetable mechanics for grinding, eg. sigils and endgame weapon/materials;
5. forced camera movement and forced simulated/smooth mouse input.
but these are only minor problems that don't really impact the experience negatively, maybe except the camera and mouse.

content/price-wise, it is about the average 7/10 in 2012's standard, which means it is probably 9/10 (or even 10) in 2024's standard. if you want to get the game for the grind, i do suggest wait for detailed roadmap or possibly updates before purchasing because the devs are known to be pretty non-responsive.",1707436776,1708374611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
* The main story is fun, engaging, and epic, and does a great job teaching you about the cast and setting without ever condescending to the player. At about 4-8 hours total, it also doesn't overstay its welcome either, wrapping up and letting players free to engage with end-game content or not as they see fit.
* The story fights are all epic as heck, each topping the last to the point where just when you think you beat the last boss, another one appears.
* The towns and settings are breathtakingly gorgeous and are some of the most detailed I've seen in a game of this type before. They are full of NPCs that quietly tell more about the setting through dress and mannerism and never feel strangely small or depopulated.
* The combat system is snappy and responsive. 
* Top-end (Proud difficulty) content is at a good level, being fun and challenging without being frustrating or unfair. It is entirely possible that you will lose some encounters in co-op multiplayer, but most players doing that content are skilled enough that it rarely happens.
* While the jumps can feel a bit ""floaty,"" the platforming elements don't overstay their welcome and are completely optional.
* There is a wide roster of characters with very different playstyles. Each character dramatically changes the feel of the game. You can try many characters to keep the game fresh, or go deep on a single character to master their moveset.
* All except the very highest difficulty is relatively forgiving and easy to power through for players who just want a cinematic experience.
* There are many options for building your character to match your play style. *

Cons:
* The main story is entirely single-player and cannot be done with friends. It is possible to engage with friends in side missions at any point in the game, but the main story must be done with 3 AI-controlled characters.
* There are only two cities currently. While both of the cities, especially Seedhollow, are gorgeous and expansive, it would be nice to get new cities to explore in future downloadable content.
* When doing co-op with vastly outgeared players, unless matched using quick quest (random matchmaking), the numerical difference leads to one player contributing nothing while the other one-shots the enemies. I haven't found a way to force the game to scale stats down to match the difficulty of the quest being posted.
* The very end-game turns into a pretty heavy grind, getting 100% mastery on all four mastery paths, unlocking and leveling all of the characters' weapons, farming for a terminus weapon, going through two very arduous awakening phases for ascension and terminus weapons, and leveling an endless parade of randomly generated slightly-better sigils to level 14-15. Most steps require large amounts of a rare item drop called Silver Centrum that proves to be the bottleneck when all other bottlenecks (boss drops, money) cease being a barrier.
* The sheer amount of grinding it takes to max out a single character makes it unreasonable to play multiple characters in end-game content without committing to an equally long and arduous grind for each new character. While you can do most of the content with a character that isn't completely stat-maxed, it feels like the game more rewards extremely deep investment in a single character than branching out.
* Your character quite quickly hits the ""damage cap,"" thus making ""damage cap+"" the most important skill in the game. It invalidates a lot of more interesting builds that focus on situational damage increases, as it becomes almost trivial to hit the damage cap with a small handful of damage-boosting sigils, rending all other damage-boosting sigils useless. 
* The maximum damage cap increase (65 levels from weapon and sigils + 100% from terminus weapon) becomes the baseline for all builds, making building individual character sigil builds feel only modestly different from one another.
* Through most of the game, your choice of weapon is a strong reflection of your personal playstyle, but the ascension weapon and then the terminus weapon outclass them to the point where most end-game builds are pretty prescriptive and every player is visually using the same weapon, taking out one of the few avenues for personal customization.
* The alternate color palettes, including the ones that are DLC, are all pretty mediocre or actively bad, and generally look worse than the characters' default palettes.

Overall, I feel like the game is a great experience and certainly worth the 10 hours or so it takes to play through the story campaign and enjoy the side content. For those who want to stick around and enjoy a nice good grind, it can be very rewarding. For those who don't find that exciting, the story provides several good stopping points where you can put it down, satisfied in a well-executed and polished experience, satisfied that you got your money's worth.",1708372021,1708372021,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has fun and engaging combat, a great cast of characters with clear influences from past videogame greats and anime alike, and a brisk story that doesn't outstay its welcome. It has tons of content after the story is done to sink your teeth into. All of this without any MTX, gacha mechanics, or other bullshit that's infested the gaming industry despite its mobile game roots.

Good:
* Graphics are absolutely wonderful and the game runs smooth as silk. 
* Sound and music are high quality. 
* Voice acting is solid - maybe not the best ever but still very good. 
* Tons of stuff to do without being too much to do. 
* A solid variety of encounters, ranging from hordes of enemies to giant bosses. 
* Characters all feel viable, unique, and fun with a wide variety of archetypes. You'll find at least one character you love.
* No MTX. No cash shop. No paid cosmetics. No battlepass. 

Bad:
* Story is serviceable but isn't going to wow you. You'll likely predict every twist and turn ahead of time. 
* Game is really easy until the endgame. 
* Wasn't a big fan of the main character in this one. She/he is really outshined by the rest of the stellar cast. 

Ugly:
* A few 'mobile game isms' exist, such as certain resources being hard to farm. As I understand some of these things were available in the mobile version's cash shop. 
* Missing S++ by a single enemy and being robbed of needed items sucks.

The Dualsense ruble and haptics are very good, they already fixed a bug where the controller would disconnect randomly, and that's a big plus for me, but the game doesn't have Dualsense or any kind of PlayStation button prompts, why on earth a game released only for PS5 and PC doesn't have this icons?

This can be fixed with mods, but why is always the modders fixing this kind of issues?

The missions are fun to play, they compare this game to monster hunter, and they are right, but this game is more friendly, there are some interesting missions, like the one you can control a cannon (this is my favorite one because the Dualsense haptics, you need to try it for yourself),

Enemies have a good AI and bosses are fun to fight.

Also the graphics configurations are too simple, it is missing the most basic settings, let me change the anti-aliasing, shadows quality, effects, textures and models quality individually, also it would be great if they add upscaling like DLSS and FSR 2.

Was looking forward to this game and was very excited. However the game is not starting up at all. I have tried all the solutions suggested in the discussions.

Original review:
Pros: JRPG mix with some monster hunter. Main story was straight to the point with good cinematics. Very polished game that runs well. Battle system is smooth, Epic boss battles, visually beautiful game, community is alive and non toxic
Cons: MC is meh for the main story.  Repetitive bosses that are re skinned with added difficulty once you progress during the end game content, missed opportunity add more new unique bosses with more fighting styles. After completing proud mode there is nothing left to do game wise besides grinding for materials, weapons, making your character more powerful, but whats the point in doing this when there are no more added powerful bosses to fight against once proud difficulty is completed? Overall good game, just hope they add more content later on to keep the multiplayer alive.",1707768564,1708307968,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I went into Relink thinking it'd maybe be a decent multiplayer experience at best, but what I ended up finding was an incredibly fun game with so many great intricate systems. The best way to explain the gameplay is to say, ""what if your turn based rpg was an ACTION RPG"", AND IT ENDED UP WORKING REALLY WELL?

Gameplay is fluid throughout multiplayer and single player, the bots that control your party members do the best they can, for the most part, with the characters they're given to control, and the same can be said about randoms or even your friends.
I say 'for the most part' because there are a very few amount of characters, like Ghandagoza and Vaseraga (the two massive beefcakes) that the AI doesn't make the best use of, in the sense they don't execute Ghandy's perfect timing hits or Vas's charge attacks.

As of the time I'm editing this review, there are 19 playable characters with 2 coming in the extremely near future, all with extremely varied playstyles. You're given access to unlocking them pretty easily as you follow the main questline, the only time you'd really have to ""grind"" for one is to unlock whichever final character you choose.
My initial impression was a low level of disappointment in how some character's had shared mechanics, but after delving into every single one I now realize I couldn't be more incorrect.
On top of each character having a fully unique design, they're each given a passive that HEAVILY impacts their gameplay, and definitely require you to use the customizable skills that come with each character to use them to their full potential. So much of the customization in skills comes in the form of how you want to output damage, how you'd like to support your team, or how you'd like to support yourself, giving you a decently varied playstyle just for a single character. I'm fully min-maxing my 7th character right now and I cannot express the amount of joy each one gave me.

Also in case it needs to be mentioned because we live in a world where the gaming landscape is controlled by the idea of ""viability"", yes, every character is viable. Some will do more damage, some will have more utility, and others will do a bit TOO much damage, it seriously barely matters. The ONLY TIME IT MATTERS is when you get to bosses with damage checks, but this is more like the game is gating you off from content until you're actually SERIOUSLY ready for it.
Every character is designed to have a specific role and be able to play for the team in the form of buffs or debuffing the enemy if you don't feel comfortable in being the main damage dealer, and you'll more than likely be doing your part as long as you play the game and try not to die! Healing, debuffing, and buffing is also NOT REQUIRED IN ANY PART OF THE GAME, I have played the entirety of this game solely super-armoring through every piece of content with Vaseraga as I let my starving, piss-stained AI companions grapple onto me like my children as I do all the damage. 
ALSO, YOU DO NOT NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME HYPER MECHANICALLY IN ENDGAME CONTENT, ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU TO DO THIS IS A GARBAGE DELVING RACCOON ON A KEYBOARD, but you can definitely play mechanically if you'd like. :)

The game also allows for even deeper customization in the form of Sigils. Sigils are stat amplifiers that can support everything from your damage, crit chance, percentage based damage based on certain qualifications, lower cooldown times, decreasing cooldowns every time you do damage, and the list goes on. Every time a game has stat amplifiers like this it seriously makes me so happy, and I constantly spend hours theory-building and testing to get the perfect build for how I can get the highest damage while also catering to my playstyle.

The mechanics of this game, separate from characters, are mostly in the form of guard breaks, blocks, dodges, and your Super Burst Gauge. Dodge rolling and blocking can both be perfectly timed and give you an amazing buff if you do so in the form of making you invulnerable to damage for a few seconds (which can by the way be buffed with the aforementioned sigils!!), letting you get off some more of that sweet sweet dps as long as you can stick to the enemy. 
The Super Burst Gauge is this game's form of giving each character a cinematic chargeable ultimate, that is actually able to be combo'd with any of your teammates. The purpose of this mechanic is seemingly to put it together for a massive elemental combination burst after combining each one, but a tip for players going into the endgame, you can actually use your SBA to stall out damage windows for you and your team, and more than likely get more damage than you would have otherwise.

As for the story itself, I can't say I care for it! It has moments where it has a lot of fun with itself, but for the most part it takes itself very seriously, and what it takes very seriously is SERIOUSLY campy. This is for the most part an intensely cookie-cutter anime turn based rpg storyline. But I seriously don't care! I appreciate the amount of effort put into the game and it's story as a whole, but I also really appreciate the amount of effort put into allowing me to skip every cutscene I'm not in the mood to sit through! There are some seriously flashy and cinematic parts to the main story that do make it pretty entertaining when you're actually PLAYING THE GAME though, so i'ts definitely not an entire snooze.

Problems though! Only 2 that I can FORCE, but they do exist. I understand the need for a damage cap, and even though the game itself actually gives you a certain amount of ways to INCREASE the damage cap, when it comes down to it there's an actual concrete damage cap eventually. I wish I could say it would be somewhat difficult to get to, but if you play this game to the degree of maxing out multiple characters, it does ultimately come to chance, but for the most part you will be hitting the damage cap on a few characters you put effort into building. Granted though, a damage cap for this style of game is pretty important, and does balance out multiple characters that otherwise could very feasibly beat endgame content in seconds, which is already possible.
Probably the only other actual issue I have with the game right now is that there aren't enough bosses for the EXTREMELY LATE endgame content in this game! Farming in the EXTREMELY LATE endgame has you fighting around 9 of the same bosses multiple times, and that doesn't even include the final boss that for the most part is grinded out separately for other reasons I don't want to spoil! These boss fights get pretty repetitive, especially if you're doing what I'm doing by building multiple characters to appreciate more of the content put into this game.

There is more content post-release that does appease one of my more fair complaints, but the only form of said content that's been actually shown is in the form of a new endgame boss coming out a month after the game's release date. There are some nice bonuses with the arrival of two new characters and some sort of paid dlc in the next couple months, but past that I have to just hope the developers see how much people love this game and desperately wish it gets even more extended content.

If you're a fan of games like Monster Hunter (but hate how long hunts can take), or crave something akin to Genshin's party system in a fully fledged multiplayer system, maybe interested in the fantasy anime RPG elements, or even love the chaos but synergistic gameplay of DMC or Bayonetta, seriously type into your little Youtube search bar and look into the game, because I definitely can assure that this game would be worth your time and money, ESPECIALLY at full price.",1707044306,1708299172,True,5,1,0.583648741245269775,0,True,False,False

The grandeur of art and music really give a massive fantasy feel. Hell I spent an hour walking around the towns looking at the art and the sky's.

The characters are unique and have their own backgrounds an stories to follow through the fate system. The main bosses the BIG bads are really unique fights. I recommend the game if you like combat like monster hunter and Geshin impact. This games combat reminds me of Tera back when it was the prime action MMO RPG. I dont know if I'll do another run of the story but its going to be one I remember for a very long time. Its kinda got a kiddish feel to the plot.

BUGS: Unlike many games that have come out over the past couple years, I have yet to experience a single bug or issue in my first 24 hours of gameplay. Not only were there no bugs, but i have yet to see a screen tear, long loading times, or poor connection issues in online matches. There's nothing. I have seen absolutely nothing negative, and it is actually appalling. (in a good way)

GAMEPLAY: for people wondering about the core aspect of the game, do not worry, you will not be disappointed. For anyone who has played Honkai Impact 3rd on PC, You will absolutely love the playstyles that each character has along with their bursts and combo's. Not only this, but the endgame is very much worht the grin with the  different combo's you can do with the in-game weapon and sigil system.

Character/Environment Design: Peak design and animations as well as overall look of the world. Runs and looks amazing even on my 2060

Nostalgia: For someone who has played the original games of GranBlue Fantasy, it is oh so refreshing to see all my favorite Skyfarers back in action. (Love you Zeta)

ROADMAP: after realizing that not only is the game not stopping after this one launch, but is getting updates to the story and the amount of characters being added to the game every month, I basically folded. I would be willing to spend XXX amount of money to get the DLC's for this game as they released.

Conclusions: there is honestly so much more about the game I can say, but I believe you can tell  by all the positive reviews. If you're a fan of GranBlue Fantasy? Love JRPG's? Love CO-OP? Love Anime? Love Endgame and Min-Maxing? You said yes to any one of those? Buy it.",1708293374,1708293374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

== TLDR ==
Game is good, combat is fun. 
Enough playable characters to spent a lot of time with each of them. Hundreds of great animations. 
A lot of content to grind in post-game.
Great English voice acting. Probably the one and only case when I prefer DUB over original. 
GREAT OST. Almost each boss have boss theme which you expect to hear in LAST FIGHT of another game.

That's how Action JRPG should look like, not a mobile casino trash.

== Detailed == 

Story: It's boring Just another generic anime story about friendship, etc.
At least it's not too long and it's not a total cringe as some other games with anime stylistics (Tales of Berseria, etc.)

Locations: Invisible walls are more then I would like to see, but less than I was afraid to see. Big and interesting locations are not string point of this one, since it use ""hub"" structure for all content apart from Story quests.

Music: I've found that I did not care about music during story at all (""Managarmr Part 2"" is a rare exception).

Probably combat system is too intense for me, so I literally did not care about everything else before finally start doing quests in ""Maniac"" difficulty, being accustomed to gameplay and starting to paying more attention to surroundings.

Music is GREAT.

Gameplay: Battle system is good. Not a super casual, which is pleasant to see nowadays.

AI party members: Good. While they definitely cheating in a lot of situations, it's still pleasant to see useful AI party members which behaviour is interesting to watch.

Localization: I've seen a plenty of reviews which says localization is bad. Maybe - I honestly don't know. But the one thing I know - English DUB is definitely great - it's not worse than original, and maybe (!) event better than original.
(from the person who prefer to watch anime with English subtitles)

Technical: I've seen a lot negative reviews about game crash, freeze, etc. But personally I've experienced 0 problems with game. 
Being installed on SSD it's also has VERY FAST loading times.

Quality of Life: I'l write it as separate option, since game just filled with QoL features. Which is always good to see, especially in game which is a few days old.",1707310911,1708291943,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game looks and feels amazing, the core should be the online co-op with the campaing being a long tutorial (15-20h). This kind of games tend to be monotone and repetitive so be aware of that, luckily you can mix and match combo and ability to create your flow, also there's something like 20 characters (more promised to be incoming) you can try and see who fit your style. 
Online would be better with crossplay, for now it's a bit hard to find a match but not impossible.
Only real complain I can find is the localization: sometimes the dialog does't correspond correctly to what is said in japanese. They do make sense and they are pretty close but still not exactly or completely what the character said. Anyway I remember this happened in FFX too and nobody never ever said nothing so sshhhutup.
Yes, monsters are damage sponge. Hunting them is satisfying, getting good on both mechanics and equipment is also satisfying.
No, it's not a gacha for Gods sake (and blessed be the devs for this!)
Another thing worth of note is that the game is censored, it doesn't compromise the game experience in my opinion but I understand why community is pissed off.

The Sigil system is kinda confusing at first but is kinda straight forward once you understand it, the thing that may throw off players who don't have experience from the mobile game is the idea of damage caps, so go lookup a good guide if you find yourself not getting bigger numbers on your attacks.
But anyways, don't get this game for the story, get it for the very great action RPG that it is.

[h1]Granblue Fantasy: Relink is an amazing game. [/h1]

As an action RPG/JRPG fan, I really love how Cygames delivered this game and the attention to detail they have given to make this game fun and enjoyable. From the amazing combat to beautiful art style and amazing soundtrack, I am happy to say that this game tickles every itch that I have in an RPG/JRPG game.

[h2 ]The Story  [/h2]

Although the story very short, it is adequate enough and is fully jam-packed with fun and amazing storytelling and battles. You can think of this as the introduction of the main chunk of the game. 

My only complain in the story though is some of the English translation to its Japanese audio is poorly translated.

[h2]The Gameplay Loop [/h2]

This is where probably the majority of your playtime will be, and where the game really starts. Granblue Fantasy is well known for having cool and lovable characters in its franchise, and this game you get to play some of them! As of writing this review there are currently around 20 playable characters, and each of them has unique and fun combat mechanics.

You take on different quests from exploration to boss fights, either solo or with other players to grind character exp, materials, and sigils to make your character strong to further take on difficult quests. Very much similar to games like monster hunter, which I am a big fan of.

The combat is very fluid, fast-paced and fun. Since each character plays differently, they can have a wide variety of builds that you can try to match your favorite playstyle.

[h2]Visuals and Audio Design [/h2]

Even though the gameplay is entertaining, I just can't ignore the art direction the game went to from its environment to enemy designs. Everything very much an eye candy and is gorgeous. 

Same goes with the game's audio design and OSTs. I am the type of person that appreciates a game's music and sound design, and Granblue Fantasy: Relink delivers well on this part.

[h2]My Closing Thoughts [/h2]

[b]Yes[/b], the gameplay loop is compelling. [b]Yes[/b], the game is amazing. [b]Yes[/b], the game is fun.

As a player that loves grinding in video games, I really love what Cygames cooked with Granblue Fantasy: Relink. From the game's announcement since 2016, I think that it deserves all the love it's been having, and it's a game that was worth the wait.

I highly recommend this game to all players that love a fast paced action RPG/JRPG and to fans that love the franchise. Give it more love as the game really deserves it! ♥",1707754456,1708288386,True,2,0,0.525514781475067139,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is fun, flashy, and snappy.

[u] Gameplay [/u]

The whole reason you'd get this game in the first place. There's no other way to describe the boss fights other than its 100% anime. Not in a bad way, in fact the presentation of the fights are spectacular. Feels like you're actually facing off against something genuinely threatening. 

Combat is fluid and has some thought put into it. Can't just forever spam dodge or block and become completely immune throughout boss fights. But, the game does reward perfect dodges and blocks and it feels great to do every single time

Each character is unique in their own right, different systems, different combat styles, the like. Large, linear skill trees that don't force you into a specific line for the character. Usually just amounting to minute stat increases that adds up as you go through it.

Main story is played with up to three AI companions, but you can go at it solo with the main character on your first playthrough. At least from what i've heard in the multiple New Game Plus difficulties afterwards where you can omit the main character. The AI is actually very competent. Heals you when you're low, books it to you to revive, avoids boss mechanics generally. At no point will the AI ever feel like a hindrance

[u] Main Story [/u]

Typical JRPG, damsel-in-distress plot. Haven't finished the main game fully(Only on Chapter 6), but that's not what you'd play the game for

[u] Side Story [/u]

There's not much character building present thus far in the main story. So, there's this thing called ""Fate Episodes"" that delve into some decent nuance for the playable characters. Voice-over from the character in question and most of the time its lengthy dialogue boxes

[u] General Cons [/u]

Unlike Monster Hunter, combat doesn't have a weight and satisfaction to it. It's a hack-and-slash moreso than methodical and calculated. Nothing against it, but with how both the playable characters and boss fights are presented. Would've loved a weightier combat. As such, when the playable character you're controlling becomes incapable of movement through status effects or using block/dodge too much. It feels too much like control is taken away

The large, linear skill tree that is mostly just stat increases that add up over time. While simplistic, would've liked it if it was more game changing. Once you gain a new ability, that's it. Nothing in the skill tree will change how its used or comes out. Once you unlock a character, they'll pretty much play like that the entire time. With a few skill nodes increasing their individual systems in some way or another. The approach is more of getting the biggest number possible on the screen than anything.",1708281928,1708282754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story mode is virtually 20% of what the game actually has to offer. SO FAR.

The amount of time that I unexpectedly sank into this game.
Nice straight forward story, beautiful soundtrack, amazing characters and chemistry.
The developer put tons of effort into making the game feel immersive, with each character having
lines with any party member you assign.This game is full of so much personality which you feel during the combat.
There are so many ways to approach combat in this game, with each character having 
a different control scheme. You can even apply autoplay features to play the game without really playing the game if you want. They really made this game for ANYONE to enjoy. 

I absolutely love building my characters in so many different ways.
Building your character in different ways means they can be played in different ways.
You can turn a DPS into an absolute tank unit. You can play the game entirely away from your enemy
by playing ranged characters.

I normally don't enjoy farming in gaming, but in this game, farming is so rewarding as you recieve 
rewards that can be used for so many things. There are so many things to do, so much so that 
when you have an objective, you are easily distracted by another. 
The bosses in this game are where the game truly shines, especially end game. 
Fighting a lot of the bosses over and over may get a bit repetitive at times, but the versatile ways you can approach them and the many different things you can do with the rewards is what keeps it fresh.

My only issue is the lack of cross platform play. Unfortunately the story mode is NOT co-op, but there are a plethera of missions to play co-op. Another gripe i have primarily pertain to the visuals, which are amazing, but at times so flashy and overwhelming that you can't see what small enemies are doing. The aiming system also needs adjustment as it's linked to the right joystick, which results in you accidentally locking onto a different enemy, making your attacks go nowhere sometimes.",1708281443,1708281638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is the main selling point of this game and is probably the best out of any other anime games out there. The gameplay is smooth. It is very responsive and you can cancel out of any actions with block or dodge. It is also forgiving, but not to the point of making the game too easy. End game is just fighting bosses, which feels a bit like Monster Hunter, but without the running and carving aspect. Additionally, the gameplay mechanics of all characters are unique to them, meaning that you won't feel like any characters are simply a different flavoured of a copy pasta.

The progression systems feels pretty good in general. My only concern would be at end game, where things getting a bit inconvenient. Farming sigils feels terrible. One of the main way of getting them is through Transmutations and Transmarvels, but trade-ins are 1 by 1, meaning you will need to click a lot. Then, getting one 2-lines Sigils is hard, because so many sigils are just not worth considering because of the Damage Cap system, to the point that all characters will be using 90% of the same build. There's also the end game weapon, which you can't even guarantee a selector and are left to the mercy of randomness to get the one for the character you play.

Regarding multiplayer, I've mostly done solo queueing through matchmaking. The only issues I've met is mostly regarding the times where steam went down(ie: weekly maintenance on tuesdays), but otherwise, I've not met many issues. One of my favorite thing is that even if you get disconnected, you get thrown into an offline instances with AIs of whatever player characters there was. I'd like to see matchmaking for multiple missions at once and maybe buffed benefits to Quick Battle, but otherwise, it's still a solid multiplayer system.

The AIs in this game are incredible. Not incredible in term of performing character mechanics, they are crap at that, but their survivability is actually better than most players you would encounter in multiplayer. It's not uncommon for AIs to not die during fights, provided you haven't neglected them anyway.

Overall, the game is incredibly fun, and I'd even go as far to say that it is one of the few anime games where full price is justified, as it is a high quality game, something rare these days.",1708189838,1708273334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game from a longtime fan is that it's beautiful, runs well, plays great, and is honestly the most I could probably ask for in a mainstream Granblue game that's close to capturing the beautiful insanity of the original browser RPG. (Which you can still play, real easily - I only recommend if your gambling addiction is low).

Cygames has been for most of it's history incredibly fair to it's players, and there's a part of me that is genuinely proud of a game company that has such love for it's community to be able to branch out like this. Take this from someone who's been playing Granblue for eight out of the TEN years of it's running - they do deliver, and they will take care of you. This game will see future content.

Now for potential downsides - the story in this game will be kinda confusing if you haven't played, oh....300ish chapters of the browser RPG. That being said, you can also entirely ignore that jump since characters will reference events as ""being similar to X"" and they're pretty much right. This story follows a similar tread of the first 20 or so chapters of the original with some utterly new characters and stakes. That being said, I do hope some classics like Sturm and Drang, Zooey, Orchid, Noa etc do make their way onto the roster.  If you're looking for an easy entry to Granblue this will work, but if you ever wanna go back to the OG make sure to temper your expectations. And don't run from Guild Wars.

TL;DR - Really lovely game, and for a mainstream entry to a storied series you could definitely do worse. Wait for a sale if on the fence, but I really think anyone can have fun here.

This game feels like one of the higher quality gacha game with its good gameplay loops WITHOUT ANY GACHA. Its basically everything genshin wishes to be and more. But i dont want to make that comparison in anycase since its a whole different game, obviously.

Start with the story. I've seen many people in the reviews complaining how simple the story was and yes, it was a straight forward, short, and mostly predictable. The story start off feeling ""mid"" then it turned into ""not bad"" and then finally turned into ""thats pretty good ngl"" Its not a top-anime level of a story, but it does it job great. The writers and dev knows exactly what story and how they want to tell and did that almost flawlessly in my opinion. This is because most of the time, the visuals and the maps are nothingless than stunning. I find myself just stop and look around to see how  cool the worldbuilding and the maps are made. But not only that, it is PACKED with content. Yes, the story is relatively short, but every chapter feels packed to the brim with content and is very VERY memorable. A lot of times a new boss is reveal it just makes me go ""HOLY FUCK."" And when the story seems to be over the game tolds you NO ITS NOT OVER then throw you more epic fights, then they do that again and again until its actually over with the MOST FUCKING EPIC FIGHT EVER i had goosebumps and then it ends. It was enough for me to give me that feeling of emptiness when its over and all of these combine made me focus on enjoying the story more and lowkey immersing in it than trying to predict things or pick things out. I love everything about it.

But the thing is, the game is barely over at this point and YOU""RE IN THE ENDGAME right? Now, many have said the endgame of this game is great, and I totally agree with them. But I'll just lay what its like right now for you. In the endgame your goal is to basically grind better and better gears for your characters, find the perfect sigil, upgrade weapons, etc. And for this, you have to play the same quests over and over again. If you're like me and you love the combat then that wouldn't be much of a problem either. On top of this, compared to other games, the game is very generous on what it gives you in each quests. Yes, theres a lot of grinding, but the chances and the amount of loot you get is also fair. Its prevalent that the game respects your time. Some quests you can just semi-AFK over it too. The quests unlocks like how monster hunter does and the progression feels pretty natural. If you want to know if you needs friends to play with or not my answer would be not until the lates of late game when you're AI team arn't enough for the mission and you're basically forced to go into online. But people are mostly nice there and the matchmaking is relatively quick. Although there might be some server problem here and there that could get a little annoying. 

But heres come another problem with this and its that, the boss designs and how it plays in end game. Its not really a big complain but some bosses just feels like it was design to be played once. It did a very good job at giving you a sense of epicness and awe when you first encountered it. But when you have to play it multiple times, it gets a bit annoying for some. [spoiler]Like Excavalllion and Vulcan Bolla for example[/spoiler]. 

But other than that, i feel like the game is great and is absolutely worth the price! If you like the game, the play time could EASILY reach a 100hrs. 8.5/10",1708247706,1708247706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't be intimidated by the fact that there are multiple upgrade systems, the game is very forgiving and you can't really do anything wrong. From my experience, there's no wrong way to play the game and you can definitely beat the story quests (so don't worry about switching characters even if you've dumped all your resources into upgrading a different one already)

There's a lot of extra content besides the story mode, but in my opinion it's best to view it as stuff you can do after beating the story mode. Don't approach it with a completionist mindset, just leave it as stuff to do if you have already beaten the story but don't want to leave the game behind yet.

There are some big differences though. This game is a lot more casual in a lot of ways, the combat feels better than any action game i've played, its fast, chaotic, requires quick reaction time for fast dodges, positioning, and utilizing the skills that you built on your character in ways that work well for the fight. It is incredibly rewarding. 

One of the coolest things about this game is the characters, there are around 15 characters in the game right now each offering unique skills, skill trees, weapons and play-styles.

that being said, here are some critiques:
- game balance feels terrible in the endgame. presumably this is to lay the groundwork for future fights. as it currently stands right now, as soon as you reach the final difficulty, you can clear any fight. as soon as you get all of your mastery nodes maxed, you become super overtuned for basically any fight and the only way you can lose is if you don't understand how the game works or if a party member is throwing. the final fight in the game can be beaten in under 1 minute and 30 seconds in-game time (roughly 6 minutes actual time) with a specific party composition and can be comfortably beaten near-bis with a random party assortment of competent online players in under 5 minutes IGT. enemies are way too squishy and the damage cap makes some skills completely worthless. you can also achieve near optimal damage while having defensive utility, which doesn't make sense to me and kills most illusion of choice for buildcrafting. the endgame pivots from action game to grinder once you are bis aside from Supp V+s and the hellgrind that is the perfect weapon imbue - for no meaningful ingame benefit. a lot of this stems from the best stuff being put behind the easiest fights and difficulty not scaling rewards well.
-- additionally, several attacks can be animation cancelled to do more damage, which is cool. however, a small subset of those attacks are skills that can be dodge cancelled [b]AT NO COST[/b] and fully refunds the skill, giving you whatever benefit you would have for casting that skill (e.g. vane going into his finisher, percival having faster charge on his Y, vaseraga going into his charge attacks faster than normal, katalina getting gauge, etc) and completely breaks the expected damage output on that character and kills their skill depth by turning them into one-tricks. hopefully the costless cancels get patched.
- the game is anime as hell, for the good and the bad. both ally and enemy cutscene attacks are not skippable, meaning a significant amount of the game becomes waiting for cutscenes or waiting for trivial attacks to end so you can play the game. it also makes some characters significantly better than others since you can skip certain attacks with hard CC and SBA chaining. at least in the gacha game, you can f5 the page and skip the animations. you can't do that here. in versus/rising, cutscenes are only for SBA and they are way shorter in comparison.
- bloodthirst, a buff that makes it so the enemy takes what feels like only 5% of normal damage, is the only buff that can't be dispelled. this compounds with the cutscene stuff to force the player to play a minigame while the enemy tries to beat over the player. some fights are significantly less interactive than others during bloodthirst/OD mechanics, which hurts the moment-to-moment gameplay. extremely questionable design choice.
- a lot of the minmaxing in the endgame is either cheating, botting or mostly AFK playing to farm resources to try to win a 1/5k roll for a marginal power boost, with getting a single curio roll every couple of minutes. doing the fun things will slow down your grind to a halt. additionally, the game is vulnerable to [spoiler]savescumming for masteries and transmutations, both of these seeds are stored in the game save[/spoiler] and will save you hundreds of hours of grinding by using this to your advantage. the game does not autosave after rolling.
- the camera is pretty bad. the consequences of this are: big enemies are unpleasant to fight (maybe the game really is monster hunter???? :^) ), perfect defending attacks is inherently wonky, blocking is encouraged and is sleeper overpowered when compounded with oneshot attacks.
- fighting aerial enemies feels like shit unless you have an explicit out (e.g. you're playing charlotta, rackam, eugen, and others to a lesser extent)
- the game's communication to the player is bad - just like the gacha game. very few people know that you can mash/spin sticks to leave critical state faster. the game doesn't make it obvious that OD (not Bloodthirst, but enemies entering Overdrive) reduces their damage taken. defense values are not displayed anywhere. damage cap is obtuse - only visual indicator is a yellow stroke around text which can be lost in the damage number noise. some traits stack multiplicatively and others stack additively - the game does not tell you directly, you must experiment.
- the solo story missions cause an odd problem where you're incentivized to gear your entire party, but then as soon as you get access to multiplayer, that gearing on your party is no longer relevant so you're put into a dichotomy where you either gear your entire party or you make your main character snowball into a death machine. this is further complicated by that if you want to do the [spoiler]ultimate difficulty campaign, you need to gear up id and gran/dj as they have sections where you are forced to play as them[/spoiler] and that the AI companions are really underperformant compared to a person, even without abusing cancels.
- why is the ultimate fight in the game a [spoiler]mediocre turret fight where the boss is slow as hell when compared to every other fight on proud difficulty excluding versa?[/spoiler]",1708211668,1708213461,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is a good game. So why am i rating it negatively?

Because it should of been a GREAT game.

The combat is great, the setting is fun, the want to play more is present.

What holds it back?

This could've been Game of the Year if it wasn't held back by the censorship of outfits and the English Marvel Universe level of English meme punch it up localisation present in the ENG DUB and ENG SUB (ENG SUB copies from DUB, so if you play JAP DUB and ENG SUB you will hear jarring non-sense differences between them)

Below are threads upon threads that discuss the censorship and localisation issues in depth if you would like to know more, with articles, references, in-game evidence and more

I have already sent feedback to Cygames about this via the linked feedback form below, i encourage you to do so as well if censorship and localisation changing the script from JAP source bothers you too

Feedback form to Cygames about the ENG localisation and request for a new ENG SUB that is closer to JAP voice source

What's fun is half these threads are locked now, as the pro-censorship/localiser shills try to brigade any discussion about the above issues

Lucky it's PC and some mods are forming so we're almost ready for uncensor mods, but still off from a better english SUB

All the way up until for zero reason, it randomly corrupted my save file and I lost my ENTIRE playthrough. Just fired it up to play and BOOM, nope, cannot load saved game. Since you can't save in additional slots for some reason, this becomes utterly gamebreaking. The expectation seems to be that you will religiously manually backup your save files in the Windows directory. How is that a developer expectation in 2024?!

There is no point in playing this game as long as it's so buggy that it will literally corrupt your save for no apparent reason. It's just begging for massive frustration. I can't even bring myself to start another playthrough, after reading about other people's stories of this happening two or three times.

Honestly, it's a really fun kind of terrible until captain bandage sword starts sucking the air out of the room.  There's also some genuinely interesting stories in visual novel style interludes called Fate Episodes.

There ARE genuine problems.  I know there's a healthy player base for this game, but I consistently can't get into a quick match with my buddy.  You gain power too slow to use two characters, but too fast for just one.  So, if you beeline it through every required mission you'll constantly over power yourself and end up with check lists of trivial boss fights.

However, this is the best way to bring up new characters as level matters very, very little.  Gear and unlockable skill trees are everything.  So a powerful character can farm for everyone.  This discourages experimentation with their varied and gigantic roster, but I would still stop and do it.  The most fun I've ever had in this game is right after the credits when I had multiple crew mates with 50% of their skill trees and a decent weapon.

Otherwise, the main story is 10-15 hours and it's a BLAST.  The narrative isn't good, so if you find the cutscenes annoying, skip them and move on to the next awesome action set piece!

Customization also feels limited, with mastery trees lacking focus and the real variety coming from expensive sigils and a handful of skill slots.

The story itself takes a nosedive into linearity and predictability, with the true challenge waiting post-game in a grind reminiscent of Monster Hunter: World. Be warned, the base game already demands a hefty time investment, and Hard mode just extends fights with stingier resource drops.

+Good gameplay
+Many different characters to master which each plays differently

Cons
-Limited boss variety
-Sigil transmutation and transmarvel has to be made one by one which wastes A LOT of time

Other points

-Combat is awesome
-Character designs are a roller coaster 
-Potential waifus and husbandos for all 
-Story is lukewarm, makes you wonder what they were trying to do
-Never tried ENG voices, but JP Vyrn voice can get annoying sometimes
-Rewards for straying from the linear path in the main story are slightly underwhelming 
-Recruited characters are not involved in the story
-The illusion of choice in story dialogues
-Fate Episodes give you stats and sigil slots at a cost of you listening to stories narrated by the characters themselves, with some battles here and there

What a joy, a diamond in the rough with all the great bases covered.
If you are a JRPG fan, you will immerse yourself in this world.
If you are a Mission Board enjoyer, you will have plenty on offer here.
If you are an FFXIV telegraphed mechanics enjoyer, you will feel at home.
There are few caveats though, and its that, for all Granblue offers, its never the best at it.
I see this first PC/Console game as a jack of all trade, master of none.
And that's okay in my book.

[h3]TIME[/h3]
There are 3 structures on hand that the game offers.
The Story, which is basically your tutorial that will take around 10-ish hours to finish.
Then, the Mission Board will open and you will enter the Road to Endgame content. It's based on Ranks, ala Monster Hunter ranks of difficulties to go through. From Easy (Story, 1st difficulty type) to Proud (the 7th difficulty and hardest content). 
Then, once Proud is unlocked, you will enter the End Game; where monsters get high levels than yours (up to 40 levels above you) and will become an average FFXIV Savage Trial. There is a lot on offer here, and getting to proud might take you around 30-40 hours or so. Then you will have to play... 200h afterwards if you wish to platinum. There a lot of bang for your bucks, but a lot of repetitive content to grind too.


[h3]LORE / STORY[/h3]
The story is probably the weakest part of the game. Not by its very nice graphics, moments, artistic moments and set pieces, no, this game suffers from the generic mobile game plot and one-sided villain archetypes. There is very few innovative or even efforts to tell an original story out of the VERY generic shounen tropes.
But there are set pieces that will remind you of Armored Core 6 and Final Fantasy 14, and just for these, this story sold me on how innovative they wanted gameplay to be. And I highly welcome that in our current gaming landscape.

[h3]GAMEPLAY[/h3]
This is an action-adventure based role playing game. 
It's close to a Tales of or Genshin Impact (without the gacha and not with an open world) as it's instanced based instead. This allows the game to have more ""money shots"" and ""time based action set pieces"" to sprinkle the adventure and create new interesting transitions in-between arenas of gameplay and combat. Not everything always meshes together though, as the arenas feel very flat and hold very few interactions with the monsters overall. And just like FFXIV, the game relies heavily coloured telegraphs that are VERY messy and difficult to read.
Also you have total of 20 characters on hand to play  (once they are all unlocked) which will open 20 different sets of gameplay and game-feel. Along those sets of skills, you have skills trees (masteries), uniques weapons (6 per character) and 15 accessory slots to create unique builds and synergies. 
The gameplay is very addictive and deep to indulge into.


[h3]ART DIRECTION[/h3]
The developer talked in interviews the ""watercolour-like"" art and, to be fair, other than clouds and the world map you see in the story, the watercolour effect is probably the worst of it all. It's more a hand-painted marvel to look at, yes, but watercolour specifically? No. That doesn't keep the game to being beautifully lit, textured, vibrant and has very clean biomes sets. Characters are nicely animated and have clear defined animation sets that makes them likeable and enjoyable to attach yourself to. I'm sad we don't have more unique Armor skins unlocks for achieving masteries and hard achievements per heroes.

[h3]REPLAYABILITY[/h3]
OK. Replayability is very good, but it will highly depend on your tolerance on repetitiveness. 
Once the story is done you can fully replay it per chapter, take you time to finish and acquire every collectibles and even choose higher difficulties to clear it (you should as its tied to an achievement). Then there's the Lyria's Journal achievement, which require to unlock and do everything with everyone, which might take you 200 hours to get or so. It's replayable, but the ceiling of Platinum-ing here is very insane.
The grind required to clear the game is too egregious to me.

[h3]SOUND/MUSIC[/h3]
EXCELLENT original soundtrack made by Octopath Traveler Yasunori Nishiki and Tsutomu Narita. Because you will replay many missions and come back to many of the two main cities, most of this soundtrack will stay engrained in your mind: from soothing tracks to action-filled combat themes; there's aorund 70-80 original tracks at least to eargasm to.

[h3]PERFORMANCE[/h3]
On a good rig here:
4K 43"" Monitor
GEFORCE 4090
AMD RYZEN 5950X
128GB DDR4 3600Mhz
980Pro Samsung 2tb NVME Drive

Had excellent FPS at fixed 144fps at native 4K constantly. 
There was no DLSS options when I played.

[h3]CONCLUSION[/h3]
It's an excellent first original experience that Granblue has on offer here.
I am looking into it and wishing for an equivalent to an ""Iceborne-expansion""; this game is so ripe and fit for it. This first instalment really shows to everyone how a mobile game can create a real immersive world on PC and console to show they can do better. I just think they should find 2-3 more writers to make less trope-ish and pre-pubescent remarks and dialog.

If it's on sale just grab it and encourage this game you just won't regret it!

1st, graphics are great, but optimization is poor in areas with a lot of traffic. With an NVIDIA 3080 FE, I can get 120 fps regularly at 1440P EXCEPT, when I'm in the town hub area. For whatever reason, the FPS always dips a tremendous margin in those areas, and that's even after turning on RBAR and other performance enhancing options in Nvidia profile inspector.

2nd, you are basically forced to main 1 or 2 characters as there is tremendous grind to max out even one character. Maybe include a repeatable quick quest farming option that requires some type of ticket to do. This would significantly reduce the amount of redundancy, while still forcing players to be strategic in how they use their farming tickets.

3rd and probably the largest issue is the lack of image scaling, and DLSS support. Implementing these features would help tremendously in overall game performance.

4th besides the 5 free color palettes available, there aren't a lot of customization options to differentiate yourself from other players, especially if you play on a team who all play the same character. Maybe add additional character costumes?

So the game can be divided into two distinct ways of enjoying it - the story, that has actual (small, corridor like) locations to explore and go through and the quest mode, which usually throws u into a cut off boss arena or some small fragment of the story mode setpiece repurposed into a quick mission.

The story is great. It's pretty much anime tropes but IMO they were executed well. The game is FULL of crazy moments, right from the start, you wont get bored. It's a nonstop assault of explosive action with incredible visuals/audio and bosses/locales that push some crazy epic BS at you. The game feels like a bullet hell at times. Bosses in this game are insane, the first major one you encounter is such a spectacle that it could work as a final boss. But no, its just the first one. And ones after him are just as (if not more) spectacular. It feels like a blockbuster movie but its actually playable. Mechanics correlated to these crazy moments in these fights are great in the context of the story. It feels like a lot of effort got put into these battles, the campaign also has exclusive gameplay interactions that u wont see in the quest mode (like new combat mechanics when u get to control... some stuff that u will encounter in the story mode). The ending was great. I love the antagonist and chemistry between the chars. Story just felt like a great journey full of action and with colorful cast of characters. English voices are great imo. I didnt mind the writing/translation and it was funny sometimes.

After you complete the core story (which, in my view, should take around 12-20hrs to beat if u dont rush it)  you will start unlocking the access to meatiest parts of the quest mode. You thought the game ended when the credits rolled? Well, you can drop it here and now if u want to but if u want to grind (or just see more of the game) then... there is absolutely shit to grind AND ACTUAL NEW CONTENT to unlock. Quest mode actually has a new kind of story progression that continues from where the core story mode ended. At this point main gameplay loop becomes the Monster Hunter like loop of: beat the ""key"" quests, complete the ""urgent quest"" (a boss battle) and unlock a new difficulty tier/quest rank and repeat till you see everything. There are new bosses to see and lots, LOTS of potential to hyperoptimize your builds and grinding. There is a lot of progression systems - getting perfect rolls on the overmastery skill tree, gridning the best sigils (think of decorations in monster hunter), getting the ultimate weapons and ascending/upgrading them as high as you can... And theres like more than 15 characters. Maxing one takes a long time, if u want to do that for everyone then we are possibly looking at hundreds of hours of playing. Beating all the quest mode content took me around 54 hours, at that point i have seen every quest so far present in the game and every ""secret"" boss there is. I still didnt ""max"" any character, i got 2 ultimate weapons (none of which i managed to level up to max) out of like 19. Is there much of a reason to get perfect builds? For now, from the perspective of hard challenges to overcome - not much. You can beat the hardest boss with just semi-optimized character builds and that, as i said, will probably take around 50 (more depending on how fast/slow u learn how to buildcraft) hours in this game if you arent tryharding and IF u are playing multiplayer. Because for multiplayer u only need to have only one semi-well built character that can stand their ground. If you want to beat the last few bosses solo then its gonna take considerably longer because u will need to have the whole 4 (you and your AI companions) person team kitted out. Last tier of quest difficulty is actually hard if u dont think about your builds and survivability. So far i have 2 characters that maybeee stand a chance for these hardest quests, i need to build my team more. I beat the final boss with randoms in multiplayer and i want to be able to solo it just for fun. 

So - the replay value of this game comes from the pure fun of combat and getting higher numbers for the sake of higher numbers (and again, theres lots of numbers to optimize). The combat itself is really great, character movesets are very varied and lots of them have their own, often simple but very fun, gimmicks. Dodging has bit of a nier automata feel, perfect dodges give u a hefty iframe reward. Swinging weapons is fast and feels good, you can cancel most of animations. Its a bit button mashy, combos arent complicated but they do require some thought. Like for example, a character named Siegfried requires you to swing his greatsword rhythmically so his attacks get buffed when u get the perfect timing on each swing and it is cool. While a character named Narmaya capitalizes on switching between her two combat stances seamlessly through her combos to buff her active abilities. There are even gunner characters and they have their own gimmicks too.

What can be annoying about otherwise amazing boss battles is that they have like a sort of unskippable, mini cutscenes baked in when they do their ultimate (mmo raids vibe) attacks. Its fine in the story but can get old while grinding. U cant move your characters during these animations. And overall, bosses at times have invicibility phases so these things combined can throw the pace off a bit.

Music and visuals are great. Game runs in 60fps on my laptop gtx1650ti but i did need to downscale the resolution in settings. Sadly, graphical settings are lacking. You dont have much of a finer control.

UI and quality of life thingies are great, this game has features that monster hunter failed to implement (like wishlist that actually shows which quests drop what items and instantly redirects u to said quests). There are still problems tho, like for example the mastery skill tree navigation is too slow when u want to spend your mastery points all at once. The mastery view is just too slow. And then there is the post-quest results screen which weirdly requires every player to accept the end screen to progress further. It has like a 40 seconds timer so if someone doesnt click ""next"" you will have to wait it out which is weird and can halt the pace of a gaming session a bit.

Another nitpick would be the camera: theres some sort of a soft auto lock on going on in the combat, you cant turn it off. Usually you dont mind it much but sometimes it will fuck you up. It makes some of the boss phases hard to comprehend, both visually and gameplay wise cuz your attacks will be locked to what the camera deems as your goal. Tho that only applies to specific cases.

Feels like game was made with a lot of love, theres a lot of cute character interactions and cool voicelines, small details, fate episodes, cute emotes, so on and so forth.

Overall: I think that the game is well worth the asking price. 50hrs to clear all quests might not seem to be that much when compared to behemoth like monster hunter but keep in mind that this is a totally new game, first attempt from this studio at a game like that and the game doesnt feel padded at all (there is content recycling but it felt fine to me). These 50 hours, IMO were just chock full of fun. And then you can continue to grind it or drop it, whatever u want.

Anddd there will be content updates, possibly more of a reason to grind. We dont know how many updates we will get but at least one big one is certain.

Lovely game.

Haven't been an active Granblue player for long, been mostly playing it seriously since around August/September last year? Anyway, all the months I played it before picking this up made this an absolutely enjoyable experience. This game is an absolute treat to fans of the series.

For those who aren't fans of the series, you still have a pretty damn accesible experience, the Fate Episodes do an alright-ish job of introducing you to the chars and give you a slight recap of everything that went before this game's story happens (not like it matters, this is basically the playable equivalent to a non-canon Shonen movie lmao)

As for the story itself:  it's alright, very fun but nothing you would say groundbreaking. Some of the bosses are absolutely cinematic masterpieces, though. 

In the gameplay side of things, you've got what's basically a crossbreed between Monster Hunter and FFXIV, with gacha-like progression (fear not, no microtransactions are present... just fearful GRINDING), so don't go expecting a proper ARPG. 

Most of the time you'll be fighting instanced fights against bosses with 4 goblins that may or may not know how to protect and may get instakilled because they stood right next to the boss [strike]no I am not talking by experience I perfectly know how to block I swear I haven't wiped myself out like 5 times during my first Very Hard quests in multiplayer[/strike]

Music wise it's a Granblue game. No need to say anything more. 

All in all, this game is INCREDIBLE. I still have to dive deep into the rabbit hole of Maniac and Proud quests, and from my experience in the gacha, that will be a treat.

[h2]The good :[/h2]

- Granblue builds up on a gigantic lore from its original gacha game, and Cygames gave us a run for our money here. Literally everything but a couple characters are straight from the original game, from the NPCs to the playable characters. Some locations are original to the game. Top it off with gorgeous graphics & sceneries, as well as an amazing soundtrack faithful to its origins, and you have something to show for it.

- 19 playable characters all with their own gimmicks and personalities. It really makes you want to try all of them, and it's hard to select the 4 to keep in your party.

- The flow of combat feels [i]really[/i] good. I was scared when I heard Platinum Games was pulling out of the project, but they still managed to work it out. It's tight, dynamic, flashy but not too much, and most of all, satisfying. Nothing better than a 4-way charge attack on a boss resulting in a massive blow and stun to get your blood pumping.

- The AI is NOT dumb. They actually went to great lengths to make the AI really smart in combat: It's actually really good at dodging, using skills, supporting you, and so on. Cygames told us you could do ""all content"" with bots, and this looks to be true. Other companies should take notes. Like, seriously.

- Fully fleshed-out upgrade system, with upgradeable weapons, ""sigils"" to give yourself passives in combat, as well as skill trees. maxing out a character requires quite a bit of work, but you'll enjoy the results.

- The end-game content is where it's at. It kinda plays like Monster Hunter where you collect loot from missions to reach your ultimate build. While there are a lot of reused monsters from the campaign (albeit with many variations), it's surprisingly not a bother at all because everything else is amazing and you're just craving for more combat and better upgrades. Truly a bold move from Cygames, and they made it work. I got over a hundred hours in this game, 75% of it was post-game, and I'm still not bored (experience may vary per individual).

- Lots of convenient options such as fast-travel to NPCs for quick quest turn-in, or fast-travel to merchants or locations is also available, and that's the little things that really add up to increase your enjoyment of the game.

- Super-fast loading times (at least on NVMe, but I'm guessing even a classic SSD is fast), it's honestly ""wow"" how fast your can travel between locations, especially the towns where there are a ton of assets. It's super optimized and is really enjoyable.

- While the campaign is short (about 20h~ish), and not with the most elaborate plot ever, it's very Granblue-esque with lots of epic fight sequences that makes it an enjoyable experience nonetheless.

- Achievement hunters will be pleased with this game, as nothing is missable because even story chapters can be replayed after you finish the game.

- Rock-solid online coop netcode. I've had no problem finding other people to play with (for most stuff), and I NEVER had any lag issues that impaired my combat (which require precise timings). And if there is a network issue, the game automatically falls back to offline mode and players get controlled by bots so you can finish the fight. It's a super smart implementation by Cygames and, like I said above, other companies should take note : This is how you do it. Not sure what kind of magic they use for the netcode, but it works damn well.

- Last but not least, I want to add a special mention for the towns in this game. There are ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS, brimming with life and personality. When I first visited Seedhollow, my jaw literally dropped. If I were to be reincarnated in a fantasy world, that's the kind of city I'd want to live in. And I've seen my fair share of towns in RPGs.

[h2]The bad :[/h2]

Nitpicking at this point, because there's not a lot of bad things to say, but if I were to list some:

- Campaign could've been a bit longer. the narrative & pacing was perfect for a 20h~ campaign, but I would've liked something in the 25-30h. But the end-game content makes up for it. Playing on max difficulty (Hard) was not that hard either.

- Quests feel very uninspired (get X mats, kill X monsters), I had hoped for something with more narrative like in the recent Legend of Heroes series.

- Would've liked more variety in the post-game monster missions. The combat makes up for it, but it would still have been a great plus. But I can't find it in me to blame the devs when you see everything else.

[h2]Conclusion :[/h2]

A fantastic first entry in the classic PC/Console JRPG series by Cygames. It's almost frightening how much stuff they got right, and often even better, than other studios. You can really tell they sat at the meeting table and said ""OK, what are all the little things that players find annoying when playing RPGs? Let's fix those"". And they freaking did. All those QoL (quality of life) things are noticeable for RPG connoisseurs, and they really enhance your experience.
I personally can't wait (and hope) for their next game. With all the experience they got building this one up, and seeing how good this one is, the next one could be a true masterpiece. They already sold 1M copies, so there is hope. They did say more content was planned for this game, too.

[b]Verdict :[/b] If you're a JRPG fan, this one is a must-buy in my opinion.
DLCs are completely optional and not really needed, just so you know. I think now's the best time to buy it because there are lots of players doing the end-game content, and I don't know how long this'll last. But, like I said, you can clear all content with bots, tho it's gonna be considerably slower because you have to gear your bots on top of your main (you should definitely invest only in 1 chara first, is my advice). And a lot of fun comes with playing with others in coop, too. I personally think the game is worth the full price, but maybe I'm biased, given my long history with the Granblue lore.

However, this game started proving me wrong the moment I turned it on, and it hasn't stopped.  It blends a few different games' styles (Monster Hunter, Tales, Warframe, FFXIV) into one for a uniquely blended awesome cocktail of action w/ boss fights that are honestly probably what FFXVI was shooting for.  It's a great game.  Pick it up if you're a fan of any of the stuff I just mentioned.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  I can't believe I'm saying that this game is worth the price tag, but it is.

Everything you could want from Gensht can be found in this game without additional cost after the initial one time fee purchase. You'd get the same replayability+more while being able to have access to new additional characters apart from the main starting 5 characters with all of the characters having unique unlockable free weapons and unique combo style while having a multitude of play style between each character going from full dps, full tank, full support or to a mix of the 3 playstyles per each character even though some may be suited more towards one style that can be UNLOCKED FOR FREE THROUGH GAMEPLAY WITHOUT ADDITIONAL COST vs the scummy gacha mechanics in Gensht for both characters and weapons. 

Apart from those few comparisons between Gensht and Granblue Fantasy Relink, game visuals are like constant gorgeous art work as well as EXCELLENT music throughout the entire game. World exploration is more than adequate as it's a semi open world with exploration in each zone like with a Monster Hunter game. The combat and movement during combat is 100x better than Gensht. Online gameplay is quite similar to the Monster Hunter quest lobby where you talk to an NPC to access online mode as well which works extremely well since you DON'T NEED TO ALWAYS BE ONLINE WITH ONLINE BEING AN OPTIONAL FEATURE. Boss fights are VERY SIMILAR to FF14 where the boss attacks are properly telegraphed with key visuals which works extremely well with the perfect dodge and perfect block mechanics.

The combat is where the game shines, which I assume is largely thanks to Platinum Games' contributions during development. Tons of characters with varied, stylish playstyles. When you press a button in the game, your character does a thing.

The game also utilizes Final Fantasy tropes really well. Summons, limit breaks, materia, etc. are all here with different names and used well. Throw it all in a blender with co-op boss fights and a Monster Hunter-esque endgame and gearing system, and it just kinda works.

They're gonna fix the start up issues people are having, they are a huge company with dozens of engineers working around the clock to keep the launch of their multimillion dollar project successful.

Guess what.

Launch issues aside:

This game is freaking rad. Deal with it. I said it.

It's rad.

EDIT:

Ya i was right doods. This game is exceptional and SUPER DANK.

I got it on launch day, and yes there were trubs getting it to run at first. But I noticed after a patch three days later, they put in a fallback to make it attempt to load your data at the fail point, and it worked for me, now every time.

So anyway, who cares about launch issues.

This game is super hyper fun ultra sicknasty dope-dope.

If you don't play videogames, or if you hate cool stuff, don't get this game.

But if you like things that are cool, then this will probably define a new type of cool for you. It's tight combat, feels fair, plenty of variety, a very robust scaling system, many many characters, and a story that is really just a prop to hold up the gameplay if you want it to be. You can also engage with the story if you want, and it is pretty deep and interesting! The play can choose how to play the game, and it is so wonderful I enjoyed every minute of it!

To get to the actual game, you have to complete a single-player-only story mode (not very long). Many different playable characters with somewhat different playstyles.

Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a good, Monster Hunter-ish type of game. There are many unique characters and a grind loop in the endgame. Almost everything can be done in singleplayer with three CPUs helping you, or you can play multiplayer with randoms or friends. Be aware that if you plan on playing with friends, you'll have to spend a day or two completing the campaign first, because it can only be done in singleplayer. I haven't seen or played any previous titles in this series, and it wasn't a problem. You can read a quick recap of how you met each character if you are interested. And if you are like me, tired of watching cutscenes and dialogues, you can skip everything, and there will be a few-sentence recap of what you skipped. The gameplay itself seems pretty easy so far because you can revive yourself too many times before a ""game over"" screen. But doing so will earn you fewer rewards for missions and take more time to complete them.

In the endgame, on top of classic MH parts crafting and upgrading, you get a gacha-like gear acquisition. Early endgame gear is more than enough for everything in the game for now, so completely maxing your character is not required unless you want to. Most people spam a few META missions, so you will have hard times matching with anyone for something else, unless maybe peak online hours. At some point, you will have to spam one of those missions to improve your characters. Character building isn't very diverse, as you can use basically the same build on everyone (with a few tweaks). But the characters themselves have different playstyles and combos, plus you can still make some fun builds if you don't care about damage.

There are DLCs with new bosses and playable characters announced already, so the game will probably get even better.",1706808946,1708096290,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's like an entire generation of developers watched a video essay on Sans and thought ""oh so I just make the player lose. that'll make my villain look super duper fuckin mighty""

Please, if you're a developer making a game, and you're going to employ this trope, just don't do it 4 times in 8 hours of gameplay. I'm begging you.

The game is... alright? Characters are very flashy to use, but feel mechanically very one-note. You're Siegfried? Press the button at the right time. You're Yodarha? Make sure you're stacking finishers before using skills. Rosette's the only one that feels dynamic to me. The game gets away with this fairly well on account of satisfying animations, and a wide enough variety of options that you're not *just* mashing attack, but Relink fails to inspire in me the feeling of ""wow, there's actually a lot more to this charcter than it seems"" like weapons in say, Monster Hunter.

Boss Design has flashes of brilliance and flashes of big dumb. Maglielle(?) is a boss who feels like a pretty wonderful fusion of MMO, bullet hell, and traditional ARPG style boss design. Thoroughly fun to fight. She's followed by two gimmick fights against super giant enemies that are a lot more running around than actually fighting, and gee willickers it's another forced loss (I think this is #3 in less than 8hrs gameplay?). This all happens at a point when it felt like the game was building momentum in a good way, then proceeded to shoot itself in the foot.

Higher difficulty options are needed from the outset. If you pay attention to the basic mechanics and bother to keep one or two characters up to date for the point you're at in the story, you will not face a real challenge until 25+ hours if then. The game doesn't have the kind of story that'll keep players new to Granblue interested, so having the ability to kick up the challenge early game would go a long way.

The story is what you expect from something that traces it's lineage to Gacha. Very flat, tropey, heavily depends on the quality of its character designs to get by. The setting seems pretty neat but I just don't find myself caring for the plot even as I started out wanting to.

[b]REVISION AFTER REACHING ENDGAME[/b]

The endgame almost fixes some of my problems, but introduces a bunch of new ones.

For one, it's virtually 100% recycled content. Unlike monster hunter, you aren't grinding familiar fights to see new ones, you're grinding to see the same ones with a few new tricks. For a game that was developed for 7 years and has beaucoup gacha bucks behind it, I'm really sour on how limited the boss roster is. 

Many maniac and more egregiously proud difficulty quests involve fighting multiple generic bosses at once, which clearly weren't designed to be together. What a tragedy, I finally found the challenge and it comes from having to manage the terrible lock on system and pay attention to three bosses at once such that I'm still guarding/dodging while putting out damage. I don't normally bust out the L word but this is straight up lazy design. 

Lastly, the endgame is horrendously starved for essential QoL features, compounded by the bad UI design. You will regularly spend 5-10+ minutes going through your inventory, option by option, individually selecting everything you need to recycle. You must transmute sigils one by one, which adds more pointless menuing. Given how short fights can be and how long menuing, selling, transmuting and making adjustments can be, you may genuinely spend half your time in the endgame in menus.

Ultimately if you need a new grinding game, Relink might do it for you on sale. It's a game that does well on spectacle, runs well and isn't buggy but seems to fall short in most every other department, Wide but not deep, long but not varied, and full of issues that realistically should have been addressed in its 7 long years of development.",1707558833,1708083396,False,1,2,0.458835422992706299,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Great entry for gamers into this hunting action genre  (imo it's in this genre since post game 90% of the quests drops u into an arena to fight 1 boss . Or very rarely 2/3 boss jammed together with no sense of coherence)
-graphics, sound, music, designs (while based on the original franchise) are beautiful
-Main story Boss fights are choreographed rather nicely
-Some oddly good QoL for an RPG (teleporting to side quest giver, Wishlist; Repeat quest immediately) 

Cons:
-Main story quest is only 20 hours
-only 20 bosses at end game . a few of them have reskinned versions , notably one Ancient Dragon which has a grand total of 7 skins. Quite a turn off
-Characters, while very easy to pick up, have rather low skill ceiling. Your character gets stronger mostly from equipment and sigils, which are all from grinding. Few aspects that let the player feel good for making skillful plays
-Almost no sense of achievement when even has highest Maniac Difficulty, with a group of players at that power level, the quests end is 5 min. 10 mins tops, except for the final 2 bosses
-Outside of Main story, most maps are just 1 round arena. 
-Some VERY QUESTIONABLE DECISIONS e.g. no minimap , or even a basic map for the any of the towns; no  batch gacha at Siero's; no skip function for Fate Episodes; very long Mastery tree which you have to scroll down manually; no options to turn off damage numbers; NOT ABLE TO REMAP CONTROLS",1707308369,1708079659,False,5,0,0.478579849004745483,0,True,False,False

The story of the game is pretty standard fare, but makes up for it by not dragging you its feet and getting right to the point. The bulk of the story can be completed in around 10-15 hours, which is where the rest of the game picks up. The end game consists of quests in the style of a Monster Hunter title, where you go out and fights enemies/bosses to collect *things* with which to become more powerful through a nebulous but nonetheless easy to understand game-play loop.

I'm usually not a big fan of action games (couldn't get into Elden Ring and DMC series), yet this game managed to make it's fast paced action very easy to pick up, but have a lot of depth and very high skill ceiling. Even if one character doesn't click, there is a huge roster with vastly different play styles to try which prevent you from getting bored. 

The fantastic looking art style is just the cherry-on-top. It's similar to Tales and Arise and I absolutely love it.

However, this game is not perfect. The main story is just servicable. Voice acting is pretty good, but the story is too short and not very engaging. The side character's stories ""Fate Episodes"" are a real missed opportunity. They could have at least went with Tales of Arise's comic book style without spending too much effort on it, but it feels like they really run out of budget at this point and just give up ...",1708050808,1708050808,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beautiful game, very little issues on launch easy to pick up and has a high skill ceiling with animation canceling. Perfectly parrying/dodging attacks and weaving your attacks feel great. You feel like a boss when you're maintaining DPS because you perfectly dodged while everybody else running for their lives, dodging mechanics.

Endgame gameplay loop is like doing mini FF14 raids with a MonsterHunter Rise style partying system. This is a good base for a game that hopefully will become like Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak with more solid updates coming in that would create more play styles and harder content as the end game is pretty easy and isn't much prestige. There's no achievements for soloing bosses and camera lock on is dogshit, turn off all the auto options for camera.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Fun gameplay that feels smooth and responsive.Also has a high skill ceiling with animation canceling that can vary per character. Although there are some brain dead characters too.
[*] Abundance of different characters with different playstyles
[*] Has light auto farm capabilities to make the grind easier and you can save scum. I appreciate ways that can lessen any sort of grinding as I value my time.
[*] Looks great very animu, much weeb
[*] Good QoL features that let you teleport around NPCs and quest finishing. Also Wish listing item drops. Although it is missing the option to roll multiple times when you have an abundance of resources to gamble.
[*] You can somewhat tune your difficulty by playing solo without a party or with a party or with randoms.
[/list]

Cons / Nitpicks
[list]
[*] The lock on camera is god awful. Half the fight is you against the camera some times. If there's more than 2 enemies on the screen, the lock on will drive you insane. Learning how to play without it is a must.
[*] Endgame builds are the same for every character due to the damage cap system. Builds only open up when playing without a party darksouls style vs bosses, but due to this bosses with DPS checks seem to be undoable solo.
[*] No option to dial down effects of other players like in Monster hunter or FF14 so there is a huge lack of clarity in fights, this is especially bad when you can die in 1-2 hits.
[*] Boring variety of bosses. You just fight multiple bosses or reskinned boss models.

Story wise its not really interesting but gameplay and cutscene really bought everything together nicely.
Its like Tales Of Arise but more fluid, i havent unlock all hero but from what i had its so fun and unique. Bosses have mechanics not just target dummy, and in the story there is so many gimmick even you can play as a MECH 10/10 for gameplay.

- Localization sometimes its to cringe to read, idk why they didn't just translate it correctly, instead they give slang here and there and its really annoying.
- Matchmaking sucks because of region lock only in early stages (easy, normal, hard and extreme), the time we got to play coop with people in early stages isn't much, i found that you can always play coop in proud stages and extreme farm stage, seems like it isn't a big problem.",1707055146,1708043489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After the first game update (fixes), and by updating the firmware driver for my PS5 controller, most issues I had were fixed. Let's go!

First Review:

Game and combat systems are actually pretty fun.
Current problems I found myself in:

- Playstation port - we're still greeted by Xbox controller prompts in 2024.
- No way to change button bindings, even tho it's possible with keyboard and mouse! WTH!
- Controller (PS5) randomly stops working in town/dialogues/main menu as if it had a stroke.
- Game isn't able to close properly after quitting. Tested multiple times - always had to manually close Steam completely.

Poorly optimized. These things just get in the way of my enjoyment of the game.

I have seen people likening this game to an anime Monster Hunter, which I only partially agree with. As opposed to the slow and methodical gameplay found in the Monster Hunter franchise, Granblue Fantasy Relink opts for an arguably simpler, and beginner-friendly combat loop. The game, however, does offer its own unique strengths in the form of extensive build varieties.
[b] The Goodies: [/b]
My only experience with the Granblue franchise was some brief experimentations with the main browser game and the spin-off fighting game. Nevertheless, according to my limited understanding of the lore, you don’t really need to play any of the other games to jump right into this one. The game features a typical anime storyline with a protagonist and their fellows beating monsters to save the world. What I do enjoy about most games in this franchise is their stories’ sypnosis system and detailed encyclopedia about the franchise, which can help new and returning players catch up to speed.
The main gameplay consists of you taking on quests (mainly beating monsters up) in different biomes, which is similar to a Monster Hunter game, albeit with a lack of an expedition or meal system. Finishing these quests nets you goodies to upgrade your characters and weapons. The game currently features a cast of 18 playable characters, each with their own unique playstyle and set of skills, which consequently leads to quite a bit of build potentials.
[b] The Not-so-Goodies: [/b]
The game can get quite grindy towards the end, especially when there is RNG involved; which is not surprising considering the original browser game relies heavily on a Gacha system. Regardless, the game is plenty of fun without tackling the endgame contents, and you will most likely burnout trying out all of the playable characters long before.
[b] Conclusion: [/b]
The game is great if you’re interested in getting into the franchise, or if you’re looking for a more laxed version of Monster Hunter.",1707990609,1707990609,True,1,0,0.528301894664764404,0,True,False,False

For the most part, the game is not hard, the story however is the standard granblue fantasy mobage story where it emphasize on the power of nakama. Only got stuck on the final chapter boss where it requires some damage check and I think I am under level. You could just change the difficulty to story and clear the final boss.
Then the 2nd part of the game begins, where you would need to grind to get more powerful weapons and higher level with higher difficulty quests. The good thing is, you can invite ppl to join your game to help you. I think this would add another 5 - 10 hours to the game depending on what is your objective (if you are perfectionist, most likely getting more hours due to grind). 
Overall, I think this is a good game. But if you  want to have the best bang for your buck, hoping this could burn your hundreds of hours like monster hunter, this might not be the game for you.",1707985226,1707989410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I mean is. I hoped for a fast open world game with deep story telling. But in the end it is a Monster Hunter clone with small or medium areas you get teleported to and grind monsters. Which is tedious to say at least. It takes forever and the waves sometimes seems kinda endless. It sadly hits the current agenda people like to play: End game hard mode. But I hate that. I wanna have a chill time and enjoy a good story and not a bunch of characters constantly talking story related paragraphs in the middle of a fight. But in the end the story is sadly something you can ignore anyway. I got a refund and bought Persona 3 Reload. A much better choice.

Yes, the artwork and the OST are amazing - as is known of Granblue as a general rule. But even as a fan of the setting, all this game presented me with was the fact it is a clearly unfinished project they shipped off as a stitched together, salvaged zombie of what they hoped it could be. 
Cygames will be drip feeding some of the missing content for the next few years at a crawling pace to keep it alive, but that won't do much to you unless you can live off of the ""ah! I know that guy/fight/boss/event!"" feeling stemming from other Granblue material. 
Unfortunately and in my personal opinion, the game has a very big ""meh"" plastered on it on a fundamental level, and the only reason I've played through it is my previous investment in the characters. Were I to rely only on its actual content/storyline, I would have given up around the ten hour mark if not earlier.

To its credit, all technical parts work. No bugs, perfect performance, online services smoothly working, the UI is pretty and well done for the most part and the translation to English is... well, it's alright.

It's great when a game just works.

The graphics?
Stunning. A unified, clean series of designs for every aspect of the world.
Everything is done in engine. No crunched up FMV's to be seen until the credits roll.
Player and boss super attacks are well choreographed, sending graphic effects flowing across the screen to contrast with the more grounded normal combat.

The plotline?
Pure, undiluted, A+ anime tropes. I knew absolutely nothing about Granblue lore and it brought me up to speed, then proceeded to deliver anime climax after climax after climax. Each of the main story episodes is about an hour long. Each with some sort of amazingly choreographed boss fight at the end, starting with the wind god. I did like ~1 episode a day and side quests and the pacing was pretty good.
None of the major boss fights are wasted, each letting one of your supporting characters shine or letting one of the villains chew the scenery. Even the few re-fights in the end game boss rush are paced correctly, lower hp, their attack patterns altered and different methods of support. 
And when you think you're done? More bosses, bigger stakes.

The gameplay?
Very nice. Each character is like a musou character, with some sort of semi unique mechanic and a list of skills to choose four from.
You get 6 characters to choose from to start, then you can choose to unlock more as the story progresses. The extra characters don't seem to have a story role though, so I left them aside.
You lead a party of four characters, where you play as only one of them while the others are played by AI.
The AI isn't braindead and took care of keeping healing in reserve (though having multiple healers will cause them to overlap their heals) or starting a super attack chain at the appropriate moments. They also are aware how enemy bosses super attacks work and can mostly avoid the glowing circles without cheating.

The grinding?
The main story with all the side quests took, 10 hours? Going though the multiplayer mode with npcs took me to 32 hours. So the grinding really increases in the post story.
The post story grinding is pretty bad, since it involves you running a mission on repeat to get [whatever you need right now]. Repeating a single 5 minute mission to get resources is boring.

Unique mechanics to encourage cooperation.
Link attacks that can be performed when you exhaust the enemies stun bar. If you are within a generous distance to the stunned enemy, anyone can press the interact button to fly to the enemy and attack, this builds up a meter that activates 'bullet time' when the team all does a link attack.
Super attack chains. Chaining together your characters supers attacks adds a bonus super attack on at the end based on how many players chained their attacks together. It's also cool when the characters shout out the extra attack name in unison.
Team based failure. The team shares a failure timer that drains while one or more characters are down on zero HP. Each player can self revive by mashing but having an ally interact with you revives you faster.

The bosses are great. They shift between a normal or warm up attack pattern, but can also enter an enrage mode where they have harder attack patterns that drains over time. But it also drains quicker if you hit them, encouraging your to keep the offence up. Also, when you break their enrage mode they enter a down phase for free hits.
Bosses also have limited use spectacular attacks where they turn virtually invulnerable and force the players to be on the back foot temporarily.
The constant shifting of boss tempos between the normal, enrage phase, invincible phase and stuns keeps each boss fight varied.

The multiplayer?
I don't know. The main storyline doesn't allow for co-op play. The multiplayer capable missions are very short and mindless. So I would label this game as singleplayer first, with a bonus multiplayer mode added onto the end.
I tried to queue for a multiplayer side mission early in the game, and the game queue timed out and told me to switch back to single player mode. There probably isn't a mid mission join feature. I'd like to run side missions with AI and leave my game open for humans to join in if they wanted.
Apparently players are scaled down to the lowest level player, so having friends at different levels might work out alright, instead of the overleveeled friend stomping everything.

There is a quick play mode that unlocks after the main story, but I haven't been able to find anyone. Maybe there is region locking or something.
Since quick play just spins the wheel and drops you into a random mission, it would be great if the 'repeat mission' button would just take you to another random mission while in quick play mode. Anything that encourages repeating the same mission over and over is a surefire way to burn players out.",1707985765,1707985765,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Downsides are criminally bad EN voice acting (for the love of god switch to the godtier JP VA) and localization, some stability jank and hub CPU overhead despite the good perfs and instant loading times, badly thought-out co-op downscaling that makes playing with underleveled friends a sad experience, underwhelming rewards for quick-questing, no PC<->PS crossplay, no GBF codes on PC, and multitarget attack magnetism hating you.
Okay, we can breathe now.

[b]We are only in February and it's already my [i]mercilessly[/i] uncontested GOTY.[/b]

Immediately buy it now if you like any of those: Character-action combat (Platinum games), MMORPG raidboss mechanics, Final Fantasy aesthetics, Monster Hunter beast slaying and game loop, Tales of JRPG comfort food, Skies of Arcadia or floating islands in general, or huge angry lizards.
Worth at a discount if you just want to enjoy the short and generic, but explosively spectacular tutorial that is the main story.

[b]Gameplay, presentation, visuals, and soundtrack [i]are at the top[/i] of the J-ARPG genre.[/b]
Count 60-ish hours to complete the game up to the current Proud difficulty last boss. 8-16 intense hours if you only want to play the main story. Hundreds if you want to be that one guy with every character maxed to high heaven. Post-game is very challenging and has some cheesable grind.

[h1]Unexpectedly blue skies[/h1]
Granblue Versus first introduced me to the franchise with a stellar fighting game, and made me fall in love with its world -as a huge fan of anything celestial fantasy- and its characters, from my goofy main bro Lowain to the ever so popular Narmaya. After a while, I made the mistake of touching the browser game and got hooked by its progression, story, grid system, Narita's music ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjsv056BXE ) and Minaba's pretty draph pictures ( https://gbf.wiki/Character_Tier_List pick your poison).
While every love story has its honeymoon, what follows is often a bitter marathon. [b]And good lord if Cygames isn't a company that masters the monkey paw like no other...[/b]
Every great addition was punctuated by terrible management decisions and very strong disconnections with their games' identities and playerbases. After years of going through nonsensical balancing in VS (and still going, hello 66L), and debacles like GBF's infamous summer fortune, revans weapons BS and simply inhumane grinds, I got used to the ways of that company... Or so I thought.

After 7 tumultuous years of development, what we thought was basically vaporware, came back from development hell to slap our collective behinds, into a now million-selling release on PC alone. And... just wow.

[h1]A game that knows exactly what it wants to do[/h1]
The identity crisis most JRPGs and ARPGs face generally takes the form of a thick layer of bland-tasting fat, with stories that try being impactful but fall flat, convoluted and broken systems, endless padded sidequests and oh my god the pacing! Here, most of it is trimmed, with some remnants to remind you that this is a Granblue game, and to lure you in with some sweet suspension of disbelief. And by the time you realize it, [b]you're enjoying the gameplay so much you just forget about everything else[/b]. You know the story is McDonalds JRPG slop. Relink knows the story is McDonalds JRPG slop. You look at each other and nod, then cut to the chase.

There's the hubs, the main story and the co-op monster hunter-like gameloop. Everything else is treated like the aforementioned fat and aggressively cut. Forget long character intro monologue cutscenes. Here you have a few gists in voiced text blocks in the form of fate episodes. Collectables? There's just a few barely hidden chests in your way. Side-quests? It's just auto-complete stuff you automatically hit as you progress through co-op with some handy repeatables for that endgame grind. Character banter? Percival orders Vane to bark for him as you chain skybound arts together, no need for a dedicated cutscene that cuts your gameplay for 5 minutes.
Dialogues and cutscenes exist to put the fights in context and that's it, and they are all skippable and handily summed up if need be. Hub area, dialogue, short cutscene, repeat. [b]The momentum never stops[/b] and you surprise yourself binge-eating the game at 2 AM, wanting for more every chapter...

...And that's only the tutorial.

All of it is presented in a polished package with one of the most beautiful and tightly executed art directions this techart nerd has ever seen. It's [b]Hideo Minaba's illustrations coming alive[/b], with jaw-dropping vistas and hub areas that brim with life and personality from Folca's retired draph soldiers teaching swordfighting to a bunch of kids to Ghandagoza getting lost in Seedhollow's backstreets.
The visual effects are omnipresent and bursting with energy while staying perfectly readable in some Proud fights' bullet hell situations. I very much know how difficult these things are to pull off and this simply leaves me in admiration.

[b]The game keeps raising the bar on every chapter in every form[/b]. And one I haven't talked about yet is the soundtrack. In short, you are not ready.
As always, Tsutomu Narita + Nobuo Uematsu + Stella Magna is a very deadly combination.
While it sometimes re-uses tracks from good ol' GBF, it has many original tracks that are among Narita's very best works. If you don't mind me spoiling you the battle track for the base antagonist in the game's cover art, Id, here's a sample of what you can expect from this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDq5_PZ57xg

[h1]And now, the meat[/h1]
[b]This is the best-feeling action combat I have ever touched[/b]. It's heavy and observant like Monster Hunter, fast and deep like a bayonetta, over-the-top flashy like a Metal Gear Rising, strategic and demanding like an MMO raidboss, bullet hell-y like a Nier Automata, and has big number soup that goes brrr with insanely complex itemization theorycrafting like.... Granblue Fantasy.
You control one character in a Xenoblade-y party of four, starting with 6 base playable skyfarers and a pool of 12 you progressively choose and unlock as you progress through the game.
They are all incredibly varied, ranging from Lancelot's mash & dodge gorilla gameplay to Rosetta's buff and rose turret uptime rotation, Zeta's pogo stick loops with gradually tighter timings, Narmaya's super technical and fun stance dancing, Eugen's third person shooter mode, Io's cast-for-hours nukes... Every character is like playing a different game, and not a single one of them is boring, with multiple possible builds each. Fantastic kit design.
Teammates can be players or CPU, which are, surprisingly, [i]really[/i] good, like, better than the average player!
You hit, hit harder with another button, do character-specific combo routes, manage character mechanics and stacks/bars/etc, block, dodge, jump, attack in the air, use one of four skills of your choice, break enemy ""parts"", do linked attacks, chain ultimate moves into each other, use a variety of potions, revive teammates, become a doormat, spam silly stickers when the big dragon boss fires a huge laser so that all your teammates can see on their screen is a dumb obscure old man GBF meme bathed in blinding, lethal light.
Your equipment consists of your levellable weapon (customizable stat stick) and slots for sigils which contain traits that conditionally modify your stats or build you a certain way. This is pretty much GBF's grid and weapon mod system, and if there's one thing GBF vets will always say good things about aside from the pretty JPEGs, it's the grid.

I do find this game more of a Hybrid JRPG/Monster Hunter game  rather then a full JRPG experience , The main story itself being the JRPG and the After-story being the Monster Hunter side.

The Art :
The game itself is visually amazing , the views you get and stylised backgrounds are wonderful to look at even while fighting/exploring and whatever else you get upto! There are plenty of different area's and unique things to discover , The animations are flashy and the game provides a very nice cinematic experiance overall. Not much to complain about here , only praise from me.

The Controls/Camera :
I played with a Game pad and found a typically easier experiance , only thing that is a real bother is the camera in certain fights pan's upwards and makes it a tad hard to see the telegraphed floor markers , With this in mind , I have also found the Locking-on to be . . . Meh , as there are times when your doing a DPS phase and while being locked onto the part you can hit as a Melee , it will instead lock-on to a part you are unable to hit , but you will attack it all the same, so you waste time trying to reset yourself which is a massive annoyance

The Campaign :

Its around 10 - 15 hrs long I would say depending on skill level and whatnot regardless I did enjoy it very much and very invested through-out the story , With Chapters leading upto a boss fight in each act , it sets you up to experience what you will be doing in the after-story , as a bonus there are Character specific mini-stories you can do to explore their story and gain small side bonuses for doing so with each story being about 20 mins total

The Monster Hunting Part :

So now you beat the story , you will pretty much be levelling and grinding out various systems to increase your power to complete progressively harder fights , nothing untoward really , This does involve a ton of farming which can be very monotonous because you will need to farm A LOT. You will be using  multiple Gacha style systems to increase your PWR rating with some pieces of gear being gained from blind luck , well . . . a good few pieces of gear , It also doesn't really give you an idea of how important certain skills are and just kind of expects you to know when your at your DMG CAP  for example

Overall :

This game is pretty nice , I was worried about the price but so far at 100hrs I feel I have my money's worth and I think with some QoL improvements it will be really nice for sure , even better with friends if you have those

A simple but impact stat/mastery system.

-Very short campaign. If you ignored sidequests you could probably finish it in maybe 10 hours.
-VERY EASY campaign. Not a hard negative, but even with just a smidge of grinding every fight felt like a breeze, even on the hardest difficulty
-Not all the characters are balanced. Poor Gandaghoza.
-Monster designs are almost too stereotypically fantasy. Griffins, goblins and dragons? You can have fun with those, but please get even a little creative with them!

And now the pros:

-VERY good post-game. I don't know why they waited until after the main story to start the Monster Hunter style gameplay loop, but once it hits it hits!
-A very pretty game in every way. The location design and music are all top-notch, and it has some truly impressive set pieces. Excavalion boss fight, anyone?
-Very fun and intuitive combat- for the most part. Once again, poor Gandagoza.
-The writing and voice acting is very good. Controversial take, but the English VA is extremely well done.

Going cheap on servers when you earn the sort of money you do is crappy.

The soundtrack as usual with Cy, is really nice. That aside, with GBVS being out and most of this cast being in that game, I would have liked more of the player SBAs from that game to be featured here as well as Primals as summons would have been nice just to add variety to characters Kits and players options. (Zeta's kit is...pretty freaking lame and quickly repetitive. You could have did her better justice Cy...). Ares, Tiamat, Noa, Colossus, Leviathan, Yggdrasil and even Bahamut are all relegated to the background and/or not even used when you could have had a summoning system in the game...

Outfits - Color palettes for outfits?! REALLY? Big Sis Narmaya has at least 5-6 different variants in the mobile (most others have the same thing), you could have brought those over into your first major AAA release... Heck, you don't even allow people to pick the classic Djeeta/Gran outfit in favor of the new outfit if they wanted to....lame.

Combat - Chaining combos is awesome, to the point of learning out to use a character to maximize your output is pretty rewarding. Most characters kits are engaging and unique (Zeta was again, pretty robbed...). The only problem becomes the same typical problem you deal with in RPGs. Every.Single.Goon in the game has next to no hit stun and can just outright steam roll you whenever they want to, right down to basic goblins and wolves...so all those practiced combos go to waste because you're forced to dodge and block on a constant basis by enemies that are seemingly spamming X and Skills more than you are. This can be fixed with things like increased dodge immunity after perfect dodge, Stout heart, or even an increase to stun power. But this is so ridiculous to have to go this far just so an enemy will act like they're being hit. It's nonsense. Games doing this is getting old....

Story - The story is fine. A bit cheesy and at points is laughable in how little sense something makes or a character action is. I do like that Djeeta/Gran aren't silent and will say the dialogue option you pick, that's really cool. I think you could have utilized more QTE here and there to kick up the scenes and engage players for having them watch, but it's fine. The big poo-poo is that none of the story is co-op which is just a head-scratchingly stupid decision. There is plenty of juicy aspects that would have been fun to do in the story scenario with a friend and I was looking forward to that only to find it was gone. It makes even less sense since when you join another player you talk about story spoilers and toggling it when you can't even do story...so why the useless disclaimer? Just because you can fight a boss? That's not spoiling anything...

Targeting - This whole system can be a bit wonky just because the natural lockon of skills is so good that I often drop it. Additionally, the camera often can lose track of you and worse of it, is that bosses have so many target options, that sometimes you get locked onto a spot that's not reachable and you're just blindly swinging at something you can't hit. Thus, I mostly don't even use this system unless I pick up throwable items and want to chuck them from deep. This system needs a touch up.

Quick Quests - Freaking Quick Quests....I get that you have mobile game roots. It vomits ALL OVER GBR with Dalia Badges and Knickknack vouchers (Both are utterly stupid and useless currency that exists to bloat replayability). Again, artificial replayability by putting in gacha and an overinflated grind to max out and build characters. Fair. But Quick Quest....the 'underleveling' for Quick Quest has got to be the dumbest thing this game offers aside from the fact you can't play any of the story in co-op. Why are you nullifying player progression in Quick Quest by scaling players down to match the quest? False advertising. It outright states you'll get a quest in range of Easy - Very Hard+. They are NEVER on Easy because you dumb down players characters to match the stage. I fought Vulkan Bolla in Undertake Quest and beat him in less than a minute. Legit got the SAME quest right after that in Quick Quest only for it to take nearly 6 mins+ because you scaled me down to match it JUST so you could make the quest difficult. This makes no sense when you already HAVE quests you can just match to my power level and it doubly makes no sense because you don't underlevel people in regular quests and you don't do it in story chapter select to the point players can beat Id in the first encounter because they're so overpowered yet...yet...you underlevel players for quick quest? Idiotic. The underleveling for Quick Quests should be freaking patched out, it's dumb.

All these things aside, the game is fine and would love to see more content drop, namely characters, quests, and ACTUAL costumes. This game is psudo live service, so these new additions would be nice and I know there are already plans. Playing the story co-op would equally be nice, but I guess that's a pipe dream now.

Grandblue Fantasy: Relink manages to captivate the player with its immersive play style, build crafting, and expansive universe at every turn. You will find yourself spending hours trying to obtain that one weapon or sigil that completes your build.

While the game had a rocky launch on Steam, the game itself was still too good to dismiss. With the popularity of ""review bombing"" earlier on, I am always hesitant to dismiss games on Steam reviews alone. Hence why I spent an ample amount of time playing this game thus far before I decided to put my thoughts out there. 

If you want to know where I am at in the game...
I have beaten every fight with an S++ rating, 100% of all collectibles, and even have 100% completed 4 characters (Rackam, Ferry, Lancelot, Io). Yes, this includes siglis+'s and [redacted] weapons. The game just makes you want to go for it when it comes to building out your characters. 

The game plays kind of like the God Eater games, mixed with a little bit of Monster Hunter, and the fantasy elements of the Final Fantasy series. Yet, it still stands out as its unique IP. The story may not be for everyone, but the world surrounding it is beautifully crafted. I found myself looking to find out more info on each of the characters and references that were hidden throughout the game. 

The game presents a fairly linear storyline to end game loop progression that takes into consideration teaching the player things as they become applicable. There were a few misses where some things could have been explained earlier (curio RNG, Knickknack vouchers, Sigil + versions, and crewmate card usage). There are now plenty of us past this point that would have benefited from knowing more, but that is part of learning in a new game. Make sure to check out many of the guides out there explaining the system before you commit to spending those resources super early on.

Regarding the multiplayer end game aspect... The loop feels great. I find myself WANTING to grind out more things for my favorite characters. There are a few things I would like to see change (repeat quest when more than 2 people select it and improvements on where to find items per quest), but for the most part it is just really enjoyable. The progression from 'Easy' to 'Proud' feels fantastic, too. They took into consideration the type of task you need to do as you advanced which I thought was neat. Felt like a real guild was assigning you quests based on your rank and skill. Because of this, I always found myself adjusting my sigils + playstyle as I progressed. 

In closing, I have enjoyed the game and am so looking forward to the updates to come. Give the game a try! You might just end up enjoying it!

The postgame consists of monster hunter-esque grinding where you can get drunk on watching numbers go up. and this is where a majority of the game is. For most of it, its recycled content from the main story just with more mechanics. The last difficulty introduces some new unique fights

The game also needed better testing for PC. There really is no excuse these days. For example, if you set the FPS to 120 the camera moves faster, and if you set it to 30 it moves slower. At 120 FPS I have to move it halfway across my desk just to do a 360.

I feel really bad for the people who worked on the game, because they did a decent job, but unfortunately the publisher has no integrity and doesn't give a shit about the game, not to mention cringe Americans butchering the writing. The game could have been amazing if the people in charge of the last mile were competent.

I would give the gameplay so far a 8/10, the community a 3/10 since it's filled with American cancer, but the steam forums get a -1/10 because they aren't even people.

No nonsense game. Has good cutscenes that become more and more epic as you progress. And all the characters have an interesting background story. I even got a little emotional towards the end.

The controls are pretty easy to learn but it can take a while to fully understand a rotation. I've played ~20 hours so far and still feel like I'm not playing any character to their full potential. There's also different skills to pick from and of course party compositions, so finding something in your own style can take a while (assuming you just don't copy from some guide).

At this point I finished the main story, but the game apparently also has post-game content where you just do what you want and progress your characters instead of following a storyline. Not sure how much content there is left but from what I've heard it seems to be one of those games where the story is basically just the tutorial. While the general structure could be called similar to Monster Hunter, in the sense that you have a hub, go on instanced missions and farm rewards, the moment to moment gameplay certainly is not.

It's great to see that Cygames was finally able to release after a series of unfortunate delays as well as a global pandemic. As someone who has been waiting for this game for over 6 years, I can happily say that it was worth the wait. 

To start, it looks fantastic and the approach that Cygames took with the art style both maintains the Granblue Fantasy style while also giving it a fresh coat of 3-Dimensional HD paint that the series deserves. Every character model oozes personality and does justice by their gacha game counterparts. Their models are well-detailed and their animations, both in and out of combat, ooze personality. 

The soundtrack is great as well. Classic tunes get new versions that help set the mood of the more idyllic setting of the base game (Sierokarte's shop theme being a softer acoustic guitar instead of being a high-speed folk violin solo). Bosses, which will comprise most of your playtime, will have a variety of themes from pretty par-for-the-course RPG boss themes, to chiptune(?), to full-on power ballads as you take on some of the game's toughest fights. 

If I could describe the gameplay, I would compare it to the controls of a ""Tales of"" game with gameplay loop that presents itself as more of an arcade-y Monster Hunter, except instead of picking out a weapon to define your playstyle, you're picking up one of Granblue Fantasy's iconic, or not-so-iconic characters. This game was worked on by Platinum Games, the studio responsible for games such as Bayonetta or Nier Automata, and as such the combat is fast-paced and sleek. For veterans of character-action games this game will be relatively easy early on, but the difficulty ramps up nicely towards the end with fights that demand deeper character knowledge to meet DPS checks as well as avoiding AoEs that are vaguely reminiscent of Final Fantasy XIV raids. 

For those who are not are used to games such as this, there are a variety of accessibility options that can make it easier for you such as the ""Story"" difficulty that will make fights easier for you as well as the Assist settings that streamline gameplay for you. While these options will make a fair bit of the content easier for players who need them, you will need to learn how to interact with the game's systems in order to conquer the high-end challenges. 

In regards to story, this game gives you a self-contained story that is connected to the lore and world-building of the original Granblue Fantasy, but can be enjoyed without knowledge of previous works. Additionally, all playable characters also have additional story beats that give players additional insight into who they are and is fully-voiced. My biggest complaint about this game is in regards to its story. The game's main story, while having some fantastic peaks, is ultimately your standard shounen adventure. It's not bad by any means, but coming from a company that has shown its playerbase that it can put out excellent narrative in the mobile game such as Home Sweet Moon, And You, and the What Makes the Sky Blue trilogy it's a shame how safe Relink's story can be. 

All said, this is an excellent game that I would wholeheartedly recommend even at full price to Granblue newcomers and especially fans of the original. Cygames has already planned content to be released for at least the next three months including an endgame super boss and two new characters, however given the positive reception I wouldn't be surprised if they went even further.

Relatively short, semi-generic story (took me around ~12-13 hours; including minor exploration & some side quests).
Most rewarding co-op content locked behind completion of story mode (matchmaking pre-Proud difficulty is very hard).

Overall, I give this game a solid 8.5-9/10. Definitely a fantastic game joining the 2024 GOTY contenders (with Palworld, Enshrouded, Etc.).",1707934874,1707935099,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is predictable and cliche, but ultimately inoffensive and buoyed by its fast pace, phenomenal setpieces, and well-directed and animated cutscenes. The narrative won't surprise you, but possesses the comfort and joy of a Saturday morning cartoon.

The mission-based game structure and boss design are much closer to Phantasy Star Online than Monster Hunter—special moves, constant cut-ins, and telegraphed bullet hells await. Relink does an excellent job teaching you the many different fights as you progress through the tiered difficulties—when you finally arrive at Proud you should feel prepared for what's to come.

There's a LOT of grinding to be done—grinding for sigils, grinding for weapons, grinding for materials to upgrade your sigils and weapons. But like all good grinding games, the grind in Relink is an optional task—you can clear every fight in the game with suboptimal loadouts. But Relink knows that it's fun to min/max and reach your character's peak potential.

Granblue Fantasy's artstyle has translated beautifully to Relink and the game is a joy to watch in motion.

Early release lot of people encounter crash, but they do fix it ASAP so we can expect more help/fix if there is more bug or crash happen in the future.

The main story doesn't overstay its welcome & quest system keeps things refreshingly focused compared to your typical big budget ARPG. I think this game could be god tier depending on the quality of challenging endgame content added post-release.
As it is it has all the makings of one but the 'optional' content is very easy and takes a long time to build up (especially if you touch multiplayer) while player side mechanics are really strong.

Combat definitely feels very platinum games-like. A bit simple but each character is very unique from the other. The skill ceiling is still higher than you might think and some characters are more technical than others.
The amount of quality of life features is kind of incredible, from training modes to wishlists etc. As a comparison both of those features are pulled off better than monster hunter. The downtime / busywork you need to do between quests is extremely minimal.
Enemy attacks & AoEs have the cleanest visual indicators i've seen in a 3D action game like this from memory. They can definitely up the difficulty without visibility being an issue.

Misc. gripes:
The disparity between multiplayer and single player difficulty is too big. It's not good if multiplayer feels like an easy/cheat mode. This is a bit like if monhun didn't scale quests to be harder based on player count.

Guard seems nonsensically strong. Many bosses have attack patterns where you can't do anything but dodge until it times out. But guess what. You can just stand in place and hold the guard button. If you got hit it's because you assumed you need to do something. There are very few fights with unblockable attacks, and it's usually some mid-tier monster instead of an endgame boss.

There are many bosses where the only challenging part of the fight is a DPS check. This is pretty cringe & even if the rest of fight was fun in a challenge run (say playing 1 character only) that limitation might make the dps check part impossible. Struggling through a difficult fight with a lowish power party isn't rewarded, rather you kinda get punished for good gameplay through the rest of the fight.

Lock-on and targeting behavior is strange with your character very likely trying to hit something on the other side of the map, if the movement direction matches more.
The auto tracking on your moves is really strong even without locking. If manual aim could be more of its own thing ala monster hunter this could make some characters with slower attacks more fun to play.

Launch version specific:
The endgame quests aren't very interesting for multiplayer play. Only 1-2 quests are challenging for survival if played with random people (main one having multiple bosses at once, one with many unblockables). For others if you are playing multiplayer you can assume there's no chance of quest failure and it's just a speedrun to get to your loot drop gacha. Getting hit also barely costs you time or resources unless it kills you, unlike monhun. Tanking hits is the way to go if you are specced above the quest level. The 'final' farmable quest is more of a setpiece & dps check fest than actual combat which is pretty meh.",1707910941,1707925132,True,42,2,0.761455535888671875,0,True,False,False

The game isn't the optimized the best, though FPS will thankfully only dip during cutscenes and in towns. Even so, the visuals are amazing, from the art style to the VFX and animations.

I finished the MSQ on Hard Mode in about 20 hours, a pretty modest length. However, the game is actually part of the monster hunting genre of action games, so its true appeal lies in the combat itself as you delve deeper and deeper into post-game encounters and raids with other players (or your own party).

Each playable character plays completely differently than each other, along with skill trees and gear allowing you to create loadouts for a character that can emphasize different roles in a party. One character might excel in tanking or be built to be a damage dealer, or another character may specialize in a buffing support role or as a healer.

The story is only a small part of this game though, once the story is complete there are many more bosses and activities to take part in during the post game. I took my time and completed the story in 20 hours and have spent 40 hours so far in post game and there is still more for me to unlock. The combat in this game is incredibly fun and it's biggest selling point, there are a bunch of characters to play many with different play styles to make them unique. I'm hooked on the build crafting for this game chasing bigger and bigger numbers. As you level up you get a large amount of control of your characters stats in the form of Sigils that you will spend at lot of time chasing the good rolls some missions will have set Sigils you can farm from them while there are others you will need to use you resources to test your luck on an RNG loot pool.

Only big downside I've experienced is the matchmaking has been setup in cumbersome way that tends to get in the way of itself. For example if three of four people toggle to repeat a quest but one person does not then it disbans the whole group rather than look for someone to fill an empty slot. Also the online for the game is region locked so player activity will swing wildly based on time of day making is near impossible to matchmake into groups for less popular quest depending on time. Even with those points however I still have fun playing with randoms and farming endgame activities.

If I could make a small request to the devs it would be to not lockout the chat/stickers during phase transitions and end of mission screens when they would be most beneficial to have.",1707904918,1707904918,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A wide array of playable characters and, even though the combat is fairly simple, each character is a different kind of joy to play. The voice acting is pretty good, story is decent (nothing groundbreaking), but seeing as I knew nothing about Granblue characters, and that this is the first breakout title away into this genre of games, I am definitely invested in future adventures.

In 69 hours, I have not crashed once. Only issue I have is sometimes the matchmaking gives me a ""Network Error,"" but it immediately allows me to re-queue (most of the time) so it's no love lost.

This scratches the itch of an MMO that doesn't include microtransactions and has reasonable farming methods. Co-op is kind of tied to the story, so you will have to generally beat the game in order to fully unlock all of the co-op, but it opens up the other 80% of the game once you do beat it.

The gameplay is good, music is great, story is pretty good too. The actual playing of the game is great.

Personally, I do not feel I got my money's worth.

I enjoy ARPGs, I enjoy character raising games. The problem I have is that there isn't any endgame content/replayability. ***There is no content for you to do with a maxed out character that you haven't ALREADY done with a weaker version of that same character.*** Fights that seemed hard the first time through become easy - you essentially stat check the bosses even BEFORE you even get your truly max level stuff (Terminus weapon, all sigils at 15 etc).

Not only do previous fights get stat checked - but the amount of grind that you will have to do to get a fully upgraded sigil set and weapon will leave you wondering ""Why am I here still? The fights are not hard, and there's nothing left for me to do with this gear"" so uh....

Game is super fun. Until you beat it. On the one hand, wow big surprise the game has an end oh no - but on the other, this game was marketed as having end game content. It does not - it has ""post main story content"". For what it is, the game is great. But don't make the mistake of thinking there is much actual end game to experience. There is going to be one more boss fight released in March(?) but after that, given comments from the devs, I don't expect that this game will have much more to offer.",1707887152,1707887152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- I hate the fact that steam players are more or less seen as ""secondary"" with PS5 getting all the benefits. If they just didn't do that, there wouldn't be any drama around that.

---------------
Well then, oh boy. This game got me real good. 127.5 hours in 2 weeks ... (holidays/days off)

Story: 8/10 
- took me around 13-14 hours to see credits
- took me around 20-23 hours to see the ""actual ending""
- It's a bit short if you ask me, they could've introduced the other characters in a better way

Gameplay: 9/10
- You can feel the platinum games dna here
- The characters actually play different enough
- Super amazing boss fights with raid mechanics
- Hype Boss fights in endgame that can be quite difficult early on
- Great progression system with Mastery (skilltree), Weapon upgrades and sigils (sockets/accessories type equipment)
- Great endgame with decent methods of obtaining good sigils and decent weapon upgrade in (current) late endgame.

Soundtrack: 10/10
- It's simply amazing and I'm not surprised, if they got the FF1-10 composer on board
- The themes with lyrics are straight up bangers
- Some bossfights got the best themes in gaming for me personally (managarmr)

Graphics: 10/10
- They absolutely nailed the artstyle/design
- The characters look amazing
- The visual effects, especially during boss fights is astonishingly good

PC Port: 8/10 (my personal experience)
- You can't play the game with a PS5 Dualsense controller (frequent disconnects and cutouts for inputs during gameplay
- One freeze during a cutscene quite late in the story (had to alt+F4)
- few disconnects during multiplayer sessions
- Great performance with stable fps, no matter what happens on screen (3080)
- No stutter
- very short loading times (SSD)

To be specific, I am unable to play the game. The game crashes after starting a new game. I've contacted Cygames support and they've given me a template reply that I should wait for their official announcement. Well, v1.0.4 patch announcement came for the day 1 patch. Unfortunately, the patch did not resolve my issue. After near two weeks of waiting for a patch that would resolve my issue, I am inclined to leave this review here.

[h1]The problem with the PC version[/h1]

Reading through the issues in the Steam forums, there are couple of notable issues that keep popping up.

[h2]Can't start the game[/h2]

First, is the inability to start the game. We're living in the age where computers can be really complex and have many various features and instruction sets that general average PC consumers don't really pay attention to. The minimum system requirements simply do not convey enough information. Intel Core i3-9100 was launched 2018, sporting 6M Cache and up to 4.20 GHz of clock speed. Where as Intel Core i7-10510Y was launched 2019, sporting 8M Cache and up to 4.50 GHz of clock speed (base 1.20 GHz though). Other than the clock speed, there is one key difference between the two. The newer one lacks AVX2 instruction set, which the game apparently needs. It is largely thanks to the community that figured this out. Second is a sudden guaranteed crash when the game is started after creating a save. Unfortunately, community has not yet manage to figure out the reason.

I find it is not reasonable to expect all PC gamers to know about the ins and outs of PC components. I would've given the developers a pass if there was a clear message on what's causing the players from unable to play the game. If an error like ""Game requires AVX2 instruction set to play"", ""Need more memory"" or ""DirectX version X is required to play"" is clearly conveyed somehow, then I believe it would've been harder to attribute the developers for ""bad port"" and it would give the players a clue to figure out the next steps to make the game playable. People didn't give Todd Howard's vagueness of ""upgrade your PC"" a slack for Starfield, I don't see a reason why anyone else should either for Granblue Fantasy Relink.

[h2]Controller stops working[/h2]

I witnessed this happening on a live stream. Controller suddenly stopped working and that requires a streamer to restart the game. The only time I've seen a controller to stop working suddenly was when I was messing around with Remote Play Together in another game, and that too happened intentionally. In normal gameplay, there is no reason for any connected functional controllers to suddenly stop working.

[h2]Random crashes during gameplay[/h2]

Based on the reports on Steam forums, crashes can happen unexpectedly. Can happen after the end of battle, from alt tabbing, during cutscenes, during Discord voice chat and etc. This forces the player to treat the game carefully and change their normal PC habit to accommodate the game. I've read case where someone's external application (Discord) crashed, because of this game. I believe this already speaks the quality of the software (not good).

[h2]Save corruption[/h2]

People have been reporting save corruption. I haven't found a thread to confirm does the same happen to PS4/PS5. There are some that have claimed that PS4/PS5 can experience the same save corruption. Due to the game design, you're only ever playing on one single save. On PC, I see no reason why games should be tied to one single save. Divinity: Original Sin 2, Trails into Reverie, Neptunia: Virtual Stars and even Tales of Arise provides more than just single save. Not only does it let players to go back in time for certain point of the game, but it also provides a convenient way to setup a backup save in case something goes wrong with their main save file. If the game has to operate on single save-design, there has to be measures to ensure the integrity of the save file. It was brutal for me to read how people were spending over 50 hours only to have all their efforts wiped clean.

[h1]Wrapping it up[/h1]

All in all, I wasn't able to play the game so I can't really comment on the core game itself. At first I wasn't planning to leave any review, but reading how the random crashes and save corruption was happening to other people, I felt I should at the very least write my thoughts on the quality of the software. It's a shame as I was looking forward to playing this game.

This game is more into quests and postgame more than the story, the developers said that the story has 20 hours of content but the post-game has 100+ hours of content, there are some characters I love playing as like the captain, and others, there are also other characters I want to see as DLC like Sandalphon, Feather, Tien/Esser and her brother Feower/Quatre, I still can't wait to play as Seofon though.

But let's just get to the point, is this game worth it? In my opinion, Yes, a 100 times yes, this game is worth it in my opinion, the 8 or 7 year wait was worth it in my opinion, I instantly bought it on launch and I just... love EVERYTHING about it, It's perfect, If you love Granblue Fantasy, or love Action RPGs that have intense post-game content, then this game is for you.

Don't worry if you're new to the series, the game is beginner friendly and the story is game-original.

While I haven't completed Proud Mode yet (stuck trying to get myself motivated to kill all those tedious duo fights), but I feel like I've seen everything the game has to offer.

[h3]The Start and the Story:[/h3]

It starts off really nice, then quickly shows that it's story is very run-of-the-mill ""Power of Friendship"", and more of the bosses just really hated you for playing a melee character. You start with a handful of characters, but can unlock more as you go, Unfortunately you can't test them out, so you are pretty committed. If you don't like their gamefeel, not really much you can do about it.

The Japanese Voice Acting is really solid with some recognisable names popping up here and there, but unfortunately the English Voice Acting lacks direction, and feels like there isn't much emotion. The subtitles are also an issue. This game uses a ton of tropes, and to hear them and not have the subtitles match is fairly jarring. It's one of those ""close but important context is lost"" situations.

[h3]Combat and Issues:[/h3]

Whether it was things flying around above you where you can only hit with a terrible air ""combo"", or bosses that cleaved around themselves in melee range while not interacting with any ranged at all outside of one attack, Some fights generate pockets of wind that push or pull you, once again making melee a nightmare where ranged aren't affect to nearly the same degree. This is an issue as a lot of characters have combo's that need to be done in order to access a lot of their power. After a while this just becomes massively frustrating, while ranged is so easy that it's boring.

Unfortunately this compounds into the ""post-story"" which technically is still the story mode exists for a good while as you are introduced to Very Hard, Extreme, and Maniac difficulty quests. These put you against the same bosses and enemies you have already faced just with more stats and occasionally a new attack. The same issues still apply and are often compounded. And it only gets worse when two bosses show up at the same time.

Additionally, some bosses have DPS checks, and these are absolutely insane compared to what you are asked of in general. If you can make these DPS checks, then the ""Clear within X minutes"" goal is completely meaningless as clearing the DPS check will mean that you are capable of clearing the fight well before that time. It's a very, very, weird feeling to easily be able to clear the fight within the ""challenge"" time, but not make the DPS check.

Fortunately your AI companions can pull their own for a large portion of the game, given they are properly equipped and levelled. Do not neglect them. They fall off later on in Proud Mode, but that's a mode reserved for just pure suffering. Also, you can't really control what they do when, so if you want to save your abilities for a big burst phase....not much you can do. This will only apply in Proud Mode though. Again, Proud isn't fun, it's just pain.

[h3]Postgame[/h3]

The endgame very much consists of very little but endless grinding for items to make other items that will be replaced by other items to make big numbers go bigger. It's like Monster Hunter, if you were only hunting the same monster you were fighting at the start of the game. Fighting eventually becomes very dull, and using other characters for variety is really hard as you then have to level them as well, which means more grinding.

It is a MASSIVE time investment, for something that at the moment doesn't stand to do much. Builds are fairly set with only a few places for deviation, unfortunately these builds rely on a pure RNG nightmare. You will grind countless hours for a chance to maybe get an upgrade. It's....a lot of time to invest. You are going to want to get these if you are any form of serious about endgame as it's a VERY large increase is potency. From where I started in Proud Mode to where I currently am, my output has more than doubled, and I am no where close to that end point. 

[h3]Concerns Going Forward[/h3]

My biggest concern is what comes in future. As new content is added I am left with a question. Wiil the devs balance for the endgame players that can melt things and leave the majority to feel like they have to do that insane grind, or will they balance it around a logical ""next step"", and have the encounter just get melted?

The difference in potency is extreme.  

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

This game is beautiful, but it's also a mess. It's great for pure grinders and people that like gacha mechanics without the micro-transaction, but if you aren't interested in doing the same thing, fighting the same fights, doing transmutations thousands of times one transmute at a time only to turn it back into tickets to buy more transmutes to turn back into tickets over and over, there isn't much to offer past the final story bit. Maybe in April this will change, and will be the only reason that I will still keep playing.",1706997727,1707851093,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It has quickly skyrocketed to my all time favorite game. The gameplay in this game is extremely well made. It can be really tight or it can be really casual depending on which character you choose and how you build your character, there's a ton of customization and a lot of characters to choose from. The story in this game doesn't do anything unique, but it's presented incredibly well. It's well paced and has amazing cinematics along with an outstanding soundtrack(Which by the way, you can listen to the entire soundtrack in the in-game journal) that brings it all together. The graphics are also pretty in this game and while the art style of the characters may not be for everyone, I greatly enjoy them. There's a ton of post game content to explore once you've finished the game as well which continues to become harder and harder as you progress, but in no way does it ever feel cheap. The only complaint I have about this game is the online matchmaking can be really spotty at times and if and when that's ever fixed I would go so far as to call this game perfect.

For now
Overall for how much I've played I have greatly enjoyed my time. There are minor issues like way too many cutscenes in the story part of the game though I can be forgiving for how beautiful the game is overall. When I first heard about how long this game was in dev hell I was worried because games tend to lose themselves to the trends over the years of development and become a mess but with this game it held on to its core of being a very deep well designed horde and boss combat game with a decent story mode that though I probably would not like to play that part again could enjoy for how it acts as an important tutorial to the later part of the game.

For the future
Also I can say this will be a game I Will often revisit because at the time of writing this they are currently planning on adding more bosses and events to the game to keep it fresh well in to the future as well as new characters to try all of which will be free at least for the current roadmap.

For those on the edge
I will say this game is not for everybody it has simple systems overall but incredible depth its a game that will eat up a decent chunk of time to learn and master but is well worth it and you can tell much of it was a work of love and that the devs cared what they were making every character is well designed and fun to play and has unique gameplay for ever persons taste or style my current favourite being Vaseraga who can just say no to dying and is slow like grandma but hits like a meteor. if its on sale you for sure should pick it up but at least for me full price is still worth it for the amount of time and fun I've had already.

I hope that this has helped in some way and hope to see you in game soon.",1707823489,1707823489,True,522,20,0.860400021076202393,0,True,False,False

So having played/watched those, I already knew I'd enjoy this games setting. I originally played this games demo on PS5, then debated between PC and PS5 for my purchase. I saw the ""jank"" comments about it on PC which made me hesitate, but I really didn't like PS5 being 4k @ 30fps when I knew my PC could do better. There are cons on PC, but it doesn't apply to everyone! Setup is 3440x1440 monitor, RTX 3080, R7 5800x, 32GB RAM

This game absolutely reeks of Final Fantasy aesthetic and for good reason - it's the same art director who did FF6 and FF9! It has airships, and summons, and materia (sigils), and anime tropes, etc. so if you're an FF fan, this game is definitely something you need to check out.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
- Smooth 120fps @ 1440p ultra settings. Haven't seen any dips. Makes the combat feel much better.
- Gameplay is addicting and responsive. The combat is simple enough for anyone to enjoy but it has decent RPG building aspects with materia/sigils.
- Boss battles feel like they came from FFXIV due to the ground markers. Hell, I've already encounted divebomb mechanics from one primal beast fight.
- Lots of characters to choose from that you can play as, all with different fighting styles.
- Story is okay and feels campy. I enjoy the camp, but I can understand some people cringing at it.
- Voice acting in JP and EN is excellent. Normally I play JRPG in JP, but I'm enjoying this one in EN.
- Animation is beautifully cel-shaded but 3D with no weird stretchiness that some of these games get. Textures are all high quality.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
- Forced resolutions. I'm on an ultrawide 3440x1440p, and have black bars on the sides. I've been on this aspect ratio for a long time so I'm used to it, but that doesn't make it okay. Mods can fix it, but wish the devs would officially support 21:9.
- DualSense/PS5 controller support is bad. Very bad. Going into the menu at a Hollowed Ground will ALWAYS make the PS5 controller stop working. Sometimes it happens between other menus or loading screens. Luckily, this is fixable:
------> Disable PS5 Controller support in Steam completely and enable Xbox support. Use DS4Windows+HidHide and emulate it as Xbox controller. Fixed every controller problem I had.

If you don't have an ultrawide monitor, and don't plan to play on a PS5 controller, these cons don't exist for you. :)",1707822529,1707822876,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Combat is great (better than ToA and FF remake for example, with great character depth - much closer to Monster Hunter or DMC etc.), and the boss fights are exciting and well done. Game looks great, especially in motion. Developers are to be congratulated for delivering a game that actually works at launch and sustains high framerates etc.

- Characters, designs, plot, music extremely formulaic. Lots of people moaned about the VA but it's actually fine, if a little annoying (damn these guys like to chat during combat). Some finicky technical issues (no ultrawide, HDR or auto HDR, although fixable with mods/third party programs)

I decided to leave it negative for now, because I believe that like me, no one reads positive reviews. I will leave this positive review in the future.

I want to start by saying that this game is worth it simply because of the combat gameplay, there's not much to say, it's almost perfect. I say almost perfect because there are certain mechanics in this game that make it... disheartening.

Before continuing, I want to clarify that I have 116 hours of play at the time of writing this review, I have almost all the rare sigils of the game and at the moment I'm farming the last boss in order to get all the weapons in the game.

Build characters / Damage mechanics cap
If you played a good part of the game, you know that this game has damage caps assigned to different characters.
It's difficult to choose the words to describe what I feel about this mechanic, theoretically it's a good idea, as it tries to bring the balance in the game but it was simply poorly implemented.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, imagine that your favorite character's damage cap is 100,000, there will come a time in the game when you will have to farm sigils that allow you to increase your damage cap limit, making it reach 200,000 , 250,000 for example. Understand that it's not difficult to increase your limit, it's just very annoying.

Understand that, in the end game, every character of yours will reach the damage cap easily, making many of the sigils that should be interesting to build useless, such as Break Assassin, Overdrive Assassin.

The damage cap affects ""slow hard hit"" characters like Io/siegfried/ghandagoza/vaseraga much more than others. In addition, this mechanic makes characters damage buffs useless.

Boss loop:
Don't get me wrong, I like farming bosses in RPG games, the problem is when I have to do it more than 100 times, especially in a game that has more or less 15 bosses (some of which have elemental variations, but in general they are the same). I don't understand why Japanese games do so many re-skins.

Party roles:
Don't build tank, it's useless, many of the bosses hit a wide area, although it's focused on the tank, it will hit your team members.
Do not build support. It's useless, attack buffs are useless (blame the damage cap).

Anyway, there are many other minor problems that it is not worth mentioning each one.

is it worth playing? yes of course, go ahead.",1707814340,1707814340,False,3,3,0.429003000259399414,0,True,False,False

Can't say much for the story as I skipped it but the game play is very fun and has stuff to grind towards while being able to queue up fast with others.

The graphics are gorgeous and Granblue's fantastic character design, music, and art are all present in full force.  However, it utterly fails at being a capable standalone action game.  Much like its mobile browser game origins, it values weapon and character stats over any kind of skill or execution on the player's part, and enemies are designed with spectacle in mind rather than being fun for a player to fight.  Every single boss has a 15 to 45 second long super attack sequence in which the player can do nothing but wait for it to finish, and they will all do this multiple times per fight if given the chance.  Visual effects, both from the player characters and enemies, are so pervasive that it can be difficult to even tell what's going on.  The camera will constantly try to wrest control from the player to force you to look at what it wants, and the lock on is clunky and disruptive.

The story is bland at best, and annoying at worst, and the English localization does it no favors.  Having played the Granblue mobile game for a few years, Relink's English dialogue is wildly out of touch with the setting's established tone, featuring a lot of punched up, quippy writing that is simply not present in Japanese.  A whole lot of ""He/She/They would not fucking say that"" listening to the English voice acting.

Perhaps most frustratingly, Relink expects you to grind purely for the sake of grinding.  The main story and character sidestories can all be completed by level 60 or so, but character and weapon levels cap at 150.  The game's prolonged and repetitive post-game exists solely to make you do the same content you've already done but with massively inflated stat requirements with no real incentive to do so.  Character progression is agonizingly slow as the costs for even marginal stat improvements grows exponentially as levels get higher, and in some cases require randomized stat rolls costing massive amounts of in-game resources per attempt.

If you like tedious soul numbing grinds with no actual reward or incentive, maybe Relink will scratch the itch.  Otherwise wait for a heavy discount and put it away once the main story is done.",1707812187,1707812187,False,1,1,0.498704671859741211,0,True,False,False

Graphics: Real good. No complaints here.

There's nothing really wrong with the story(other than being an 'C' average story turned up to 10 in a good way) and the music is great for like a grand total of 3-4 fights however;

20 hour mandatory SOLO-ONLY story with about another 5-12 hours of more pointless missions with the worst matchmaking that can take anywhere between 2-10 minutes to match with people that will be cleared under 2 minutes. It took almost 40 hours to get to the final mission of proud and by then there's no real challenge at any point except for maybe 2-3 fights.

You will battle the camera / targeting system twice as much as the actual bosses they throw at you because it's a completely non-functioning system that makes the game more difficult for no reason.

Endgame is an absurd and pointless RNG grind with arbitrary damage caps per character, with RNG Terminus weapon drops on the final boss that unlocks your damage cap even further. Because the devs can't actually balance endgame DPS #s, they lock your damage potential behind MANDATORY sigils that limit your builds as much as 8-9 out of your 12 total slots. Build diversity is a completely limited by (4x)Damage Cap V , War elemental , class sigil+, (2x)Supplementary damage V, Crit Chance V, EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER WILL BUILD ALL OF THESE with several minor exceptions.

To top all this nonsense off there's actually optimal strats for you to literally turn on assisted mode and full afk your game for 20 hours farming materials like Silver Centrum so you can max out equipment.

So you're actually incentivised to not even play the game and to treat it like an idle game and get all your materials that way too.

GBF Relink is a solid Anime ARPG/JRPG that seems to feels like MHW mixed with Genshin while bearing some influences from others like FFXVI and Nier Automata. Despite it's flaws, it offers is a good and tight, if a bit predictable, ~15h of main story along with a somewhat solid end-game content and replayability, playing Cygames's other games and watching the GBF anime def help gives proper context and insight on parts of the story and references, but overall, it is still quite friendly for a newcomer as well (I'm being one of them)

The game has:
+ One of the best graphic for an anime games IMO (IDK why anime games seems to love sticking with low res textures and low poly models... considering how far hardware has progressed)
+ smooth performance, it even runs on steam deck
+ Good story and amazing characters, though it is to be expected considering the franchise
+ Fun and solid gameplay, imagine fighting MHW bosses with characters that can move and attack at the pace of Genshin Characters
+ Each character comes with a somewhat unique weapon, and therefore gameplay, which gives you more variety in how you approach your game
+ improving ideas that they ""took"" from other franchises, for example: all the characters that you've met / in your roster can spawn in the actual game world (staring at you hard, GENSHIN, TF you mean characters only shows up on events/quests), there's also [spoiler] the primal battles which are basically ikon battles from FFXVI [/spoiler]
+ Good AI companions that are actually useful and doesn't hinder your missions, even toward the end-game contents

But it is by no means flawless:
- UI and menu control are obviously very controller-centric, this game is just a straight port from the console version, a good and stable one, but not a full PC port
- Some of the mechanic that they pulled straight from their mobile games doesn't really fit people that would play on PC (Fate episodes anyone?)
- A lot of reused assets, was expecting more variations and unique stuffs considering how big the company/franchise that's behind it and how much the game cost
- The camera has a mind of its own at times, which is annoying
- Very rigid world design with plenty of use of invisible borders, as an avid open world game enjoyer, I really don't like the fact that they used so much invisible barriers to block your progression instead of clever world designs, though this is also nothing new in anime games...
- Despite having a variety of characters, the story seems to only revolve around the main party, which does break immersion abit (it's like -talking to zhongli in Genshin, as zhongli- kind of immersion breaking)

Overall though, despite all the flaws that I've listed, they don't really affect the overall satisfying experience that I had with the game, but rather mostly minor complaints, nitpicks, and constructive criticism, I think that the game delivers a great base experience that can certainly be expanded down the line with Expansions, DLCs, seasonal events and updates, just like MHW did, which I hope the company would do!

While this game's story is as generic as any anime adventure plot can be, the battles are flashy, fast-paced, exciting, and enjoyable. It encourages cooperation between each characters and it rewards you for it with cinematic moves and thousands of damage numbers flooding your screen. Let's not forget the AI here are often smarter than most human players as they know how each boss mechanic works and will do what they need to do to not die.

I've spent almost 30-40 hrs in story alone, mainly because I didn't want to miss out on loots, lore, and levels. And only then did I get to ""play the actual game"" when I unlocked all the difficulty levels and started playing online coop. The online community is also quite nice, but most of all, efficient as to this day I have yet to play with anyone who was intentionally a burden or has caused our mission to fail.

You get the full game experience as you should for its price tag. But even then I've enjoyed this so much I'm willing to spend more for mere cosmetics if ever they plan to release some in the future. The only downside I see in this game as of the moment is it's rather demanding requirement as it crashes or lags heavily on mid to low end PCs, which prevents some of my friends from joining us. I will edit this part in the future should this get patched.

I'm not an absolutely huge Granblue fan and I don't have the free time or mental energy to get bent out of shape over subpar-but-passable translations (though highschool or college past me would have thrown a fit). I found the voice acting and script mostly enjoyable, though there were definitely some spots where it was obvious the English script writers took some liberties they definitely should not have (mainly bad puns). If modern day slang in fantasy settings bugs you, you probably won't like the translations here. Another downside about the writing is that the unlockable characters, because of their absence from cutscenes, feel kind of out of place when they interact with the crew during dungeons. Like ""Uh... Have you been here this whole time?""

The characters all seem well designed and have their own gimmicks so they all feel satisfyingly different from each other. Bosses are well designed and most of them feel just right; not too long, not too short, not too hard, not too easy. However, one downside is that you basically have to commit to a single character. You don't really get the resources to level more than one (though I guess this may change in post game with adequate grinding). The reasonable ability to build up enough characters to round out a 4 man party would have been nice.

Performance-wise, I'm running a build WAY under the recommended settings and its running on high settings at 60fps with slight occasional slowdowns in cities. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and everything looks fantastic. Outside of the one cutscene crash in chapter 1 that I had to change to Windowed mode to get past, I haven't encountered any bugs or issues.

In short, visuals and OST were beautiful. The game runs smoothly under minimum requirements. The gameplay is fun. The story is good but not quite great. The voice acting and dialogue are hit or miss depending on how much of a translation purist you are. Being pigeonholed into committing to a single character from early in the game kind of sucked.

I thought at first it was gonna be a Final Fantasy rip off till I got to the other primeval beasts and they are all different and unique. I thoroughly enjoyed the surprise of finding out the first primeval wasnt going to be Garuda. The online potion is a quest board mission system with short missions basically to farm for sigils and materials but they are fun, they got different modes like bosses, survival, hoards, ect. Each mission feels unique enough and the rewards are something to look forward too. If you guy's are wondering there is a battlepass system I sadly don't agree with not every game needs one but since the devs made mention they will not be adding any micro transactions they do need to monetize in some way I suppose. All in all this game is 100% worth the buy and play I would recommend it after beating it myself. I hope you guy's enjoy it as much as I have!",1707787055,1707787217,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is fun, runs fine, looks pretty standard. Will have to do a deeper dive to see if it's worth the money really. On the surface after finishing all the Normal level quests, it seems like it has potential to have a very interesting coop endgame.

Edit : Made it to endgame with Siegfried. It's pretty good, it has a long way to go as far as matching Monster Hunter, which is really what it feels like it's trying to capture via the sigil system and emphasis on replaying missions. I would like to see more missions, the end of Proud mode felt very rushed. A good example is one of the monsters you fight near the end, who has just one fight and no variations or alternate buffed version. For now, there isn't much to do after you max out your last weapon -- it left me feeling very powerful with not much to do with that power, if that makes sense.

In a year that's already stacked from the beginning for JRPG's (Persona 3 Reload, Like a Dragon 8), and with upcoming games like Dragon's Dogma 2, my wallet is already crying. And don't get me started with how good Tekken 8 and Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising ended up being. 

So I decided to check this game out, because I like the combat from games like ""Tales of..."" and Ys 8. I'm still at the start, and while the story is just there for things to get rolling, the combat system is satisfying and flashy. The scenery is gorgeous, the music mesmerizing, and the combat simple but fun! 

Edit: 15 hours later retrospective: The most fun action RPG I've played since Ys 8 and Tales of Arise. Story is akin to a ""One Piece/Dragon Ball movie"", but it just exists so you can fight epic bosses, and visit a variety of locations.

Except it doesn't have gacha, mtx and time-gated garbage that relies on player FOMO for retention and plays like a complete game from start to finish, with some great endgame content to uncover. 19 characters at launch, all of them are fun to play.

The game is divided into a story mode that takes place in ""semi"" open areas (mostly linear though), much like an adventure game and quests that play like Monster Hunter games. It's a very grindy game, so if the combat and characters are not your thing, then don't bother.

Not much to write anything more about other than this is some of the most addicting, grindy fun I've had in a videogame in years. It's a VERY solid game overall and it delivered exactly what I expected (it even exceeded at the combat department) Let's see how the upcoming content fares.

You always liked these types of dynamic action games that focuses on character growth but are filled with gacha to r*** your wallet? Granblue Fantasy Relink covers all of this. And I hope it sends shockwaves through the industry (this game is performing really well so there's some optimism to be had) so more games like this that can be made and compete against the gacha stupidity that the eastern market loves to shit and show that gacha is just a psychological trick to scam people and shouldn't exist at all (look at Megaman Offline from Capcom, it's doing great without all the gacha crap).

The concise yet engaging plot propels me on a quest to save the world alongside a diverse cast of characters, each with their own compelling journey.

The game-play earns a perfect 10, offering an astonishing variety of ways to play that I find simply unbelievable. The dynamic real-time combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving keep every moment exhilarating, making it a truly immersive experience.

Progression gets an 8 from me, with a heads-up for those planning to dive into the late game. While the system is well-structured, there's some grind involved for those aiming for extreme levels of mastery. But, if you're ready to invest the time, the payoff is worth it.

The cinematic experience is an absolute standout, earning a perfect 10 in my rating. The game's cut-scenes and cinematic sequences are breathtaking, seamlessly blending with the narrative to create an immersive and visually stunning adventure. Every moment feels like a carefully crafted masterpiece, enhancing the overall enjoyment and making the storytelling truly memorable. 

Granblue Fantasy Relink is a game where the story's potential for anime and manga enthusiasts, diverse gameplay options, and the challenge of late-game progression combine to create a thoroughly enjoyable and rewarding experience.

Last update addressing some of the known issues was 2/3/24. Those issues remain, and have not been fixed if you go to the comments section. The issue with controllers randomly disconnecting in the UI menus have not been addressed or fixed yet. You have to navigate menus with keyboard/mouse, and play with controller. No game I have ever played in my life has had this problem. Also, I'd like to add that anytime this happens you're forced to shutdown steam through task manager. The game will remain open and running even after you return to desktop via in game menu. FIX the game! I want to add the good things with the game, but Cygames isn't getting a free pass from me for failing to do their job and make sure the PC version is fully functional. 


Original:
“The developers recommend playing this game with a controller.” Well, funny enough that’s what I attempted to do. Worked perfectly fine until I reached the main hub to accept quests. Now, opening any menus in town causes the controller to lose functionality, and will occasionally send those inputs repeated if you are patient enough to watch paint dry. Just for that I’m leaving a thumbs down for bad functionality. It’s unacceptable even if it is launch day. Fix the issue, and I’ll fix my review.

I'm writing this review immediately after collecting all of the achievements— but I haven't nearly exhausted all of the content and fun to be had in this game.

Relink is a triumph. A game that moves players between impressive setpieces while slowly unfurling the breadth of its mechanics and systems and telling a tropey, but ultimately compelling and sincere story. And after you've spent 10-15 hours playing through that story, the game opens up like a bottomless pit, threatening to swallow certain types of gamers whole. I am, fortunately, one of those types, and Relink's post-game content has been a wonderful climb through a shocking amount of vertical and horizontal progression, new bossfights not featured in the story, and good challenges with equally good rewards. 

The easiest comparison is Monster Hunter; hunt stuff to get parts to make a better sword to use to hunt stronger stuff. But the systems in place go deeper than that, feeling similar to those you'd find in a gacha game, but balanced for a full-price title. And the progression does feel fair and expeditious; despite spending almost 140 hours already, I don't feel that my time has been wasted with pointless tedium. As the phrase goes, this game is firing on all cylinders, brimming with intelligent and considerate design, even long after the credits have rolled. I love this game to death, and I think anyone that enjoys action games will too. It's not perfect, no game is, but so far the flaws have not ruined my enjoyment of this game that apparently took eight years to make.

TLDR = JRPG Monster hunter-esque with fluid combat. One of the Best 3D Action JRPG I've played so far gameplay-wise
Solid Game for the price.

Pros:
- Gameplay system is polished (From Fighting systems to Character systems), 
  (Only gripe is the quick quest system design and DMG cap design)
- Great boss encounters, attack patterns and mechanics
- Multiplayer working well (Good netcode with client side calculation for dmg)
- Support for variety of playstyles via different characters with unique mechanics with their techs
Example of playstyles: Mage Dps , Range Dps , Support Dps, Fast Attackers, Slow Attackers, Stunners
- AI Companions if you wish to tackle content solo
- No performance issues encountered
- Majority of the game is voice acted
- Nice Osts and Sound Design (Other than the Sierokarte repeated lines during transmuting..)

Neutral:
- Story Content
- Skill Tree  (I do prefer specialization tree rather than just a grab all skill tree. Feels pointless other than just linear progression)
- Grindy gameplay Loop (Alleviated with AFK farming i guess but definitely not my thing)

Cons:
- Camera Controls can be wonky even with everything disabled (Quite annoying in Duo/Triple Boss fights)
- Lack of builds variety since everyone is optimally just pushing for DPS in the endgame.
- No crossplatform

Looking forward to see what the postgame updates will be like.

Launch day issues have looked to be mostly fixed with minimal bugs and crashes now, credit to the devs for a making haste with updates.

This is basically super anime Monster Hunter.

Combat is fluid and extremely satisfyingly, feels great on control and K+M.

Mission/Boss difficulty has a steady curve the further you progress into endgame, new fights can seem extremely challenging at 1st but with character optimization and learning the few patterns for each fight eventually the hardest bosses become farm-able and a blast to fight!

Imo worth the $60 price tag as there is hundreds if not thousand+ hours of content depends on how far you want to take the game, no in your face micro-transaction shop, and free post launch bosses and characters to come. 

Little to complain about given the trash we get from other companies for $60-70 price tag now a days, this is a complete game as is with more to come though free DLC soon.",1706917199,1707749038,True,0,0,0.449333757162094116,0,True,False,False

Once unlocking Proud missions, the last difficulty setting of the game at the moment, you'll be tasked with clearing all of them, all while attempting to ascend your weapons.

Ascending your weapons not only will take a considerable amount of grinding for materials, you will also need to complete character specific achievements to be able to ascend it higher. For example, one of those gates is performing 30 Skybound Arts playing AS the character. So if you're trying to get a full party up in power, you'll be here for a while. The most optimal way of progression would be finding parties online as it will help you focus on just one character.

While you are TIRELESSLY farming to maxing out your ascension weapon, at one point you will face the very last mission of the game, home of the Terminus weapons. But you might be thinking: ""Wow! I beat it! I can get my weapon!""

Clearing this mission gives you a CHANCE to drop A weapon according to your current available character roster. A CHANCE.

Fast forward - you've now upgraded your Terminus weapon to 150. You've +99 mirage munitioned it. You've ascended it once. TWICE. +5! +10! YOU DID IT! YOU HAVE THE BEST WEAPON IN THE GAME!

Lemme just address some of the ways I find this game to be inadequate. I do play with a mouse and keyboard so I will be referencing controls with that.

Combat
Game has the left button for your basic combo and your right to finish a combo. Really could have changed it to light and heavy and had different combos based on it. Game just doesn't and it feels lacking. Could have had more combos and variety in attacks. Dodging and Guarding might as well be the same thing as there is never an incentive to choose one over the other. Game could have solved this by having undodgeable attacks and unguardable attacks. I know some bosses have like a AOE to make you guard but how they design it is that you shouldn't be needing to do that if you were behind the blocks of ice we placed. It's also usually death if that does happen. Dying is too generous, I don't like the critical bar you have, it incentives more recklessness than observation ""eh I still have 10 more lives I'll be fine if I just die here"". And along with this the party AI is way to competent at prioritising you to heal but that's not a negative just feels like it caters too much to you.

Now I did go back to relink in the middle of writing this review to see if playing without party members was fun. It's not. Bosses aren't scaled to members in a party but just to a max party. And why can I just not play as the Captain or have her in my party. I don't like her move set and I don't want her in my party. I am just talking about the Story quests. So far I have no incentive to play the hub quests unless it's for a crewmate ticket which I will hoard until I finish the game because I don't want to farm for all that MP (mastery points). They unlock crewmates based on progress (which is good) and there's no reason for me to unlock more crewmates unless I want to suffer later grinding (which I don't link).

Why is Bahamut here, why can I not just use him as a summon for battle like FF7 or a poundmate from Yakuza. If you're going to make him destroy 3 wyverns in the beginning surely I can use him to destroy a couple of goblins right?

Can't tell what happens in a battle half the time. Can I like, just turn off the flashy effects, I like being able to see and not be blind. Why does it say I can break parts off monsters on Eugen (or was it Rakham) but never actually works. Do weakpoints even exist, I can't tell because my damage doesn't change color.

Story
It's boring. I understand this is meant to be accessible to a wide audience but at the same time a story written by adults should definitely have more depth than ""oh shit evil people from nowhere, now my princess is gone, time to go rescue her, ah fuck man I keep losing to these people time to keep chasing them because they literally cannot kill me, etc"". Not going to go more indepth because for those who haven't played the game it's very surface level, lacks tension and makes me question my sanity, confronted with these things they call Skyfarers (And from what I understand, aren't they suppose to be big shot adventurers who can fight primeval beasts). Also Lyria, WHY THE FUCK DID YOU SUMMON BAHAMUT TO FUCKING DECIMATE 3 WYVERNS, NO SERIOUSLY WHY-. I'm still mad about that. Also why are we trying to find a way to sever the life link, she is suppose to be our waifu... right? It's feels like I'm finding divorce papers. And Id literally went, she's first woman who was nice to me besides mom and now I must knight her, bro you are like the strongest knight here why are you like this. But either way, I just hate a very simple story. The fact that this takes 10 or 20 hours shouldn't be the case. This is just a giant goose chase.

Crafting
Why the fuck is this so barebones. What's even the point of making weapons if the only thing you are going to do is change stats and add a different unique effect like ""does more stun damage"" and tell me that I can collect 6 weapons only. 
Could have made this into a bucket system with randomised stats for weapons with more different cosmetics. Why does Siero just give me items can I not just make it myself? Why does Siero only stock three categories in her shop? Why can't I have two of the same weapon with different augmentations (wrightstones). I wouldn't do that because that's a pain but maybe others would like that. 

World
Why do you just have several locked chests in the beginning of the game in the hub that I can't unlock until much later? Like it's not because you're not skilled enough or you haven't been able to get a key from a mob drop but just a ""no come back later when you've done enough story and open them all"".

I actually wanted to learn more of the life of the people and ecology in the Ice lands (not because I saw a hot animal eared mommy) but that's just not a thing. Like what crackhead decided to live next to Furycane shrine. But it's all just, yep they exists. 

Overall, despite it being a game that actually works and isn't filled with bugs (aside from the people not being able to launch the game and crashing) it sucks. Cannot recommend it just due to a lack of depth.

[Mild Spoilers]
The games story starts you off at the mid-point of the mc's overall story, your crew mates have already joined you and there is already a bond between them, so for you there is no attachment to the mc or any of the crew mates [except for 1 but he joins late], you can unlock more crew members with a crew card but these crew members have also already joined you in the past before we join the story so there is no real attachment to them either.

The story itself is ''been there done that'' if you have played other jrpg types then this storyline is something you have experienced before..just more lazily done [the only cutscenes you will ever see are to do with msq and nothing else].

The gameplay is good, it has a monster hunter vibe to it in which you go to a quest counter, choose one then press ready when you are ready, the game is not open world or anything you can only explore within the mission area [some missions areas are large]. the combat is also good, there is no mana or stamina, you just hack and slash until your arms fall off, which i found to be fun.

TDLR: if you are looking for a story rich experience where you laugh and cry with the mc, this is not it.

I will say, this game is my favorite game yet in 2023-2024. As a player who specializes on FPS Shooters, I will say I enjoy the game a lot. The grinding is a lot and have some cute anime girls in it, my fav is Cagliostro... don't judge me. As a person who got extremely disappointed with Gensh*t, this game is definitely leagues better than that game. Definitely requires way more skill to play compared to Gensh*t. 

The best part of this game that it is not a gacha game, so not much ""immoral"" practices of draining your wallets out for a chance to get a character. Definitely a money worth  and I am willing to spend money on DLC where you are guaranteed to get certain characters, and doesn't require you to slave everyday (but you can do so, because I did). I am hoping that they plan to add more characters from CyGames universe (Please Kasumi Kirihara... please come home...), and hoping this game will last years to come by them adding DLCs.

For context, I play very limited amount of RPG games. The RPG games I have played and enjoyed are Monster Hunter World & Rise and Pokemon (already stopped playing). I played a couple of gacha games (Gensh*t & Arknights) and was fan of Princess Connect from CyGames. Just a big fan of their character designs over most other franchises so far.

For me, it is worth to get the full price tag (it is cheaper at my place because regional pricing). But if you do not want to dish out as much money, wait for it to go on sale (I doubt it will come any time soon though). I am planning to support game companies that support good practices like selling premium games and having DLCs to add more extra stuff like cosmetics and more story/game modes.

Gameplay-wise I would say this game sits somewhere between PSO2 and Monster Hunter.  The game feels less rigid and more forgiving than Monster Hunter as you are free to use the dodge or guard button to cancel out of a lot of attacks.  You also have dedicated buttons for your character's skills rather than the MH approach of making them combo based.  A lot of characters also have parry or counter moves that reward skillful play in various ways.  The game also employs a stagger system where you can create your own openings by staggering bosses and eventually stunning them for about 10 seconds or so.  When you counter a boss into a stagger and then knock them into a stun?   It feels SO goooood!   The hit feedback in this game is so CRUNCHY.  I love it SO much!

I found the story, while short (roughly 10-15 hours), to be very enjoyable thanks to the excellent, highly entertaining, very cinematic boss fights.  The game doesn't end after you beat the story though.  There's an additional post game story chapter with more bosses and more difficult versions of what you fought during the story and there's even harder stuff after you're done with that.  All the while collecting stronger equipment and materials to upgrade your characters.

That's the other neat thing this game does.  It gives you a roster of around 20 characters and lets you make a party of any 4 you want.  They're also all playable, fully featured characters each with their own gimmicks and distinct playstyle.  It was hard to choose what 4 characters to build first because every single one of them seems cool and interesting.  The AI itself for your party members is also very good.  I find myself getting outscored by the AI when I play badly.  Coop and matchmaking is also available for non-story quests too if you'd rather run with other players instead.

There is also a complete lack of live service features, and micro-transactions.  You pay once and get the whole game with no restrictions.

I fully believe this will go on to be one of the most fun ARPGs released this year.  I hope Relink gets a big expansion because I am 100% willing to pay for more of this game.",1707716907,1707716907,True,112,0,0.874271094799041748,0,True,False,False

Main negative is that there aren't enough monsters to fight and the matchmaking can be a little awkward (like let me move around when I am searching for a match wtf).

Deep character building
Fun boss battles

Fantastic combat mechanics

It also has an emphasis on grinding which I enjoy in a jrpg but not everyone may

If you don't mind the 20 hours farming, you can actually find some fun. I hate how they baited me into doing some grinding quests, making it look like it's only a couple of quests, but then they add more and more with no end in sight. This turned into a full time job and a hate / love relationship with the game. It could be so much fun, but no, they had to artificially increase the game length.

The cities in this game look amazing (composition, detail) and they are filled with so much life. Spells (or VFX in general) look incredible, too. Comes at a cost though. Framerate is all over the place (RTX 3060, 2560x1440 , 28 - 120  fps (120 locked, no vsync), mostly averaging 60 fps. In fights, you might die, because there is just too much stuff happening.

Outside the cities, the level design is completely trash.
The first level is okay.
But then you get a level that is timed traversal with multiple paths that can lead to treasures, but there is no way to tell which one will lead to the treasure. It's a coin flip and if you are wrong, you have to suicide.
The next level has a ""challenge"" that would take 20 minutes to beat a certain enemy, because your stats are not good enough. This ruined the game, because since that moment, I never tried a challenge again, even though some of the later challenges were easier.
The level after that is just one huge area with a bunch of treasures etc., have fun running around aimlessly collecting treasures. I tried finding everything, but still had to look up a guide later.

The combat is smooth and looks incredible, too. With parry and dodge at the same time, I rarely lose health. However, most of the time you play your character and go into auto-pilot mode. Without knowing boss patterns, it's easy to get greedy and keep hitting, until you get 1 shot. Hard to judge if the game forces you into grind mode and rarely wants you to actually block / dodge. Most of the time you can keep attacking until a cutscene plays, then you have to run and wait.

(I played the main character who is okay with all the buffs. I then switched to Yodarha and he is fun. Then tried Io, was fun, too. Rackam got stale pretty fast. This was my main party. After the credit screen, I put some effort to upgrading Eugen. He was quite boring, but all my points were spend on him already. In the end, a waste of time. To play with another character, I would need to do like 3 boring grind fests to play another character. Which is a big letdown)

Upgrading everything is hell. It takes at least 10 minutes, to read some background stuff about your character (which gives you stat boosts like 15% or something, hard to pass), buy new weapons, upgrade weapons, check sigils, upgrade masteries (offense, defense, x). And now all this again for the other characters.
The mastery tree is a waste of time, there is no variety, you will skill everything anyway, so what's the point? You could as well get these stats when leveling up your character.
Also, why did the game never tell me that the weapons I don't equip can still give me their mastery upgrades? That's massive if you look at the 3k HP weapons that everybody seems to have and that comes from just 1 weapon.

Story is meh, I screamed at my screen when certain characters acted questionable.

Tons of stuff to grind, but can become repetitive for those who aren't into fighting similar enemies again and again.

The true fun comes with learning the characters and their unique play styles. Combat is fast, flashy, and fun, and playing with others is incredibly satisfying.

That said, Leveling one character up can take an extremely long time due to the number of things to grind for (their specific weapons, leveling and uncapping said weapons, character abilities, and stat boosters called sigils).

The main story is fairly short (10-20 hours depending on familiarity with the rpg mechanics) but in that time the game pins you against tons of monsters that will kill your whole team if you are too careless with both your decisions in a fight and neglect to upgrade your skills/weapons. Even if you fail, if you like spectacle, this game's story has that in spades.

If you are as hungry as I was by the end, there is even more post-game content that continues the main story a little further with chapter 0 and even past that, there are even more new bosses for you to discover through a Monster Hunter: World like mission system. These missions will ramp up in difficulty to the point where you will be fighting multiple bosses at the same time.

I have finally reached the end of the game and completed all missions and I am still obsessed with this and plan on coming back to try out more of the 20+ characters currently in the game. I also am looking forward to the promised future updates that will be releasing throughout this year.

If you're here for a grind, you can blast through the story and stay for the postgame stuff, which encourages you to fight bosses and enemies over and over in Monster Hunter-esque fashion to grind up gear and characters in order to MAKE NUMBER BIG.

If you're just here for a satisfying singeplayer experience, you'll find the main story is a 15-20 hour affair packed with fun fights, plenty of spectacle, and great music backing it all up. For some people, 15 hours of enjoyable action RPG might not sound worth the money, but after playing through Relink's story, I can say with some confidence that I would rather have what it offers than 60+ hours of tedium occasionally broken up by long and pointless dialogues that so many JRPGs have delivered in the past. It's meat vs. fat, and Relink's campaign is mostly meat, which I appreciate.

That stuff aside, I have to comment on how much care obviously went into this game--I'm talking animation work, voice work, music, pretty much anything you can think of. Each area in the main campaign has an adaptive soundtrack that smoothly increases in intensity when you enter a fight. Some characters have little animation flairs like fixing their hair after landing from a jump. Seemingly every combination of playable characters has unique, voiced battle interactions that show off their (sometimes clashing) personalities. The characters will react in combat when you do something cool, like performing a perfect dodge. There's a huge amount of detail that didn't have to be put into the game, but was put in anyway.

Is it perfect? Hell nah. There are problems. The story is passable, but basically standard JRPG fare; start by fighting goblins, somehow end up fightings gods and saving the world with the power of friendship. Some people like that kind of thing; to me, it's old and tired and bleh. A lot of bosses in the postgame are recycled to stretch the content further; their moves are remixed each time to make them challenging in a meaningful way, but if you don't like seeing the same models, you might be disappointed. You can't apply scaling to yourself when selecting specific quests online, so if you want to play with a much lower level friend, you're just going to curbstomp all the content available to them in five seconds. Also the postgame grind can get pretty nutty. You will never have enough resources, and you will repeat quests many, many times, even raising just one character. I cannot imagine the time it would take to max out every character in the roster.

Yet despite all this, I recommend the game. Bottom line: it's fun, and it's fun practically right out of the gate. You don't have to play for 70 hours before Relink ""gets good."" The game wants to show you the best it has to offer as soon as it feasibly can. More games should try to be this way.",1707691351,1707691351,True,2,0,0.52879488468170166,0,True,False,False

If you're worried about there being gacha pulls for the characters, don't be. You get awarded crew tickets throughout the story (and a couple of other ways later on) and you just exchange one of those for a character of your choice instead of rolling for them or whatever. You get enough tickets to buy every character, so there's no missing out on anything.

Good stuff:
- Boss fights. Each and every boss is unique in their own way in terms of mechanics. Very engaging and even replaying it doesn't feel super bad.
- Character design is good. Every character have their own play-style and look very different from each other.

Mid stuff:
- Some of the soundtracks for boss fights are good. The best is probably Excavallion boss fight. The others are straight up forgettable/mid. Pretty bad for a ""Japanese-theme"" RPG where there's usually quite a few memorable soundtracks.
- No crafting system. Sigils are straight-up random from gacha or targetted farming from bosses

Bad stuff:

- Bad console port. Console controls + console UI + console graphics + random FPS drops in some random places. This has to be super lazy of them. The only good thing about that is the FPS are at least stable during boss fights.
- Horrendous storyline. Feels like it was written by a 13 years old. Super ResidentSleeper. Just skip everything. Don't bother with the story, massive waste of my time. Main character basically has no personality, good for self inserting.
- Damage cap mechanic. This has got to be the most terrible, lazy and straight up worst mechanic I've ever seen. Yes, some RPG(s) has some ""damage-cap"" where it is usually capped at ""99999"" or something but this one that they have is dependent on the skill/attack you use. It doesn't even tell you when your damage is capped, you've just gotta look at it and notice whether you are able to crit. This thing also takes up so many sigil slots in the late game.

Gameplay is fast, responsive and flashy and yes, it will totally make you blind 10/10 ! Play the game on 4K OLED HDR BIG TV  for even better effect. And yes, it makes human type fight difficult because we cant see them at all haha.

No clunky BS and pointless waste of times so you can focus on whats actually matter. Speaking of wich, we have the tech to instantly use a potion now, amazing !! *staaaare*

Plenty of characters with different playstyle that will fit most tastes.

Bots will carry your ass and steal your mvps, so dont worry if you want to play solo and are not really into action games ! Plus, there are a lot of things you can equip to help you survive. (No more bots dying withing 15sec of the fight like ""certain games"", it is super refreshing honestly).

Game does not follow the mobile game story and will have tldr background on the characters if you want to know more about how the crew came together, so dont worry if you dont know the licence.

Speaking of the mobile gacha... just dont, if you value your life that is... you've been warned (rank184 here).

Few more things

- Camera needs improvement

- No bugs

- 1 CTD in 70h

- No Ultrawide support, sigh.

- No dualsense input on screen, not a big deal but you support it, so might as well add them lol.

This isn't Genshin Impact with character switching nor is it methodical like Monster Hunter, it's an anime action game that leans closer to titles like Nights of Azure. For all of its polish, it does lack some depth when it comes to upgrading and diversity between builds and weapon variety. Progression is very much linear with alt builds functionally being regulated to counter strategies for endgame grinds or multiplayer speedruns/safety nets exclusively. This isn't God Eater nor Monster Hunter so don't come in with that expectation. Meet the game on its own terms and you'll likely have a good time with it.

The story is fine for what it is and I can't speak for much when it comes to how serviceable the fanservice and content is for a glorified GBF fan as I'm only really familiar with bits and pieces thanks to Shadowverse, Rage of Bahamut, and the anime. You don't need to know much about GBF at all to get into this game and like the characters and honestly it probably encourages you to try the source material if you find any of their stories interesting. At the end of the day however, the story is decently short (which is why it's more of an ARPG than a JRPG) but the majority of your gametime will probably be spent on endgame progression and unlocking difficult challenges to take on.

I'm pretty good at action games so I can't really speak on the difficulty but the general perception tends to be that this game is on the easier side, so it's definitely something you can do with friends for fun or during downtime and not be stressed out about constantly wiping to a wall or learning specific mechanics for several attempts on end like say a Dark Souls or Ninja Gaiden title would have you doing. The player is rather powerful in this game and the tools at their disposal definitely makes the majority of encounters laughable when take advantage of so! I strongly recommend that you play as much of this game as you can blind to make sure you're getting enjoyment out of it while it still poses a challenge as eventually it does reach a point where it's a pretty systematic grind. You can do well with the AI companions, as a solo player, or even with self-imposed challenges. Multiplayer does make the game significantly easier with faster encounters just because players tend to be much better at dealing (and taking) damage than CPUs; however, there is no wrong approach to anything in this game. I think from my experiences however, after completing the story I would likely just recommend taking on the newly unlocked difficulty tier(s) with a friend who is at a similar progression point or gear level as you, just so the experiences feel closer to Monster Hunter and God Eater rather than having an incidental teammate 1shotting everything for you on your first encounters- could DEFINITELY ruin some of the more interesting things you'll run into later down the line.

And on the top of grind- that's basically the entire endgame. If you've played MHW, think of Investigation spamming for Decoration farming; however, you'll need to do that for missions without any variation or enhanced drop rates in addition to having to roll on several different F2P (there are no P2W aspects of this game) gacha systems for your best-in-slot or even just passable substats and gearing. There is a substantial amount of content in this game to take on so I'd definitely recommend taking it at a slower pace and not being frustrated with having to catch up on gear progression or anything silly like that. I beat most of the encounters in the game with a Lv 75 weapon until upgrading it to 125 which is 25 levels lower than the maximum- and wasn't even best-in-slot using a team entirely of characters who I just liked having around in the party. You'll be fine to play anything and everything you want and you shouldn't be expected to be punished for it--- barring some flying enemies at times but you know how it is with ARPGs.

The formulas in place and current roadmap for the game at the time of writing this does have me more interested in what may come in the future with updates, especially when compared to how I felt about MH Rise so while you're still on the fence about picking this title up, just know that Cy doesn't plan on dropping it at least for a good chunk of time.

It's cliché, save the innocent girl just so she can be kidnap more and defeat ennemies with power of friendship + end with a sh*tty moral at the end. Even if I didn't play the game for the story, I was expecting a minimum of effort. The story was unbearable to me as a fan of the yakuza series and visual novels in general. Also they drag the end too much. Probably because they know their story is not long. So they try to prolonge that, but longer story doesn't mean better, and I would rather have a game with no story at all and just quests rather than what they give me here.

Just offering some color swap as DLC is sc*mmy at best and is an open insult to the player base, it's even worst at their price. Real cosmetics should not cost more than 5 € at worst so a color swap for 8€ ? Please don't buy that.

The multiplayer is dead because the matchmaking takes too long to find a group. Maybe due to a regional matchmaking so the number of player on steam is misleading. Depending on where you are you could end up solo and the fun come in end game multiplayer. I am not American therefor I am mostly solo. 5+ minutes of waiting for a quest that last for an average of 2 minutes is just infuriating and it's when I'm lucky to find a group. I am in France if it can help you.

The gameplay is however really good but they really lack bosses. On top of not having a lot of them, some are really awful to fight like the one in lava. I also didn't like how the numbers are show. You just see a bunch of unreadable number stacking on each other. Clearly it was just put there to make the gameplay feel good rather tham giving informations. They could have replace the damage numbers by ""Boom ! Splash ! Vlam !"" like in comics and it would be the same...

So despite the gameplay being good, the problem of the matchmaking plus the bad story really prevent the game from shining and it becomes an average experience. I hope they will do a sequel and improve all of that because it can clearly be a really good game and kind of an alternative of a monster hunter.

pros:
- good story
- good gameplay

cons:
- good story, but you have to know yourself what's going on overall - game doesn't explain much, you're just thrown into the Gran Blue story out in the middle.
- a lot of english translation missups
- special edition doesn't give you Color Pack 1, you have to buy it separately
- game doesn't have playstation gamepad prompts, only xbox
- after playing for a while, it starts to lag within game UI using Dualsense or other gamepads. The only way to fix this is to restart the game. This is A HUGE problem for those who play with gamepads. It kills the mood completely.
- you can't change gamepad controls
- gamepad vibrates when it doesn't need to be and in a hilarious way, just random vibration which has no connection with UI or gameplay

The main campaign is about 15 hours long even on hard difficulty and it's a faceroll on any difficulty lower than hard. Main plot sucks, the antagonists be like ""you're too weak"" or ""that didn't count"" or ""ur mom"" and move a goal post a chapter away. However, it doesn't really matter since it's just a tutorial before the end game and it's *the* real game. Also you really want to progress as fast as possible to unlock and try new characters: the story offers you 3 unlocks at different moments of the campaign and the rest can be acquired in another 15 hours.

Characters have rather unique fighting styles even if some of them share the basic mechanics but there's a lot of them. And more are coming with their own customizable set of skills. The animation is smooth, the voice acting (JP at least) is outstanding, It's probably hard to find the similar game with the characters' appeal this high, especially if we exclude the obvious gacha mentions as ironic as it may seem. When I think about it, the designs are just too lovely for an action-RPG but my opinion is probably biased. However as the main plot line is short the unlockable characters don't get much of story coverage besides 2 personal missions and some static but fully voiced VN-panels.

Where the characters shine bright is at the battle. Game has a huge focus on the boss and horde fights. While well- and rather too obviously telegraphed the attacks are intense and deadly. All the boss fights feel meticulously crafted with the different phases, desperate aggression periods and ultimate attacks. The game is coop-focused and sometimes NPCs can't keep up with the pace of a battle but still you will probably die much more often than them and they will take care of you just fine. As the only irritating detail I can mention the weird working lock-on, and since the game allows you to lock on different parts of the boss the additional targets can distract you and cause confusion.

A game runs surprisingly well even on the highest graphic settings on my modest (R5 5600X & 1070) setup and while some locations are just nice to look at, one of them is marvelous in terms of architecture and style. I can't stop myself from examining it every time I enter, seems like a lot of work was put into. And no stutters whatsoever. Dear God, I don't remember the graphics and style being so balanced and polished.

I am someone who has been a casual fan of the mobile game's story, characters, and world for several years, and followed the anime when it released.
So you could say I was already very invested in Granblue before playing Relink, and had been anticipating the game's release ever since it's announcement years ago.

Needless to say, Relink did not disappoint.
This game has some of the most enjoyable real-time character-action combat I've ever played.
Every character is super diverse, controls are intuitive and responsive, and the combat visuals are that perfect balance of flashy, and informative.

As for story and setting, the game takes place in a different province of the Granblue world from the mobile game, so players unfamiliar with the series can jump in and play along mostly fine.
All that's really required is watching season 1 of the anime to get up to speed with the etymology of the world, but if you're not interested in that and are only here for the gameplay, it can be safely ignored.

The soundtrack is absolutely superb, I genuinely wish the soundtrack could be purchased, on Steam or anywhere else, because its all so beautiful and theatrical, especially the major boss fight tracks.
There are some very minor sound issues that do annoy me a little, like the overall game volume being pretty low, and there are a few character's who's voicelines sound a little weird quality-wise.

The campaign took me 40 hours to finish including the Epilogue chapter, and I'm really looking forward to the many more hours ahead of playing though the extensive endgame content with online matchmaking.

If you love Granblue, or are at least fond of it's world or characters - even if you have no previous experience with this franchise - I strongly recommend playing Granblue Fantasy: Relink.
It may very well be my game of the year.

+ A vast cast of excellent Japanese voice actors and unmatched visuals for its art style make for an outstanding presentation that culminates in a powerful cinematic experience during the main plot. (I guess i didn't waste 7 years for this)

+ Gameplay alike Monster Hunter series but some of the aspects got the better improvements, fights are pretty insane indeed come along with new and old awesome soundtracks. However, it's kinda sad for them that they don't also add the old BGM (6 Dragons, Diaspora Theme) into the archive. (Fr, please add in so i can stay in Lyria's Journal forever listening to Burning Out The Blue xd). The enviroment sound when in towns (Folca, Seedhollow) are astounding where all NPCs are fully voice to the perfect bit (Stop it i am not crying, you are crying).

+ Cracked A.I, actually doing better job than players and called them giga skill issues, man they literally dodge everything in 0.001s frame wtf. This opens a lot of opportunities for players since they can just solo questing without waiting 7749 hours trying to queue up for mediocre quests.

+ The main story is really nice, but kinda bit rushy at the end. In addition, the dialogue references LOTS of Granblue Fantasy Gacha Mobile Game version. Personally, i would find it a very smart way to promote the gacha version for themselves, which is again, very clever. However, somewhat backfire if the person really hate gacha and want to know the whole fantasy of Granblue (Ngl the gacha version is kinda f2p friendly i g-guess? so might as well give it a try, it has old interfaces but also really addicted when you get to know what you are doing).

+ They did fucking wonderful job in keeping the original material from the gacha version of the character's skillset (Rackam's Collateral Damage + Duration, MC's Base Skill, etc.). Morever, all weapons are familiar too (Vintage Weapons, Illutrious Weapon, etc.). Idk what are people thinking about this but i personally think this small detail is pretty dang wholesome (Why only Zosimos and Ereshkigal make it into the End-game weapon why Kimura ? :whysnapped:) 

+ Builds and Weapon Choices: Introducing new concept of 'Dmg Cap' for non-grubble enjoyers. However, this make really fun to theorycrafting a specific for build for a specific character. You can just literally build a Support-centric character to character-who-carry-your-ass-run.

+ Same issue to Monster Hunter, the game act pretty bad toward modifying number tools, which is so called hacking/cheating. Personally I am considered cheating is pretty unethical in this game because you basically missing most of the fun in grinding but it makes understandable for who those might not have time for this kind of hell grind and basically just enjoy the story. This means I'm not agree on cheating is fine, No, cheating is pretty gayass, but if you know what you are doing then im fine with that just don't ruined others players' experience (a.k.a Airplane Mode) (fr i have spent 80 hours just to grinding Silver Centrum mom pls help me i'm despacito).

+ The game has some connecting/booting issues but immediately solved the short moment after so this headpoint is made for fun frfr hehe xd

+ Regarding the running issues of Localization/Censored/Regional Pricing:

Localization: i have to admit that for the new players who have not known to original Grubble storyline. This is troublesome cause it might affect the way people looking toward the contents and such others thing. Personally I running on JP Dub/EN Sub, its pretty much not similar, but if you by any chance looks like a weeb, you kinda alr understand the context of the dialouge, no big deal.

Censored: Dude, I'm paying 50$ for the gameplay after 7 years waiting, who's gonna give the damn thing that if Zeta pansies is being censored, stop being a coomer and literally just buy some erotic stuffs with less than 50$ lmfao. The game gonna make you look what the boss gonna doing instead looking at pansies you can't never eat 24/7.

Regional Pricing: Just crack it my dude, i don't see the problem :cluelesstyping:

TL;DR: 
- It's Illusion of Freedom, if you are a Grubble player also, you know what i'm talking about
- It's 12/10 for JRPG. Shut up and take my money Cygames (Once again)
- Definitely worth it

This game is an artwork you can feel the hard work.

Sure updates will takes longer as for mobile, but I am looking forward to. I do not expect less from Cygames.
I am a bit worried how long it be possible to maintaining a game like this, since it doesn't use gatcha. I do not expect cosmetics and  items you can obtain while playing will sell that well, nor do I think the mobile games can back it up. Sure I like that we can get important thing for free, but I would be more sad to see if they have drop that project because of.  I am just waiting too long for this masterpiece to not be worried.
I would like if the colors for character customization could be separated into hair and clothes to allow more options. the content of packs could stay same, just the option to apply them. 
I am looking forward to see more  stories quests and characters in Relink, the year of monkey sounds promising.

Right at the two hour mark as well so I can't even refund. Story is bland, just like what you would expect from a company that makes gacha games. Also I'm sure steam is gonna clean up this bad rating like they have been with every other game. Oh well.

Edit: Played some more, the gameplay was nice, but then another oof in the story. I'm a GI player so I know horrible story when I see it. Ex: They made something soooooo obvious for a while, but then you're supposed to be surprised about the ""big"" reveal. 
So in my opinion, If you want a good story, don't play this game, its as bad as the GI storytelling. If you want amazing battles, graphics and good character design and you don't care about the story, be my guest.

The good stuff

- Great artsyle
- Good PC performance
- Lots of characters, everyone is easy to pick up in a few minutes but there's a decent amount of skill ceiling to make them interesting and focus on who you like
- Very repayable, grindy after the story but mostly the good kind
- fun with friends

The meh

- Story is not great despite the overall presentation being really good if that's what you're looking for look elsewhere, it's a gameplay game
- Poor localization
- Kinda easy, you will rarely if ever actually lose - most of the challenge is to play well, not to win
- Great base of boss encounters, but you can really sense things could be pushed a lot further which hopefully happens in future content
- The hair/cloth physics engines is outstanding but only actually works properly with a 30fps cap pls fix it

the story was decent ? took around 15 ish hours to complete the main story...
i play solo for the side quest most of the time, the game is enjoyable till i reach proud difficulty

downs 
the ai for multiple bosses is poopy, it made progressing proud difficulty annoying,,,,,, very annoying.......
the boss fights are cool and all, but i feel like there is a lack of unique bosses during the story quest, there was couple of recolored bosses which new skills. only 2 bosses i feel like its actually super cool and not just hit and dodging

Follow up:  
  
After nearly 100 hours, I can say that I definitely love this game, and recommend you pick it up if you love flashy, fast-paced action combat. I'll start with the negatives because there are only a few.  
  
First off is the story. It's super straightforward, there's barely any filler, and it's pretty short. It's not bad, but it's definitely not great. For a game that's mostly about multiplayer, I think this is the ""best"" issue you can have.  
  
Secondly, there's a lot of small QoL stuff that leaves much to be desired. It's a Playstation game that completely lacks Playstation icons when you have a dualsense plugged in. There's no button remapping as of this writing this review so you have to work around it by using steam controller input. Matchmaking is restricted to your download region which is such a weird thing to do in 2024. You can easily swap your download region but come on, just make the servers worldwide and let players adjust their ping limits themselves.  
  
Thirdly, the endgame is kind of repetitive. Everything leading up to it was fun and amazing, but at endgame there is basically only about 12 missions to do, one of them you will be repeating at least 100+ times trying to get a weapon to drop. It's kind of a spoiler but I won't get into it, but basically a ""Monster Hunter""-like game shouldn't have you continuously hunting only a handful of bosses of endgame. In this sense, the game desperately need a variety mode where it can truly feel endlessly grindy and not repetitive.   
  
Finally, Build variety is kinda limited. At endgame everyone is forced to build their character a certain way which sucks.
  
With those out of the way, I will say everything else is perfect. This is without a doubt one of the most visually stunning games you will play. There's a lot of hand-painted backgrounds that feels like it had so much love and care put into it, every little detail feels like it had dozens of hours dedicated to it before the stroke was made. The UI feels very vibrant and cool. The characters are visually distinct. Things just look pretty and cool to look at. There was without a doubt a lot of love and care put into this game's art style. Same goes for music, sound design and everything else art related.

The gameplay is really great,  there are 18 characters to choose from, each with their own distinct mechanics. I will say that there's some overlap between characters in that their gameplay tries to achieve a similar goal. For example, Lancelot is all about spaming attacks. and dodges out of the way, and Charlotta is a character who spams attacks and parries instead. They have different skills so those will be different, but their moment to moment is pretty similar. This isn't a common occurance though and is only limited to a few different characters. 
  
The meta game is really good too, it's very similar to monster hunter in that you have a lobby where you craft your gear, gather materials from missions, craft better gear, gather more materials....etc. If you love that gameplay progression loop, it's right here in this game too.  
  
In conclusion, this game is a must-play if you like fast-paced action games with a monster hunter gameplay loop, that is visually the best thing to look at.",1706797121,1707617431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First: The story is terrible, lazy, rehashed anime tropes left and right. I couldn't stomach it all, and started skipping the cut scenes about 75% of the way through.
Second: You know all those bosses you fought on your way up to the conclusion of the campaign? Yeah, get ready to fight those same bosses, and only those bosses, not just once, not twice, not even 3 times, but at least 4 more times with a progressively bigger and bigger health pool. This only slightly changes when you're on the final difficulty tier, which is a real shame.
Third: The game is way, WAY too easy. Yeah, this comes up in every review out there, but I couldn't believe how easy it *still* is knocking on the door of the hardest difficulty in the game.

With all this negativity out of the way, here's why I still give the game a recommendation:
The characters are fun. While they are no where near the depth or complexity of MonHun weapons, they still do have their own level of mastery to be attained, and it's just complex enough that the moment to moment game play can be enjoyed near endlessly. If you get tired of playing that character, you can very easily swap to a different one in your party of 4, and have just as much fun as the first character all over again.

It's a solid, fun game, just don't come looking for variants of bosses, or complex weapon systems.",1707613999,1707613999,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Take Monster Hunter, but make it an anime. No, not Rise. Make it MORE anime.

GB Relink is one of the best games in recent memory hands down, an excellent ARPG that's as much character action as it is MonHun.

But it gets a thumbs down in Steam's score system because of the utterly awful translation. Almost every single incidental line has been ""punched up"" into glorified fanfic.

Now for the game itself...

The good:
+Game looks better and much cleaner than its predecessors, even though the fighting games look pretty good.
+Loading screens are extremely short, it's splendidly optimized which is rare on new releases nowadays. It runs smoothly on my 2060 with all graphic options on high.
+Gameplay is not as repetitive as other similar RPGs, as bosses actually have a good repertoir of skills and many of them are actually quite complex. You can equip 4 skills at the same time aside from each character's basic combos, and one ultimate skill for each character which you can combine with other people in coop to make a ''all out attack''.
+Skill/stats trees are HUGE and that's always a good thing
+The protagonist is voiced and actually speaks. Dialogue options are pretty irrelevant though, but it's a nice touch.
+When you have to do mini-games that require platforming and running around, the game automatically teleports you back to the starting point whether you succeeded or failed, this lets me know that they actually kept the player in mind, as it makes me look forward to the reward rather than imagine beforehand the tedious task of running around all the way back every time.

The bad:
-The story is quite cheesy, but if you like these kinds of games you're probably kinda ready for that. Character individual stories are pretty interesting though, and give them good development.
-The roster is quite short in comparison to the fighting games and I was disappointed that many characters were not included, although it is possible that they will add them as DLC content later on (maybe it's already confirmed that they will or they won't, I haven't read about it so I do not know).
-The censorship. While in the fighting games there is the option to play the censored or uncensored version of the game, in this one you have no option but to play the censored one. Now whether you like pantyshots and underboob views or not that is completely up to you, but censorship is bad in all its forms and I will never support it, hence why I'm not putting a 10 on this game, but I still recommend it because it's not as invasive as in other games. I will update this review if the option ever gets added to the game.
-Localization is terrible, as it usually is in Japanese games.

One thing to mention is that while the story is rather short (around 20 hours to complete with some secondary quests in between) this is more like Monster Hunter in the sense that you complete the story mostly in order to unlock the game itself rather than play the game for the story. 
The ''unlocking'' part meaning the second half of the game, which includes 3 new difficulties for new quests and evolved versions of the original bosses which are much harder but give new materials for new weapons.

After looking through the new quests that opened up, they're all just reskins of previous fights with bigger numbers and maybe one or two new mechanics thrown in for good measure. Disappointing.

It's a decent game for someone who wants a casual Monster Hunter. I was going to recommend it because it has pretty good boss fights, but they are about the only thing that stands out and unfortunately after playing for 18 hours I've only seen about 10 bosses recycled over and over again ad naseum.

I'm still having enough fun to play it while watching a stream or a series on the 2nd monitor so I'll play more and update the review if the remaining content is satisfying.

Short summary:
story - dogshit anime trash but skippable
gameplay - a lot of characters play basically the same but there's some variety and it plays well overall
level design - borderline boring in most cases, there are like 3 or 4 open maps but they're mostly barren places where you go from A to B

The combat system is great and there are lots of content (story + endgame) and grinding as typical of JRPG. Comes with many playable characters, which can be unlocked by obtaining crewmate cards through through and story. It has a mastery system which spends MSP points to advance your character stats. Reading character stories also improves stats like Princess Connect. It comes with online coop with friends though not cross platform (only for PS4 and PS5). From my past experience and the exposure of the story and content so far, this would take triple digits hours to 100%.

Graphics wise is not on par with FF series and more towards Atelier. Whichever is better is subjective. Coming from Hyperdimension, this is a huge upgrade.

My only problem with the game is the translation. The tone of the translation is not on par with the original JP. I'd rather have a close to direct translation not an interpretation of the original work.

Overall, my biggest take away from this game was that it wasn't ""hard"" but instead it was sometimes annoying and frustrating with the camera movements.  Also, the harder fights weren't hard but instead you'd get hit by something randomly attacking you from behind.",1707599080,1707599080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Keep in mind, im shortly after finishing the main story and currently doing epilogue quests to reach true ""endgame"" by unlocking the highest difficulty levels.

Story 6/10- While I didn't hate it, It wasn't anything amazing. Just typical, ""save the princess"" story. The bad guys nearly winning, hero saves the day in the last moment. It would have been higher, but the game is technically a sequel to a franchise, some people recommended watching anime to get the idea of how the crew gathered together. I wish they spend a bit more time on it in game. There are ""Fate episodes"" quests that somewhat explain it ... but they are just walls of texts, without any animation or even gameplay (with few exceptions). So in short, watch anime, it might give you a better introduction

Secondly, the pacing is terrible. While at the start its decent. Later on there is no breathing room for a player, as if they were rushing to finish the story. There is no hype up to a final boss fight or rather its never ending. At certain point you will be going from boss fight to boss fight thinking its the last one. Just for them to drop ""ohh noo, now we have to save this person"", because the bad guy, despite losing is still pulling ""haha, see you later, teleports away with friend"" card 3x. Just really annoying.

Lastly... there is no explained character growth. Yes we as players, see lvl ups. distribute points etc. However, story doesn't reflect that. At the start we get our ass absolutely destroyed. Immediately get up for rescue mission. Get our ass beaten yet again, in the same spectacular fashion, just to find enemy yet again and now with the power of ""friends we gathered during our journey"" being directly delivered to us, we have a chance to fight. Even tho the enemy also gathered 10x more power. No training, no secret power we found. Just believe in yourself and strangers that you now call friends.

Gameplay 9/10- While story is slighly better than okay. Gameplay is for sure the dominating aspect of the game. I really enjoyed all the fights, the combat system is working well. Each character has their own unique play style. The AI team, is actually smart and supporting. There is a lot of endgame content and a lot of characters to be unlocked. If you want to max it out, you will spend hundreds of hours playing the game.  And the only two minor issues I have, are : 

1. Annoying camera lock- as if they tried to show you more during fights, but it actually does the opposite. with locking usually picking furthest enemy... instead the ont closest to you.

2. 1 or 2 boss mechanics... - it  could be me or not. But there are some that I simply could not predict. Like laser beam going absolutely all over the place and you had to hope it won't hit you, because it would cover like 80% of the map. I would mostly die and wait for AI team to pick me up. There is probably a way to avoid it, I might just be blind to it right now.

Visuals 9/10- I really liked the visuals, they are very anime like. The enviroment looks absolutely gorgeous and perfectly fit the anime style of the characters. Honeslty, if they made anime the same way they doing those 3D rendered cutscenes. It would be the first 3D anime that I would accept with open hands. The game to cutscene transitions are also really smooth.


So in the end. In my opinion story is its weakest part. Interesting world, but not enough explored inside the game and a bit rushed, to call it amazing. I hope for future projects they will put a bit more love to story, than they did here. I will definitely play more to see the endgame content and how much it tests player's skill. Lastly I really recommend this game, purely for visuals and gameplay as its really fun.

Granblue Fantasy: Relink is like if Monster Hunter had a love child with Dragalia Lost (rest in peace). It’s so beautiful.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
In many aspects, Relink resembles a gacha game—except with all the brainwashing and anti-player systems taken away.

Loads of characters with different mechanics to learn? Check—but without having to open your wallet just to gamble a coinflip of getting 1/7th of a proper character.

Quests that allow you to farm for specific materials or resources? Check—but without having to wait 3 hours just to play a single stage.

Challenging end game content requiring really built-up characters to clear? Check—but where you need to learn mechanics instead of just roflstomping.

Incoming updates adding new characters and fights? Check—but where you’re actually excited for the content instead of worrying if the next banner is gonna fuck you up the ass.

Hell, there are even hundreds of little in-game achievements, tons of currency types, an auto mode, and character episodes. It’s like this was designed with a gacha game blueprint but somehow ended up as an actual game.

[b][u]The Bosses[/u][/b]
Oh man. The bosses.

If you’ve ever played Dragalia Lost, you’ll find the style of attacks very familiar—especially those of the end game bosses.

Tornadoes, flamethrowers, meteors, blade showers, lasers, earth explosions, movement restrictions, dimension shifting, and so many more mechanics make boss fights more than just “hit boss, dodge boss”.

Now, Relink’s end game isn’t as mechanics-intensive as Dragalia Lost’s (just phase 1 of Volk was more complex than anything in Relink). Skill expression here is more focused on comboing and dodging/guarding.

Still, we’re getting new content soon, so maybe there’s hope for some really complex bosses in Relink.

[b][u]Criticisms[/u][/b]
A few areas for improvement and minor gripes.

You can’t change controller keybindings, and the camera is very slow and feels slippery to control. Lock-on logic is also very weird, which makes it hard to target what I want to. They seem to be planning to fix some of these issues.

It would be nice if I could see damage details, durations, and cooldowns on skills—especially Damage Cap. We also need a “Detailed Stats” screen. The availability of vital information in-game is currently very limited, and trying to search for it online has Google trying to shove the useless cancer that is Fextralife down your throat.

Ultra end game min-maxing of builds requires you to get UNBELIEVABLY lucky in 3 separate gacha systems. I like grinding, and it’s nice that maxed players have something to aim for, but tens of thousands of hours of lootbox grinding for perfect Overmasteries/Wrightstones or Supplementary Damage V+ Sigils involves brainlessly farming easy stages instead of interacting with the fun content (i.e. the bosses).

Still, future updates would likely make acquiring some of these less time-consuming, as is oft the case with these types of games.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Relink runs excellently on aged hardware. Even on my old-ass GTX 1080, I’m capable of playing on Ultra on 1080p at a consistent 60FPS in quests.

Frames only drop in the towns, which is resolved if I switch to lower settings. The game still looks fantastic nevertheless.

Load times are really quick even on an HDD.

I’ve crashed only once in 120+ hours of gameplay.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The main story is pretty standard for a JRPG. There are loads of callbacks to events from Granblue Fantasy.

For someone who hasn’t played Granblue Fantasy, I feel like the Fate Episodes did a great job at catching players up with what happened in the original game, along with providing insight into their personalities. Story-wise, I think this was the high point of the game.

A quick shoutout to Hanazawa Kana, by the way. The range of emotions she conveyed in Zeta’s Fate Episodes shows just why she is regarded as a top tier voice actress.

[h1]Localisation[/h1]
So, I’ve seen people complaining about the localisation being awful, with some focusing on how the game supposedly panders to virtue-signalling gaming “journalists” by censoring or changing things to be more PG.

As someone who actually understands Japanese, I don’t believe this to be the case. (At least the pandering part.)

The thing about anime-style Japanese dialogue is that it uses nuance, context, and expressiveness to give emotional weight to even the simplest of words.

What many English localisers do is, instead of following this principle of “simple is best”, they either go full /r/FellowKids cringe (e.g. most gacha games) or spam flowery language in disastrous attempts to imitate GRRM (e.g. Triangle Strategy), along with vomiting out a torrent of stupid mistranslations (e.g. the Octopath Traveler games).

Fortunately, Relink’s localisation rarely outright mistranslates things—rather, it randomly adds and changes things to be different from what is said in Japanese. It’s like a high school assignment of having to quote a passage “in your own words” turned up to 11.

Like, they changed “Seedholm” to “Seedhollow”, “Zega・Grande” to Zegagrande”, and “Divine Protection” to “Wrightstone”.

Here’s an example from the opening lines of Vane’s Prologue Fate Episode:

[hr][/hr]
Original JP:「みんなを守れるようなカッコいいヒーローになる！それが俺の夢だ。」

My translation: “To become an awesome hero capable of protecting everyone! That’s my dream.”

The localisation: “My dream is to become a hero. I know, I know. Kind of stupid, right?”

[hr][/hr]
If any supposed pandering occurred, it would have been an unintended side effect of this “style” of localisation. It’s mostly a vibes-based localisation that violates “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.

That said, as far as I can see, there aren’t any majorly mistranslated combat skills (like in the Octopath Traveler games) or any stupid pandering (like in Triangle Strategy) going on.

Overall, although I find the localisation kinda awful on an absolute scale, if we’re grading on a curve, they’re doing above industry average. The localisation didn’t trigger me as hard as Octapath Traveler 2, most gacha games, or the English subtitles of basically any anime on Netflix, so there’s that.

[h1]Final Words[/h1]
Relink has already given me over a hundred hours of fun on just a single character and will continue giving me more as I develop and learn the other ones. More content is coming very soon, and I’m super hyped for it.

P.S. Cygames, please, for the love of God, give us a Dragalia Lost game made like Relink.",1707593098,1707594972,True,2,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

It is very simple to get into and offers a very deep dive into min maxing the shit out of your character.
You can play it casually and enjoy most of the game with ease or you can go hard and dominate every enemy in this game.
If you are a fan of action rpg's or beat'em ups, this is right up your alley.
Story was just long enough for me not to get bored by it and people complaining about localization or shallow story really need to think about how much else this game offers and that in comparison, those points mentioned don't even matter or are bad, they are coping hard. 
The biggest downside of this game is probably its auto-camera (turn it off) and it's lock-on (its very inaccurate on what you actually want it to do versus what it does).
Another downside is that if you use a Dualshock 5 controller (PS5) on PC and you tab out often from the game, your controller will eventually not respond ingame anymore or have delayed response. The only fix for this is to close the game and steam and then restart the game. Very annoying if you are a multitasker.

Personal main story and personal side quests are single player only but you have 3 reliable AIs (sometimes more) in your party. Each playable character's fate episodes (aka character's view of their story) are also solo only.

Quest counter (eg. Bounties and commissions in other games) will be unlocked as you play through the story. These quests can be either played solo, mutiplayer with friends only or multiplayer with public. More of these quests/bounties will be unlocked as you play through the game with new stages and different difficulties. (Similar to Monster Hunter style)

All playable characters in game so far are unlockable for free, A good amount of character cosmetic colour and weapon skins are also free as long as you play through the story and craft your weapons.

60usd is easily worth it in my opinion. Hope this is enough information for someone to decide on getting the game.

Extra Info: If you are worried about unstable internet connection during matchmaking with other players, as you disconnect and reconnect into another instance their characters will remain in your party as AI to help you fight till you finish the current quest.",1707590394,1707591817,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

There is enough enemy variety during the story (about 10-15hrs long, quicker if you're a story skipper), the post-story gameplay does not have any new enemies until the last difficulty, ""Proud"". Proud is where the game actually starts to get difficult to the point of having to dodge properly and gear up your character. The story is overall pretty meh. Post-story content is about 35-50 hours long so you're looking at about 55-75 hours for the full game with a bit of grinding time in there too. More hours if you want to get a perfect build on a character as there is RNG for important gear drops.

More indepth review:

Positives:

The graphics are great. The face and clothes quality are especially good. The mouths are well done and are very expressive (I wish Genshin had mouths this good). The lip sync is actually really good (I play on EN voices and subs), never saw mouths close when talking or talking when no voice is happening. The general environments are pretty good too.

The monster designs are pretty good. Though a lot of things are so obviously Final Fantasy inspired (not a bad thing).

The gameplay is pretty much perfect outside of a few issues such as AoE circles hitting you even though you aren't even close to them. Will go into further detail on that in the negatives part. The hitting feels satisfying and each playable character is somewhat like a different weapon in Monster Hunter. I play Io so I do big aoe blasts like a Black Mage from Final Fantasy would, but then I can swap to Lancelot and do lots of small hits which add up to a lot of damage. Lots of build variety to choose from with the sigil system (similar to decorations from Monster Hunter).

Neutral:

There is a system called ""Transmuting"" where you can make sigils with tokens and the chance of you getting a character specific sigil (late game only) is pretty low and when you do get one it's probably not for the character you want. It does add something to keep grinding for after you finish everything but... meh... Maybe a bit too much RNG. No pity system on it either.

Negatives:

I get that it's a grindy kind of game but 3/4 of the post-story gameplay is just such a waste of time because you fight the same monsters over and over again just to get to Proud difficulty where there's actually new content to experience. Perhaps it's this way because they wanted to bloat the gameplay hours??

Some of the hitboxes on the AoE circles are really bad. For example, on the final fight in Proud difficulty there are meteors that come down around crystals you are supposed to break, I can be standing completely out of it but will still get hit. I'm assuming this is because the meteors that come down are projectiles and hit your character from the side they are coming down from... rather than just blasting the floor where they are aimed and telegraphed for. Knowing this, if you aren't aiming for a perfect dodge you have to walk extra distance outwards... Feels bad.

Enemy variety is pretty low for post-story content. From off the top of my head there's probably about 15~ boss enemies minus reskin versions. There are a lot of reskinned enemies which to be fair do have quite a difference in their movesets but it still doesn't really feel great to fight a fire dragon.. then an ice dragon.. then an earth dragon... then a black dragon etc. I know there are more fights planned for the game but I hope a lot more do get added. The game really needs more enemy types.",1707588295,1707588319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The boss battles also have a lot of genuinely engaging and surprising elements. I've laughed out loud multiple times at the ingenuity they put into the major bosses.

Pros:
1, The story is not the best but it is actually not atypical of a JRPG. The action pieces are great and imo that is what makes the story feel engaging till the end.
2. All the playable characters in the game are viable and fulfill different playstyles. 
3. Difficulty Curve and progression is one of the best in almost all games I have played. You don't ever feel like you are suddenly thrown into deep water even all the way till the highest difficulty of the game. That being said it is expected for newer players in the genre to struggle in the harder content due to not having access to assists. This is intended and you will eventually be skilled enough to get past that barrier.
4. Fights are fast-paced.
5. Both online and offline play are good options to enjoy the game. Although I would like to point a caveat that you will be progressing slower offline because you need to raise multiple characters instead of just one to get to harder stages.

Cons:
1. Not all the characters shown in the story are playable. To be honest I wish they added them into the game. Will obviously not name for spoilers
2. Super lategame farming is truly brings out the reality that this game is not granblue fantasy relink but grindblue fantasy relink. Of course, you don't need super high-end items to beat the game or even put bosses on farm. But yes there is the grind.
3. End game builds are unfortunately a lot more cookie cutter than I would like to imagine it to be. There will still be some variation but many core sigils are obvious picks when trying to build your character.

All in all, a solid recommend even with these cons. Any casual player should try it. Any dedicated player should also try it.",1707570917,1707570917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fast paced and enjoyable combat, a simple but fulfilling fantasy story, very pleasant visual design + effects, fun endgame, very solid music, excellent sound design (those goddamn perfect parry/block sounds are to die for).
Endgame is somewhat similar to Monster Hunter where you pick up quests and take down a big boss or groups of enemies, so if you're a fan of that kind of game I highly recommend trying this out.

One thing to note is that the main story is NOT co-op. If you're looking to play this game with friends, just keep in mind you won't have many options for co-op quests until you've finished the story.

- Amazing visuals and music, and the voice actors are industry legends (speaking for the Japanese voice-overs)

If you don't find a group in about 30 seconds it will give up or requests you to retry rather than just leave you in one queue until ready which can make it annoying to queue for bosses.

They also give you no time to interact with people you queued with after a battle, and while the option is there to stay with people it's not explained and noone uses it from my experience.

I feel if they allowed you to stay in the instance for a few minutes and allowed players to leave at their own pace it would allow people to use the interaction and typing features and encourage staying as a group, 

It would also be nice if the stay as a group feature got streamlined in a future updates, as well as the ability to allow for longer queue times instead of cancelling the queue after 30 seconds.

I have yet to try the online session matchmaking which I'm sure is better and would work fine but my opinion still stands for open quest queing 

Other than that while the story is short and fairly forgettable plotwise, every boss feels like a massive setpiece and this is easily one of my favourite action RPGs in years with plenty of post game content, and if properly supported it could definitely become even better.

As of the time of this review, I've played everything in the base game, including the final challenge. I'll also not acknowledge the Assist Mode, as I never used it and it cannot be used in the end-game anyways.


Granblue Fantasy: Relink is an attempt to take the world of Granblue Fantasy and put it into an action setting, which I believe it succeeds at marvelously. Characters are represented beautifully and faithfully from their gacha counterpart, right down to a lot of NPCs looking very similar yet also immediately recognizable from the gacha. Many mechanics from the original gacha game are here in ways that make sense, such as every character having four skill slots that have cooldowns after uses, weapons having level caps that need treasure drops from quests to uncap further, and a wishlist that players can add treasures to so they can easily find which quests they can farm them from. But there's NO ACTUAL gacha here, this is not a pay-to-win game you can whale at, this is a full-fledged game.

And I want to emphasize that you DO NOT need to know Granblue Fantasy to enjoy this game, the whole point of this game was to introduce the IP to more people. I have friends that know very little about it, only what they've heard from me over the years, and they enjoy Granblue Fantasy: Relink just as much as I do. Every character has Fate Episodes you can go through, which most are just still-images with text on a screen voiced by that character. The first 2-3 Fate episodes per character are their backstories, so you can learn what you need to know in-game. In fact doing Fate Episodes grants stat increases for that character, so you're encouraged to do just that. Some Fate Episodes do have quests attached to them, these also have important unlocks you will want.

Aside from the visuals, the first thing that will stick out is the story, and this aspect of the game can be polarizing. The story is only okay, and yet I think that's okay. As a fan of the original gacha game, it just feels like another side story event. It's not bad and not great, just with a much higher budget and visuals. But the core of this game is the multiplayer aspect, which doesn't fully unlock until the story is completed, which can hold people back. As with the original gacha game, nearly all cutscenes can be skipped, which are accompanied by a short blurb detailing what happens in the scene you're about to skip, so players wanting to jump into multiplayer ASAP can do that and still have a basic idea of what's going on. The story can take somewhere from 5-20 hours depending on just how much of the cutscenes you actually watch and how through you are in scouring the story quests for collectibles.

The game is a mixture of character action like you'd expect from Platinum+ (who actually assisted in the initial development), raid mechanics like you'd see in Final Fantasy XIV, and 4-player co-op like from Monster Hunter. This doesn't sound like it should work, but it does spectacularly. There's over a dozen characters, starting at six with others unlocked over time, with each having a very different playstyle from one another and granting every player to find their own way to play and express themselves. Each character has their own unique traits and combo system, and unique skills they can pick from. While they can only bring up to four into battle, they each have a handful of unique skills to pick from. You're encouraged to try them all out and find what works for you, or more importantly what works for the quest you're tackling. While some characters are a little more complicated and difficult to pick up than others, the ease of controlling and attacking with them makes jumping into Granblue Fantasy: Relink an immediately responsive experience. There's also a training area where you can practice using a character without worry or failing a quest; you're highly encouraged to utilize this. As you unlock more skills and sigils, you'll need to figure out what works well together.

The meat of the game is the post-story multiplayer. While playing the story, you'll gradually unlock Easy and Normal level quests, and they can be played in multiplayer, but they're so easy it's not worth the time. After completing the story, you'll unlock Hard level quests, and the Monster Hunter-style progression will begin. Clearing select quests will unlock more and harder quests, granting access to more bosses, materials, and more to strengthen your characters for the next challenge to come. While there is a variety of quests such as surviving an onslaught of weaker enemies, the ones you'll spend the most time doing are boss battles. They start out with simple mechanics like finding a way to deal with a goblin with a massive shield or avoiding a giant rock monster as it tries to roll you over, but slowly get more in-depth and eventually introduce breaking boss parts to either gain rewards or stun/disable them. As you advance to Very Hard, Extreme, and higher, the boss battles get harder, add new mechanics, and do everything in their power to put you down. The final level of challenges get especially brutal, making it all the more satisfying when you finally overcome them.

The music is incredible! In the early years of the original gacha game it was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, legendary composer for Final Fantasy, and those compositions are rearranged as well as new compositions by the current composer Tsutomu Narita. I'm not really good at explaining how and why music is good, but as with the original gacha game there's quite a variety of thematic styles. Seriously, just go online and listen to some of the boss themes for this game. I recommend Managarmr's theme.


Granblue Fantasy: Relink is incredibly fun and gorgeous, with a vibrant and colorful art style that can make you feel like the world is alive and gameplay that's very satisfying to play, though it takes a while to get to the really fun part. Depending on your skill level and ability to learn MMO-style raid mechanics, you may find the game challenging right away, or take a long time to reach that challenge, but I assure you the challenge is here and waiting for you to find it. And with post content on the way like Lucilius's Dark Rapture, I promise the challenge will only intensify.",1707563760,1707563760,True,14,0,0.589323997497558594,0,True,False,False

This is basically Anime Monster Hunter, and if you like that style of game... you will love this one.  It however, is much easier to get into than Monster Hunter and I would say the combat itself is not as complicated either.  This doesn't mean that combat is a lesser tier in this game however.  In many ways, in can be more difficult since many of the characters (think of them as the different MH  weapons) require precise button timings to pull off their combos and button mashing absolutely does not work here.

The fights themselves are a much much flashier and fast paced affair than MH as well.  Some of these boss fights are truly a sight to behold!

Character progression is also very deep and varied and is just as satisfying as any MH game is as well.  

The story is actually not bad either.. at least I found it a lot more entertaining than any MH games main campaign.  The music, voice acting and visuals are amazing as well.

The game starts after the MSQ, when you start fighting different variations of the bosses you fought so far. They get harder and harder and it's a fun challenge to get to the endgame. You spend a lot of time grinding for specific items to level up your character, weapon and finding sigils to accommodate your playstyle.

The controls are simple, and they respond very well.

There are 18 different characters that allow you to play in many ways. The 12 Sigil slots also allow you to customize your playstyle.

The graphics are very good, it'd be better if the characters had fewer clothes, but they still look nice. Ascended weapons are really pretty. The color variations add a nice touch.

-- Things I wish were better ----------
The game camera is complete trash and it needs to be fixed.

A couple of things I think could be improved is that there are too many DPS checks, not allowing your group to play tanker/healer, the last boss of the game is extremely punishing if you don't do enough DPS and it's last attack kills your entire party no matter what and you fail the mission if you don't do enough DPS. The power you can get with items etc is much greater than the difficulty of the game, so once you have 18k+ power score even the last boss becomes trivial.

It'd be great if there were more bosses on the level of the final one (or stronger).

It'd be great if there were more items to chase, currently there's 1 weapon and 1 sigil you might want to farm, and both of them you get from the final boss. There should be more weapon variations and different bosses dropping them.

Bosses should be harder, or actually what I think I want is players to be weaker. Players can get like 21k power and the final boss requires 17500, I think if the numbers were reversed the fight would be way more interesting.

games a 9/10 for me. some minor things prevent it from being what I personally consider a 10/10. which isnt perfect but something where I cant really find anything to complain about. my complaints about the game like a week and a bit later are thus:

-all the stuff is too complicated and not well enough explained. I didnt realize alot of things that on learning I facepalmed because the game did a poor job of describing things like ""weapons you unlock and get masteries for have their bonuses apply no matter which weapon your using."" I didnt realize how transmutations worked fully and I thought that I would only get level III+ or lower from the shop for the longest time because it doesnt tell you use actually can get level V plus ones.  theres just too much info in the game to leave things out imo. which takes away from the experience a bit. 


-no fsr/dlss support is a minus from me since fsr2 and dlss are really good at giving you tons of frames and are becoming a very important feature to have for games. This game I'd love to play at 120fps but my 7800xt is just off. cant make it. its like 100 to 110. so I play at 60. I know fsr would very likely give me 10 frames. and I'd be good. even at standard it doesnt make a difference. speaking of. the pc port here needs settings. and more features to be a 10/10. its very well done. it runs very well. I have near no issues. there were some cutscene crashes for some people on amd cards mostly from what I can tell at the start. which was patched out within 48 hours for most people. so who cares not a big deal I just watched the 2 cutscenes it crashed then skipped the second time no real issue. but yea. if the pc port got some love that would likely bring it right up to a 10.




I have literally no other issues with this game. And I wanted to point out that review bombing a game because no preload and because the console version has some extra little trinkets is completely juvenile. Guys. we need to calm the fuck down here and scale this back. You mf's are so crazy on your willingness to flood a game with bad reviews for basically nothing. what the fuck does preload have to do with ANYBODY looking at the game now? nobody cares if ps5 got a few more skins. its pointless. the game was mixed at launch. thats a complete fucking joke. starfield had better reviews at launch. rn the game is at 88 percent. it should be at 95+ but the entitled cry babies who were bitching about things like ""2 whole cutscene crashes for most people"" and ""i cant preload"" which has nothing to do with the game and everything to do with sony funding it. I'm easily willing to let sony's inferior shit pc get a couple bonuses if it means I get this game that has no microtransactions. is content complete day one. and had actually zero bugs minus the two quickly fixed crashes. some people have more issues with crashing. I'm not talking about them. they are justified in asking ""hey. fix. come on"" I'm just putting this here to say ultimately. Valve. fix your fucking review system its garbage. people shouldnt have to have a ""yes or no"" reccomend with no details and no easy place on the front page to report bugs and issues to other consumers. come on. this isnt necessary. the game should have 95 with those issues listed in some seperate section on the front page you can look at. why should i have to dig through reviews to see launch issues when its irrelevant to someone in 3 months if the devs patched the game. which they did. immediatly. 


enough of that. go buy this game now. stop looking at reviews. you dont need to. just buy it. it'll remind you of when you had your xbox 360, gamecube, ps3 etc and games came out and were fun and had everything. thats what this is. a gem. a real video game.",1706800542,1707526315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

if you dont know what monster hunter is then ill give a basic rundown of the gameplay loop. you pick a mission (most of which involves fighting a boss) you get resources from said mission to upgrade characters and you repeat. there is a LARGE variety of characters and although there are levels its not hard to reach max levels. rather most of the strength increases for each character involves the resources you grind for and the resources needed to max a single character is a lot between weapons, masteries, and sigils. 

there are a TON of characters each with at least 8 different skills (you can only bring 4 with you) so even playing the same character has some diversity to it. 

game is amazing honestly I really only have two issues. the game is popular but it also separates people by region and theres no crossplay between console and pc so the wait times for content that isnt late game gets real rough but if you are at the late game (at least currently) there is little to no wait time.

my other gripe is the story sucks. like it is genuinely the most mediocre hard to follow jrpg stuff that feels very uninspiring. it is a visually stunning game but I wouldnt be surprised if there was a single dude who was given a week to make the whole story because it is short and also SO MUCH content is behind the story so you feel incentivized to get it over with asap to get to the ""real"" game.

It's a Monster Hunter-style never ending buffet of boss fights! It doesn't really get difficult until you're in the endgame of the endgame, but by then you should have the resources to gear up and get the job done.

I've really enjoyed playing this game with friends, and there's a surprising amount of strategy around clearing bosses as quickly and efficiently as possible. And before I forget, each of the characters feels distinct and mechanically interesting to play, which is amazing, because they outnumber the weapon classes of Monster Hunter as of the time of writing.

The game is really fun, characters feel different, story is simple but interesting and questing is fun, but the matchmaking is not that great before you reach Maniac difficulty, and sometimes it will load indefinitely and crash, forcing you to restart the research or even close your game in the worst cases.

Thankfully AIs are fine, so playing solo is not that horrible, but AIs are not enough in endgame content, some bosses can be really challenging.

On an other note, the game looks wonderful, especially in the cities (game's hubs) which are just gorgeous, the Granblue Fantasy artstyle is perfectly brought to life in 3D and finally being able to visit the skies is really refreshing.

- Customization of playing styles (there is a around 20 characters and everyone can be builded in 2 or 3 different ways)
- Top tier boss design
- Well optimized
- Good IA on party members making it possible to play solo even in endgame (though still easier with coop)

the most negative thing about the game imo is the visual clutter from all the visual effect from skills(either party members or bosses) in simultaneous that makes the combat messy at times, but this is something standard to jrpg.

It has an annoying mascot with a shrill voice, a mysterious damsel in distress with Plot McGuffin powers, a melodramatic villain more concerned with theatrics than anything else, a completely forgettable protagonist, and a really unforgivingly bland introductory sequence which probably only makes sense if you've played some ten-year-old gacha game. 

The gameplay itself is acceptable for an ARPG, but nothing groundbreaking and a bit more on the spammy button mashing type with twitch dodge/guard mechanics and stay-out-of-the-giant-ground-markers gameplay. It's definitely alright, but you may not want to pay full price for this game since there's better ARPGs out there and Dragon's Dogma 2 is around the corner anyway.

Update: Granblue Fantasy Relink is kind of difficult to review because I want to like it, but feels like the game developers have never made a computer game before.  The Steam release is plagued with technical issues, such as the DualSense controller support being terrible (my directional buttons don't work at all and I need to use the keyboard for items despite them being completely functional in other games), and other issues like being the only game in the last 5 years I have bought which cannot get screen resolutions correct. Anything other than default 16:9 resolution isn't supported and god forbid you try running the game on borderless with multiple monitors, because it will assume your primary display is 16:9 and split the screen across both monitors. I have never ever spent so much time fighting with game configurations and worse yet, losing.

Despite that, a lot of effort went into the combat, which can be enjoyable. There's a lot of content to grind, but the game feels soulless and shallow because of how amazingly linear it is. I wish Cygames had showed similar care when it comes to their characters, half of which have no impact on the story whatsoever outside a Visual-Novel-esque questline which is basically a voiced-over narrative. I don't really think this game was what I was expecting when I saw the trailer four years ago and I do feel a bit let down, but the game isn't bad, it's just amazingly unpolished.",1707324532,1707503499,False,4,0,0.487718671560287476,2,True,False,False

Many people will compare this to stuff like Phantasy Star, Monster Hunter, or other such games.
This is its own unique game I feel. There are so many different characters each with their own game play style to enjoy, and the curve to master each of them is fun and rewarding.

I'll keep this short by saying the thing I love most: THE ENDGAME. 

Though it's absolutely unnecessary, I love how, if you grind enough, you can absolutely overpower yourself to the point where you can completely destroy all of the bosses on the hardest difficulty. 

Do you need to do it to beat everything in the game? Absolutely not. Not at all, and yet it feels so rewarding when you fully awaken your best weapons, fully gear and optimize your characters. It feels so rewarding to go in and smack fights that you once had to struggle to learn and progress through once upon a time.

Putting the game on the shelf now and might come back for the upcoming Luci boss/raid but unsure. Would overall recommend the game regardless.

Pros:
- Amazing battle soundtracks and music, the specific boss to unlock Proud difficulty is probably the best soundtrack IMO.
- Very fun and flashy combat, never got old or boring for me to use skills and attack.
- Animations are very smooth. Everything feels good to do, feels good to play. Dodges, blocks, moves and all that are very satisfying.
- Polished game in general. Did not personally experience any bugs or performance issues. UI was clean and felt like an actual finished game.

Cons:
- Forgettable, generic story. I didn't really get the game for the story so it doesn't matter to me but honestly if you're looking for a good JRPG story and only that, I couldn't recommend this game.
- Endgame grinding lacks variety - The dungeons/instances where you grind for your endgame curios/gold/Terminus will pretty much be the same with no variety. Terminus weapon boss isn't mechanically intensive and just effectively a big meat sponge. As someone who loves endgame grinding, honestly felt like the journey in this game was more fun than the destination.
- No anti-cheat. Subjective in some ways since you can beat the whole game solo and there's no competitive aspect (e.g. leaderboards, PvP, etc.) but I'm still of the opinion that any game that can be played multiplayer should have anti-cheat. It's lame when you queue up for a boss and someone just one-shots it in a single second.

1. Stuck on ""Connecting..."" loop.
2. Doing more than 1 ""Quick Quest"" in succession can soft lock your game, requiring you to restart it. 
3. Random ass error messages such as ""Another player has cancelled the match"" or ""A network error has occurred"". None of these messages mean anything to the player and the game needs to do a better job of articulating actual useful information. Bring the player back to matchmaking or produce an error message that is helpful as to show the player why they weren't able to be brought back into matchmaking. 

Despite the flaws above, it's still a good game for co-op (when it works); recommend getting it with a group of friends once the issues have been ironed out. Random matchmaking is good too but you'd want the goofs and gaffs of playing with friends in a game like this that can otherwise take itself too seriously in the endgame.

The campaign is like Devil May Cry series, in which you run through several main missions, and as you progress, you unlock more and more moves, skills, characters and difficulty. Which by at the end of the game - if the gameplay clicks with you - you'll want to do more of it with higher difficulty with the build you thought of.
The grind is quite similar to Monster Hunter and Warframe, in the sense that you re-run some missions to farm exp, skill points and materials, then you go fight the big boss to farm rarest material and weapon drops.

If all of the above piqued your interest, I can wholeheartedly recommend it for you. Yes, the main story campaign is quite short (~15 hours with extra 5 hours for the epilogue) but that's quite on par for action games, and the bulk of your game time would be grinding the post game missions, which could easily go way beyond 50 hours in my rough estimates. My only complain is just that I want more of the story, since it's very good imo and reminds me of ye olde classic JRPG stories, and it also feels like one of the many adventures that Granblue Fantasy could have, which I hope Cygames will add more stories for the game, as new characters are coming as DLCs.

The big differences is the RPG progression so you can get stronger in many avenues while playing. Several different characters with different play styles and their own skills. Lots of additional post game content.

That said. It's not perfect. I've had an encounter with the ""blackscreen on boot"" that a number of other people are reporting. I've concluded it dislikes my Gulikit Kongkong2 bluetooth controller. Turn it off and game boots just fine and then turn it back on once I get to the menu.

So beware of that! Maybe wait another week with buying the game if you are uncertain, see if they fix that issue first.

Campaign is a little short if your looking for something FF-esque. Story is quite predictable. Bossfights are a bit easy, even on hard, and if you accidentally over level the bosses by doing some early side content  *cough*might have done that abit*cough* you'll end up with a bit choppy fights where it just keep jumping from ""phase""/cutscene to cutscene. 

So is the campaign bad? No, but if you spend 60€ for the story only I'd wager you'll be a bit disappointed. 

I had a great time just breezing through the campaign and enjoying the world and vistas. The game reminded me of how freaking long ago it was since I enjoyed a game, and world, as much as I enjoyed Ocarina of Time  (which was not exactly yesterday...)

So, now... 
- if you don't mind a ~15ish hour campaign with a very goodie good anime protagonist
- if you like the fast paced Monster Hunter-ish combat and a similar-ish mission system that takes over after the campaign. 
- if you like gearing up, leveling characters, figuring out which set of gear give you the best versatility and dps potential, and watching the characters stats break all the limits of the universe

This might be for you. 

Cutscenes during bossfights pretty much go away after the campaign making the fights even more fun. If you use the online feature to play co-op with people I think you'll have a blast.

I never played the old mobile games, but didn't feel too left out of the story on this one. The story is reminiscent of the golden age of the Tales Franchise (actually reminded me a lot of Tales of Eternia for those lucky enough to play that on the PSP back in the day), and is a really nice mix between the good parts of Genshin Impact, Final Fantasy, the Tales franchise, and the Mana franchise. A lot of JRPGs seem to be quite derivative of each other, but this one at least has enough of an idiosyncratic style to make it a refreshing experience. The visuals are gorgeous, the combat is live action and feels very fluid, the mechanics are intuitive and just feel good, and the character development is surprisingly robust. Fully voiced dialogue, unique character interactions based on your party composition, and despite the disappointment of not being able to do co-op for the main story, the co-op is quite fun. It reminds me a lot of Monster Hunter World in that regard. I haven't finished the game yet, but it seems like the post-game content is quite extensive. The only disappointment is that, while you can play as other characters, you can't switch which characters you control unless you're in a resting zone. Would have been nice to switch through the party mid-combat. The best part about this game is that it's the sequel to a mobile game, and there isn't a single micro-transaction that I've found. I'm normally not a big fan of anime games, because I find the english VA's and dialogue translations a bit cringe, and while there is some of that (I think it's just unavoidable for the genre, but it's just my personal opinion either way), I found the dialogue to be well-written, and the VAs did an excellent job. The characters have a lot of personality, which is cool for a game of this nature.",1707473090,1707473090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Main story was generic JRPG stuff, fate episodes(characters' personal stories) kinda redeemed the story content in the game, but their presentation is bland - prob my biggest gripe with the game as a granblue enjoyer; There were some flashy moments and cool minigames in the main story tho so + for that

Core gameplay is a mix between MH/Tales/FF14, feels very responsive and all the chars I've played are distinct and a blast to play with, the link system combined with everyone using their special attacks consecutively for a big combo explosion feels very rewarding to pull off even though it's not hard at all - it just feels satisfying

Voice acting to me is a big part of this game as all characters interact with every other character mid-fight, because of that the fights feel a lot more teamwork-oriented and all the lines fit every char's personality perfectly, that being said I think this is only applicable for the JP version of the game as it's just stacked with insanely good VAs - if you feel like you can understand some JP or want to play in JP then this will be a + for you, if you choose the EN dub I think this will detract from your experience

Progression is smooth and upgrades don't really take more than a few runs until the final parts of the endgame, boss variety is slightly short of where it should be, but most of the bosses offer a good challenge or are at least fun to fight, with some having special interactions that make the fight easier

Overall I'm having a great time with the game and I think it is solid, well polished, looks really good with its unique artstyle despite having lower fidelity graphics, plays smooth as butter and I can weeb out all I want when I listen to my fav chars from the franchise completely pop off in a proper 3D environment

If you have play any of the Warriors games before, you will feel right at home with this one. From the way missions start, to side quest, specific character quests related, is easy to see where they got their inspiration from. The advantage in this one so far, is that 4 characters can level up at the same time, since you can have a party, something I dont remember been able to do in the KOEI TECMO games. Also, like those games, you have tons of characters to play as and level up, and grind items for to keep you entertain for dozen of hours and features and online function which I have not try yet.

It also features gameplay mechanics similar to the last iterations of Ys games, where the you have a party of 4 and you learn skills that help you in battle, it has similar link attacks, ultimate attacks, and boss  can be stagger in a similar pattern as well.

Basically the game plays like if the Warriors games and Ys had a baby, it would be something like this.

I have several hours in Monster Hunter-type games, and this definitely hit home for me. The main story is understandable for someone that isn't familiar with the series, and although there are some nods to events that have happened previously, the game does a good job of helping you understand what it's talking about.

The endgame loop is great - you have so many characters to level up and ""perfect"" and so many ways to get the items you need to do so (although some ways introduce a sprinkle of gacha elements to it, which makes sense, but didn't disrupt the flow for me). I'm not by any means done with the game, and hope that others give this game a chance to - it was very ""over-the-top"" and almost TOO anime at first glance, but I've really come to enjoy all the unique characters. Seeing that they already have a roadmap available of a raidboss and more playable characters coming out gives me hope for this game's growth.

Edit after 65 hours: The last difficulty, Proud, is challenging and fun. I'm not a big fan of fighting 3 bosses simultaneously; it feels a bit artificial, but later you'll be fighting one boss and these type of raid bosses feel difficult. The grind for the last weapon, Terminus, is just that - a grind.

Main story lasted around 12 hours for me, I played on the hardest difficulty throughout pretty hard focusing the story and found it to only ramp to be challenging near the last few chapters of the story. The characters, gameplay loop, multiplayer endgame, graphics, and world building lead to a light fun animeish boss battler.        (Do the fate episodes)             

No DRM and has offline mode so I appreciate them for this. So far only 2-3 hours into endgame but it seems the end game is where the enemy variety drops off slightly , giving you stronger variants of past enemies with different movesets, but this may lessen or worsen the more I play. The difficulty can constantly ramp by completing hard and harder quests to unlock new difficulties leading to more challenge.

Either way I enjoyed the story alot, the mutiplayer endgame might be a tiny bit repetitive sometimes but with how light and fun the gameplay is I can see easily playing a ton of this with friends.

Cons:
-No crossplay (as of the time of this review, could come later)

What I liked
- The art style is incredible. The pixel count isn't the highest, but the lighting style they do with this game makes it look 10x better.
- The gameplay feels smooth. You click a button, it happens.
- Character diversity feels enough. Each character sufficiently feels different from each other in terms of gameplay.
- Despite low boss variety, it didn't really feel that repetitive. However, I could see how that's a con for others.
- Some fights are incredible. The first and last Proud level fight are very fun fights. Furycane during the beginning of the story is what really got me to go into the game.
- It's extremely approachable as a game. It feels easy to pick up.
- Very cinematic boss fights make the game much more fun.
- I think the only bugs I run into are camera angles during the story line, and all air attacks are incredibly buggy when you're fighting bosses like Vulcan or Bahamut. Very polished game.

It is what it is
- Full Auto Assist. Kinda interesting decision. You can't use it on later game modes, but it leads to a lot of people afk farming Extreme levels (but regardless you'd be able to do this with Maniac with enough investment w/ 3 AIs).
- Item caps on 999? Why? What's the point of this
- Matchmaking/COOP UI isn't really that great or intuitive.
- Kinda wished the story could be co-oped with your friends.
- The combat itself is not that complex, It's a little more complex than Kingdom hearts spam X, but it's also not as fleshed out like other games. For some reason the game insisted that all combos must start with X, and once they use Y, all remaining attacks must use Y. There's some characters, where I think would have greatly benefitted from a X Y alternating combo system. Regardless, they definitely added a lot of things to make ""spam x"" as interesting as possible.

What I dislike
- I don't understand the point of RNG drops that are ""You get it or you don't"" such as Dreaded Horn in offline games. Even though this has co-op, there is no centralized system in place to make ""you get it or you don't"" drops actually feel valuable and simply feel like a waste of time. RNG drops are ok, but it makes more sense to have something like ""you can get a drop from a pool of items"" and what item you get is random. They're fun the first time you get it, but once you realize you have to get it another 12 times, it stops being fun, and you start looking for non-gameplay strats like Autoplaying, Botting with a simple AHK script, or just hacking it. I will admit though, the last boss grind isn't as ""unfun"" as some of the other ones like doing Vulcan Bolla. Chasing Sigils aren't as boring because you do get sigils, its just a matter of what stats you get on them.
- I wish character builds were more interesting. Sigil system is alright, but I wish there were more interesting unique sigils. Some of the class sigils are cool, but others are kinda boring (Zeta is just 25% atk increase on a debuff she applies and the other one just makes you jump higher when you loop). 
- I wish some of the less useful sigils in the end game didn't have level caps to them so people could use them for specific scenarios or for fun - Stun Power, Throw, Fast Learner, Rupie Tycoon
- More clarity in some of the stats. Stun Power, unless I missed it, has 0 explanation as to what it actually does.
- UX/UI was clearly designed for console. It would've been nice to have at least some consideration for mouse like scrolling, selecting masteries when leveling them, zooming in and out. (I played mostly with controller).
- Story... is definitely a story. It feels very generic to me as someone who hasn't interacted with any previous granblue content. Even the character tropes and their backstories feel pretty generic with very little depth or care to them. It is presented very well though, which made it a lot more fun that it would have normally been.

EDIT:
I purchased the special edition and I don't even have the color set 1 unlocked on steam...
Even those able to play have problems like not getting rewards after quests in some situations, or report having multiplayer issues.

EDIT AFTER UPDATE:
The game finally launched.
Impressive so far, everything runs great now. 
Great presentation, seems very polished.
Now I can recommend it easily for those liking action rpg games.

AFTER 30 HOURS PLAYED:
It has more content than I anticipated and absolutely everything, I mean everything, is done right. (except maybe if you're over leveled and play with random people and your character scales down, then you're super weak compared to what you were at this point in time)
But when it's the other way around (you're not the one scaled down because everyone else is higher level than you) then it's great.
I guess playing with 3 people you know solves that 'problem' that only appears on random daily missions (you have to do 3 per day to get the tickets).
Other than that playing with friends and a cpu has been super fun during progression and we're far from finishing it, still 3 more difficulties to unlock that come with new mechanics.

[b]Mouse-unfriendly menus:[/b] Menus can not be controlled with the mouse. Navigating menus solely with a keyboard feels slightly clunky and controller-oriented.
[b]Excess mouse smoothing:[/b] Aggressive camera smoothing hinders aiming and responsiveness. Making some characters (especially Eugen) feel a bit cluckly when aiming.

First, this game is nothing like a Gacha game as it can be kind of comparable to, it's a more general JRPG with light anime tropes, but, a REALLY cool story (if not slightly friendship is magic-esque) but all that aside, the characters are really cool. 

You initially have to play as a very boring character but can eventually play as any of them.

I HIGHLY recommend doing some slight research on a character you like before unlocking as the crew cards at the start are very limited.

This game has some of the coolest boss fights I've seen as a Souls player and WoW Raider, it's a combo of those two, there are mechanics in some of them and I'm excited to try them in Co-op.

The games story is pretty short, my game time is extended from doing some side quests and stepping away, but the real meat of the game is the boss fights and side quests AFTER the main story to farm materials and XP to do stuff on harder difficulties. 

I played on hard and I only ever ""failed"" once, but never lost a boss encounter, it's very forgiving but I'm sure coop on harder quests will be more challenging, some of the characters are simply while others have crazy in depth aspects, none of them play the same at all and it's cool to find one you really synergize with.

I don't know how much of the farming aspect will make me dislike the game, but overall I really enjoyed the story, the art and characters are incredible, music as well, the set pieces and cut-scenes are nothing short of epic.

If you can look past the anime aspect and just enjoy it for a feel good fantasy, you will love this game.",1707445125,1707445125,True,1,0,0.50142282247543335,0,True,False,False

Pros:
There are many good things about this game that other comments have mentioned well enough.

Cons:
1. Stupid lockon system messes up your fight more than helps. I know the devs admitted this and are working on the improvements.
2. The camera control sucks. Still too slow at max. speed. The movement acceleration can't be turned off. Feels sluggish.  
3. Attack and skill visual effects very often blocks the entire view of the screen and I couldn't see shit
4. Bosses chained damaged very likely kills you if you make one error dodging it in the middle
6. I didn't know there is a damage cap system build in the game until I watched a YT video mentioning it. Mediocre ingame tutorial and explanation. There are other hidden things like this too.
7. Many other small things I don't bother mentioning but hurts the quality of life.
8. For those that care, this game is not like MH. It's more like a hack and slash game built in the core.

I want this game to be good. I'll wait for the updates so I can change my review to recommend.

As someone who's followed this since its inception years ago, it's hard to recommend this game other than for someone who wants to play it for the thematic experience. Though, the game is paced well enough into small bite sized parts that it feels less of a hassle to play through and more of a lighthearted stroll along a breadcrumb trail, where the breadcrumbs are really hard to eat but you have to eat anyway. Just make sure to start upgrading weapons early. Levels don't play too much of a large role as much as the weapon levels. Masteries are also a great point to remember doing frequently as soon as you have more points.

In the 12 hours of completing the main story (Prologue, Ch 1-9, Epilogue and part of Chapter 0), the endgame content barely opens up all the upgrade possibilities, quest difficulties and real multiplayer opportunities. Which sounds good. But in hindsight, the scripted boss fights are damage sponges as you mash your way through the core of your controller or mouse, you get thrown off course and have to run back to the boss every minute (I started using ranged characters after a certain giant boss), and story-wise, it's one failure after another. Not only does it start with a frustrating turn of events that Lyria can't seem to shake off being #1 most easiest target in the world, it takes 10 hours of pointless boss fights for her to just be handed back over by a betrayal to become a reverse betrayal...to get taken back again in exchange for someone else...until the final chapters play out then you'll see an annoying pattern here. Point being, every chapter, albeit paced very well, ends in some sort of frustrating tragedy sugarcoated in a small victory. Some if not most boss fights are scripted so even if you get its HP to zero the event goes on until a scripted wipe or a scripted victory. Feels very on-wheels for the most part until you just start grinding quest content a la Monster Hunter or Phantasy Star 12 hours down the line. By this time, most players would stop playing already. And I think those who are looking for the endgame content might not be patient enough to stick around and enjoy the main story unfold for 12 hours. It's like having to watch Game of Thrones ""play"" scenes because they put some important dialog for story or lore while they were at it...heaving.

For something Platinum Games had a hand in at one point of its development cycle, you'd think that the combat would be combo based, but no. It's very Genshin Impact-esque in that sense where each character does a few things distinctly different from the other with two main buttons and a 4-button skill set, and the point of unlocking new characters is for coolness and a better play-style that fits yours. Most characters are fairly generic and their backgrounds speak for themselves, but some do make a difference. I did enjoy playing Ferry, Nermaya and Yodarha. Despite Gran/Djeeta being a great support class, playing them is quite boring.

It's a very beautiful but frustrating game. I love it, but I hate it at the same time. Honestly, I would prefer watching this as part of the anime more than playing through it, albeit the pacing in this (other than the extraneously long boss fights) is very good as a video game. The writing though, is too much for a game. Take me one long road to tragedy like FFXV or FFXVI but stop slapping me with mini tragedies in every chapter, please. I really hope that they continue from the mobile game cos the writing for Relink is downright frustrating af... The entire game is about failure after failure after failure. Like if I were Gran, I would have just offed myself to save the world at a point near the end... XD And even if the ending is bittersweet with the hopes that you'll meet a certain someone again, I don't want to hold my breath and grind the rest of the endgame content to find out it's not written into the game, so I will end my adventure grind at this point until more conclusive information comes around.",1707442418,1707442418,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

Playing through the main story and doing the accompanying side quests will land you around 20 hours of playtime, which has been a point of contempt for some, however, I feel it's a completely acceptable playtime for what is essentially a linear gameplay experience. The game does offer additional challenges with it's Monster Hunter-esque quests in ""chapter 0"", however, most of this is upscaled content you've previously experienced throughout the main chapters of the game.

That being said, the music and art direction for this game is great. Voice acting is also superb, however, the English translation gets a bit too loose at times. I'm not too fussed if some liberty is taken with translations so that a character comes off as more natural sounding in English, however, hearing Io directly reference ""magical girl transformations"" feels pretty inappropriate of the entire setting they are going for, and I can't imagine she said anything close to that in the original Japanese version.

Easily recommended

======================================================================
The Bad:

1. Pretty Horrible English Translation
It's really horrible, if you understand even a bit of Japanese, you will easily get confused because the localizer really like to tell their own story with their own wording instead of just translate it as it is. 
If you understand Japanese a little, often what you heard and what you read will be so different.
It's not just complex sentences, even basic ones got butchered. 

They also like to use unconventional English, modern gen-z English, and pretty out of date slang, which really out of place and ruin immersion.
This is important because some characters portrayed differently from the original because of localizer can't help to keep adding/changing stuff in translation.

Example of the worst yet so far:
(JP): Hmm
(EN): A wishful thinking
Somehow they managed to translated ""Hmm"" into a sentence...

(JP): Are you two a couple?
(JP): What!? No, we are just working together
(EN): Are you two an item?
(EN): An item!? Gross, no we are not...
wtf even....

Another examples:
(JP): Exactly
(EN): Exactamundo

(JP): Still talking about that?
(EN): You guys are such a dork

(JP): (dodged thrown spear) That is absurd!!
(EN): (dodged thrown spear) Well that is just happened...

(EN) Often Vryn talks in blabbering childish manner unrecognizable English, can't even understand most part. 

Even sometimes when characters speak formal and common Japanese, they altered it with some slang and impression which made the characters really looks out of place and time.

2. Censored/Altered
Yes, they censored/altered several characters outfit by giving them ugly short pants.

3. Possible cheaters in co-op mode because there is no anti cheat present at the moment.


The Good:

- The game itself run pretty good on RTX 2060, it's not a resource intensive game
- The graphic is beautiful
- Movement and combat almost feel fluid, but not the level of DMC or Bayoneta
- Good amount of playable characters and every one of them is unique
- Satisfying combat
- Good amount of side and end game content especially if you want 100%
- Combat is still fun even in higher difficulty
- Co-op

It's just so sad the translation is so bad and has unnecessary censorship ruining the original visual artistic otherwise a good game.
Japanese game companies really need to wake up fast, listen and make games for your the gamer not the localizer.
Such a good game, ruined by horrible localization and censorship.

If you can tolerate all the negatives especially the translation, then it's safe to buy.",1706781353,1707428204,True,919,78,0.676272034645080566,0,True,False,False

Recommendation: neutral leaning positive for now based on good gameplay counterbalanced by some poor technical decisions (see below). 

I'm not very far into the game yet, so this review will be updated as I progress. If the game merits it, I will change the recommendation. I hear the endgame is where it's at, so we'll see how things go once I get there. 

Positives:
Granblue's art style has always been a positive, and that remains the case.
The music is engaging, though it may be time for Japanese games to shift away from the nostalgia piano/symphony style which seems ubiquitous in anime-inspired games. 
Combat is fun so far, though not particularly challenging, even on hard difficulty, even the bosses. 

Negatives:
The controls, the controls, the controls. 
Some of the choices the developers made here are baffling. 
Games have been offering the ability to remap buttons for so long this should be a standard feature in any game. You can remap the keyboard controls, yet GBFR does not let you remap the controller buttons. So, you're stuck dodging with RT and blocking with LB, weird choices in any game. 
Playing Eugen, when you aim his gun camera movement shifts from the right stick to the left stick, something I don't think any other game does. 
It's as if the developers didn't bother to play other successful games to see which control schemes work best and just reinvented the wheel. 
I hear a patch is in order to address button assignment, and it can't come soon enough.

Some settings choices are odd as well.
On the graphics side, you're locked into multiples of 16:9 resolution. If you have an ultrawide monitor, you can expect black bars.
Frame rate is capped at 30, 60, or 120fps. This makes me suspect the game uses frame data in multiples of 30fps for gameplay and move timing, another somewhat archaic system.",1707410915,1707426978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For fans like myself it is a way to experience the world and characters we know and love like never before.
For new people, while there is some lore left out, through both the main story as well as the fate episodes you learn most of what you need to know in regards to both the world and characters, it is a good way to jump into this fantastic world overall.

In regards to localisation, while I understand it isn't for everyone, coming from the existing Granblue Fantasy games this isn't really any different from what we know and love, so I have no issue with it.

Gameplay is a lot of fun, a number of different characters can be played and upgraded, each having their own playstyle and can be switched out from your party which can give a different experience as well. Additionally each have their own set of weapons that can also be upgraded just like the character, during the main story this isn't too big of a focus, but that switches when you get to the end. The main story somewhat serves as a tutorial in this regard.

Performance wise I didn't experience many issues, maybe a lagspike here and there, but they would quickly disappear or be fixed with a simple pause unpause, and this was shortly after launch.

Artwise the game is phenomenal and a beautiful rendition of what we already saw in the other games. 
Music wise it doesn't disappoint, Narita and Uematsu have done a phenomenal job with it.

There are some issues I have, for example the target lock/target switching can be annoying at times, but the cons are heavily outweighed by this game's pros.

Overall I highly recommend trying out this game whether one is an existing fan or a newcomer to the series.

i don't personally think 7/10 is bad number. its just decently good and i cannot stop playing it, specially with friend.
For Comparison Armored Core 6 and ER is 8/10 for me and i love it deeply.

coming from the web game player myself, story speaking its huge plot but not really that deeply important to main story currently. best thing to explaining the story is, its good spin off or 1.5 or web game story, but can't help to feel its just too short. 
for something like 15-20 hours in game time, for the story alone probably just like 3-5 hours and additional hours for post game story. just don't expect something big for the story.

gameplay wise its pretty simple and easy to learn.
the Level grind are super friendly. you can technically reach LVL100 by only doing new quest. no need to massively replaying some quest for grind. unless its for maximizing Weapon Cap and Rank.

for the graphic its pretty good, i like it a lot specially how the light do in the dusk. i love the art choice.

unfortunately, some cutscene are broken on released, but i think they already send some patch to fix the bug. didn't see any freezing cutscene after the update.

[b]Overall Impressions[/b]
While the game starts off with a mid campaign, (Albeit one with some unique moments that goes quite hard), even on it's hard difficulty, the campaign is largely a breeze to get through (Est. 10-20 hours depending on how thorough you are with side-content between main quests). The main cast of characters are decent although new players may be a bit confused given the canon ties in to the mobile gacha game this title is based on. My only gripe with the campaign is that none of the characters you unlock during it has no impact on the story and isn't even present in cutscenes even if they're in your party.

Where the game really shines is in it's endgame after you've finished the main campaign - Suddenly the decent action RPG becomes more of a Monster Hunter-esque experience with bosses to farm in order to upgrade your characters. As you progress through it you unlock higher difficulties with new bosses (or more difficult versions of previous bosses) New features, weapons and other gear to tweak and tinker your build.

Now your mileage in the endgame may wary depending on how invested you are into making a powerful build for your main, or if you want to dabble into more, or even all the characters (Of which there are many already, with another 2 confirmed for a later update.) The earlier difficulties are quite easy, though later bosses I'd liken to something akin to 'raid encounters' in other games with different phases and mechanics to be aware of. Another powerful looking boss is also planned for the game's first (Of hopefully many) updates.

More than anything else though, this game just feels like a complete package already, with seemingly little in the ways of mtx planned for it. It feels smooth on PC, I've experienced very little in terms of bugs and never had issues with performance, even on the more intense boss fights. There's no ""Waiting for a season"" or DLC or update that ""Fixes the game"".

Every character is unique enough to find something fitting your own playstyle in action games, as well as having their own unique dialogue lines. It feels like a 360/PS3 era titles where the story quests are just a bunch cool set pieces one after another, which can be good or bad depending on your perspective. It's a load of fun, and even more fun with a couple of buddies.

Problem is, I don't know where this game is going to be about 3 months down the line without those buddies. The game is set up in a way where it's highly dependent on having a multiplayer community, much like an MMO-lite/MO. I'm a week late to launch and the game is already to a point where, while trying to reach endgame, it's too tedious to solo, but too easy to get hard carried while queuing for multiplayer. The flash and effects of character skills look amazing, they can easily flood out the otherwise readable boss tells and AoE markers, making some fights much harder than they should be. 

While I was skeptical of this game since it seemed to be in development hell for the longest time, it ended up being a great one. Just fair warning though, if this game made you want to play the original Granblue Fantasy, well don't.

""Excellent presentation, average in every other respect.""


Specs:

Laptop: 2021 Asus Zephyrus G14 - Ryzen 9 5900HS, 16GB DDR4 3200 and a 6GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060

Performance (1080p/Ultra): 55 - 90 FPS Variable, typically runs between 55 - 72 FPS


Handheld: 512GB Steam Deck (Oct 2022) - CryoUtils, latest SteamOS updates, Proton Experimental

Performance (720p/Standard): 20 - 60 FPS Variable, typically runs between 30 - 40 FPS

Note: Do not use the game's built in V-Sync as frametime/pacing is very inconsistent. Either use your GPU's V-Sync or if you're on Steam Deck, lock the FPS to 40 via Steam OS. Leave the framerate at 120 FPS in-game. Performance remains smooth and feels responsive with no frame tearing to speak of.


Pros:

- Easy to play, even for someone who has never touched a Granblue Fantasy game before

- Visually stunning and full of great spectacle fights that are well designed, produced and executed

- Performs well enough for the quality of visuals


Cons:

- Easy to master. Every character has a gimmick to make them worth using, but none of the characters require dedicated practice to master. You should be able to understand them within 1-3 minutes of practicing at Sir Barrold.

- Difficulty is almost non-existent. I've been playing on Hard mode and have beaten every fight on the first try with minimal preparation. Mind you, I'm the kind of masochist that does naked low SL runs in Souls games for fun, so you'll probably have no issues with the difficulty if you're just the average player.

- The story, while it's serviceable and does a good enough job to incentivize the player to stay invested until the end, is not anything remotely close to the kinds of stories you would get from a game like Red Dead Redemption 2, Ghost of Tsushima or Witcher 3. It feels like a high production value, serialized anime on Netflix (e.g. Onimusha) as opposed to a grand odyssey with high drama, great dialogue with a satisfying climax. The story's sole purpose is to just give you an excuse to get to the next spectacle battle and well.. to be honest, that's perfectly fine for a game like this. I just put it under con because some people might go into this wanting an actually good anime story.

- Display options are extremely limited. You can adjust fps from 30 to 120, VSync is just On/Off, graphics options are just Standard/Ultra, you can adjust brightness and blur. No DLSS or FSR options. For Steam Deck, you cannot manually force a lower resolution in Steam OS to enable the use of native FSR 1, though you can likely edit an ini to force a lower res. I have not done this, so I cannot speak to whether or not it'll work or if it'll even look decent if it does. 

- Do not play this game in a dark room with the brightness even at 50%. Opening the menu screen is akin to having a flashbang go off, it's so damn bright! I would implore the devs to include background options for the menu screen so that we can change it to something darker.


Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a fun game with really cool spectacle battles and a well thought-out, though disappointingly easy action battle system. The controls are fluid and responsive, even in low fps situations on the Steam Deck and I keep having to pick up my jaw from the floor as the visual splendor of the game does not stop for even a minute. Unfortunately, even with online co-op, this truly is a ""beat and uninstall"" game as there are currently no incentives to replay the game, let alone master it. This is one of the few times I curse myself for being a massive Souls/Monster Hunter fan. Apparently four updates to the game are planned, including a raid boss designed for cooperative play and two new characters, but that honestly isn't enough for me to want to reinstall after I'm done with this. Unless you are a big fan of the series, I'd say wait until this game is on sale for at least $40 USD, it's worth at least that much.",1707406751,1707406751,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Jokes aside, after having finished the main story and having gotten a taste of post-game content, I can confidently say that this game is a lot of fun. The gameplay is very flashy and fast-paced, yet it still manages to feel very fluid. Every character (at least the ones I played so far) feels very unique and the skill-tree (mastery) goes very deep. There's also a lot of variety in the form of different skills that give unique effects and can change gameplay dramatically. 

Aside from a few smaller things, the only thing that I think is a missed opportunity and in turn didn't really like, is the main story being singleplayer (even though I did enjoy it), meaning you can only do side-quests with friends.

And let me say it does not disappoint,  starting off into the fantasy world you wake up surrounded by friends, (if you want to get a feel for the characters you can watch the first two episodes of the anime) and you then choose who you want to main. (if you've played the gacha game then you'll already be familiar with these characters)  The story didn't take long to clear maybe 10-15 hours if you watch all the cut scenes and explore + whatever ""current"" difficulty you choose to clear it on from easy to hard.  Now regarding how good the story was I would give it a 7/10 even though i love the characters and the development it was predictable at times but also feel like this is a fair score.

After that's done then you can finally get into the meat and potatoes known as post game, MH fans should be familiar with this, you have to clear rows of quests to unlock the next difficulty to progress and get those materials you need to further upgrade.   in terms of building characters in this game though you have numerous options to build from sigils (perks) to weapon levels and masteries as well as choosing what skills you want to use. 

Now regarding the best part of the game, the combat is pretty good in all honestly it feels so fluid and each character plays differently which keeps things exciting.  You have a party of 4 and control one character even in early difficulties you can let the game play for you in assist mode or go full hands on you choose your experience. Anyways regarding the teamwork you can choose to do co op or the solo experience (let me say this AI is probably one of the most competent AI I've seen in gaming in a long time)   from linking skills to chaining ultimates, as well as dodging and coordinating who does what for the team and forming the best experience possible is whats keeping me and probably others HOOKED. 

Regarding the bosses, the difficulty for the story wasn't too bad for me personally (and will vary from player to player) starting on Hard but after beating that and going from Hard-Very Hard-Extreme-Maniac-Proud I noticed the spike in difficulty Very Very Quickly, But it was done tastefully as bosses didn't become HP Sponges but instead became more chaotic in a fun way.  

Regarding the endgame loop, its you min maxing characters to get ready for future raids and helping your friends out with quest, all in all I would put this game as a Buy Right Away if anything mentioned caught your attention and i say this game is a easy 4/5",1707385474,1707385474,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

To obtain it, you must defeat the final boss and hope for a drop that grants you a random weapon for one of your unlocked characters. However, the drop rate for this coveted weapon varies greatly, ranging from 3-5 runs if you're fortunate to a staggering 20-30 runs for others. If you are a solo player like me. it takes about 10-15 mins on a random queue, and victory is not guaranteed. 

Luck was clearly not on my side. Having unlocked all the characters, which further increased the difficulty and the chances of getting the final weapon for IO, I found myself empty-handed after the first 20 victory runs. The prospect of potentially facing the boss 300 times or more, which easily translates to 60 hours of battling the same scenario, is daunting to say the least.

Other JRPGs really need to look a this game and learn from Granblue how to really bring the anime level of spectacle into the video game scene.

The only big criticism I have of the game is that it is far too easy, even on Proud. The difficulty of the storyline is OK although still easy on ""Hard"" mode -- but about what I would expect for a game that wants people to be able to get through the story. The post-game high difficulty content though? Not exactly high difficulty. The critical bar (how many times/how long you can be dead before the quest games over) is just far too generous, and potions too. Unless your whole team wipes multiple times you can get through things quite easily and anyone used to MMO raids should be able to handle the mechanics with almost zero difficulty.

Really hoping the future content will address that and give us a true difficult mode. I'll update this review then if that happens.

Overall I'd give it a 9/10 -- just give us a bit more meat to chew on in the hardest encounters!",1707380689,1707380689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Expected more combat wise for it to be something platinum games was involved in but it's still better than most anime games of this genre. Graphics are incredible as well only terrain I didn't like was the sand I always thought those scenarios are very empty and boring but it's good variety. 

Combos are okay. I've tried my best making stylish strings of moves but this combat is not entirely flexible for that and it is somewhat of a button masher. Some characters are miles better than others. Bosses were impressive at times. Even in the hardest mode this game is still relatively easy but boss patterns were a sight to behold at times with cool looking moves.

Story is pretty basic anime but it's enjoyable and something about this game which is underrated is that it actually makes sense. If I run a trail to get a chest I actually teleport in front of the chest at the end instead of having to run back. It doesn't make you do the same thing for too long and they switch up the gameplay often. Runs smooth everything on high. NPC's are not dying all the time and actually have a combat sense. 

I usually avoid buying games full price but this game deserves it in my opinion. It's a fresh new take and series and they're doing their own thing. Music is good and the scenes is genius looking.

Thats all I can say. But read further if you have either an older system or an ultrawide monitor or plan to play with a PS5 controller.

Its got some problems at the moment (launch week) most are addressed via mods or tweaks or developer updates.
The most critical issue was fixed a few days back with a patch from the dev team (the game would not launch on some systems or would freeze instantly and randomly crash on cutscenes).
The second most critical issue is Avx2 required, but this only affects people with older CPU's (2nd/3rd gen Intel). If you fall in this category: DO NOT BUY. You will not be able to play, period. It just simply won't launch for you.

Those two critical issues aside...
If you plan to play with a PS5 controller: You will need to install DS4 for Windows and then disable Steam Inputs under Properties > Controller. If you do not do this, your controller will time out randomly and often freeze your steam. Hopefully the devs fix this, but in the meantime, you have this option.
For PS5 icons, there is a mod that swaps the XBOX icons for PS5 ones.
If you have an ultrawide monitor: The game has no ultrawide support at all, but there is already a mod by Lyall that fixes almost everything.

*******************************************************************************************************
Performance wise while being fluid and being able to maintain high framerate its not great and kind of worrying. GPU utilisation is all over the place and potentially a kick in the nut for the long term health of the card as the temperature fluctuation while playing are out of this world.

TEMPERATURE 3080TI EVGA FTW3 NO WATER LOOP (clean and well ventilated in a corsair 5000D airflow) FRAMERATE LOCKED TO 75FPS:
Idle/Walking in open space: 40-55c
Villages: 50-65c
Combat: 70-75c
Dialogue/Cinematic: 75-78c (100% GPU util for some reason)

In comparison Cyberpunk Give me a constant 70c-75c while Grandblue GIve me an inconsistent and fast shifting 40c-78c .

Those temp By themselves are more than fine IF those are constant but in this game your GPU is going to jump from low temps(40 for me) to high temps(78) constantly which cause constant dilation/constriction of the card component and premature paste drying which is the real long term card killer.

I think about WHY I like something or, rather, what compels me to do something like play a game repeatedly.  Video games, by admission of designers, can be flagrantly designed to be addictive.  I feel that this should be said before anything else.

Do I recommend Granblue Fantasy Relink?  No.  I don't.  I think there are a lot of cynics who feel like tradition only applies as, to them, it is seemingly being established.  Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a game that is the product of the work between Platinum Games, who for reasons that I have to say aren't fully known to me left partway through the game's development, and Cygames.

I will be upfront, I really like action games.  I am not a fan of Platinum Games so much as they are, or were, a source of designers and developers who formerly worked for Capcom.  It's a long, complicated history, but to keep it brief, they are a developer I keep my eyes on, even if I haven't bought a game from them in quite some time.  This one had me curious, because of Platinum Games leaving partway through development.  Cygames, in contrast, are a company that has developed a, as of today, successful profit extraction mobile game/PNG Dispenser RPG, Granblue Fantasy.  

In a move to broaden the appeal of the brand, love speaking like I'm greasy, Cygames commissioned two games based on Granblue Fantasy.  The fighting game, Granblue Fantasy: Versus and, this game I'm reviewing, the Action RPG Granblue Fantasy: Relink.

There are a lot of weirdos who don't realize that not everyone hangs onto every word or press release of a game.  I have not followed this game's marketing.  So, in that sense, I wasn't sure what this game was going to be.  Turns out, it is a game in the tradition or Monster Hunter.  This is where I can get to the point of where it applies to the reader of this review:

Do you like Action RPGs like Monster Hunter or games similar or adjacent to Monster Hunter?  Because that, ultimately, is what Granblue Fantasy: Relink is, and sadly it doesn't really do much to really break the mold of this tradition while, simultaneously, embodying all of the flaws of a Hunting game in terms of the things it tries to do.

There are people who like to dismiss the main scenario of these games.  These are individuals who I think are pretty stupid.  The game MAKES you play the story in order to get introduced to mechanics, the flavor of the game, and this is the tradition that I think Granblue Fantasy: Relink really fails to improve on or do anything of interest with other than to carry the torch of the flaws of this kind of game and what typically happens.

Instead of being able to play with your friends, you will have to make yourself play a game with a story aimed at adolescents and with, sadly, comparable mechanics and design.  Granblue Fantasy: Relink's story, if we're just comparing it to games that are aimed at a young audience, isn't interesting, but more importantly it isn't something that is interesting to experience save for these little glimmering moments that, I'd bet money frankly, are indicative of the fun that Platinum Games brings to their video games.  I wouldn't trust Cygames to design their way out of a paperbag when it comes to action, call me crazy but I just have a hunch who was bringing the meaningful experience to this project.

I enjoyed the segments that clearly are reminiscent of Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.  The game had long lost my attention, as I think the world of Granblue Fantasy embodies all the things that make Japanese cartoons based on shonen style fantasies so disposable and uninteresting.  So it would have been up to the game to really carry the brand, so to speak, and unfortunately I think Platinum's departure made for a much worse title.

Why?

Well, this game has one of the worst cameras I've ever experienced.  It poisons a lot of what you might get out of this game as just shameless junk food if you like action games.  If you like deck building and being mentally addled by shameless gambling, waiting for weapons or items or any number of things to drop or a number to go up, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is okay.  It is a mediocre game that has glimmers of greatness and even just fun missions.  But that camera needs to be able to frame the action, and the reason I've segue'd into talking about the game as junk food is because there are plenty of characters to use that are tantamount to the weapons that create different playstyles in Monster Hunter...

And this is where the problems start.  Unless you're playing as a character in the main cast, your character will never really be rendered in the main story.  The main scenario doesn't do a lot to really commit to having a dedicated cast of characters and instead of treating the additional characters of Granblue Fantasy as a bonus, Granblue Fantasy: Relink tries to have its cake and eat it too by just having throw away dialogue where you can imagine your character as ""having been there"" but their presence has no texture or real substance.  It's clear that the story is about certain characters and Granblue Fantasy: Relink isn't brave enough to work with that premise.

Why that should matter is that, your friends won't be able to play cooperatively with you, which is a problem with certain Monster Hunter games but to an even greater degree because now you have a story that you have to play by yourself.  I'd actually say this is more of an issue in Final Fantasy 14, which is a game I'd say probably has the actually worse version of this problem.  The game is very concerned with you, the player, experiencing a single player mode **by yourself**, yet weirdos/the supposed appeal of the game, is about the MULTIPLAYER part.  Crazy, right?  Wow, who would ever hold that against a game, crazy... just make yourself play the game, bro.  Don't get something that's actually treating that well or thoughtfully, just do what I say!

Your friends can't take the role of the principal characters of Granblue Fantasy and play the story with you.  This means the story mode is just something you want to ""get over with.""  It has no appeal of its own... it's in the tradition of mediocrity.  Some idiot would say ""That's how these things go"" and I'm just going to say, when you see some doofus burying the bar under the ground, I'm just gonna call it what it is: Bad, lazy... you name it. 

They didn't have to do that, but they did. 

So the camera and the lackluster scenario means that you have to have a predisposition to this type of game.  To me, if that is the case and the game has such a fundamental problem on top of having Cygames style gacha hooks and things that just kind of run part and parcel with this kind of Action RPG/Hunting game... I'd say that unless you REALLY, REALLY like this kind of game to a fault, I don't recommend it as it is.

It doesn't have any serious performance issues, I don't really care about the localization and I understand Japanese, I think it's up to taste, I like Japanese voices, mileage may vary... 

No, the reason I don't recommend this game is because it's just kind of okay while leaning on the side of irritating.  I'm doing the same stuff I've done in the past with other hunting games, rushing through quests, not seeing much reason to taste the food and lamenting the main scenario being so weakly presented.

It's not a bad game, but it could have been a good one.",1707366962,1707367358,False,1,1,0.442953020334243774,0,True,False,False

I honestly recommand this game when it comes to story telling that makes you feel part of the fight through its challenges, battles & each boss felt like a darn boss alright since I like souls games and tales of series, Thats why since it has wonderful visual combat & atmosphere and each character with their unique fighting style that you may build them according to your fighting standards of approach as you level up finish quests to earn skill points & get stronk each chapter or mission.

Edit:- 49 hours 
Honestly for knowing there is an aftermath story just made it better for me glad kept doing side missions & putting my characters to work and facing few new bosses for a change.
I like how they're Nerf those at level 100 that are joining off a starter player or around level 60 to keep the boss enjoyable and manageable for both players to overcome it in a good pace.

Edit 2:- 108 hours
After beating the game 100% achievement discovering mini and major parts of the game that you may adept through your journey and experience I honestly would love to say this game deserves the love and attention it seeks as I hope it continues to support its fan base and community with its future development.

Cant wait to see other antagonists bosses and story line within this game to fight em and experience terror 

Low key this game gave me old games nostalgia such as ""White Knight Chronicles 2"" ""Ex Troopers"" ""Freedom Wars"" ""Monster Hunter"" from its Story approach, Mechanical Fighting style Quirks , Character enhancement upgrades, Coop mode online and Mission progress 
__

-The only downside I had is:-

-The release pre-download where everyone could start playing on time because not everyone has time to download since our schedule could be tight.

-Would be nice to add Playstation control buttons as an option in the menu which is a minor issue ""got used to it""

-Sometimes you may glitch against boss if your character has a striking attack from above like zeta or lancelot against the magma boss and register you as fall while fighting his chest area

-The target system for controller Idk about pc, but its all over the place when there is alot of target lol ill be fighting one mob my character be like chasing another target or it automatically attacks to the closest object it can get its hands on even though I turned off that option",1706868969,1707363843,True,7,0,0.624786794185638428,0,True,False,False

It hits hard in both style, and combat - one of which I've found lacking in just about every arpg I've tried. Code Vein was very stylish, but the combat felt weightless. Scarlet Nexus had great combat, but regularly looked like shit (straight up powerpoint cut scenes). Tales of Arise came close, but didn't grab my attention the way this game does. The new Hyrule Warriors was probably the closest as it had a great cast of characters, unique play styles for each character, and of course looked beautiful with the Breath of the Wild visual style. But Granblue just feels like it knows exactly what I want. The combat is crunchy as hell and I can feel every hit that lands, and even more so when you land timed attacks. Just about every characters attacks and skills are so over the top in just the right way, and so vibrant I just wanna stare at the animations and not the boss that's about to hit me. The monster hunter like structure also helps keeps rewards flowing, and enough stuff to do in between missions so that it doesn't get boring.

My only disappointment is that it's made for ""casual"" console gamer so combat gameplay/mechanism will only be as good as what casual gamepad user allow it to be. (target lock on, very limited number of usable skills/spells, .....etc...etc). 
The game doesn't even have proper mouse camera control. Feel very unresponsive like you are playing a laggy game.

Since this is kind of a new franchise/company, I brought the game full price. But If they were to make a sequel or something, I will most likely not even buy it unless it's a dedicated PC game.

I suppose it's not bad, just not worth the price of admission.  I see comments about how the English localization is bad, but, as someone who speaks English, I'm tired of weebs saying that ""if the voice acting sounds bad in English, it's because bad localization.""  No, everything is localized fine.  They're speaking well enough.  The issue is the way the story itself is written.  It's just typical anime cringe.  That's fine if you enjoy that, but making it Japanese doesn't fix it's over the top campy-ness.  It only makes it so I can't understand the cringe lines.  Frankly, Japanese in anime sounds much more campy and over acted than these English translations.  No, localization is not the issue.  The English language is not the issue.  It's just generically written.  And I mean, I can enjoy some over the top camp.  Reincarnated as a slime is bad, but lovable.  Persona 5 gets pretty campy, but it's still enjoyable.  This feel forced.  Maybe it's because they're throwing me into  the middle of an adventure.  Show me how these characters meet.  Don't expect me to play a shitty mobile game to get the full story.  You throw me into a flying boat with a bunch of people talking about how much they love adventuring together and how much they enjoy each other's company, it's not good writing.  I feel like I'm almost being pandered to.  If it was $30, I'd say ""yeah go wild.""  But, as much as I'll likely continue to play it, I can't recommend others purchase it, certainly not for $60.

I have gotten all the way up to the Proud difficulty, primarily because I heard the game ""gets fun at the end"" Which honestly it doesn't.

The entire game consists of the same monsters and mobs just reskinned like 3-4 times.  and not even reskinned like monster hunter world does with new abilities and different patterns, it's literally the exact same but instead of (example) inflicting poison it inflicts burn. 

Story is pretty mid, nothing riveting like I said fell asleep. 

The couple thing this game does good is that it has great animations and the characters talk to each other during combat. That's about it for me really.

Biggest issues so far are: 
• Controller stops working now and then, have to relaunch the game for it to start working. 
• The matchmaking is weird sometimes. Don't know if the devs have sorted out the issue where you have to set Download Region.
• Minor stutterings at times.
• Some performance tweaking is needed from the devs

• No ultrawide support, but that is nothing I really care about, it will just be a plus if they decide to add it later!

If you only finish the story you miss out on a huge portion of the game. I speedran the story in about 10 hours and it took me another 50 to see everything, if youre not a godgamer like me youll need longer. Endgame has A LOT of recolours with vastly different mechanics ü a couple of completely new bosses and all of those get pretty damn hard near the end.

The game is very good if youre looking for monster hunter style endgame. The bosses have a bit more MMO ish mechanics with lots of AoE, Adds and similair stuff.

The combat feels phenomenal. The camera and lock on dont cooperate as much as id like to on occasion but besides that its absolutely amazing. there is a plethora of characters with a good variety of very different playstyles. The animations and repsonsiveness as well as the sound design just make the game feel really good to play.

Theres a pretty good chunk of gambling for gear (think monster hunter talismans) and im a little worried that this is mostly intended as an introductory game to the franchise to get people to play the full on pay2win gacha mobile game of granblue fantasy and get people used to the gambling mechanics.
However in the game itself there is currently absolutely no actual pay2win.

As such it gets a huge recommendation from me. Very cool gameplay, lots of cool bosses, lots of characters to play.

EARLY PC PORT IMPRESSIONS:
I had trouble finding info regarding the port so here are my 2 cents so far:

Controls:
Fully functional key remapping for M+K including setting actions to mousethumb. Button prompts show up ingame as you set them via keymapping. (e.g. it shows the keyboard input bound to ""interact"" when standing next to an item)
Mouselook feels distinctly like a Console game ported to PC - the mouse movement doesnt perfectly align with look speed but rather simulates stick input. Its serviceable - i.e. better than some other ports (looking at you release version of WO LONG) - but very noticeable. 

Graphics:
I ran the game at a smooth and very stable 60 fps using the ingame fps lock (""fps target"" in settings). Maintained throughout the first major fight (the big Monsters are SPECTACULAR - full capslock). There is a reasonable number of customization options for graphics on PC considering its a port.
All settings on high/ultra @1080p 60fps.
3060 RTX, i5 12600K, WIN10 16 gigs of RAM, oldish SSD.

Loading is super fast so far. Hardly noticed any loading times.

tl;dr - good port so far with the sole exception of mouselook having the distinct console game port feel to it.",1706778595,1707340967,True,2,0,0.511689841747283936,0,True,False,False

Now entering the ""post-game"" content after ~14 hours. Just like Monster Hunter a lot of the game's content seems to be located AFTER you clear the campaign. For comparison, my weapons are level 75 and they seem to go up to 150+. My heroes are level 50-55 while the max level is 100 (I think). Some gear traits go up to level 45 and the highest I have is 5.

The story is its weak point imo. I understand that it has to do with already developed characters from past games/anime or whatever else but it still didnt feel that great. Its way too much of your stereotypical anime ""power of friendship"" type of stuff with characters that constantly feel the need to express how much they care about each other. I've watched anime and shows with the same themes but this story just drowns in it. The good things about it is that it has good setpieces, the voice acting is really good and its also short (around 10-15hours).

The progression systems are really good, at face value it looks like A LOT and while there is a lot of grinding (especially if you wanna have more than 1-2 mains)  its not as much as you might think, you get materials fairly fast and missions are by nature not that long.

The game is mission based, a bit like Monster Hunter. You have a hub where you upgrade, get side missions, story stuff etc (with some mild exploration elements)  and a quest counter that sends you out into an arena (most missions are bosses) or to do your next story quest. The number of bosses is average. Not too few but not many either. Theres a good amount but I'm hoping for more content in the future (which the devs have confirmed I believe).

My main complaint is that the game is a bit too easy as of right now. I just made it to Proud difficulty (highest difficulty in the game) and it is NOW that I'm even mildly tested. Everything else up until now, while extremely fun, has been a breeze, and I doubt Proud will be too hard since my main character isnt even close to maxed out yet.

EDIT: Another negative I forgot to mention is the fact that the game is region locked on PC for whatever reason (part of ports being bad because nobody cares about PC I guess). Thankfully it uses your steam download region to determine where you are so all you have to do is change that whenever you want to play Granblue Fantasy. It only requires a steam restart and the game launches super fast so for me that hasnt been a huge problem, but certainly annoying.",1707332873,1707335485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is well paced, a bit basic and fairly cliche, but realistically it's fun and wholesome or the most part with a few nice twists.

This games overarching gameplay content is the winner here, and by a significant margin. It works similarly to something like Monster Hunter, but more fast paced and arcadey.

I main Katalina and am not really happy with her design.

I played the game through the campaign with I think one crash, which is acceptable. Then after the campaign I had about a day of questing with a couple crashes. Now I crash all the time. Sometimes it is during the loading of the quest, sometimes in the middle, and the worst part, sometimes after I have finished the quest while it is in the death animation. I can repeat a quest 10 times no crash and I can load into the same quest and it will crash 20 seconds in.

I am unfamiliar with the anime (hell, I only heard there was such a thing from a friend after I completed the story) and tend not to be fan of the multiplayer RPGs, but this game allows you to get by very well with Singleplayer only. 

The story was a bit brief for an RPG, but there is plenty of lore hidden in menu's, special quests and items to pick up, and so the game does a good job at rewarding exploration both in-game and in the menu's. 

The artstyle is lovely. I particularly like how the further-away parts were less anime artstyle and more paintbrush strokes. 

The combat is fun. it sort of reminds me of Dynasty warriors, but less 1v1000. Still, you do take on groups and the boss battles are spectacles and highlights.

I am 53 years old, and I can not relate to a teenager or a preteen heroes.  
 
The graphics are OK, the art is OK, the story and acting?  Awful.  its like a bunch of 12 year olds got together and wrote a story for a school project.

I can not recommend this game at least to any adult out there.  Not sure if this is really for kids either as I didn't get very far into the game with all the cringe acting and story, but it does not seem to me it was made or written with adults in mind.

Since the last patch, I haven't experienced any crashes, even during cutscenes which did cause crashes beforehand. I finished the 10 main story chapters. The story was really nice and cinematic, but quite predictible and cliché from time to time. Overall I don't regret the buy solely for that alone.

I'm now at the beginning of the endgame and am slowly building up a team to challenge higher difficulty settings. Movesets of bosses don't seem to evolve much for the moment, but the damage they deal has skyrocketed for specific moves, making them nearly guaranteed one-shots. Depending on how you view it, that might be a negative or positive. I'm seeing it as a way to tell me to finally pay attention to what bosses do and how I might have to start to learn their patterns to be able to perfect dodge more consistently.

As I advance in the masteries of my main character, I can see that many additional quality of life masteries make the gameplay more smooth and make the triggering of the character's unique mechanic easier (in my case, Katalina's stand).

I haven't finished the final epilogue chapter, so other things will open up. Currently I'm not put off by the grind, but I can already see that there will be more grind awaiting that I won't be able to circumvent without steadily upgrading at least 4 characters, as coop outside of quick quest seems pretty barren.

From the initial battle encounter with Bahamut through my first visit to the village of Folca, [b]Granblue Fantasy[/b]: [b]Relink[/b] gave me the impression that this was the anime action role-playing game I had been waiting for, and it certainly is.

*[i]The children having fun in the village—what an adorable scene![/i]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRAFtaGyo4w

What I really like the most of the game is the battle systems and skill mechanics, it's one of the best I have ever seen. There are a total of twenty playable characters, each with their own unique playstyle.

The overall story itself is great, I like it, and the best part is that the real fun actually began after completing the main plot. There are a ton of things to check out and unlock. For those who are seeking for challenging fights, battling Primal Beasts in Proud difficulties with other players in the online coop is one of them, and it's been a thrilling and exciting experience so far.

I heard about Granblue Fantasy, but because they are mostly gacha mobile games([i]?[/i]), I've never really played nor was I particularly interested in any of them.
After this though, they have caught my attention, and I look forward to more quality games from [i]Cygames[/i].

Gorgeous graphics to look at, a banger of an OST, and the ultra-hype Campaign is literally a tutorial for the online stuff. Most of the game is just boss battling similar to something like Monster Hunter without the stalking, just straight up fights. Played the game half on the Steam Deck and half on my dedicated PC. Slight annoyance is that the game is locked 16:9 unless you use GBFRelinkFix, so the game has black boarders on Steam Deck and sits in the middle of my 32:9 monitor. Capped 120hz is below my monitors 240hz, but none of this was a detraction from the experience.

Insane amounts of character customization with 18 completely different characters to play and build up (with more coming). Buttery smooth action combat that is an absolute joy to learn and execute. There's grind, but it's a fun grind; with both loot for crafting and weapon unlocks and RNG rolls to min/max. Fights are fun, and the campaign is the most Call of Duty-esque non-stop setpiece action (that I can't talk about without spoilers) in between some decently sized exploration segments, and then you can hop online through the quest counter and play endlessly. My only, slight nitpick is the camera is kind of annoying at times; but it's still completely manageable.

- The combat is hp sponges and it sucks (spam your kit until hp goes down).
- Bosses getting ""second lives"" is just the worst mechanic of all time.
- You are heavily advantaged if you play a ranged character over a melee.
- The late games fights are just recolors of the bosses you killed earlier in the story... straight up boring.
- Some mechanics are just never explained anywhere and are extremely idiotic.
- There's a full auto gameplay mode... they just couldn't be bothered at this point.
- The cinematics in combat cancels your abilities and whatever you're charging. 
- The dodge is absolute dog shit and is not an iframe unless you do it EXACLY when the attack hits you... like what? I really can't stress enough how freaking bad the dodge is... like really it is complete and utter trash.
- Some characters are just plain boring (to be honest Io's kit is trash and bosses move too much so you almost never land your lvl 4 charged ability).
- There's too much particles on everything (hinders visibility) like literally you can't see anything and it's even worse with the bad camera angle the lock gives you.
- The lock on camera sucks but you have to do it to hit your abilities.
- The story is extremely boring and the characters are all like 8 year olds playing with their imaginary friends (with how they talk and stuff).
- What ever you say has absolutely no impact on the story so why even put options in dialogues.
- The ""puzzles"" to get the chests are just boring and annoying why are they even in the game.
- Online play is dead (which is weird because I'm a few days after launch).
- You can't actually save and quit whenver you want even in a solo session because you have to wait for a check point... why is that even still in a game in 2024?
- Why is the menu and inventory and everything with a white background?
- Every character can actually do almost everything so there's no real concern about getting characters for certain roles (healers, tank and damage dealer)
- You can literally take anyone in any team and it will work so there's no real team building strategy so that sucks.
- The only real use of your allies when playing alone is to revive you when you're down because they do very little damage.
- You never actually kill any bosses or your enemies sooooo i mean that's boring. They're all alive or ""controlled"". 
- The characters are uninteresting and if you haven't played the first game, you don't get attached to any of them. 
- You get the defeated screen when you're still alive??? What the fk? 
- Angra manyu is the worst boss fight I've ever seen in any video game.

Over all it's an ok game but if I had the chance I would never pay more than 20$ for the small amount of fun you can get out of it.

Basically its Monster Hunter: Anime edition, with faster paced and flashy combat, very satisfying.
Attacks are very responsive even if you are butting mashing, providing great character control.

The story is not bad, and not great, just the generic ""save the girl from the bad organisation"" kind.
The characters are very charasteric, and have some good back stories, making them memorable, and they made a good antagonist that's easy to hate :)

The combat is with a party of 4, but you only control one character, so there is no swapping around during combat, nor having to remember combo's and skills of 4 different characters.

I use the Japanese voice acting setting, which is -as usual- top notch and definitely recommended in this anime-type games where the English voice acting can feel off.

Art and Soundtracks are amazing, nothing much to say about that, just amazing.

Story was enjoyable, got better to the mid – end of the story. Overall, it could have been longer but not a massive deal.
Personally I think the story could have included some of the other characters within the game to appear or were mentioned to be around the place this also could have been a nice way make the story longer but get new players feel connected to other characters. While the game does have the Fate episodes quests for that it would have been more interesting and immersive if there was more connection to the main story. But that’s just my personal take.

My biggest issue for Story was the English localisation is terrible, which is a shame because there are some good English voice actors voicing some of characters in the game. Lot of the translations felt rushed or just made no sense whatsoever, it’s a fantasy game with characters saying some of the most out of place things.
If you are new or plan on buying the game honestly advise you to play in JP voicing acting.

Combat is fast-paced, flashy and very enjoyable with characters all having their own play style and skills and builds. Fighting the bosses is the great mix of MH style fights combining that with FFXIV or other mmorpg dungeon/raid mechanics.

Progression is simple and fun to understand. You have the character that you can level up and beyond to gain masteries and skills where you can choose multiple skills to use in content to suit your play style with a character.
You got Weapons where you can level up weapons to max level of 150 and sigils where you can really start focusing on your build that you want to make.
I do hope we see more weapons later on in future updates.

If you are familiar with the Monster Hunter games, then Content such as Quests will feel very familiar and just as fun. You have different types of quests modes from Defend, Survival, conquest, horde and the main one bosses fight which is the biggest draw to the game. There are different difficulty of quests from Easy, Normal, hard, Very Hard, Extreme, Maniac and Proud. The difficulty starts to show from Extreme and above. There will be a future difficulty I believe which will be Impossible difficulty when the Lucilius quest comes.

I can’t wait to see future quests, weapons, & characters to game, personally I would love to see Zooey, Athena be playable, as well as rest of the Society members: Beatrix, Ilsa, Eustace and Gwynne also be playable. But would be nice they used this game to introduce underrated characters as well. For boss raid like quests would be cool to see Primarchs make an appearance, maybe also Qilin & Huanglong.

I highly recommend this game, 9/10 fantastic game while not perfect its very enjoyable, a great introduction to the gbf franchise for newcomers, fans of FFXIV or MH games will enjoy the boss fights and endgame.

Or a really good BAD game?? Especially if we're talking the story. Took me like 20 hours with occasional side questing to complete the story. Hell by the END OF THE STORY you've only changed your weapon 1 maybe 2 times if you were lucky enough to find one.  The levels are quite tiny as well. Functioning as more ""battle arenas"" than any real exploration. The story itself stresses its IMMEDIATE importance while the game encourages you to simply ignore that and grind side quests. Which are generally 1 room full of monsters you bash on, or a boss fight. 

End game is essentially ""questing"" via tiny battle arena map horde mashing for various materials used to upgrade various aspects of your character. AT least so far.

Cygames loves Granblue Fantasy. While I've never played the gacha, the quality and presentation of their fighting games and Relink speak to how much that team adore this IP. They might even love it too much, as many of Relink's flaws could be argued to be devs smothering the game in unneeded mechanics and over-tuning. 

At some point, you too will fall head over heels in love with Relink, sparked by one of its extravagant set piece fights or a bewitching Skybound Art chain (unless you ruin it by being premature and not waiting for your partner. Nice Captains finish last).

[h3]Relink![/h3]
- Spectacular, high intensity combat. A feast for your eyes, ears and frantic fingers.
- Vibrant, colorful art style.
- Playable characters have distinct personalities, both aesthetically and mechanically.
- Sensational soundtrack. Excels in both gentle ambiance and fervent action.
- AI companions actually contribute!

[h3]ReThink[/h3]
- Too easy for first 20+ hours, even on hard difficulty without assist tools.
- Too many befuddling progression mechanics.
- Spotty localization. I only know a few scattered Japanese words and phrases from anime (or in other words, I speak fluent weebanese) and even I'm picking out jokes lost in translation.
- Tech limitations. Locked at 120 FPS. No widescreen support.
- Multiplayer only largely accessible after beating the 10-15 hour campaign.

[h3]Recommend To:[/h3]
- Any anime action RPG fan.
- Any Granblue Fantasy fan.
- Anyone who has ever audibly squeed when a character shouted out the name of their signature attack.
- ""Dubs Over Subs"" degenerates.

[h3]But Your Playgroup Might Prefer:[/h3]
[b]Monster Hunter Rise[/b] The multiplayer in Relink is wonderful, but it takes a while to get there. If your friends want a similar play experience and are in a hurry, MH:Rise delivers if you imagine each of its weapons as a Relink character. You might be thinking to yourself ""There's no way some weapon can be as sexy as my Granblue waifu/husbando."" If so, you are clearly not a Charge Blade main.

Relink is your messy romantic partner who fumbles their words around you and is a little too easy for your personal tastes, but is drop dead gorgeous and doesn't disguise their delight when you spend time with them (though they're a little standoffish with your friends at first). While the relationship will eventually cool off and Relink might one day catch you eye-balling that Blue Protocol hussy, you are missing out if you let their love pass you by today.

Censorship: There is some. But its not as bad as people are making it out to be. The only characters that are censored are the underage ones. The ones that look like full grown women are not. This isnt really that big of an issue. There are some games that cover up every character where it looks bad.  


Localization: People are really grasping at straws with this one. That said, I didnt really listen to the voice acting much. Between the Gran's narration irritating me and the unintentional lisp that every character has in the game due to some error someone that worked on the game made... I found it better to just read through it anyway. (Edit*) [That said, the localization shouldnt bother you since its not intrusive. Just dont have Japanese Dub with English Sub and vice versa. You'll live. ]

Combat: Best part of the game. I personally wish I wasnt forced to have Gran in my party for as long as I was, but its whatever. I get it. Still didnt like that part. 

Lots of great set pieces. Super campy. Plot is somewhere between FFXIV and Phantasy Star. Super predictable typical anime campy trash that I love so much. This is everything I wanted out the later Tales of... Games.

I can't in good conscience recommend this game because I genuinely feel like I would've traded the entire multiplayer experience for a more polished single player JRPG adventure game. As it stands, the game feels unfocused and (honestly) a bit too easy for my liking.

But let's give the quick run down of what the good and bad is:

The Good:

• Genuinely fantastic combat system.
• A cast of characters with a wide array of play styles
• Gorgeous visuals
• Amazing boss fights with mechanics similar to an MMO boss fight.


The Bad:

• The story is more or less a tutorial to the meat of the game.
• Aforementioned story is honestly not that great, and has an issue with resolving. There was far too many moments of: ""Is it over? Nope, it's not over."" and it felt like a slog.
• Aforementioned ""meat of the game"" is recycled content you've already experienced in the single player mode fed to you over and over without much variance.
• Character balance is genuinely not that great.
• Endgame is comprised of material farming for meaningless % gains when content (in my experience) was cleared incredibly easily just by being ""competent"" rather then really demanding micro stat management.
• Content gets stale quickly.


If you're a fan of Granblue, I could easily recommend this. You'll enjoy it enough, I warrant. If you're not and you've heard people tout it as ""Monster Hunter Adjacent"" then steer clear, because it lacks the long-term charm and longevity of it.

I'll probably return for DLC, but honestly it'd be a hard sell to me.",1707285386,1707285421,False,1,1,0.45138886570930481,0,True,False,False

Cygames borrowed from the best when making this game, by which I mean hired away developers from other companies. The best elements of FF, Ys, Tales, White Knight and Altair are present in this game ... except for the plot: Cygames really needs to hire a real writing team is they want to move beyond being a mobile game developer. Not that the plot is bad (I have seen worse from bigger names) but the depth of it is pretty thin with how the characters go from A to B to C to D with without dwelling in the environments to let players explore the word, and the answer to obstacles is provided as soon as you hit it.

the game does make up for that by providing missions that can be played as either single player with NPC support or MP with online players (the menu for this looks like MH, but the in game application is closer to FF15's multiplayer expansion). The co-op system works and provides a lot of depth that the game otherwise would lack, but at the same time I think I would have preferred if Cygames leaned in on the single player plot and expanded that content, then followed it up with a stand alone MP game that went all in on the MP mission systems.

All in all, this is the first JRPG in a while that both felt fresh and worth paying full price for: you can really tell that Cygames cares about the Granblue franchise, and that is quite refreshing after the blatant disrespect we have seen directed at many of the other JRPG franchises in recent years.

the game is simply fun, having 20 characters with unique play styles and gimmicks that make trying new things out  characters not just another chore on the list of maxing out the roster.

everyone complaining about silly little localization or censorship aren't really playing the game. ill stand on this because of all the hours ive played the game, i have had literally zero issues with any of the ""problems"" most people have with the game. they're a nonissue for people actually trying and enjoying the game.

overall i would give this game an 8 on a bad day and a 9 every other day. i haven't even loaded up persona 3 reload because this game had such a grip on me. hopefully we get more content post road map because cygames really has a good base for a COMPLETED game. wouldn't mind shilling out a few more dollars if it meant id get to play more of this",1707285006,1707285006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After the story, the game starts changing progression to a Monster Hunter style quest board, where competing all quests of a certain difficulty leads you to the even harder stuff which lets you upgrade your characters even further and in even more specific ways (which I like as a Monster Hunter player).

first of all, the story
well it's granblue fantasy with the usual granblue fantasy'esque story... a.k.a. it's short but dense 
it also managed to cram in as many shounen manga and JRPG tropes in it without making it too cringe (at least for me personally)

after finishing the main story, you start to enter epilogue where the power spike happens
this is where the gameplay loop of ""farm quests for mats, get stronger, fight stronger enemies, farm more mats"" feels right at home, especially for people who come here from monster-hunter-like games

I also have some complains like...
-there're too many unnecessary scenes (both skippable and unskippable) inflating the game's playtime
-the characters tend to move forward several steps before stopping, causing them to enter enemy's aoe
-limited gamepad key rebind option
-VERY limited graphic setting options

My main issue is that Cygames pulled a dirty trick here. A 10 hour campaign at full price with half the roster of characters not implemented in the story WHATSOEVER. That's right! Half the characters DO NOT appear in the game outside of combat! Not just with main story, the whole game. They're summoned out of the ether when you go into a battle map. Other than that, they do not exist in the game world. WHY!? WHO DECIDED TO SCREW IT UP THIS BAD!?

My second issue is the classes. Classes are another thing that didn't make it into Relink. You're the beginner class for Gran/Djeeta and that's it. Honestly my opinion is that Gran/Djeeta is the weakest character in the game. The only up side for a few people, maybe, is that you can freely switch between the two. Some of the swords you can get are very cool, but one of the best of them is literally sold as DLC from Day 1. Cut out of the game and sold to you separately. So our mediocre main character is incomplete unless you shell out even more money.

Which leads me into my third issue. With how little this game really offers the fact that they're already tossing out DLC like a Dynasty Warriors game really rubs me the wrong way. It tell me that this is just a cheap, poorly made cash grab. Prove me wrong, Cygames. If you can.

All in all, I expected so much more and I'm very disappointed. Expecially since their first DLC characters are also not recognizable from the mobile game.

I can only imagine how much they'll charge for two characters, given a SWORD and some mats is $11.99.",1707281733,1707281733,False,2,0,0.485920965671539307,0,True,False,False

[b] https://www.taptap.io/post/6973240 & https://www.taptap.io/post/6973013 [/b]


[h2]First time playing this series? Me too![/h2]
So let's get down to business. I've never played this series previously because I prefer [b]Bandai Namco's[/b] JRPGs, though I occasionally dabble in more niche titles like [b]Rogue Galaxy[/b], [b]White Knight Chronicles[/b], and my personal favourite [b]Trails in the Sky[/b] and [b]Cold Steel[/b] pick those bad boys up if you're into deep story! I used to be a huge fan of Bandai Namco's [b]Tales of Series[/b], but as they and many others grew as developers, they did what every series seems to think they should do. Overprice their games, increase the visual flare to 110% while sacrificing the actual game-play experience and story and throwing DLC inside the games or by just making the characters stiff and un-alive like they do in the recent Cold Steel series.

Granblue felt wonderful it felt like everything was alive including the characters and their expressions. It seemed like I was playing FF14, White Knight Chronicles 2 (a game that was discontinued with the release of FF14), Rogue Galaxy, and God Eater, all while incorporating their own mobile gameplay style into a PC JRPG. 


[h2]Localization[/h2]
There appears to be a group of folks who are enraged and upset because the game's localization falls short of their expectations. Essentially, they are talking about the English patch and censorship. I can definitely understand that having a character say something like ""Hmm"" and it comes out in the English version as ""A wishful thinking"" or something said in Japanese being emotional, while the English version is completely pragmatic at the situation that just happened. It's not as horrible as some make it out to be; the only issue I had was that the subtitles were way too small and not adequately seen when set against a bright background, and there were no settings to modify them. I can put up with certain basic things like that; I see character and personality, regardless of how it was in the Japanese version.

At the very least, they did not rename characters or change speech like you see in other games, manga and movies, such as [b]Atelier Rorona[/b], where [b]Esty Erhard[/b] was renamed ""Esty Dee"" because it was HAHA FUNNY. (It isn't), or Fist of the North Star being translated from ""You're already dead"" to ""Your ass is grass!"". 

The translations in this game are really minor and would only bug those who actually know how to read or hear keywords in Japanese that would alert them to the wrong translations. 

Moving on to the censorship issue. It's basically the minority; a few individuals are upset since all of the females are wearing shorts instead of their original panties and one characters outfit was modified a bit more (Narma) to show less skin, which is visable on I believe the console versions or in the official Japanese editions. While I can't confirm it, I believe other people are also arguing about Io and the main female character wearing shorts, but here's what I want you to know. Io is an 11-year-old anime girl and the female protagonist is a 15-year-old anime female. There is no reason for them to wear exposing clothing nor is there any real reason to be looking up their skirts to sneak a peak. I could understand Narma and other mature adults, who are equally covered up making it a much more tasteful JRPG in my opinion. I can't see this as a deal breaker. It's perfectly fine and doesn't effect gameplay. 

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
It's fairly pricey, but here's the thing. It's pricey because you can tell they put a lot of time and work into all of the voicing (there are no reading parts, everything is voiced), the visuals are fantastic and well polished, and the models' attire and weapons do not clip. The gameplay is enjoyable and fascinating, keeping you going back for more. There are several quests, characters, builds, weapons, and skills with the online multiplayer. I could go on for several hours. 

If you're upset about not being able to search up young girls dresses and see panties or a lot of cleavage, someone will eventually mod the game. If you hate it when Japanese dialogue is adjusted and changed from the original in a minor sense, again it could be a deal breaker for you. But if you're interested in a fantastic adventure, awesome monster hunting challenges and playing with a friendly and helpful community, this would be your next stop for that adventure.",1707276727,1707281701,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Pros:
[list]
[*] Friendly enough to be fun/casual for your less game savvy significant other/friend
[*] Slammed with skill-based tech to make excellent players stand out and feel great doing so. 
[*] Nicely balanced for both online co-op as well as solo players. The party system isn't great, but it's better than virtually every other monster hunter style game I've played in recent memory.
[*] Sorting, prioritizing, filtering on inventory and build related items is nice. It's not perfect, but was much appreciated late in the game as far as quality of life goes. 
[*] Really late game has some solid difficulty and really cool/unique fights - I will absolutely come back for new boss dlcs if they make them.
[*] You pay for what you get. No micro-transactions, tons of characters with significantly different play styles. You'll be impressed with what you get as a whole if you like the genre.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] The absolute best fights in the game require significant grind to reach. So much so - that I expect most players will miss out. 
[*] By the time you are in the zone grinding towards the highest difficulty fights, you'll have killed a lot of the same enemies which can make the ending portion a slog if you stick to 1 character all game.
[*] You can't technically co-op the main story. In between chapters, you unlock side-quests that you can group up for. More of a minor inconvenience than it sounds. 
[*] Each time you unlock a new difficulty (for most of the game) - you are given the resources needed to upgrade a weapon to the next tier. But this just ends up with your characters feeling too strong for the new difficulty. They should have made the weapon upgrades available at the end of a difficulty as opposed to the beginning.

Seems like a fun time. I can confirm the combat so far seems very fun and responsive with a lot of room for complexity, along with many distinct characters.

UPDATE:
After getting to endgame, lvl 100 and some of the grind, I can say I'm liking this game a lot. 

The main story is short and sweet. Fast paced. 10-20 hours. Not much downtime. Don't come in expecting a 40-80 hour JRPG. The bulk of time spent is in the combat and endgame.

The core gameplay loop is very satisfying. The game is super responsive, and has many different characters, all with completely unique combat and kits. 

The boss battles remind me of FFXIV bosses, but with faster paced action. In the hardest difficulty, you will actually need to have proper gear, and there are some DPS checks.

Endgame progression is very well paced. You always feel like you're getting stronger. Early to mid endgame does not feel grindy even. Of course, there are things to chase in the late endgame, but that's what you want in this genre. It feels around the right balance.",1706770125,1707276553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Granblue Fantasy is Fun But comes with caviats[/h1]
I think this is actually one of the best combat based JRPG games ive played in ages, it shows really well the collab between the studios, also it runs and looks very good, but there are 2 fundamental problems

- The game is incredibly short, being around only ~10h to ~12h for main story and even with completing side missions don't add much meat and potatoes to the dish. There is endgame stuff but thats just repeating same bosses and dungeons over and over again
- The story is kinda abysmal, because it expects you are familiar with teh Granblue original game or the anime, which may not be case with many people. There isn't any flashbacks or recaps of what has happened to the prior events of Relink. 

If length and story isn't in high priority this is quite fun game to play and enjoyable hack and smash with multiple characters that bring nice variety when needed + you can team up with friends on side quests online.",1707268608,1707268608,True,5,4,0.54686206579208374,0,True,False,False

The main story is awesome and super fun (I am just about halfway there and it still feels fresh). The nuance for the different characters is just enough for experimentation, while still feeling familiar. 

The co-op (the main thing that drew me to the game) feels like a mix of mmo and monster hunter like. The only drawback is the lack of level sync with friends - of course this can be limited by plowing through the main story and just playing with friends after the fact - but I am saddened that the main story can't be completed with friends - so many parts would be AMAZING with actual other players - even if the host was forced to play the MC and your invitees got the play a party you put together.

I bought Granblue Fantasy: Relink while not knowing much about the universe. I was vaguely aware of a gacha game for mobile but had never played it myself, as well as a fighting game in the same franchise. I went into this knowing two things about this game, which immediately sold me on it:

1. This game features 20 characters, all with mastery trees independent of one another, with different skills and mechanics that differentiate each character's playstyle.

2. This game features a Monster Hunter-like gameplay endgame loop of completing quests for materials, and using those materials to improve your character in various ways.

The story ended up being quite charming, and the game features a feature that I would appreciate more games having - when you skip cutscenes, when the game asks to make sure you're okay with skipping, it provides you with a summary of the scene, so you can still follow the plot if you just want to skip ahead to gameplay. It follows a pretty standard JRPG story format, culminating in some very big boss fights with some incredible music.

The visuals are outstanding and style oozes out of every corner, especially the incredible watercolor portraits for each of the 20 characters. The animations are gorgeous, with each character having a completely unique moveset. The boss designs are pretty much all hits and enjoyable to look at over and over again, which you'll be doing over the course of this game, as its endgame is centered around doing quests for materials repeatedly.

The gameplay is the real winner here - 20 different characters each with different movesets to master and skill trees that give a real sense of empowerment, a sigil system similar to the charms or gems systems found in Monster Hunter games, and tense but fun boss fights.

This game is absolutely worth a purchase if you're looking for one of the best action RPGs of modern times, a very solid Granblue game, or you've already played your fill of Monster Hunter World and Rise and you're dying for more bosses to kill and materials to farm.",1707064171,1707261401,True,2,0,0.553641319274902344,0,True,False,False

Great combat akin to most Platinum games and FF16, with different playstyles for each character.
Quest system structure akin to Monster Hunter titles, with scoring systems and challenges, providing replayability

They did and amazing job at translating their Medieval fantasy/Magic punk art into a world you can walk around in. The combat mechanics and character variety give way to many play styles, and it has some lateral progression systems that let you try out all of them. True to their reputation, the mid to late game contains repetitive grinding to progress your characters which might be a turn off to many people. Their over arching story is nebulous at best even for those entrenched in it and the character interactions are geared towards people like me who already know the characters and wanted more story which i think might alienate newcomers to the series.

Co-op matchmaking with friends and randoms has been a blast. The story, while very short and simple, was still enjoyable. I love all the characters except it took me time to warm up to Vyrn as he reminded me of a certain specific emergency ration from another game. The monster hunter esque quest boards with FFXIV party matching for multiplayer content was a welcome surprise as I'm a huge fan of both. It feels so satisfying to have a great character progression model akin to some mobile games without any gacha involved. Combat feels smooth and consistent. Seriously one of the best action games to drop 2 months into this year.

I have very few cons such as the lock-on system/camera and a few matchmaking bugs. These weren't enough to detract the great experience I've had. However, my biggest issue was more related to my current location (at the time of this review). Matchmaking seems to have some sort of region locking but I was able to remedy it by changing my download region to a more suitable one. Luckily playing with friends had no issues for me.

But I frigging hate the controls.

Let's use the context of a Nintendo Switch Controller.
I'm used to having Talk/Search/Normal Attack/Accept/Advance Text Window on the same button.
That would be A as someone that games in Japanese. Or B (X on ps) when I play American games...
If anything, most japanese action rpgs are like that.

Who was the frigging genius that decided to put talk on X, normal attack on Y, Search on A, Accept/Advance Text Window on B. Use one single button! At worst, I can forgive talk and search being split but not the rest...

And why is step/avoid on R2 but Guard on L1. put it on the frigging same level (both 1s or 2s).
The second I can still swap the buttons so it's borderline okay but the first, I find unforgivable...

Also, why the heck is the game auto-saving on my save slot, I skipped through a couple of events as a test to try something in the game and quit the game then the next time I loaded, i'm not at the point I manually saved, it was after the shop tutorials instead of right away entering the first town. WTF? The saving in this game is horrible.

Finally, give me the option to change the controller display in game.
I never used an Xbox Controller and seeing the Inputs based a Xbox Controller is really confusing. Xbox is the least popular machine and Switch the most popular and they are very confusing since X/Y and A/B are swapped. Should have bought the ps version...

Fortunately, they said on twitter that they will try to release an update to remap buttons, not continuing until that comes out. Last time I played Harvestella with a weird button mapping, I was suffering badly when I went to YS11 after and it took me hours to re-adapt, not doing it again...",1707171304,1707253856,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

If someone told me that PSO2 devs moved here, I would believe them. The game even captured the essence of the annoying lock-on mechanics that has PSO2 has.

Jokes aside, the gameplay is pretty simple but it has enough mechanics for you to master to keep you engaged. It also offers a roster of characters that have varying playstyle. It's evident that the game is definitely designed as a console game. There are some minor annoyance that I encounter at times like:

-Wonky camera controls at times
-Locking on to things that are not in FOV because the target is closer
-Minimal graphics customization to help the game run smoother on lower spec devices
-No support for DLSS/FSR
-No Ultrawide support
-Keyboard shortcuts being unavailable at title screen but will be available after passing through a certain amount of tutorial
-Not being too clear with the quick access to skill activation on Keyboard. When playing on controller, you have to hold down a button in order to be able to use the skills you have equipped. In Keyboard, you still have a button you can hold but it is unnecessary as by default 1-4 quickly activates them without the need of holding down the button.

In terms of story, for someone not familiar with Granblue Fantasy itself, it will still be relatively easy to follow. For those familiar with the franchise, it definitely will be a treat. If in case someone wants to learn more about the characters, the game does offer things to expand about the individual character's backstory.

That being said, this truly is a gem of an action RPG game. The boss battles definitely were crafted masterfully to immerse you in the battle. It truly reminded me of how PSO2 was when it was lead by people with a vision as they created memorable Urgent Quests in that game. I look forward to seeing what CyGames does. I really do hope they expand on this game further. Even if they don't, the game will certainly still be playable by anyone who is interested as this is not a live service game.

If you're looking to play this on Deck, I was able to play it just fine but you will definitely be dropping down the 30fps side when there are a lot of things going on. Text is also a little bit hard to read at times since the scaling is not that good. Other than that, it plays well like you would on a proper console.

It might have been 8 years or so since this was announced, but I'm glad CyGames took their time in developing a good game rather than rushing it out.",1707252752,1707253535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Progression is rewarding, you unlock characters, you get new weapons, classic RPG singleplayer stuff. 
Story is not amazing, not bad either, its something you can skip without missing out huge reveals or things that you cant quick watch on youtube.
The gameplay is where it shines, combat is fluid, rewarding, well animated. It might be a bit clustered at some fights but your character will always be highlighted.
As soon as you finish the story mode, you can remove CAPTAIN from the party, of course you can play your favorite character thru the story until the end even if sometimes you are forced to play as CAPTAIN because plot armor...
Its HUB based, if you played Monster Hunter you will feel at home. Also if you are MH fan you will like the boss fights as well. 
Combat is action packed, you can have nice combos with your party members, you can even ult together with a high damage unique finisher move.
You got the perfect dodge, block and hero-specific parries, jump, dash, leap while jumping, like Dark souls on steroids but with nice animations lol.

[th]🟥 Cons[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td] ✔️ Very capable party A.I. making progressing through even the postgame content viable for solo players. Likewise, this means developing characters you may not even play but who are part of your regular group feels rewarding.[/td]
[td] ❌Raising multiple characters is difficult to do. Throughout the roughly 30 hours it took me to progress into the final difficulty, I only managed to have one character up to the performance I would deem acceptable for those levels of quests.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td] ✔️ Fantastic presentation due to unrivaled visuals for its art style and a wide cast of accomplished Japanese voice actors, delivering an extremely cinematic experience during the main story.[/td]
[td] ❌ The English localization is infamously atrocious and ranges from awful voice acting on top of an already somewhat shaky script to outright mistranslations.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td] ✔️Strong replay value due to the large variety of unique characters and consistent unlocks even very late into the postgame, allowing for further difficulty modes in the campaign and a strong multiplayer component.[/td]
[td] ❌There are some balance issues. Originally, GBF was being called trivially easy, which in part is definitely true due to the Critical Gauge mechanic, but eventually begins outscaling the player during the postgame content.[/td]

	[th]🟨 Miscellaneous Thoughts[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]The main story is somewhat short. If people merely focused on playing the campaign without side objectives for the credits, it would run between 12 and 14 hours. I, personally, got to the credits at 16 hours and then to the True Ending, another roughly 7 hours, which requires some decent progression into the harder postgame content.[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

[h3]Technical Issues and Performance[/h3]
GBF:R ran without any issues. While there are some reports of people struggling to be able to boot the game shortly after launch, I have not encountered any such problems. The game never crashed, stuttered, or otherwise bugged out. The few hours of multiplayer I have played were stable, although the matchmaking is not exactly fantastic. 

[h3]Graphics and Sound[/h3]
Visually, GBF:R is utterly unrivaled for its art style. Both gameplay and cinematics look gorgeous, and there is an incredible amount of detail in just about every location.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3153437575

The sound design is not quite as impressive, with a soundtrack that is still generally good but not that memorable. The voice acting in the game’s original language is beyond fantastic, with a wide range of extremely talented and recognizable voice actors. The English dub, however, suffers from the aforementioned awful localization, at times changing the meaning of entire phrases, and likewise quite horrid voice acting.

[h3]Story and Setting[/h3]
You play as either Djeeta or Gran, depending on your gender preference for the main character, the Captain of a diverse cast of Skyfarers in a world entirely made up of floating sky islands. While in search of Estalucia, a fantastical utopia, you encounter a religious cult that takes interest in one of your friends who has the ability to seal and summon pseudo-godlike creatures like the dragon Bahamut.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3151952766

Needless to say, GBF is very much a JRPG with some interesting thematical parallels to specifically Final Fantasy, but it sets itself apart by its very unique setting. As a spin-off title to a gacha game, I was somewhat worried that the story may be an afterthought, but was generally surprised for that to not be the case, and as someone who has not played the gacha, I could follow the story fairly easily, though with a constant feeling of just lacking some context as to the interpersonal relationships of the different crew members.

There is a glossary that is just as boring to read as they always are, but it is nice that the game does give you an extensive interface through which you can browse anything from terms related to the world-building to the backstory of various characters and more. Characters also have mini-stories attached to them, which you unlock as you progress through the main story and level them up. Sadly, this seems to be a bit of a missed opportunity, as they are usually inconsequential enough to not provide significant character development and are also merely a few sentences short per episode.

Despite this, while I wouldn’t recommend GBF:R for the story alone, it is certainly on par with similar titles, such as the Tales of […] series, and may even be good enough to be recommended to fans of certain Final Fantasy titles due to the aforementioned thematic similarities.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
GBF:R can be broadly described as a hub-based and mission-centric action RPG. Campaign missions usually take place in a large, but fairly linear, level that encourages some exploration through collectibles and chests that consistently feel relevant and rewarding due to the different methods to progress your characters’ power level.

Side missions, and therefore the bulk of the postgame, take place in smaller segments of those aforementioned levels and range from mission types such as defending a static object to simple boss fights. Unlike other games in the genre, even later bossfights tend to be much faster, lasting typically between 2 and 8 minutes for the longer fights on anything above Maniac difficulty.

Fights are not just fast due to raw numbers, however, but combat tends to be very fast-paced in terms of how quickly attacks come out. To offset this, bigger attacks offer a telegraph a few moments before the attack actually fires. This is something that is very reminiscent of Final Fantasy 14, and I haven’t seen something like this used anywhere else. While this sort of MMO design, at first glance, feels a little odd, it actually does wonders for the game to be able to be as visually striking and responsive as it is, and I’m not sure combat would feel as good without this design decision.

As you progress through the story, you get to unlock more characters for the roster, each of which has a distinct weapon type and a unique gimmick; for example, Io, one of the immediately available characters, is a mage that augments her big spells through basic attacks, allowing for devastating combo-finishers. Each character also features multiple linear skill trees that eventually unlock further active abilities that can be freely slotted in to create unique builds. While this feels impactful, it never felt like I could augment a character towards a distinct role. Rather, the game is very centered around dealing as much damage as possible, even on the later, extremely lethal missions, since outlasting enemies through support just doesn’t feel very feasible.

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]
GBF:R is fast, flashy, and eventually scales to become extremely difficult in the late postgame. While this results in an awkward difficulty curve, it is an incredibly rewarding experience that still has a serviceable story on top of it all. Looking back at the game, while it probably will not end up breaking any new ground, I can’t really pinpoint any single aspect of the game that is outright bad and was a rare experience that I simply enjoyed going through from booting it up for the first time up until the very end.

The combat feels clean and snappy, each character feels different, the graphics are stunningly charming at times, but I’m not experienced enough in this genre to comment appropriately and in greater detail on any of those things. 

However, what I can comment on is the story and the general atmosphere that is created here. In this review I will include very minimal spoilers about story structure. I am confident that nothing here actually classifies as a spoiler, but if you’re still worried then go buy the game now. 

The entire presentation is decidedly anime. You have your magical girls, your power of friendship, your spirits and monsters, your mysterious and edgy fighters, but it’s all delivered in an incredibly polished fashion. What this story gets right is the way it gets the player invested. Most JRPG’s include two different plot hooks, the personal hook for the character, and then a later hook where the end of the world lies ahead if the main character doesn’t stop it. The end of the world is always an easy way to motivate a character, however it is much harder to make that personal motivation stick. 

What this game does right is that it holds back that personal hook for just long enough that, when they decide to reveal it, the player is just as motivated as the characters they play to fix the issue. Going into greater detail about how this is achieved would result in a review that’s way too long for Steam, but it’s safe to say that the approach worked wonders. 

Looking at it objectively, the story is riddled with somewhat cliché moments, but with how they are delivered they never get annoying. Instead, Granblue Fantasy: Relink shows why some of these moments are such widely used clichés. It’s because they work. 

I rarely cry after finishing a videogame, but this was one where I could tell halfway through that I would. It takes you on a ride that is incredibly sweet, charming, sometimes just a tiny bit anime cringe, but worth every second. Let other people tell you more about the combat, the end-game systems, the multiplayer functionality, and whatever else this game still has to offer, but let me tell you that this story is an experience that has made me feel truly content, and every videogame that manages that is one worth cherishing in my book.",1707235728,1707235728,True,2,0,0.525295078754425049,0,True,False,False

Story 8.5/10:
It's honestly paced incredibly well, it comes out the gate letting you know this game is gonna be crazy with a battle against a god on a flying ship in the skies. It takes a short break after that to let you explore the game systems while wailing on much smaller threats. You then immediately take on the primal god of vitality and the roller coaster never slows down from there. The overall premise is a tale as old as time save the princess, save the world. It's been done a million times but the spectacle on display for this more than makes up for the simplicity. The story is roughly 15-20 hours depending on if you do side content and the collectathon elements in the missions. You can probably blitz it in 10 if you skip all the cutscenes and play on the easiest difficulty. It gets an 8.5/10 because it does its simple premise well and while perfect length is a hard thing to achieve if I want more it means what I got was good.

Gameplay 10/10:
This is the best co-operative action combat I have ever played. Building off the backs of games like NieR: Automata, Genshin Impact, and other ability based action games Granblue takes all those elements and cranks them to eleven. Complimented by some of the best boss fights I had the pleasure to do. The action dances really well between these tense mechanic filled moments almost every character can be built to be pure damage, debuff/stun focused, or team support focused. Despite them all having varying ways to build them they all feel functionally unique and offer tons of longevity in just trying them all out. Percival and his mongrel Vane are my two go to characters but every single one I've played is fun in a unique way. When you're in co-op this game knows how to push your hype as a group to the edge especially in the harder fights, the final moments of hard bosses being capstoned by you and your friends cracking the last few percentages of health with the very cinematic ultimate moves in so satisfying. Hell even solo the AI are so smart they might beat you for MVP scores every once in a while they keep the fun just as well as human players.

Music 10/10:
Tsutomu Narita sores on this soundtrack elevating his and Nobuo Uematsu's original compositions for the mobile game to a whole new level and his new tracks for the game are all insanely good. Sequestrian Primal, Vow and Promise, End of Ragnarok, and other titles that have spoilers in them are all incredible. Narita has a talent not only for incredibly peaceful tracks but also tracks that really set your adrenaline pumping to match the chaos on screen.

Visuals 10/10:
It's been a long time since a triple A studio has brought so much work to stylized visuals. Cygames brought their A game to bring the style of Hideo Minaba and the rest of their art team to life here. Backgrounds and Skyboxes are beautifully rendered 2d water color paintings. Literal pieces of art paintings you could see in a museum or art gallery. Very clever use of 2d planes gives life to these paintings by putting moving elements like clouds and clusters of foliage in them. Then by layering it all it gives it a depth that is truly gorgeous to look at. The characters and their equipment are rendered out with such care as well with scoring and pencil marks on them that make them look like they've come right off a page. The black outlines around them are even scored as if made by a pencil. To top it off lighting has some global illumination and point lighting with great shadows but all these stylization efforts meant conventional lighting wouldn't look great so they hand painted tons of shadows, changed colors for shadowed elements to help accentuate them, hand painted BOUNCE LIGHTING EVERYWHERE. Seriously there are spots where lighting should only be possible with ray tracing but since the game lacks it and it wouldn't look great anyway because of all the 2d plane tricks they did they HAND PAINTED IT. All this love and care into the details creates this wonderful feeling of like walking through a play set or pop up book, it's fantastic, whimsical, and warm. I know people will just see typical anime visuals when they step into this game but the dedication Cygames put in cannot be understated this is the best this style of visuals has been done so far. Also as a HUGE plus NO SMUDGY TAA or dedication to upscalers the game renders at intended resolution targets natively. Animations are god tier can't even get into it.

Quality of Life 9/10:
The only reason this gets dinged a point is no native ultrawide support which is absolutely criminal for how beautiful the game can be, and no remapping of controller inputs on PC. Other than that the assist mode is smart and makes it so anyone can play through the entire story and 75% of the endgame. The menus are streamlined and easy to use. Lyria's Journal is probably one of the best game databases ever. Character, Enemy, and Weapon information AND a model viewer for all of them. A music player built in. Key Terms, World Info, and Lore bits. All in one place and it can even be pulled up mid conversation if terms are thrown around you don't remember and it'll bring up that term's page. 

Multiplayer 10/10:
This is where the game shines. The combat and gameplay overall come alive when playing with other people and Cygames made sure these system were polished to a luster. There is at least 100 hours of content here if you do everything. Multiplayer is also INCREDIBLY stream lined, repeat missions right from the end screen, a scoring system and time system to keep you pushing for the best possible clears. Crazy amount of social features you can communicate with people easily without ever typing a word let alone using a mic. Lobby Creation and lobby BROWSER as well as quick match built in day one of a multiplayer game in 2024?! Incredible. Not to mention no battle passes, arbitrary time gates, no FOMO mechanics, no pay to win mechanics, no intrusive anti-cheat for a co-op game, no DRM crap bogging the game down for no reason.

Overall 9.5/10:
This game is an absolute treat and a phenomenal way to start out 2024. Myself and many others were weary after a 8 year dev cycle, but this game payed off huge. It's stunning in every regard and deserves all the love it is getting. The only blips are the issues with launching people had which seems to be dying out and the no co-op for the story. More than anything else I hope Cygames sees the success of this title and keeps adding to it to push it forward. I want Monster Hunter style expansions and small content updates like what is already announced. After the eight year wait all I want is this game to keep going it's the most fun co-op experience I've had in years. Cygames delivers a full experience from start to finish with more than a fair share of additional content and quality of life features, nothing withheld, nothing locked for engagement metrics sake. We should treasure AAA developers who release games like this in this day and age.

Has some similarities with Nier which is one of my favorite games. Everything is just so well done.

+/- Some people have trouble with crashes, I am going to assume they did the reasonable thing and updated drivers (have not seen Nvidia, for example, drop a driver for this game specifically yet > works fine with older driver) and used Steam to check the files. Most of the times it is a file that is messed up that causes crashes at specific times, if its random then it is most likely a memory leak of some type. I hope a fix will drop if these issues continue even after measures have been taken by the customers. Also check system requirements.

+/- The region lock is weird, it checks for Steam region (can be changed in the Steam options) and it doesnt let you play with every person in europe for example it goes for smaller regions as you can set in Steam. This needs to be updated.

[u]About the game itself:[/u]
+ Game runs great and is visually very appealing, it looks like its own thing but still very similar to the anime and the mobile game (which I havent played, it is a gambling game / gacha), there is a fighting game as well which I am aware of.

+ Combat is amazing when you are playing a meleecharacter, I tried Io the mage and it didnt have that much ooomph (yet), maybe after unlocking more talents and abilities she will feel more fun. But if you like to stand back and do your thing with little worry you can just play ranged. There are plenty options to unlock.

+ Dont expect to much drama from the story or its depth, Gran Blue is not known for that. It is more a sweet story with fun characters.

+/- the passive skilltree is nothing special, you can get +20 HP here and standard unlocks, like perfect block there and some special attacks, but there is nothing to really write home about. That said:

+ There are unlockable passives that you can level that define your build the most and that is where the game shines, have fun hunting for some of the conditions! Need to find more weapons to tell more about those.

+ Every character feels different and you can choose who to play as (some missions need to done with certain people in the party fyi), have fun trying them out.

+/- Need to see a little more areas to get a full opinion on the design of the levels. So far there are plenty hidden areas and little secrets around. They are not that open and slightly linear so far.

+ Monsters and most importantly bosses are amazing, have fun beating those, there is endgame content as well and more planned (hear ye, hear ye)",1706888286,1707230974,True,2,0,0.467757254838943481,0,True,False,False

What you can expect?
- Comfortable linear story progression and map exploration.
- Good combat gameplay with you being able to play 20 different characters. Each with their own unique playstyle. Seofon and Tweyen will be playable in April if not stalled. Unsure if it's free or paid dlc.
- Character building system is a mix of RPG and MonHun.
- The end game is all about counter quest if you're familiar with MonHun / PSO.
- Counter quests have pretty reasonable progression. You can't simply go for highest difficulty because if you do, you're simply being toxic with the party.
- Highest difficulty counter quest requires thinking before you go co-op. Don't simply fill your character equipment slots with damage increase. It's normal for team wipe to occur. Therefore, think of how to increase your chance of surviving and completing the quest. Aegis, Autorevive, Improved Dodge and Potion Hoarder. Remember these four.
- Upcoming Lucilius quest update in March if not stalled. Not sure if free or paid dlc.
- Upcoming update in May if not stalled. Not sure if it's story, more characters or quests. Free or paid dlc also unknown.

What you can pray for?
- Due to high replayability value, pray that Cygames release quest and character updates on frequent interval.
- Hope Cygames release full instance quest for co-op.
- Season pass dlc so that we can extend GBF Relink lifespan.",1706779574,1707226154,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's freezing issues during cutscenes are not just occasional hiccups; they're like watching a slideshow in the middle of a cinematic masterpiece. The freezing is so consistent and disruptive that you might start thinking your PC has decided to embark on an unscheduled polar expedition.

Cutscenes, the bread, and butter of any RPG, are meant to draw players into the narrative, but in Granblue Fantasy: Relink, they're more like a cruel test of patience. Just as the story starts to unfold, the game decides to hit the pause button, leaving you staring at a frozen frame like a deer caught in headlights. It's as if the developers thought, ""Why bother with a smooth storytelling experience when we can give players the joy of freeze-frame frustration?""

Navigating the lush environments and engaging in combat feels like trying to wade through molasses. The controls, which should be responsive and intuitive, instead feel sluggish and uncooperative. It's a disheartening experience, especially considering the potential this game had to be a visual and interactive delight.

In conclusion, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a title that promises much but delivers little. The freezing cutscenes and lack of optimization for higher resolutions turn what could have been an immersive RPG adventure into a frustrating exercise in patience. Unless you have a deep-seated love for frozen frames, it might be wise to set your sights on a more polished and technically competent RPG experience.

Still i'd recommend this game once the devs apply fix for the said issues.

Has strong hack and slash as well as fun spell casters to play as, basically covers all play styles. Lots to grind and min max if you're into that, but it also has a fun main quest.

It's basically like a good Genshin Impact. Someone like Rosetta really shows how diverse the game can be as a mage that chooses where to summon plants after finishing a combo. 1 basic attacks and a heavy give a defense buff and can spawn a plant if you hold the heavy, 2 basics and a heavy gives a regen heal,  and  3 gives an attack dmg buff, 4 makes the already summoned plants attack more. Also all of these have her doing different animations and properties. She also has 4 other skills (out of a lot) from the plants taunting, to exploding, to summoning all of them, to mimicking a ton of attacks coming out from her, it's very awesome. Genshin felt really shallow to me, this is similar but has more depth and mechanics while maintaining an elemental system, if you want your depth in the extreme team synergies and character switching genshin is reliant on, this does not have that. It instead has all of the depth on the character you've chosen to play; which you can change your party and playable character whenever, just not on the fly for combat purposes like Genshin.

RECOMMENDATION:
If you like Genshin, or warframe, or Dragons Dogma (yeah), you'll probably like this game. The grind gives plenty of time to actually get good at the game, level other characters, and understand mechanics. IF you pick and only play someone like Gran the entire time you can still have fun but you won't be going into the real depth of the game (Gran is cool, He's just the most basic). I like magic casters and supports and this game has some of the most fun version of those, up there with ffxiv.

I'll be playing this and Helldivers 2 until Dragons Dogma 2 comes out (see what happens). I'll keep playing this game especially If this game continues to receive updates and content. I have at least 5 characters I'd like to max and then I'd also want to min max 2-3 of them, plus I want to beat everything on the hardest difficulty. Basically I plan to always return and play this game.

EDIT: Nevermind Gran has a ridiculous amount of skills and is extremely versatile, he's still ""basic"" but hack and slash but does require combos and proper skill usage to maximize his passive with skills. Having a Gran that keeps a 70% damage reduction and 35% dmg boost up is crazy + a full hp heal or nuke of a stun, the list is almost endless for how much he can do.",1707037256,1707214202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Environment design and soundtracks are as good as I expected. Roaming around town, traveling to different islands & especially fighting bosses, all of which provided me with a very enjoyable experience. I'm a bit tired of photo-realistic graphics so a game with a distinguished art style is like a new breath of fresh air.

As someone who wish he could get into Monster Hunter more. Relink really hits the spot for me. The grind is really fun and worthwhile, even if I need to do quest over and over again. Because all time I spent grinding and upgrading characters made me feel like I really made progress on making my characters stronger & more versatile. I think that game did a great job on this aspect. 

Best thing about this game is the AI. Comparing to other games with a similar combat style, GBF Relink probably has the smartest AI system I have ever seen. Against bosses, they understand the openings, be able to cancel action to performing dodge / block. When bosses do large AOE attacks, they can actually take advantage of the mechanic that is used to counter that type of attacks and got away unscathed. They can even apply pressure to the boss, which made the boss stop targeting me and lock on them instead. Those few seconds when I can fully setup my attacks without having to dodge or block all the time is simply precious.

Maybe I might get a second opinion after the honeymoon phase, as the scope of this game could have been better. For instance, the story mode could be use to flesh out the characters more. Their gameplay are fun, but the interaction with the main squad was not seen during the story was quite a let down for me. Hope that in the future we can see expansions that include these characters and their interaction with the main crew. 

But for now, pretty sure that I'll be putting in a huge amount of hours in this game. For a $60 game, it was worth it for me.",1707213286,1707213360,True,2,0,0.532163739204406738,0,True,False,False

the pros:

1. fights are great

2. music is jamming

3. you can play as so many characters and all are unique

4. hitting certain masteries/sigils for your character's build is super satisfying

5. if you like dragons, there are so many dragons. so many

6. endgame is really addicting, especially if you are going for 100% completion. there is so many things to level, collect, and upgrade. this can be seen as a pro or a con depending if you like grinding for hours or not.

7. more content coming out on a monthly basis so yay

here's the cons: 

1. playstation controller works fine but the inputs are xbox??? sadly confusing

2. be sure to back up your save files - a crash could corrupt it and completely brick your save file. 

3. online is buggy, ive already crashed like 4 times and thankfully have had a backup save file since i saved a ton manually instead of autosaving, hope a fix is pushed out soon

4. i hate spending 10 out of my 12 sigil slots on the same thing for every dps character in the game - 4 damage cap sigils, 1-2 character skill sigils, and 4-6 damage specific sigils to hit my damage cap, giving me 1-2 slots for other things yay

5. you will be spamming a button a lot for specific characters that spam one skill, or reading a ton of dialogue to get stat buffs. kind of unlucky

i give this game a solid 8/10

The core gameplay is fun, satisfying and rewarding. It just feels *right* to perfect-dodge an attack and to get rewarded with additional invincibility frames. The game also offers loads of different ways to tailor your character to your playstyle, with a vast amount of grindable loot to add extra effects, ranging from general stats increases to temporary buffs that trigger in specific situations. 

In terms of presentation and atmosphere, Relink is impeccable and exactly how the world of Granblue Fantasy was meant to be enjoyed. The developers put an almost unimaginable level of detail into this game, most of which is easy to miss. You may want to take your time and just look at things while enjoying the absolutely beautiful (and epic) soundtrack.

If there is something I would criticise about Granblue Fantasy Relink, it's mostly related to the story. It's fairly standard stuff that primarily serves as a justification to bombard you with some of the most epic boss fights you can imagine. Also, do not expect your character to actually appear in story cutscenes if they are not part of the main crew.

Attempt to load a save and you may receive one of two errors. Unsure what can trigger the error. I do suggest quitting the game thorough the in-game menu options and hope this is a preventive measure. (No Alt+F4 or anything of the like)

From what I have gathered from forums and some testing myself, there is no work around for either errors from what I can find. Hoping both of these issues are able to be patched.

 While waiting for a fix you can start a new game and grind your way to where you were in your previous save, but no guarantee that your new save wont suffer the same fate.

Other than that I love this game and it's great. Just disheartening being unable to continue my progress. I'll be waiting for a patch in the meantime.

While the coop missions have been lack luster in any form of plot or substance, as they threw narratives out the window and focused on combat.

This is a solid, refreshingly wholesome Action-Combat JRPG with a good chunk of Monster Hunter and Xenoblade thrown in for good measure. Combat is impactful and fluid, though can be a bit sticky at times, with boss fights being expansive, visually stunning, and lots of fun to go up against. The story is pretty standard, if you've played any Final Fantasy you get the gist and the tropes, but it's presented in such a beautiful world with tons of really light hearted dialogue and fun. This game was very clearly made both in Japanese and in the Localized english version to be targeted at younger teens, and honestly I'm all for it. It knows when to be serious but everybody is just having fun going on a big adventure and it's really relaxing to just get lost in and enjoy for what it is. 

There's an expansive post-game multiplayer akin to Monster Hunter fights and long term grinds for every character, character builds are a lot of fun to screw around with, and there's more content planned for the future, so it'll be around for some time to come.

The story is engaging with beautiful cinematics, the combat is fast, fluid and exhilarating.. every character on the roster has a different move set and playstyle which really changes the way you approach each encounter. 

The OST is beautiful and they really incorporated granblue fantasy iconic art style into the world.

- Option to automatically hide the HUD outside of combat
- Option to resize HUD, there's a lot of screen clutter

I hardly every see this in games. i find myself bored fairly quickly with story lines, but that's probably because real life is stranger than fiction these days. You are the hero defeating evil, with the unexpected redemption and forgiveness, which is refreshing, compared to the devil worship forced on the gamer community these days.

The game play is good without question. End game is entertaining, im not sure for how long though to be honest, rinse and repeat does have its shortcomings. Random generated treasure hunt maps in a future update would be fun (with random objectives), and some pvp content like teams vs teams, capture the flag, and protect your beacon would make this game trend.

I recommend buying it and playing it, take your time, explore, look for secret pathways for treasures and crabs. Yes you can speed through it, even on hard. All i can say is though, enjoy it and take your time with it.

The game feels like a mix of Phantasy Star Online, Monster Hunter and Final Fantasy XVI with some Final Fantasy XIV boss mechanics. It starts off easy enough but players are expected to get used to having multiple things thrown at them so paying attention and reacting to whats going on will be important to improve and prepare for future fights and difficulty.

The end game is pretty much what one would epic if they have ever played a Monster Hunter game. Complete missions to gain materials to help improve your character, create builds for your playstyle and grow ever stronger.

The only con's I have for the game is that its near impossible to play with friends that are of lower level then you as you'll be too strong for the missions of the lower level without the power syncing that is unlocked after you beat the game and the power syncing only works with randoms, not with friends you play with.

As well as some boss's having far too little health, making some fights last only two minutes. Most bosses could do with an increase in health as four players can make quick work of enemies rather easily.

La historia esta bastante buena, no te mata la cabeza con tramas complejas, ni te deja todo fácil. Y eso esta bueno para mi gusto.

El apartado visual en general es hermoso, la campaña tiene vistas increíbles del escenario, los personajes lucen bastante bien, los efectos en general son muy buenos también, salvo que en los combates aveces me cuesta ver al enemigo de tanto efecto que hay (mas que nada en enemigos pequeños, como humanos)
En cuanto sonido, es bastante bueno y va acorde con la ambientación de fantasía del juego. La música es realmente buena, tiene varios ost que volvería a escuchar en lugares como YT mientras hago otra cosa.

El gameplay es muy divertido, los combates son cada vez mas dinámicos y difíciles a medida que avanzas en la historia y haciendo las misiones de caza (tipo Monster Hunter) y jugando en cooperativo con amigos (4 jugadores en total) es mucho mas divertido aun.

Durante la versión 1.0.3, al juego le encontré dos problemitas:
- Al abrir el juego, la pantalla se quedaba en negro después de mostrar los logos de la compania.
- El modo coop online tenia una especie de bloqueo de región que no te permitía jugar con gente de otras partes del mundo, y tenias que cambiar la región de descarga de steam para poder jugar con ellos (No estoy seguro de si era un bug o estaba hecho así)
- El matchmaking para jugar misiones rápidas no funcionaba.

Al dia siguiente (creo) en la versión 1.0.4 se solucionaron los problemas antes mencionados, el matchmaking funciona, ahora podes jugar con tus amigos que viven en cualquier lado del planeta parece, y el juego ya no salta pantalla negra cuando lo abrís (por lo menos a mi no me ha vuelto a pasar después del update). Y eso me da la impresión de que los devs están atentos.

Le doy un 9/10 y lo recomiendo.

Pros:
- Fun Combat
- Good Boss Fights
- MH Style Endgame Quest Content
- Visuals that remind me of Tales
- Unique characters 
- Flashy Link Skills
- Rosetta.

Cons:
- Unneeded Quips
- Lyria is played into too heavily as the ""damsel in distress"" type character, dialogue interactions w her are kind of
uncomfortable and corny at times.
- Vyrn
- Vyrn
- Vyrn
- Have I mentioned Vyrn? But seriously, I could handle Paimon in Genshin and normally i'm fine with the slightly annoying
quip companion character, but Vyrn is actually legitimately annoying. He really doesn't add much other than moments where you'd wish he didn't exist in the first place. Always has to bark back that he isn't a Lizard despite being described as a Dragon. Can turn any subtly sweet moment between the cast into a Marvel movie. 


Overall 8/10, would bump higher if there were an option to get rid of Vyrn.

I have just completed the story at 17 hours. It was generic as heck from moment one and I had no patience. I skipped every cut scene after chapter one and have no regrets, but therefore should not comment on the story, but... there really isn't one.

Combat is fairly simplistic, but is very responsive and you can pull off doges and blocks that feel great. Every character, of which there are many, has their own play style that seems to give a slightly different feel to the pattern or flow of combat.

Upgrading is the main goal of the game, both in the story, and in the post game. You can level every character, but they each have an offensive and defensive skill tree that are fairly large and give you a sense of constant character progression. These trees also unlock new abilities. Weapons are also upgradeable with a two part system of leveling them with crystals, and then unlocking the level cap multiple times. This system is further enhanced by giving each character permanent upgrades like stat bonuses for each weapon by reaching their various level caps. This gives great reason for farming crafting supplies from the many quests available.

The quests range from boss fights to horde attacks and point defense. Multiplayer post game content is likely where this game shines best, but as I've only just reached end game and am friendless, I shall refrain from comment.

This is an anime game without the plot, but has plenty of character progression elements to give you a reason to play... That is if you like Tales/Ys/'Generic Anime Game' character action.",1707172203,1707172203,True,1,0,0.494699656963348389,0,True,False,False

It's a really fun Action RPG, even though the MSQ might feel a little short, but it more than makes up for it with it's post-game, I've just unlocked Extreme difficulty quests as of writing this, but even once I get to Maniac and whatever's beyond, I can see myself still putting many, many hours into this just getting lost spamming quests.

All the characters are pretty fun to play in their own right, and the way they've translated their skills from turn-based to action RPG works really well.

[b]Review:[/b]
[b] This game is amazing. I haven't felt this way about a game since I played Monster Hunter World! [/b]

MHW was the one CO-OP action RPG experience that absolutely blew me away. It's not to say there weren't other good ones I played, but MHW was on a whole different level. And the more I played it, the more fun and engaging it become. Most games can't do that, even good ones. They'll have certain times where it'll peak, and certain times where it'll be a bit stale...but MHW was the one game where as you kept playing, the bar of expectation just kept getting raised only to be surpassed over and over again. Just when you thought you were at the ""peak"" of that amazing game, it would keep surpassing your expectations with the next fight or new mechanic or upgrade.

[i]And now Granblue Fantasty Relink is starting to make me feel that way too (although I've only put it in few hours so far). It just keeps getting better and better and better.[/i] 

All the systems in this game just go together so well. It reminds me of some of my favourite parts of other genres. The fun combat and progression from JRPGs. The mission based content, build versatility and uniqueness of each weapon/character from Monster Hunter. The end screen, build versatility, and hop-in-hop-out from Roguelikes. The character collecting and party based progression and party builds from Gacha and JRPGs... And there's so much more of course.

And the level of polish is amazing too. The music, the artstyle, the little easter eggs. Oh man...

[b] This game is probably going to be my GOTY and one of the best action RPGs I know I'll ever have played.[/b]

It's super unfortunate that this game will be overshadowed by more well known IPS releasing around the same time, and won't get nearly the amount of recognition it deserves..",1706859056,1707168308,True,2,0,0.501637578010559082,0,True,False,False

It gives you a little bit of everything and enough to say, ""hey I can keep going or its not for me."" Within the short time frame, it feels familiar like MH but with anime elements. Combat feels extremely smooth and it didn't feel repetitive. From the looks of the trailers, i thought it would be a mindless button smash but its got tactical mechanics. Playing against Mobs, elite bosses and a final boss within 2 hours felt great. Pacing wasn't too rushed or dragged out. 

After Completing the main story mode within 12 hours, on Hard difficulty. The story isn't mind blowing that you'll remember it. But the pacing is quick and each chapter felt extremely short, so it doesn't drag on. The combat mechanics and diversity of each character is what kept me going back and trying new play styles. Its a great introduction for all your basic needs.

Endgame, its similar to Monster Hunter and its now just a grind fest for your favourite characters. Playing on harder difficulties and seeing which set of 4 you want to party with. Multiplayer you'll need some communication on the tougher quest, which should have text or voice chat. There's a ton of flashy animations happening and the UI is packed with information. There's enough for a good 40 to 80 hours, if you're willing to reach max level and for half the roster. 

Overall, its a good game with fantastic combat mechanics. Flashy anime visual effects. Tons of rewards and gear to obtain. Grab your Squad of 4 and Slay those Goblins!",1706917226,1707167925,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The good:
- Fun gameplay and mechanics.
- Bosses does feel like a MMORPG raid.
- Lots of characters and builds to choose from.
- Beautiful graphics and artwork.
- Matchmaking.
- Story so far is very good. Very JRPG lol.
- Servers feel good, didn't get any rubber or lag problems.

The bad:
- English translation is bad. If you know how to read in Japanese, I recommend playing with JP interface. If you only know how to listen/speak, play it with English Dub, that way you won't notice the bad translation. If you don't know JP at all it won't matter, lol. The end result of the dialogues is the same for the story so you won't miss key points, but they tried so hard with localizing the characters speech that the audio doesn't fit the subtitles. 
[strike]- Game feels too easy even on hard difficulty. (still have to experience the endgame content to review it's difficulty)[/strike] From chapter 9 onward the game gets challenging and the quest hub missions gets harder and harder, it will be a real challenge to S++ all of them and most late game bosses have one shot mechanics and are extremely challenging.
- Afraid new characters and new endgame missions could be paid DLCs.

There are so many characters to choose from and they all have distinct playstyles. Plays a lot like a faster Monster Hunter with skill loadouts. Game is very well optimized, I see very few frame drops.

Main complaints at this point are the lock-on targeting can be a bit wonky at times, and the camera angle is sometimes too close and sometimes auto-zooms to locations that I don't want to look at, so I have to fight with it to get back to what I wanted to see.

Only other thing is people who want to play something Monster Hunter style are going to have to play through 10-15 hours of campaign before that really unlocks an endgame. Like I said the campaign is fine though, so just do it!

Granblue Fantasy basically is a Final Fantasy tactics and previous installations in the franshise inspired game and some devs like art director and music producer have indeed worked on the game. This appealed to me because I played those games in the way back machine so naturally the aesthetics of the game and setting is reminiscent to those games. If you come from Final Fantasy games, you will find that most monster types, names, some characters an settings have clothing all very transposed or inspired by D&D or FF installations. This is a great thing for me as it was familiar.

1. Story: Very cookie cutter save the princess, save the world kind of thing also present on final fantasy installations. Not a bad thing, the story moves along with some stakes but there is a problem for me with main plot characters where I couldn't find myself caring at all with Main character Gran and Lyria because there was no stakes with their link. (Not a spoiler, that is just a plot device present since the start) I would hope in future games that is present. However, this game does introduce you nicely to different characters an all characters have interactions between them in gameplay. Super nice touch. Voice acting in english is surprisingly good or similar to Genshin Impact. Not surprised if some actors/actresses of genshin worked on this game. 

2. Gameplay: This is an action RPG reminiscent to some as to Monster Hunter, Genshin Impact esque kind of game which is true to some extent. Here is where CAVEAT for recommending this game comes. This is a character building game where there is some benefits to element weaknesses. That is cool. There is some massive oversights in this game. 

a. While I like characters interactions with each other, they are YAPPING over each other CONSTANTLY AND INCESSANTLY to the point that its incredibly annoying sometimes. They cannot take turns to talk. It becomes a nuisance until your brain shuts off and just ignores them.

b. This game has the worst camera work of all time in any videogame Ive ever played ever in my 30 years playing videogames. You need to turn off settings to alliviate this somehow but still terrible and the POV cant be adjusted either which basically locks you behind your character too close and you lose sight of what's going on specially on very large arenas with large targets and get killed on some random mechanic.

c. Cygames needs to FIRE the whole department that design mechanics for this game and whoever greenlit it. They clearly didnt playtest their own game. HOLY SHT they are terrible. The Lazy fks over there only understand how to do mechanics by basically tying every mechanic to your character's feet or directed specifically to you. So basically if you love overlapping big ass chasing aoe's with other things chasing you at the same time or overlapping on top of other characters that may be around you also with no way to escape it, this is your game. If that means difficulty to you. There is no spacing or method to the madness, there is no static mechanic thing to learn. Some mechanics plain do not give you any way to react to it. It becomes an unlucky, you die... kind of situation that becomes unpleasant. You just pray you are not the one getting barraged by some random sht going your way and die because its undodgeable or unblockable. It is the single worst mechanic gameplay ive ever played in my life. This is what happens when you pay someone 8 hours to work and they work 1 and waste 7 playing on a cellphone. 

d. I feel that the whole growth of the character, what you need to farm and character trees are unessesary convoluted. Most people wont know what to spend points on their mastery trees or how to properly build characters to do what you want them to do. Monster Hunter used Farming Monster parts and Decorations. Here you have so many currencies and things to upgrade that you dont even know where to start or what to do. It becomes incredibly overwhelming and tedious to even know what you need. Most characters can do more than 1 job (tank,dps,healer) not all are good at everything but they have some element or hybrid you can do but even then, most people wont be able to figure out what talents to use for what. 

e. The ascension quest is absolutely the worst fight Ive ever played in my entire life where al crap convert into 1 big pile of dung. The most unbalanced, mechanically devoided, random ass garbage I had to endure. Even with a character well beyond the power needed for it. Its a fest of random, nonsensical mechanics with no method to the madness at all. A true nightmare where you are just glad its over and you dont feel satisfied for mastering it to overcome. Its just desperation to be over because of how bad it is. Thats how I will leave it.

 
P.S. I think that if you are a fan of final fantasy games, you'd be right at home with this game and you'll probably like the story. Is simple but effective. If you like monster hunter, you will find incredibly frustrated with the stupidity of mechanics and camera work. If you are a Genshin Impact player Uninstall your computer and go find a job.",1707154268,1707162009,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

-The Universe and overall Arstyle are both clearly inspired by the Final Fantasy games of old, more specifically V, VI and IX. (which makes sense considering those who actually created the Granblue IP used to work on those old FF games)

It's like a dream come true. I've been waiting for too long for a PC character-collection RPG (gacha type games) that has no predatory microtransactions, no time-gated progression, no bread-crumbing content across year to keep you in the dark but still commited and cannot move on.  I'd almost lost hope, 7 years waiting without any information is a whole kind of let down. But in the end, FREAKIN FINALLY !

And on top of it, it freakin delivers with 5-star rainbow sprinkles. Beautiful character and world design, great animation, skill effects. Plenty of characters and each characters have distinct enough playstyle to make you want to play everyone. And THANK GOD it is actually possible to play everyone without burning your pockets or waiting for stars to align to play those characters. So, because this is a collection-RPG by design, i'll weight out this game like those type of games :

- Story : Good enough to make you pay attention to it and not skipping. Also, cutscenes & animations are top-notch. Soundtracks are a banger but sometimes a little bit too familiar with other JRPGS (no flair/unique)
- Character : Perfect. Yes, some character are stronger so there will be someone out there making tier-lists, but think about it like Monster-Hunter. Every character is great once you know how to use them.
- Grind : If you want to max everyone it's possible, but I think you need to focus on maybe 6-8 character you liked first so you don't feel the grind because your character Power Level kinda matters a lot. And there are some helpful tips like only recruit other character after you reach Lv 60 to save resource.
- Endgame Content : They already said to keep this game updated with content (new bosses, new characters, and stuff), but even without all that, I think this game already have a solid content to make it a full game and not live-service game in disguise.

Bottom line, I think this is an easy 8/10 game for general consensus. But it's 10/10 for me personal reason stated above. Not only that but you could also send a message to other game companies to make games like these.",1706990180,1707159403,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would usually put a game down if it has not captured my interest within a few minutes, and this game has certainly done a fine job in retaining my interest.
The pacing is great, and combat is fun. It is not difficult, and certainly very forgiving in terms of its dodge timing, and it makes for a great casual hack'n'slash session.
There are many characters to use, each with their own unique skill, so it is enjoyable to switch around occasionally and find a specific playstyle to stick to.
The boss battles are times when you really go ham with your teammates, and those times, are really fun when it gets chaotic. 
Boss and skill animations is better than what I had expected, and cinematic is well done, along with the sound design.
As expected from an already well-established gacha game, the voice-acting is all up there.
Game has a pretty good in-game encyclopedia as well, letting you view things such a lore, character models, music, etc., which I think is great for players who are unfamiliar with GBF.

However, if I have to be critical, there are some nitpicks that I can point and feel out.
Facial expressions felt a little bit too static for how good the voice acting is. It makes everything feel a litte bit off... like it's missing some soul. The characters are lively in their body language, however the facial expression really brings the whole thing down a notch. I think its fine during cutscenes, but whenever there is dialogue (when there are dialogues boxes), it really feels ""blank"".
Boob physics, where are they?! I have my settings on MAX.
Environment. I think it is nice, but lacking some ""life"". Maybe more interaction between the characters and the environment would be nice. Something simple such as the foliage swaying against the wind or something, or when the characters bump onto them, causing them to move, would really give it a nice touch. If you look close enough, you can see the leaves move a little, but are just repeated back and forth animations and doesn't really feel like part of the area.
It is lacking things that makes me go ""wow, I want to move towards there and take a look"", the environment doesn't entice me enough to explore it. It doesn't incentivise me to look for things, for example, collectibles you can find, easter eggs, or hidden spots that has a nice scenery. It's a pity because I think that there is much potential in this point, but it's just there. I really wanted to pause and soak in the atmosphere, but I couldn't. And it could also be just a me thing, but passing through NPCs instead of bumping into them just feels out of place. And then, you have also NPCs (in a group) that have huge hitboxes... It's only some of them, but it semi-breaks the immersion. 
Companion/dating system. While it is not of utmost importance, it just feels like a missed opportunity. Relationship events, bonds, etc. I mean it came from a gacha game. I feel like this is a good chance allow players to experience more(?) 

Story-wise, I am currently enjoying it so far, but it just feels like I'm going along on a ride. It's not bad but, it just feels like it needed a little bit more punch. 
Combat is great though. Really, really good. The boss battles are epic, and it feels real good. Also, if you enjoyed playing Monster Hunter/God Eater type games, the gameplay loop will be right up your alley.",1707130623,1707158456,True,2,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

After this the game opens up and the action combat takes the center stage while grinding the characters up to their peak which is nearly a whole other game in itself.

The game is very smooth and is very well optimized. I started the game with not much expectation, and came to realize that it far exceeded it. The gameplay is just so crazy to me. I haven't felt this excited to play a game in years anymore. From how to game looks to even the combat, it all is just fitting right up my alley.

If you love fast phased combat style with anime styled graphics, then you're at the right place.

The game feels similar to Monster Hunter World in terms of how the gameplay is, but still different & unique in its own way. 

My experience so far is mostly Main Story, and as the story isn't really appealing to me (which is your typical 'save the princess' story), I must say that I still enjoyed playing the game in general.

- Optimization: 9/10
- Gameplay & Combat: 10/10
- Content richness: 8/10
- Main Story: 6/10
- Graphics: 9/10

Story length is about 10-12 hours. It's not a ground breaking story. It's safe, but well polished. The world itself is much more rewarding for people that have played the mobile game, but characters have fate episodes that gives insight into the playable characters.
The real meat to the game comes afterwards in missions that come in a Monster Hunter style gameplay loop of progression. Boss fights feel like a action RPG like Monster Hunter while also striking a medium with something like Final Fantasy XIV enemy AoE mechanics. 
Fights with enemies don't feel like reused despite several resources coming from reused assets. Fights stay fresh by ramping up the challenge with new ranks which comes with a fights that have a faster pace and new moves. There are different objectives than just fighting bosses as well such as surviving enemy waves or protecting an objective.

But they do mention bits here and there which can be kind of helpful but may be confusing at the same time for the players who had never played GBF mobile ver. before.

Story wise, it's your very typical JRPG story where you can find it pretty much everywhere anywhere, it's not good but it's not bad either, pretty cliche plot if I must say. You can literally guess how the entire story going to end up. But hey, as a GBF mobile ver. player, the fact that I get to see the characters in 3D and capable of moving them around instead of just looking at a chibi ver. and clicking buttons, it's a nice feeling.

Game play wise, it's fun, every characters work differently and you need time to master them. The dodge and guard mechanics are the one that I find it the hardest to master, I just hate these mechanics overall because I enjoy being brain dead button mashing. Graphic is fantastic, the bloom, the shadow, the everything is just so colorful and fascinating to look at, not even joking. 

So I've seen some reviews that talks about censorship and localization. I am siding with the localization part, but not the censorship part. I find some of the lines the characters spoke and the translation be a bit off and it kinda honestly ruined my experience because I be like ??? and have to make sure what I listened from the voice actor/actress match up with what I am reading, which clearly they don't. But whatever, I couldn't careless about the conversation anyways. As for the censorship, I find it weird that some players are purchasing Gbf: Relink just to look at female characters' panties? Okay, hear me out, I am against censorship too but it depends on the game itself. This is because Gbf: Relink isn't a game that focus on fan-servicing so seeing some of the reviews complaining about this is just funny on my end. Games like Neptunia series, Senran Kagura series which is a fan-service type of JRPGs and if they get a censorship(which I believe some of the series did) I will just not bother and look for something else. Now that, is a bad censorship, but who would've thought people actually complained about not being able to see panties in Gbf: Relink when the game itself is mainly focusing on its gameplay, action, raids, and grinds. Kinda funny tbh. If you want to pay a price that is close to 3A games just to look at panties, you can spend this money onto Koikatsu Party instead, highly recommended!

The game play loop feels rewarding, battles are fun, the variety of play styles each character has keeps things fresh, and grinding for materials to upgrade weapons doesn't feel like a chore. I honestly can't wait to get into post game content, and with news of free updates including ""paid content"" (I assume it'll be costumes) according to their road map, I can only get more hyped to see where this game goes.

I only have two gripes with the game so far, one being the lock on camera leaving much to be desired in terms of following the enemy, I also don't think we need the ability to lock on to objects in battle when free aiming at it would be fine. It got in the way while cycling through enemies, but that may just be me and my skill issues. Second is something Cygames might be workin on already which is the in-game keybinding options, not supporting controller inputs.

Other than that, rock solid game. The review bombing over the PS5 demo access and pre-order bonuses is the weakest argument against the game, that's Sony's hand at play so yell at them aggressively advertising Relink  for their platform.

Gameplay: 10/10 - you have access to a lot of characters from the franchise - from the core characters and also unlockable characters via the ""Gacha"" cards - make sure to choose your characters wisely on early as you are given very few during the story, you unlock more on endgame - I mained Siegfried 
Endgame: 10/10 - Quest structure for endgame is basically like monster hunters, you create a session or you play solo - go to the quest counter, grab a quest and be off on your way, rewards is similar to monster hunter too

But my hype was gone when i started to pay attention to story. The big major flaw of this game is TRANSLATION i have no idea who was the one who did it but i can assure you, THEY DO NOT KNOW JAPANESE. It's bad to the point when what they're saying make NO SENSE of what they're doing. 
In the early game Gran saves Lyria and after some time she say something around the lines:
""About what happened that time, i'd like to thank you for save me.""
It was translated as:
""I HEARD what you did to save me..."".
What??? ""I HEARD"" ...""I HEARD"". Seriously, she's the one who was saved, she was literally there in the event, she DIDN'T heard what Gran did, she SAW him!!

Don't even make me talk about Fate Episodes. All fate episodes translation tells you a different story of what you hear and what you read.
For God's sake is a jRPG, focus on RPG, why the hell the translation is so bad?? It's even worse than Legend of Heroes series and they're awful in translate things.

So yeah translation is so bad that will make you confuse, if you don't read any line in game, maybe story will make more sense to you. I hope that some fan do a patch to a correct translation (I can dream, right?). Right now you can safe jump all text, trust me you're not losing anything.

Playing in borderless window managed to get be through all Chapters. Hope this works for you too. Good luck. 
--------------------------
Cant get past Chapter 1 because the game is too hard ..... to launch

My first launch was smooth so I thought I didnt have the problem people mentioned. Until I get to the airship cutscene, it froze. Tried to restart the game and realised that my first launch is pure luck. Even if I managed to get back in game a few times, I cant get pass the cutscene. I spent an hour to figure out a way to fix it, and that hour get wasted as nothing change. 

The game itself is pretty good, but that is not an excuse for not fixing such obvious bugs before launch (some may say it is your computer's issue, but look at the number of the reviews related to performance issue. And for me, the gameplay was smooth even in Ultra setting, so I dont think it is really the hardware problems.). 

Even if patches comes out and fix all these issues, I am not going to change my review to positive as I dont think it is right to launch a game when it is not ready (although it is very common nowadays).",1706885779,1707133798,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the game suffers from a very generic (and short) story, during which you cannot play co-op with your friends. While relative to other character action games there are a somewhat large selection of characters to choose from that all play meaningfully different from each other, the individual move pool for each character is pretty limited and will get repetitive very quickly unless you are constantly switching characters, which is unlikely unless you are spreading around your resources.

TL;DR If you are a big fan of the franchise or the genre, is probably well worth the full $60 price. However, if you are on the fence enough to be reading deep through reviews, wishlist it and wait for a sale.",1706885074,1707132770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Monster Hunter like game with a weak short story campaign before tedious replayable missions. Better looking and faster/smoother combat than MH. Lazy and uninspired progression with no equipment showing on characters. Craftable weapons and accessories with flat stat increases. No skins either.

Full review: 

I think there are some great things about this game but more negative that outweigh it for me. It’s beautiful to look at though every character looks like they are related, generic anime artstyle and design. And the combat feels responsive and fun. I do like a grindy replay-able gameplay loop in concept. The execution of the gameplay loop is what I don’t like. 

It is somewhat like Monster Hunter but you don’t make any actual equipment except weapons and accessories. What you craft has flat stat increases (boring). You can’t see any upgrades on your character to reward you for your progression. You’re grinding to get more power to kill more things faster but that’s it. You don’t ever get to eventually look like a badass monster hunter or hero. As far as I’m aware from what I’ve seen myself and through research, there is only some dye later for recolor.

The mission rank requirements often have stupid things like “kill with a thrown object 3 times”. The missions remind me of this Viva La Dirt League comedy skit about side quests in RPGs being randomly generated. 

The story is forgettable, this is the first single player game I’ve ever just started to skip every dialogue and cutscene because it was just boring and sometimes even annoying. Luckily it’s short. 

I could see myself playing it longer just to see if there is more on offer later but the things I already mentioned could easily make me just stop playing because that’s not rewarding enough for me.",1706920921,1707130776,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been waiting for this game ever since its 2016 announcement. 

After such a long wait, I remained cautiously optimistic. As a Granblue Fantasy fan, I know I'll like this game, but there's always the possibility that this can turn out to be a shallow cash grab or a broken mess considering this is Cygame's first internally developed AAA major release.

Now that the game is out. I'm actually completely blown away. It isn't just good. It actually turned out to be one hell of a fantastic experience, surpassing every expectation I had.

[h2] Story Mode [/h2]
Let's first address the big elephant in the room: the length of the story.
Depending on how much exploration, additional challenges, quest counter quests that you do, the campaign will take you about 10 to 20 hours to complete. 
This might seem extremely short for a JRPG but don't let this duration fool you. The story campaign is actually only roughly 10% of the total content that this game has to offer. 
The ""real game"" begins after the credits roll. 

Also, while the story itself is short, and the writing is also quite generic, it more than makes up for it by having superb production quality and is filled to the brim with epic cinematic set piece moments. The short duration also means the pacing is extremely tight and never feels like it's dragging on. There is zero down time and I'm constantly being blown away by each subsequent chapter offering an even more impressive set piece moment than the one before.

Don't let the short duration fool you. It is a really epic journey absolutely worth experiencing.

This story is also stand-alone and there are additional optional side stories to explain what came before so you don't really need any prior knowledge about the franchise.

[h2] Quest Mode [/h2]
This is the real main meat and potato of this game and supports up to 4-player online co-op.
While you unlock quest counter relatively early in the game, you have very limited selection of quests you can do.
The game truly opens up after rolling the credits, and it turns into a monster hunter questing structure. All the epic boss fights you've experienced in story mode can now be challenged with up to 3 other friends.
I'm currently relatively early in quest mode but the game director has confirmed there to be more than 100 quests to tackle. People who have fully beaten the game also said that you can easily sink more than 100 hours into this game, depending on how deep you want to delve into it. 

Questing feels rewarding as you're always earning valuable materials, experience or currencies. The quest themselves are also tightly paced so they never feel like they drag on for too long, making material farming that much more enjoyable.

[h2] Playable Characters [/h2]
This is one of the biggest highlight. There are a total of 19 playable characters (including the secret unlockable character you get at the end of the story), and all of them play with a unique style. This is an extremely impressive roster size. 
In a typical JRPG, we'd usually see around 4~8 playable characters on average. This game has double that amount.

All the characters also have very varied voice lines and interaction with other characters in the party during combat sequence. Even the non-story characters (the ones exchanged using tickets) have unique lines to say during story chapters, making it interesting to revisit story mode as different characters later on to see what they all have to say.

Most importantly, they all feel good to play as.

[h2] Summary [/h2]
This game surprised me in the most pleasant way possible, and is some of the most fun online co-op action experience I've had in a long time.

Daffy was no ordinary duck. For starters, he had a bright blue beak that glowed in the dark and a penchant for wearing polka-dotted bow ties. Daffy lived in the quaint little town of Quackville, known far and wide for its magical mishaps and goofy inhabitants.

One sunny morning, Daffy decided he wanted to bake the world's largest pancake. Why? Because it was Tuesday, and in Daffy's mind, Tuesdays were perfect for doing something extraordinary. So, he set out to find the ingredients, waddling his way through the town with a shopping list that read: ""Eggs – lots, Flour – tons, Milk – a small lake’s worth, and Magic sprinkles – just a dash.""

His first stop was at the bustling Quackville market, where he purchased enough eggs to make the chickens gossip for days. Next, he visited the windmill on the edge of town for flour. The miller, a wise old owl named Oliver, upon hearing Daffy's plan, couldn't help but hoot with laughter. ""A pancake that large will need a magic touch,"" Oliver advised, handing Daffy a bag of enchanted flour.

With all the ingredients gathered, Daffy returned home, only to realize he had forgotten one tiny detail – he didn't have a pan large enough to cook the world's largest pancake. Unperturbed, Daffy enlisted the help of his best friend, a magical squirrel named Squeaky, who had the power to transform objects into different sizes.

Together, they transformed Daffy’s swimming pool into a gigantic pancake pan. The whole town of Quackville gathered to watch as Daffy and Squeaky mixed the ingredients using a canoe as a stirring spoon. When it was time to flip the pancake, Daffy, with a sprinkle of magic and a dash of courage, commandeered a trampoline and executed a flawless somersault, flipping the pancake mid-air to the cheers of the amazed crowd.

The pancake was a resounding success, and Daffy declared a town feast. The pancake was so large that it fed the townsfolk for days, with leftovers still to spare. The day was marked in Quackville’s history as ""The Great Pancake Day,"" celebrated every year with pancakes and a town-wide trampoline contest, all thanks to the goofy ambition of a duck with a bright blue beak and a love for Tuesdays.

And so, Daffy’s tale became a legend in Quackville, a story of how a duck’s whimsical idea brought a town together, proving that sometimes, the goofiest ideas can lead to the most delightful outcomes.

I cleared the main story and starting to do maniac level on coop as of writing. I will try my best to keep this review as spoiler free as possible. Lets start with :



Complaints

- This is my biggest one, where there is no map or mini map available in the game (that navigation compass thing on the top doesn't help especially in back alley in the bigger town). Things like knowing where is the locked treasure chests, the location of omens that I missed, collecting notes and  ""stuff"" would be a lot easier with a map or mini map available

- Some bosses require players to broke X amount of parts but the broken parts indication on monster is not obvious enough that most of the time I have no idea if the part we are attacking is broken or not (in my opinion, Monster Hunter did a very good job at this, its very easy to tell if the monster parts is broken or not)

- This is probably just me but I can't sort filter on side quest to set it to show completed side quests on top first and this annoyed me as hell. Also although it was nice that we can fast travel to the npc to report the completed quest, I wish we can fast travel across other town as well (cygames might as well let us do this since we are teleporting anyway, why must we have to be in the same town to teleport to the said npc?)

- Although they already added assist and full assist mode in the setting to help with non experienced players, I still wish to play the main story on coop with my friends since most of the time I'm travelling with a party of 4 throughout the main quest anyway simply because I wanted to enjoy the game with friends that waited for this game to release for many years

- I wish they make the cpu a little smarter because eventhough cpu have superior element against the monster or bosses, they don't  know how to be the first to trigger the ougi. This will help a lot since the first to ougi is the one who will be deciding the elements of the whole chain burst so we are losing a huge chunk of damage when not doing superior elemental damage to the monster



The good stuff

- Luckily enough my experience since the beginning is smooth. I have never encounter any crash, lag, etc that a lot of people been complaining since the game releases on steam

- Epic boss battle and epic boss battle! This is so good that I'm constantly amazed at it and also the last boss fight is super epic that I almost cry due to that epicness! 

- The characters are unique on their own which makes the gameplay very fun! With more coming in future dlc, I wish we can get some playable primal characters from huge gbf rosters. I just want to see them wreak havoc in the map! (Zooey waifu, please come home!) Yes, I also know that a lot of people are demanding the flying potato to be playable too

- If you're like me who wonder around in town and truly enjoy the world itself, the npc in town actually have little progression on their story every time you clear a new chapter of the main story and back to the town. These kind of titbits in rpg is amazing and I like it alot 

- The beautiful art, the world, the bustling town, everything is so alive and I feel like I finally get to experience gbf world inside out since the mobile game is in 2D. So this experience is just out of the world for me

- Great soundtrack and bgm that I already taken for granted since I'm expecting nothing less than that. Yes, it will get repetitive when you grind through the coop but it's still great music regardless

- Finally we get voiced Djeeta in the story! To be honest it was really good but also feels weird at the same time because we don't get much voiced Djeeta in the mobile game



As for the conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to those who enjoy playing jrpg and also action games. Some might say the main story is short but I would prefer it to be shorter and epic rather than dragged long and boring. After all this was meant to be like Monster Hunter where you clear the story and then enjoy more epic fights in the end game (grinding included). As a fan of gbf, I wish this game can make it to the top and shine!",1707115171,1707115171,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

What I liked: Combat, Style, Boss fights, various enemy types, every character seems fun, story has little down time, QoL additions, and reasonable character progression. 

What I disliked: The camera feels a bit slow when turning during fights, but that is my only con for now.

What I expect in the FUTURE: Really all the games has to do is add more of what is already in the game such as adding more characters, skills, cosmetics, new zones, Hard modes, and most of all more Boss fights.

If you're wanting this for the story just don't, don't buy the game.
If you're thinking about the DLC or deluxe edition just don't, it's largely earnt ingame or just some crap reskins that look unnatural or a weapon that trivialises early game and becomes worthless later.

On the plus side, they're selling the whole game without cutting difficulty modes to sell as DLC

The story (quite short as is) is sub par however the localization is absolute trash which drags it down to trash tier, not the first time I've seen a situation like this but dang this one is REAL BAD. Lots of phrases are tweaked to just be nonsense to the point where I'd prefer machine translations, I can't even picture the audience this would be localized for.

""I can't walk anymore""
""Same, my dogs are barking""
Yes, it's that bad - these people are terrible at their job.

Kinda funny because they could have saved money and made the game better at the same time by just machine translating and not applying the minor censorship. No need spending money for a whole set of voice lines reading the trash that the localizers vomited up or giving us a custom version - just give english menus plus some semi-decent subtitles and the people who buy these games will be mostly happy.

Save money + happier customers = bigger profits! Capitalism ho!

If you do buy for the gameplay switch voices to JP and skip the cut scenes... hurts me to say that but hey, won't lie about it.

Disclaimer: I've played the gacha casually as f2p for a few years so my familiarity with the characters and everything else does give me a positive bias.

While it is simple story, there is no filler fetch quest, it is very to the point and, the quality is amazing. Overall still a very enjoyable experience. 

The combat is where this game shines, there are a lot of unique characters and they all have a very different playstyle compared to each other. Tons of post game content to grind out, although the boss variety can be lacking but looking at the roadmap, I think we can expect that they're going to be adding bosses in the future starting from March for one more boss and 2 more playable characters in April.

Not a disappointment at all. It caught me and hooked me.

Pros:
-Beautiful graphic style.
-Great English dub.
-Tons of gearing potential and options.
-No microtransactions (Yet)
-Excellent cast of characters
-Fast action, can make you feel like a god

Cons:
-The story isn't anything special, it's generally easy to predict and straight forward but it is serviceable.
-Combos can feel limited individually depending on character.
-Not much guidance on the gearing aspect of things.
-A lot of different materials needed can feel overwhelming for some.

Astounded and can't wait to see what's to come.

If you enjoy well designed combat interactions that involve player skill to reach the hardest content then you will like this.

So the good part is, the game looks nice, especially the 3d anime cutscenes.  Story doesn't drag on with dialogue and usually gets you into the action.  Multiplayer worked for me and a friend, but we are in the same region.

The combat is simple to get into, but has depth.  The boss fights are basically MMO boss fights, so there is a lot of mechanics and changing mechanics.  Its not monster hunter, but I understand the comparisons since a lot of content is fighting these multi-stage boss encounters.  Trash fights are not as interesting, but fills the *warriors itch.  Getting high ranks on quest board missions is a good time.  The game is hella fun if you enjoy fights with actual mechanics and not just mash button gameplay.  

The bad edited: Seems to have mostly been fixed, they even added dualsense compat because I had some trigger action on the ships cannons today.			

This game was not meant to be played with an erratic freelook, but it doesn't excuse the fact that using a mouse is the antithesis of enjoyability.  You expect more control with a mouse than you do an analog stick, and it ends up feeling clunky and unresponsive no matter what sensitivity or setting you use.  Controls wise the game would actually play better on KBM, since it allows you to bind controls that are behind layers on controller, but mouselook is just so damn bad that the experience is kind of ruined.


So while I play games for fun, and I enjoy this game enough to endure whatever problems it has.  These problems shouldn't exist, especially not the controller issue. If you enjoy games that provide some challenge I would suggest you endure as well.  You're gonna be in for a good time.  Optimizing these fights such that I take zero damage is exciting, and doing it with a friend makes it even better.",1706843985,1707105955,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

✅Great voice acting -  ENG is surprisingly good and JP is made up of Pro's.
✅Challenging gameplay - It is grindy and you will think that it's just button mashing beating down everything as if it was a musou game but once you get to proud mode (The last difficulty) it gets exceedingly harder and parties will wipe. Once you beat the boss after struggling and trying multiple parties and builds it feels ecstatic, a satisfying sense of accomplishment. 
✅Unique character gameplay which will reward you greatly if you master them and the skill tree gives you option to fit in different play styles with just one character.
✅Works on steam deck but would rather use a more comfortable controller.
✅Great visuals anime style
✅Nothing ""woke"" was ever mentioned, which is a positive for any game.
✅$60 release as opposed to the cringe $70 default by Corpos that releases AAA titles.
✅No Denuvo
⛔️Terrible Localization. You can never learn Japanese when the subtitles have zoomer catch lines.
⛔️High PC requirements will cause headaches for some people

Pros:
- Fluid Combat
- Decent graphics with very pleasant art style and good character facial animations
- Large character variety and even larger pool of characters in original base game to potentially add to Relink
- Flashy and satisfying animations
- Decent amount to grind that can be done co-op or solo
- Auto battle feature like the gacha game ;^)

Cons:
- Disgustingly bad English subtitles even with the very limited Japanese knowledge
- Story is pretty meh/cliche and a bit drawn out towards the end, they should of just started the story from the very beginning, a bit of disservice to newer players of this franchise
- Menu'ing can be a bit tedious 
- Issue with 12th gen CPU causing blackscreen on launch + game to stop responding during specific cut scenes. Work around was disabling e-cores in bios or downloading process lasso

- QoL (you can open chests while sliding down sand dunes. i was surprised).
- decent cast of characters with varying playstyles. 
- somewhat difficult. i'm playing on the hardest difficulty and most of the challenge is trying to tell what's happening behind all of the visual effects during combat.
- combat is smooth and satisfying, especially when compared to other action anime games. 
- characters are charming. not too sure on their depth and development (there are fate episodes which is basically learning about specific characters).
- exploring is fun and rewarding
- zeta and ferry are cute. io too.

some issues i have:

- dialogue during bossfights. thankfully, most of the dialogue isn't important
- story is whatever. don't play for the story.
- AI companions aren't bad at all, but... there will be times when they die. and if they die too often or you're too slow to revive them, you're forced to restart the fight. doesn't matter how well YOU dodge, counter, etc. there are ways to prevent this from happening though, it was just annoying the 2-3 times it happened.
- commissions lack enemy variety. i just finished chapter 6 and basically you take a mission and fight an enemy you already fought. not only that, commissions also have sub goals like ""kill X amount of enemies, kill X enemy, etc."" the only one that's actually bad is ""complete mission within 2 minutes."" the fact is, a lot of the mini boss/boss enemies have time waster phases.

The game is extremely fun and the story is really good.  My only complaint I have with the game, honestly, is the fact that they are charging 8 dollars for re-coloring of characters default skin.  And it isn't like over the top recoloring either.  If they want to charge for cosmetics, it needs to be actual skins for characters in the game, not recolors.

This game gets the monster hunting formula spot on, the build flexibility is awesome, the character (weapon) variety is great and each character is complex enough to make grind sessions interesting. I wish there were more ranged characters though.

The story is nothing out of the ordinary, acts as a spin-off to granblue fantasy's main story, happening in-between the main adventure. The boss fights go from plain at first to really fun at mid to late story, especially the latter fights.
Everything is dubbed, which is barely talked about at this point, as if it was granted. The localization has been a hot topic of discussion but I find it good enough. People would have a meltdown if Lowain was in the game (I love lowain).
The music and visuals are really good, they translate the feeling of the mobile game which is the point.

Matchmaking got fixed with the last update, so they need to work on what was described below as many still rely on fixes to run the game to begin with. But I have faith this game can be a banger in the monster hunting genre, somehow. I hope they make expansions for it.

UPDATE: Found a fix by setting process priority to high, this unexplainable fixes all freezes, most common freeze spots I could find up to chapter 5 proceed without issue. Now that I can actually play the game, I can say it's good, but they really need to get to patching these. Finding fixes took a whole day.

---
I've been affected by freezes since starting the game. You must NOT TOUCH ANY INPUT until the main game logo shows up, or else the screen will freeze. 
In-game, several cutscenes starting from the airship scene leaving the first town (mid-tutorial, or so I imagine) will freeze unless skipped. Meaning I have to skip scenes in a 60 bucks game just to be able to play.

GPU usage is abnormally high, the game should not be choking on a 3070 this hard.
I hope they address these issues soon, because I have been wanting to play this for years.
You can look up more examples of scenes crashing, while also finding troubleshooting steps like running in dx12, not going fullscreen, changing graphic settings... none worked for me.

For once, the main story is painfully generic. Like, awfully so. The pacing is not great and the way some of the characters act feel so cliche it hurts. 
Localization is, however, not one of the issues. A lot of ""tourists"" as the GBF calls those that are newcomers to the franchise and are unaware of the story in the gacha game think that the localization of the game is flawed (and this is ok), and has been influenced by whatever the hell ""western values"" means. Truth is, the localization for the Gacha is very similar, as both are done in-house by Cygames. The localization is exactly the one the devs intended and have intended for the last 9 years. 
That aside, the gameplay is fantastic if you are looking for something that scratches your MonHun itch. Like in most MH titles, the game is structured in a similar fashion, with a very easy story serving as a fantastic tutorial for the actual hard endgame content. Around proud difficulty it starts to genuinely pick up. Likewise, the fights, which start quite simple, wildly escalate out of control and become absurd in the best of meanings. 
I've been waiting for years for this game, and they delivered.

This game has proved that exact statement, its one of those games that was stuck in development hell for almost 7 years but comes out prevailed keeping the same fundamental ideas and grounded approach to what makes RPG games great. With the addition of co-op i find myself playing this game for endless hours and the additional announcements of new characters and content to be added in the coming months.

This would be one of those games that you would believe would surface from being live-service but that mode never usually works out for most games and im glad that this game isn't a live service, produce content every 4-5 months or have the same model as MH with big expansions giving you the incentive to come back to the game... I would find myself being more inclined to the later

Overall the game is great, it had its problems with the multiplayer region lock but it seems that the developers are doing their very best to improve the pc experience.

Features online co-op for up to four players in non-story missions, but the party AI is actually competent enough that you can consider playing with others optional if you're committed to playing this solo (or if you're picking this up many years from now after the playerbase has died down).

Pros:
[list]
    [*]Beautiful visuals and overall spectacle. The vast majority of cutscenes are done in-engine too so you never feel as though you're ""taken out of it"" in the middle of, or between fights by jumps in visual fidelity.
    [*]Eighteen different playable characters each with their own unique playstyle.
[*] Responsive and satisfying action-RPG gameplay.
    [*]An excellent soundtrack.
[*] Very likeable character cast, albeit one-dimensional.
[*] Lots of post-game stuff to grind. The game doesn't stop at the credits!
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
    [*]Only 6 of the 18 characters (the ones you start with) have any story relevance. All the rest at best contribute with a little bit of unique story mission dialogue (which in and of itself is actually nice attention to detail).
    [*]Somewhat light on content if you have no interest in the post-game grind or doing side-content (somewhere in the realm of 15-20 hours).
    [*]The plot is incredibly generic and doesn't try to subvert or remix common JRPG tropes/story beats in the slightest. The spectacle is top-notch, but don't expect anything that will stick with you in any capacity in the long run.
[*] English localisation is unnecessarily divergent and injects a lot of quirkiness (i.e., modern-marvel-movie-style quips) into the dialogue where it doesn't need to be. Even someone like me who doesn't understand Japanese beyond a few stock anime phrases was able to notice this.

Now that the issue preventing me from doing so has been removed I can happily recommend the game as it is Incredibly fun and look forward to seeing how much further it will go.
Edit 1: I'd like to simply put here that there is a workaround for the cutscene crash. I replicated this from another user, restart your PC(at least once since you started having the crash) and play through that boss fight without ever plugging in the controller, and once you reach the cutscene skip is as quickly as physically possible. HOPEFULLY it works, as soon as you are back in the normal game you can plug the controller back in(if you have it) and resume normal play. This does not change my review, as the problem is still a Problem, but I thought I would just try and see if I could help others get around it until they fix the cutscene crash.
Original review:
Oh dear god how I wish I could just slap a thumbs up and call this a good game. Because it really is, it just has some very. VERY bad problems that prevent me from recommending it IN IT'S CURRENT STATE.
Crashes during cutscenes, Various with extremely unpredictable triggers(including a nigh unavoidable(actually unavoidable for me and a few others) hard crash that is guaranteed to trigger instantly at the post final boss' cutscene). [Absolute definition of ""game-breaking"" bugs]
The rare frame drops are confusing but minor annoyances at worst.
The PC port is... Quite janky, especially with the never-sufficiently-hated aim acceleration that makes all mouse movements very floaty and hard to be precise with. Thankfully I do have a controller for just these kinds of games, but for those without that luxury it WILL be a problem.
there are a few smaller issues but those are the ones I most noticed through my nearly 12 hour playthrough, mostly in one sitting, in which I have technically ""beaten"" the main story, minus of course the aforementioned complete inability to progress beyond the unavoidable crash cutscene..
Please Cygames fix at least the cutscene crashes as soon as is reasonable. I REALLY want to change this review to positive and will do so as soon as it's fixed.",1706886352,1707088879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I heavily enjoyed Cygames' previous foray into action RPGs with Dragalia Lost and have been playing Granblue Fantasy for almost three years now. Granblue is a series that is near to my heart, and this game captures the charm of Granblue while combining it with the gameplay of Dragalia, Xenoblade, FFXIV, and heck, even Warriors games to create the funnest action RPG I've played in ages. 

The game combines action really well with the teambuilding and strategy of Granblue with things like grid building being in this game with the Sigil system, but it is much easier for newer players to understand. This game is also very beginner-friendly to the Granblue or Cygames-verse and doesn't require much supplemental reading, however I would suggest reading the first 30 chapters of the gacha game, a summary of them, or watching the anime that is up for free on Youtube to at least understand the characters, however the game also explains their backstories through fate episodes, so you won't be left in the dark if you haven't played Granblue before.

the story tbh didn't really do much for me, it served bare minimum for me to have a reason to be fighting and why they're my enemies but it didn't really take me in that much, more the big boss fight moments and big spectacle moments.

One thing I appreciated is that it is a complete game, I'm glad it didn't take anything from the live-service crap many other studios are doing, and I kinda feel excited to learn that there will be more DLC characters in the future.

I really liked the combat too, it boil downs to 2 button combo but it's still fun especially with the help from your party members, where they're not a showpiece like most games and actually do stuff. Chain ult is very cool, it does gives me the ""fantasy"" party vibe and I loved it.

However, There are 3 different systems on just 1 single weapon, let along you have multiple weapons on a character, and each character all came with all sorts of other grinds like sigils and msp. Like I said I never played GBF before, I did not know it was like this. I'm OK with JRPGs with stats leveling and comfortable with farming some super rare materials, but this game is just too much. It is more grindy than MH, and MH was at my sweet spot in terms of needed grind.

The true deal-breaker for me is that you cannot unlock all playable characters unless you play online-mode (repetitive contents recycled from campaign), it's not like you can't play at all, but some stages like the one where you had to pick up coins, and since NPCs only follows you, you will not get the desired reward for playing through the whole mission.

Fun combat that's just a tad too simplistic and stat-dependant for my liking; Fun bosses that are just a tad too reminiscent of MMORPGs for my liking; Exciting story mode that's just a tad too cutscene-heavy for my liking.
That said, the visuals are flat-out gorgeous and it runs like a dream.
Oh also! Kudos for not featuring an incredibly obnoxious character in the primary cast, that's a rare quality these days.

I hope the devs will continue to add more quests and especially more boss fights to the game, because as it stands it's a Monster Hunter-lite ARPG that boasts the amount of bosses appropriate for a one-and-done singleplayer affair. Which is to say too few for this format.

Regarding the bugs - i've installed the game on the 03/02/2024, that's 03 of February. not a single hickup, not a single bug, no crashes, nothing. i am rolling a very high end rig, but i've never noticed anything, so if you're not sure - try benchmarking it or something.

Worship him. A god has been born unto the world
Cower in fear. He will not forgive any vice
Devote yourself. Your fate is all but written

For what, did he invoke creation? So life may thrive
Then what, meaning lies in life? What becomes of that question?

Come, watch your world drift into a vivid reality
Bring your will, ready yourself for supremacy
Black wings will reign down, fulfilling the skyborn prophecy
Life and death become one, the miserable and the blessed return to the void

Receive the twilight, witness as all creation twists into new form
Now, I call you, O grand chaos
I prostrate myself before you in this moment, grant my wish

Turn all, bind all until everything is black darkness

It does have a feel of monster hunter with the big bosses you fight as a team as well as some beat'em up elements when you fight hoards of goblins, soldiers etc. Sometimes both as the same time!

The game starts easy, but the difficulty grows as you go along, and sometimes you might hit a wall and need to strengthen your character. Strengthening your characters feels REAL good, you can definitely see the power of your character increase allowing you to overcome tougher bosses you may not have been able to beat before. And there's a lot of ways to improve such as mastery tree, strengthening weapons, strengthening sigils, imbueing weapons etc. 

There are a lot of bosses, but there's no denying you will be fighting some same bosses with different element or twists to them. So if you get tired of fighting the same boss and grinding, this may affect your enjoyment. I don't mind personally as I want higher scores and better rewards.

I like numerous characters as a relatively picky person.  Just wish I liked a light character because Ascension is my favorite full burst.

Look, the story is as barebones as it gets. Which is a shame, because it's clear there's a lot of quality lore and franchise history to pull from. The sidekick character is utterly awful to listen to. And the game lacks a good amount of PC settings, has limited frame rate support, and zero ultra wide support (though, it is relatively well optimized, I'll give it that).

But everything else? It's great. It's got high quality character action and stands toe to toe with Platinum's best. It's got more JRPG elements (gear, leveling, systems, parties, etc.) than the newest Final Fantasy. Its world is beautiful. The music is exceptional. The art and graphics are S-Tier.

What hooked me right away was the quality of the art (when you look into the distance, and especially at the skyboxes, it looks like they were oil paintings), the VFX, and especially so the soundtrack. Man, the soundtrack.

It manages to be a very competent JRPG with action (!!!) combat. Yes, it does suffer from the stereotypical 'numbers must get bigger exponentially' syndrome, but when playing the story mode for the first time, that's barely noticeable. If you just upgrade your weapons and unlock skills, you'll get through it just fine if you're a somewhat competent player.

The leftovers from the mobile game are, as far as I can tell, things like the Fate Episodes, which, in essence, give you backstory for each of the unlockable and playable characters, with slight stat increases as rewards or sometimes additional gear slots. Unlike the cutscenes in the rest of the game they aren't animated, but mostly text scrolls, which I felt was a little out of place and made me want to simply skip through them to get the stat buffs. The other major thing is how you unlock additional characters, in some sidequests you get Crew Tickets, which you can use at a trader to recruit new characters. The selection is decent and pretty much 50/50 m/f, so you don't end up 'collecting' 'just' women like in other JRPGs (unless you choose to).

Another highlight for me, is how the entire main story is fully voiced. Every cutscene, every little conversation, all of it. This adds very solid value when compared to other games where the characters just speak about half of the first sentence in every conversation. The quality of the (japanese) VA is impeccable, with some pretty big talents all around. I usually fast-forward through JRPG dialogue, here I actually wanted to go through it normally because of the voice-acting.

My two major gripes are to do with the plot, and the crabs. The goddamn crabs. They've hidden at least 45 crabs throughout the world and there is an accessory which grows in power based on how many crabs you have found. You end up turning over each and every metaphorical rock, smashing any destructibles you come across, in hopes of there being just one more damned crab.
The plot made me want to reach through my monitor to smack some sense into some of the characters. The villains are comical (even for anime standards), the main characters are daft as heck (pretty standard for anime), and sadly three quarters of the game are spent just with those kind of engagements. Maybe this means I actually cared about the plot somewhat, I'm not sure.

Some of the boss fights are pretty incredible as well. With hints of MGS: Revengeance and a dash of FFXIV.
Occasionally missions change up the usual action combat by giving you special 'conditions', I won't go into details for spoiler reasons but they felt amazingly well timed and refreshing whenever they did come around.

I don't really write reviews but I think this game deserves it. Based on my progress I estimate around 20 hours for the main story and basically all side-missions. Afterwards you unlock a higher difficulty to play through it all once more, as well as the ability to revisit story maps if you want to 100% the collectibles and unlocks. So probably around at least 50-ish hours if you want to have seen everything the game has to offer at least once. There's also 'Monster Hunter'-esque multiplayer.

The pricetag is somewhat of a downer, but considering I went into this game fully expecting yet another mediocre JRPG with the qualities of a trash port, I don't regret paying full AAA money for this.

I've seen some people say this is essentialy Genshin without the gacha and I disagree, the combat here has way more to offer than Genshin could ever aspire to.

The game runs perfectly fine on my system (R7 5700X, 32GB Ram, RTX 4070Ti) and I've only experienced a single crash, where the game froze during a cutscene, reloading fixed it.

On my completely arbitrary, and not at all inspired by IGN, rating-scale I'd give this game an 8.5/10.

[list]
[*] Strange localization decisons regarding adding slang and whedonesque writing where there were previously none in the Japanese script, and some character costume changes that were obviously done thanks to Sony's horseshit. Why they felt like they needed to add the whedonesque quips, a reference to Smokey Bear's slogan in one of the quest names, and a Donald Trump MAGA reference in another is beyond me, but literally nobody finds it charming.

[*] Mouse emulating an analog stick, apparently doesn't play nice on non-US layout keyboards. No way to turn off the obnoxious mouse smoothing.

[*] No mouse input in menus. You have to mess around with WASD, Enter, and the left mouse button to navigate anywhere.

[*] No ultrawide or 16:10 support, hardcoded resolution options. You only have the choice of 720p, 900p, 1080p, 1440p, or 2160p, and the game doesn't take whatever display resolution you have. There's more people using ultrawide and 16:10 displays than there are 2160p display users, so the ""muh market share"" argument makes zero sense when you consider that most of these 3D games can support arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios very easily (or at least with some oversight).

[*] Limited graphics options, no DLSS3/XeSS/FSR3, performance could be better. 

At 1080p and max settings, performance isn't bad, but could definitely be better. Performance is about the same on my desktop with a RX 6900XT and i5-13600K, but at 1440p instead of 1080p. I will at least say that GPU Sync (as shown in Intel PresentMon is close to the amount of time it takes to draw a frame (Which is a good thing), and from my time looking at a few frame captures in RenderDoc, nothing egregious shows up at first glance. It does not hold a rock solid 120FPS on my gaming laptop at 1080p at least, but it’s still better than the PS5 version performance wise. The game barely even hits a rock solid 30FPS during gameplay with the lowest possible graphics settings at 720p on the Steam Deck, at least without mods.

[*] Only goes up to 120FPS (although I will commend the developers on using doubles for their framelimiter instead of floats or integers, so it's really precise and doesn't have nearly as many rounding errors), and the physics become more stiff the higher you go from 30FPS (Y'know despite the developers shipping the game with a 60FPS performance target in mind lol).

[*] No PlayStation prompts despite claiming the game has native support on the Steam page (apparently you have to disable SteamInput for this, but from my testing, it doesn't work with my DualSense). People claim it has SteamInput support, but no, it’s just using XInput emulation that comes with SteamInput already. The game technically only supports Xbox controllers out of the box.

[*] Cutscenes constantly freezing and softlocking the game. I have personally stumbled across this issue once so far.

[*] It's crashing for a bunch of people and refusing to start up for others. A couple patches have released to help this, but startup times are still abnormally long.

[*] Region locking for matchmaking based on the current region that is selected for downloading games on Steam (WTF). As a result, matchmaking takes forever.
[/list]
Either this game was stuck in development hell and it shows, the PC port wasn't ready and CyGames did not release a demo on PC for that reason (something to hide), or from their past record with mediocre PC releases on Steam they don't give a single shit about UX on PC. There's no reason the game should be in the state it's in for $60-80, even if the game underneath was absolutely worth the 6 year wait. These things absolutely mar an otherwise great game in the year of 2024.

Now with the current issues out of the way, the game looks nice, has fast loading times (outside of when the game starts up where it takes it’s sweet time), and has spatial audio at least. The gameplay is great, and the story is alright for what's essentially a tie-in game that compliments the mobile game, finished it and it took around 15 hours or so to finish the main story. Rolan is a badass.

And on the topic of mods to help mitigate some of the current issues, for those wanting an ultrawide fix, the FPS to have it's cap moved up to 240FPS, 16:10 support on the Steam Deck, and support for resolutions higher than 4K (on PC) or lower than 720p (on the Steam Deck), check out Lyall's mod for this game. With it and with a 960x600 custom resolution, you can actually lock to 40FPS on the Steam Deck without many dips. It also expands the top and bottom with aspect ratios narrower than 16:9, so you can have a proper experience on the Deck without black bars:

Story is the weakest part of this game but it's still serviceable with some epic moment. Please do note even after getting the credit the game isn't finished, after you finished the main story it's where the main part of the game started and this endgame part is very fun albeit requires you to grind like monster hunter style.

Combat is the strongest part of the game, it's very fun, fluid with good co op system but even those who don't want to play co op can play solo with AI controlled party but you will have to grind a lot more. There a lot of character and each of them have their own gameplay.

It's kind of two games in one.  First is the typical JRPG stuff.  You follow a standard linear story with a set cast of characters. 
 You can play any of the characters, but the main character has to stay in the party(of 4) for the story.  For my tastes, the story and dialogue are a bit too PG/simple, maybe even cheesy at times, but it's still fun to go through.  English voice acting is decent.  I did all the hunt missions as they came available, and didn't require any grinding to beat the game.  Took about 17 hours, but I'm normally slow at progressing.
The second game is the Monster Hunters style, which happens after the ending.  Various levels of difficulty unlock on the hunt missions.  You grind out hunts to get more materials to upgrade your weapons, sigils(like armor pieces almost), mastery points(talent tree) etc.  There's more unlockable characters, for a total of 19, to change up your playstyle.  Only negatives I've seen is there's not a lot of monster variety, so you're killing the same stuff over and over, but the grind is fun because the combat is great.  Also, all the hunts can be played 4 player coop, or solo with AI party.
Summary, if you're just playing for the story, it might be a bit short for full price.  If you plan to engage at all with the endgame, well worth the price.

1. The side quests are little more than a random NPC with a minimalistic textbox listing fetch quest requirements.
2. The 'Extra Crew Members' are recruited through a character card system rather than actually being found out in the world as part of your journey.

If this doesn't seem like a red flag for JRPG fans then I dont know what else to say. 

Sure the combat is fun, but the skills themselves are somewhat basic and the 1 / 2 combo system is EXTREMELY limited. Not to mention the UI itself is poorly designed and your character will CONSTANTLY have a little popup floating around their head telling you what arts level they're at which you CANNOT get rid of.

The worst part is that the game seems to assume you are a big fan of the original mobile game because it throws an entire crew and storyline at you with no codex, no backstory and virtually no explanation or anything as far as WHY this crew of people is working together to go... somewhere?

It was one of the first truly cinematic JRPGs about a tightly knit airship crew sailing skies full of floating islands.  The game was highly imaginative and ever since that game I was looking for the next great skyship adventure.  Skies of Arcadia II never came.

Several years back, as a big fighting game fan, I came across Granblue Versus.  The world and colorful crew of the Grandcypher immediately scratched that itch.  I found that GBF was actually a massive IP that had been running for some time and was exactly what I was looking for, but I was not one for mobile games and the game did not have much of a western footprint outside of Versus -which I loved.

Then COVID came and killed GBF.  At that point, I figured the great sky ship adventure was over.  But then we got the Rising announcement, which brought the game back in full force.  Then there was the commitment to Re:Link.

Going into Re-link, the game immediately took the best things about Skies of Arcadia, Monster Hunter, and Namco Tales games and mashes them together in a giant carnival generated for pure fun.  This series and game was exactly what I was looking for following tales.  I already had favorite characters and some lore from Versus and being able to play a full fledged action RPG set in this universe was exactly what was needed.

This game has probably the best RPG action combat system ever created.  The battles and bosses are immensely fun with true challenges on harder difficulty.  The crew members are all very unique in their playstyle and you can spend hours optimizing and coming up with team compositions, some of which may work better than others depending on what you are fighting.  I haven't messed too much with the Co-Op but it looks fun and servicable.

The game absolutely deserves to be sitting at over 100k steam users post launch.  The game and world is painstakingly crafted and all the years of development show in the presentation and fun.  There are absolutely crazy fun battles in the story and missions, intense airship battles, hordes of mobs, and gigantic monster hunter bosses with crazy raid boss attacks.  All the systems feel fair.  The controls are snappy and intuitive, which is very different from the chunkiness of monster hunter.  Every character feels uniquely powerful and customizable.  While there are battle shouts they are no where near as drowning as Xenoblade.

While there were post launch intel processor blackscreen issues, these are for the most part fixed.

I definitely highly recommend the game, this is one of the best JRPGs to launch and is built on an expanding formula.  I look forward to seeing more Granblue here in the west, I will buy it all in whatever form its in as long as the quality persists.",1707065915,1707065915,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Difficulty scaling was very good in my opinion, it wasn't hard transitioning from just Story and then going all out Hard/Very Hard/Extreme/Maniac/Proud.

Progression is rather linear, so it might be a sign that there will be no such thing as Duels/PVP in this game.

Every design in Relink is good and respect the originals designs (again, I have been playing for more than 7 years) , so far there's 0 issues with the game other than typical port issues, but even so Cygames always works towards improving the stability of their games.

There is a lot to love if you're a fan of JRPG combat with some monster hunter elements to it. 

The gameplay and systems surrounding how to improve and build your character are what glued me to this game from the first few hours. While the gameplay during the story can be slow until the last few chapters the gameplay once you reach the quest system is where the game actually begins and is fantastic. Grinding out the mastery points and materials needed for your character and multiple others is fun because the gameplay and bosses is fun to begin with. I loved the steady progression i felt in both my character(s) and bosses i fought as i moved up from Hard difficulty all the way to and through Proud difficulty. with 19 characters to pick from and 2 more coming in March, All of them feeling unique from one another will give you plenty to dig into and have fun with as you try out and build different characters and there respective playstyles. 

Now for the story i wasn't a fan of it but i didn't hate it either. it does its job and is just bland, nothing special but thats fine i wouldn't say thats the main pull of the game at all. you can pretty easily speed through the story within 8-14 hours depending on how fast you're clearing the fights and skipping all dialogue/cutscenes. 
 
Music is fantastic as to be expected from Nobuo Uematsu and Tsutomu Narita. Not much to say other than enjoy it. 

Now its not all 100% positive. Matchmaking and quick quest is still kind of funky and i will either fail to connect or get disconnected from peoples lobbies/quests from time to time. First off their are still some remaining issues with the PC version and people having issues booting the game. a patch was already released to address this but it didn't completely fix the issue from what it looks like. I have had absolutely no issues on a 6950XT GPU and 5800x3D CPU. 

Now this ties into performance, speaking for myself running the game maxed out(excluding blur thats turned of) at 120fps on 1440p is very easy and is 100% consistent. Their does seem to be a small bug where some cutscenes/areas in the village specifically where high amounts of Depth of Field is present seems to ramp my GPU utilization but doesn't affect my FPS. in combat the game runs smooth without any issue what so ever. 

I do have some complaints about the UI and how information regarding character power and damage is presented but thats a constant in every JRPG you will play, unfortunately a constant with the genre. However i will say that the game failing(to my knowledge) to explain the ""DMG CAP"" Mechanic is frustrating. To anyones who's played the Gacha game theyre very very familiar with how this works, however to those that don't i'd suggest adding some DMG CAP sigils to every character. it is highly annoying that basically every character in endgame(proud difficult maxed out builds) will more than likely require 4 DMG CAP V maxed out sigils and maybe imbued on your weapon, double the frustration when the game doesn't really explain it(i didn't notice it explained anywhere anyway)

Overall Granblue fantasy relink is a game i have waited for nearly 7 years for and its arrival and quality of it is well beyond my hopes and imagination. I have had nothing but a blast playing the game solo, with friends and randoms i join in lobbies and matchmaking and will continue to do so for many many hundreds of more hours.",1706782545,1707061493,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I just finished up the main story, and while it's on the shorter side, I was never bored while playing.
While other games just artificially lengthen the time of their campaigns, this one is just burning one firework after another.
That said, be aware that this game's story is pretty easy and does not pose a big challenge for any seasoned player.

So: If you like your story lengthy and hard, look elsewhere.

The characters are all great and the combat stays fresh since they all have their unique style.
You do not even need to play as the main protagonist, just switch it up to the back and play with the character you like most.
 
After the story is completed, the game opens up into post-game - which you can play alone or with up to 3 other players.
There is full matchmaking support for all quests and the matchmaking has been fixed with the latest patch.

This is then the point where you can grind to your hearts content and start min/maxing your builds and desired characters.
The game switches up to a bite sized mode now where you can specifically grind items needed for your build.

There is still much leveling and unlocking to do (both weapons and characters) and this should take me quite some time.
I will update this review once I feel like I have seen all that the post-game has to offer.

There are already updates announced until May and I really hope the success makes them support this game longer than they initially planned.

This is not a live-service game - so you get the whole story experience from the start.

The combat and character variety are great, i have no complains about that, it was fun as hell.
The main issue with the game is that it's too short. It took me just 12 hours to complete the story and that's with every side quest and mission completed up to that point. Of course the game does have post ending content, but it doesn't compensate for it's shortness. The story itself was also not very good, with characters constantly doing nonesensical things.

I played the Division 1 and 2, did the grind on Destiny, and grind for god rolls on Destiny 2 on the Season of Wish. 3,000+ Hours for both. I can give the beans and how the content is.


[ PROS ] 
- Decent story it's not the best, not the worse. Better than Days Gone, It's quite fast actually. 10+ Hours it took me, might vary if you are a 100%-er.

- Pretty Graphics, it's no Red Dead Redemption 2, but it's more on the side of Dragon Dogma/Breath Of The Wild. It's nice, and easy.

- The Combat, is hands down is my number 1. From Perfect Parrying/Guard to Perfect Dodges, abilities that give you rewards for doing so. Teamwork is HUGE, and it's pretty. Link-Bursts, Bad-ass Super Moves, it makes you feel like your own anime moment. If you chain your supers with your teams? You get huge bad-ass explosions. 'Nuff said  

- Casual or Min-Maxing, The sigil system which to put it easily, it's Monster Hunter's Perks/Charm system. You can crunch your numbers to the point you have to include raising your Damage Cap.

- The Roster, not to shabby to be honest. You like the heavy hitters? Got them, Fast slashing type of folk? Got it, You like trading blow for blow on the enemy? Got that too, and support. Which by the way, you can use the sigils to make almost all of the roster support, dps, tank, healer.

- Music, well. I made it to end game, and I'll tell you. Those bosses have some real DBZ vocal energy. It's goooooood.

- You can play solo and still have the same fun as with a group. The AI are pretty smart.

- Endgame has some bad-ass bosses, and also pretty challenging. Ranks for difficulty: Easy/Normal/Hard/Very Hard/Maniac/Proud and to get to Proud Rank? It makes you work for it but man is it good.

[ CONS ]

- Matchmaking is..50//50. Looking at like 1-4 minute wait times.

- Semi-Live Service game, not much is known about the future after the content drops. (Three to be exact) After that? It's clouded.

- Grind, if you want to survive in Maniac + Proud. If you are planning to go that high be ready. The grind isn't bad, honestly. Way better than Destiny 2.

- Stupid freaking parrot saying sugoi or very good for the 8395287359827th time after transmuting a sigil.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                 I give it a  8.9/10. A fun game, keeps ya busy good to keep you playing for a time to come. Worth it in my opinion and it leads me

And boy does it feel good to finally be able to experience the universe this way. If you are a fan of Granblue Fantasy, you will likely not be disappointed by this game.

But what is the game like? Well, it's heavily Monster Hunter inspired, with its own deviations. It carries over the Ability system with skills that Versus already has, which expands on the rather basic combo systems that your characters have as ""movesets"". It is also a lot faster than Monster Hunter, and is loaded with over exaggerated anime powerlevels and special effects. It can be assaulting on the eyes (and ears) when you're fighting, but I personally don't mind that much. On top of the skills and movesets, you have the Link and the Charge Attack system, which are important parts of the game. Both are power meters which build during combat. Link will pop a power up/time slow window for your whole party for burst, and Charge Attacks are ""ultimate"" skills, which you are supposed to chain with your other party members. CA's especially are an integral part of the original mobile game but aren't quite as extreme in this game. They are still important damage bursts that you should get used to, since they're part of every longer fight.

Story wise it definitely won't blow you away and is pretty much in line for the usual Granblue level writing.

If you're a fan of the franchise, I definitely recommend buying the game. After my 27 hours of playing I had very few stability issues (it crashed like twice while loading into a coop match), though others seem to have more issues. Gameplay wise I encountered no bugs whatsoever, it's actually very polished. 

tl;dr: if you like anime special effects and monster hunter, you should consider buying this game. If you want to play it for coop especially, you should finish the Story chapters first, as it will unlock more characters and game mechanics vital for the coop stage. That will take around 12-14 hours. After that it basically feels like monster hunter.",1707044855,1707044855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is on the slower side but that does not detract from its enjoyment. All characters have unique movesets and distinct playstyles. And pulling off full bursts is very satisfying. 

The crowning jewel however are the bosses. They all have unique mechanics and are incredibly fun to take out. They take the best parts of FFXIV trials and raids, and reshape them around a more streamlined RPG experience. 

My only complaint really is that character stories are all just storybook text windows. The progression also feels a bit uninspired, its just a lot of grinding for flat stat upgrades for your gear, and a skill tree that feels less like a way of customising your character and more like a roadblock for progressions sake.

There are a few BUTS though.

These BUTS include:
- You need to get through stability issues. Blackscreen on launch (turning off font autoscaling in Steam helped me, but it might not be same recipe for everyone), frame drops, CTDs (didn't occur for me but a lot of people complain).
- You need to get through arguably weak main story which will take ~12 hours. Only then a wonderful world of questing grind is open to you, which is a main dish of the game (normal and hard difficulties avaliable during main story are just a little taste).
- There is no way to try out the characters before you unlock them so if you get someone purely by the eye, and then realize you don't vibe with their mechanics or moves, you will need to grind for another character unlock, and this may take you a while.
- DLC prices are ridiculous for what they offer.
- It's worse if you don't intend to play this with a controller.
- For gacha non-players game does not provide enough context for who are all these people, and why are there shrimp weapons etc.
- For gacha players there are no rewards for gacha, unlike the PS version.
- Translation/localization is dubious. It's still readable, and won't break your brain as if you are reading an AI generated text, but you might suffer from cringe here and there.",1707043481,1707043481,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

The game already has established characters from the 10 years that Granblue has been out and the game builds onto that with another adventure! I think new people getting into GBF who are interested in the plot and characters won't feel too lost, and there are small stories (Fate Episodes) you can unlock that will give brief explanations of all the characters backstories and new stories for this game.

The level of combat mechanics each character has is what I always wanted out of something like Genshin. Not as in depth as a DMC/Bayo but still different enough where they are fun to try out and switch up the combat. The only mechanic this game is missing for me is character switching during combat. Other than had a great time going through the main story (about 16 hours not speeding through it) and spent another 10 hours or so in the post game. 

Story bosses were great and the little bit I have seen in the post game they keep up pretty well with new mechanics/patterns. As everyone has said the monster hunter comparisons are pretty good at discribing the post game content just taking missions form a hud zone. Get new materials to upgrade/craft weapons and level up characters. 

It's scratching the little bit of Gacha itch that I have and you dont have to spend an extra dime. Grinding feels good and I can see a decent change after upgrades. A lot to unlock/level up with all the characters so will have a bunch to do until I get tired. Also unless the really late game gets extremely hard, the AI seem to be fantastic and actually helpful. It has online matchmaking but been going through solo without any issues.

You know how most RPGs might open with a cool cinematic moment, but within an hour you're killing 7 boars, or collecting someone's lost mail?  Yeah, not here.  This game feels like getting shot out of a cannon.

The campaign may be ""short"", maybe around 10 hours, but it is so dense with stunning spectacles it's worth the price of admission on its own.  It's a breakneck series of over-the-top bosses and cinematic set pieces.  Combat, while chaotic, feels highly satisfying once you get used to the game's systems.  The art and music are glorious.  Just don't expect a great narrative - the plot is about as vanilla as gran himself.  Fight the bad guys, save the world.  You've seen this before, though perhaps without a small dragon companion who calls people ""dude"" and ""buttface"".

After the campaign, there is the promise of many MANY hours of questing and grinding in the pursuit of ludicrous levels of power in a loop clearly inspired by the Monster Hunter series.  I've logged a LOT of monster hunter hours, so I'll be delving into this title's end game as well, and while so far I've only had a glimpse, it appears to be rather vast.

Update: Region lock *was* removed from the game, so bare that in mind as you scan through reviews.
I only had a couple instances of the game soft-locking on load screens, but outside of that it was butter with no issues.

TL;DR 9/10, -1 because character kits are a little too simple for me. Nothing to really bite into.
Most of the skill in this game won't really be behind mastering your character, it'll more be knowing the match ups and how good you are at dodging/blocking/timing your attacks.
The game is honestly pretty easy, even in the harder difficulty. It's gunna take after the post-story of the game for things to actually start getting challenging. But, there is adequate challenge down on the far end so it won't lose points there.

Honestly, super fun game. Story was fun and engaging, characters all have unique dialogue, cool boss fights, really epic battles and scenes. You can tell some of the voice actors were having more fun in their role than others though.
Endgame loop is pretty good, and I like this game's approach to build optimization.
Characters are all unique both in personality and gameplay wise, and the game is really pretty once you stop focusing so hard on the lower fidelity environmental props (like trees.)
This game doesn't take a high-fidelity approach to its graphics, but it's more so in the stylization of them.",1707031293,1707031532,True,1,0,0.515113353729248047,0,True,False,False

Rating

9. The only thing this game truly falls short of is its customization, main storytelling, and shallow character backgrounds. Few times would people say that a live service game is something they would want in a game and this rare occurrence is true for Granblue. Hopefully we continue to see this title being supported because it has so much going well for it that I want to continue to see the future of this world and characters. 

Pros:

Stunning Art Design: The game features beautiful anime-style graphics with meticulously detailed environments and character designs that immerse players in the world of Granblue Fantasy.
Smooth Performance: The game runs smoothly with minimal technical issues, offering silky smooth gameplay and minimal load times, especially on high-end systems.
Fluid Combat Mechanics: Combat in Granblue Fantasy Relink is fluid and responsive, allowing players to execute intricate combos and unleash powerful abilities with ease.
Diverse Character Abilities: Each character possesses unique skills and playstyles, encouraging experimentation and strategic decision-making in battle, enhancing the depth of gameplay.
Extensive Skill Trees: The game offers extensive skill trees for each character, providing depth and longevity to gameplay as players strive to maximize character abilities and customization options.
Engaging Side Content: In addition to the main story, the game offers a variety of side quests and monster hunts, reminiscent of games like Monster Hunter, providing additional content and replay value.

Cons:

Lackluster Main Story: While the game excels in character development and background stories, the main story falls short, feeling predictable and lacking depth, leaving players wanting more.
Shallow Character Backgrounds: Some characters lack sufficient background information, leaving players with a desire for more depth and backstory to enhance attachment to certain characters.
Limited Customization: The game lacks extensive customization options, particularly in comparison to modern RPGs, leaving players craving more opportunities to personalize their experience.",1707028127,1707028127,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As someone who is very burnt out on RPGs with 50+ hour long campaigns, this game is exactly what I'm looking for. The main story is short and simple. It has very little filler and you are constantly moving from one  cinematic moment to another. 

The action combat is very fun, addictive and smooth. There are a wide selection of characters to choose from and they all have different kits that completely change the way you engage with the encounters. The gameplay feels like a blend between Tales of Arise, Monster Hunter and Final Fantasy XIV.

Have you ever felt that empty feeling after finishing a 100+ hour JRPG? ReLink did that for me within a short 16 hours. It is a game that respects your time and gives you that complete anime experience of starting off killing goblins to killing gods with the power of friendship to save the world. Coming from someone who has stuck with the series since middle school and now graduating university, seeing the world I've devoted so much time to be properly showcased really meant a lot. Previously those world ending adventures felt so insignificant with 2D sprites and turn based combat, for Cygames to be able to recreate that world as an action RPG with thoughtful gameplay made me care for those stories in a game I spammed skip through. It is a cheesy, charming, adventure that has a lot of depth to it thanks to it's origins as a grindy mobile JRPG with a substantial post game.

Side Note: IF ANYTHING PLAY THIS GAME FOR THE MUSIC, PLEASE ITS SO GOOD

I've waited this game for so long and I've enjoyed it so far and I'm currently in chapter 4 trying to beat that certain giant spear user on Grandcypher (edit: beated him and now I'm past a certain unlimited blade works user). But believe me, you should fire your QA (if they existed in the first place anyway). No demos, no playtest, no nothing, and yet here's your conclusion: bad launch. I rarely post reviews like this but, I couldn't take it anymore.

You guys JP devs should learn from Palworld, should learn from Falcom, why their game could run smoothly but this one don't (engine problem? idk idc if you're asking from consumer's pov). That's why in modern day gaming you should obtain as much as possible about user's data through demo and playtest, especially us PC users, our custom rigs. Consoles? Okay fine, probably they also need to check whether they meet the player's expectation or something, but demo's and playtests aren't solely purposed on that for PC.

Is it highly costed? Idk. But after a loooooonnnggg development time, you guys should've expected these kinds of things (errors and whatsoever).

Now me and my friends have to wait longer before we can play together. Minimum sysreq? We've passed that, seriously (we don't even bother buying games that aren't meet our sysreq).
Edit: except for AVX2, if this is required, then just say so (just like pso ngs did) with AVX1 and THIS is why you need to playtest with people. I mean, real people).

Is it hard to optimize PC port? Maybe. But you've got a team, you've got us to pay you for that, you can see how much statistic you'll be hoarding from the hypes. I don't think you need advice for this, right?

Anyhow, everything in game is so far quite good, for now. Except a few things that people already mentioned in the discussion threads. 
Transliteration is meh from my opinion, you can do better. I don't know any western culture in certain conversations but, there are some dialogues that are not needed to be ""extra literated"". I can't remember which ones since there are too many of them.
Edit: For example this Gran's line: ""Chikara o kaishite kudasai!"" it's more like, ""Please lend me your power (help)! not ""You've got to help us!"" and I think it's far different in terms of politeness.
I don't know about censorship, but... perhaps certain men of culture already representing my opinion.

Overall, the mechanics, the grind, battle system, is fine, I like it. You can also do better with this. Perhaps a 8 players raid in the future update? Or something better.

So, cheers! If within this few days you don't have any fix for those issues, I guess there will be a refund.

Very nice graphics and art design.

Playing it with japanese voices like every JRPG, some say translation isnt accurate....well i dont know, cant understand japanese. Subtitles are okay, nothing awkward so far. 

Gameplay is very action oriented which is fine for me. Mixture of Code Vein, Scarlet Nexus and Tales of Arise. All of them i liked very much.

At the time of writing this I’ve just finished the story and gotten a few multiplayer quests in after (I wanted to wait until after completing the story to bother doing any).

Honestly after playing what I have, which is so far a bit less than 17 hours, I can say that this is definitely a good game! If you’re a player who likes Action RPGs, Anime, Monster Hunter, MMO style raids, want a co-op game to play, or you’re just some sort of fiend for grinding I can pretty confidently say you’ll have a good time. 

In terms of combat in this game, it’s pretty simple admittedly, but it suits itself well for the game. Your basic combat comes from two buttons, X & Y (Square and Circle for those on Dualshocks). With those two you’re able to use your basic combos, which vary by character. Alongside that you have your dodge, block, and “link” (also used for other actions) buttons. But aside from those you also have your 4 skills. (6 or 8 available to each character it seems I forgot while I was writing this) Each character within the game has different sorts of combos and skills which makes them all rather unique. If you want to play as a brute of sorts, a ranger, or a spellcaster, these are all available to you, and on top of that, you can tune them even more to fit how you want to play due to the customization! There’s also good team mechanics within the game as well. The main two in question being team ultimates and team link. Team ultimates are exactly as they are, somewhat. So each character has their own respective ultimate, but when used in rapid succession of each other on the same enemy, you get a burst effect at the end that is another extra large chunk of damage off of the enemy. This burst will also be the element of the first person who used their ultimate for those who may play soon that are reading this. Team link is the other mechanic, so when you stun an enemy, you’re prompted to press a button to jump to that stunned enemy and do an attack. Doing this builds the link percentage. When it reaches 100% if everyone uses a link on a stunned enemy at once (has to be in rapid succession upon stunning again) it slows time, increases your damage and gives other buffs depending on how you’ve built your character.

Now in terms of the character customization mentioned, this is what really determines how you play. This is affected by your character (of course), level, weapons, sigils, and mastery tree. And as for how these all come into play:
Character- First is the character, your main skills you’ll have available to you will be here. There’s quite a few characters in the game and they all play pretty differently. You have some charcaters that unleash flurries of attacks, some heavy hitters, tank like characters, magical users, and the likes. As I mentioned controls are simple but how they’re applied are different, some of the characters whom are heavy hitters you can perfectly time their attacks for more damage, some moves you hold for more damage and other stuff like that. I would say to look at each character’s move list before you unlock them to see if their normal kit is something you would like. Each character starts at a set level (rises as you go through the main story) and then you raise it through missions and the like as you would normally. As you level up you also gain mastery points which you use toward your mastery tree to buff your character and get the remaining abilities and things like that.

Weapons- This takes a bit less to explain. Your weapons are standard per character, it will always be the same type. You have to level these weapons for more damage and other stats, however a bonus thing that changes per weapon is the traits. Some already have passives on them, but you can also imbue weapons with new passives to help with different things like damage, critical rate, critical damage, and things of the like. I haven’t seen a lot of these so far so im not sure what’s all available there but those are some I’ve seen so far.

Sigils- Sigils are an item that you can equip to your character that gives some sort of passive effect. This will very much so help with how you want to play. These sigils come in many varieties and seem to come in some basic categories. These are Basic Statss, Attack, Defense, Support, and Special (which are more varied, but can also fall under other categories). I personally play supportive for example, so I have some sigils on to keep my health high, and increase my healing output so when I’m not helping with damage im keeping everyone up. Stuff like that.

Missions in game I could most compare to an average action rpg, meeting monster hunter. You’re not going out trying to hunt that singular monster in an open map of course, but primarily you’ll have quests where you clear out groups of enemies, collect something, secure something or something of the sort, pretty standard. The other missions are the big boss fights In which you see in the trailers, they’re raid bosses by nature. There’s only but so many at the start. However, as you complete missions you gain access to more missions to play as well. I would say my fear here is in the endgame in which I just got to. Something that may deter people is how much you have to grind to get the newer and different missions. I haven’t gotten really any unlocked yet, however like I mentioned, I haven’t played too much yet since reaching endgame. I’ve heard of it being a lot to unlock missions but cannot confirm just yet. But if it’s like monster hunter in terms of the grinding I don’t think I’ll mind it too much.

As for the story of this game. I can’t say as much for how good a story is because I don’t often play the story/campaign for most games, but to get to endgame here you have to go through the story regardless. So most of my time so far has been just story content. And to my surprise, this game’s story kept me pretty interested. I was able to sit and watch/read everything regarding to the story in this game. I would say at least in my opinion it was interesting, I grew to like many of the characters, and there were many moments where I could catch myself just smiling at whatever was happening. There’s definitely a bit at least for tropes and stuff you’d expect, but despite that I was enjoying it. Plus there’s a bit more for story with the fate episodes as well (which even if you don’t care about the story you want to check these out for stats). With me at first just going through the story missions (I did maybe 2 side missions, but took all hub quests I could. However I prioritized no hub quests, just passively completed them) the story took probably 14 hours of my current play time while playing on the hard difficulty. 

In terms of negatives. I had a couple. My biggest was at one particular mission, after completing it, during the cutscene the game would crash. I went through the mission a couple more times to make sure it was the cutscene causing it, and it was. After skipping that cutscene, I didn’t experience any other crashes. My second was how the game runs, I could definitely just have stuff to work on with my pc to upgrade or it could just be the game at this moment, I’m currently playing on standard graphics, and can’t keep a consistent 120fps which is the higher frame cap. I’m currently running an i7-12700f, 32 gb of ram, and a rtx 3060. (if anyone knows something that might help lmk). But otherwise the game runs fine at 60, and I don’t feel as if that takes away from anything in this game in particular. Those are my only two negatives though in my experience.

But in conclusion, I so far have been able to thoroughly enjoy the game, and I’m glad it finally came out after all this time. I think- or more so I know a lot of people will enjoy this game, and rightfully so. I know I’ll at least get my money’s worth of enjoyment out of it, it is def worth trying",1707008157,1707024026,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They did appear to fix the 2 major game breaking issues i had with the game that prevented any type of significant progression for me: getting into the game consistently and game locking up on main story cut scenes.

I did like the game, when I was able to play it and continue to like it but could not in good conscious recommend a game that was not working as intended to anyone, let alone for its hefty asking price tag.

After a Revisit.

Graphics and Gameplay are superb.
Music and Sounds is great.
Lots of tech trees and weapon to upgrade.
It does have that Monster Hunter take for questing and that's where the co-op comes into play in which you play that instance with either AI Bots or Live people depending on your preferred style.
Localization is eyebrow rising in a few points which leads me to believe liberties were taken with it.  Very Odd word choices for a few characters.  

To Sum,
They had a bad Steam PC Launch, Period. (They should have released the Demo on Steam like they did on the Playstation but choose not to).  The Game Breaking Issues appear to have been addressed now.  You don't have to watch the anime to get an idea of what's going on here but it is a fun world and good entry that i expect to 

I'm still grumpy about the poor PC launch.  I'm grateful to the Steam Community with all the tips and tricks in the discussion area during that time to try to get me into the game.  Now I'm cautiously optimistic that the game wont crash as I continue to work thru the story and game.

Good:
- The game doesn't just have cool concept art but looks like cool concept art in game
- Combat is what action based FF games wish they were
- Large playable character roster with tons of cool abilities and flexible loops

Neutral:
- Enemy variety is good compared to other new entries like Nioh but doesn't compare well to games that borrow from long running series like monster hunter rise or elden ring
- Story is held back by being a spinoff of a massive game. Similar to the princess connect redive anime adaptation.

Bad:
- Translation is passable at times (seemed to get better as the game went along but maybe I wasn't paying close attention) but is often awful or just completely random. Every time they translated miko to shaman I imagined what it would be like if they called you a shamanless one in elden ring.

If you're looking for some Pros & Cons well here they are

Pros:
Beautiful Art Style/Graphical Fidelity, perhaps the best of its kind.

Engaging Combat with tons of mix matching and experimentation. The game allows for a deeper exploration of build than initially available at the beginning.

Good Level Design (IMO you may or may not like it depending on what you enjoy) 

Superb Boss Fights. They will not be on the same level as say Fromsoft boss fights, but they have that MMORPG raid mechanic feel to them, and is quite engaging and fun.

Action is fluid, and the Party system works just right.

More than enough characters to try out and play with. There's quite a few good selections and I'd say most of them are unique from each other.

Cons: 
Because of the nature of the game, it will be heavy on exposition, cutscenes and dialogues. Perhaps this is a positive for your, or it may not

Story is 4 or 5/10. It's meh, It is your standard fantasy ride with Good Guys vs Bad Guys dynamic, with a few small ""plot twists.""

Party Members talk way too much during combat. It may be for the callouts, but it can get very annoying.

Not enough Boss Varieties. I have talked about how good some of the boss fights are in this game, but there aren't many of them. They repeat in pattern with slightly different variations in attack sets/elemental powers. In addition, game has way too many ""gimmicky"" bosses IMO. Cut it to one or two please Cygames.

Overall I'd rate the game 8/10 and only after 22 hours. I just barely started the End Game of the game, with only one character on Lvl 100 and some at 90+ so this rating may change in the future. They are planning on releasing more characters in the future too so that's something to look forward to. If you like MH-like games, or perhaps a good Action RPG I'd recommend folks to try this game out, its great fun and I'm just starting out.",1707019732,1707019732,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visually, it's a knockout. Character designs are sleek, environments are beautiful, especially with the LODs being water paintings, and the animations are a visual treat. It's like they took the essence of a top-tier anime and embedded it into the DNA of the game.

Storywise, it's a pleasant surprise. Relink brings a bit of depth, unexpected twists, and character arcs that keep you engaged. A casual player will probably enjoy it, but the game is made for what comes after, so if you're not looking to repeat and build your party further past the story, I'm not sure I can recommend this game, unless you're content with about 10-20 hours of story.

Now, let's talk party characters – for me, it's all about Siegfried. His moveset is extremely rewarding and enjoyable when you master it, there's something satisfying about nailing that perfect timing combo chain. Siegfried's combat style caters to the types of players who enjoy characters with a high skill ceiling.

Combat, in general, is the real star here. Controls are responsive, and the battles strike that sweet spot between tactical finesse and the sheer joy of unleashing devastating combos. Whether you're a casual player looking for a good time or a hardcore sweat seeking a challenge, the gameplay caters to both ends of the spectrum. And the co-op play? It's a game-changer, especially when you're tackling epic bosses with your crew.

Major shoutout to Nobuo Uematsu and Tsutomu Narita for the soundtrack – it's the hidden gem that elevates the entire gaming experience. It really adds to the epic feel during boss fights and cutscenes.

In a nutshell, whether you're a casual player looking for a laid-back adventure or a hardcore sweat seeking a challenging quest, Granblue Fantasy: Relink has got you covered. It strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and intensity, and for Siegfried enthusiasts like myself, it's the ultimate playground for perfect timing combo chains.

The recent patch fixes most of the issues brought by the earlier reviews though whether it works for you or not may vary. But most notably some of the issues have been fixed: There is no longer a region lock, most crashing incidents are addressed, matchmaking time has been significantly reduced with little to no connection errors.


While the talk of the town is the port, The game itself? Phenomenal. If you think the port is garbage or does not work for you, then if you have a ps4 or ps5, get it there. It's a cool trial/raid-y focused game that i personally love as a result of enjoying games like Dragalia Lost, FFXIV or even Monster Hunter. If you like those instance based kinds of games (and controls really great too), then i recommend this game no matter the platform.

I only have 2 personal gripes (nitpicks honestly) i have with the game:

 1. How very forgiving the critical gauge is with the gauge slow enough to accommodate 3 or more party members reviving on their own consecutively without any help (face buttons or teammates reviving) even at the later difficulties resulting to an easier difficulty than what it deserves to be. Though i understand the decision prioritizing a better experience for very casual players to experience everything the game has to offer. It would've been better if they adopted a chance system like in Dragalia Lost where it's an individual life count vs a gauge where the revives still encourage you to be careful even if you mess up once or twice and still does not trivialize the difficulty of the fights. Fingers crossed Lucilius' fight has a considerably faster critical gauge depletion.

2. Guard and Perfect Dodge working on all types of outgoing damage also makes most encounters easier than it looks. Overdrive phase's mechanics become trivialized when these two defensive options can easily mitigate the damage. Guard especially prevents preemptive and reactive synergy that makes these types of games challenging to learn because you can simply hold guard. An early example of this is when the player can simply hold guard to not get damaged during furycane's OD phase rather than standing where you cant get hit by the tornadoes. It could probably be better if certain outgoing damage can be guarded/dodgeable while most attacks in Overdrive (especially during phases where its all about the ""mechanics"") bypass guard and become non-iframable by perfect dodge.

Otherwise, this game is everything that I wanted Relink to be, even became what I never knew I wanted all along.",1706865579,1707018425,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Playing the game, Graphics are crisp and effects are stylish. My experience so fat (up to the first boss) has been quite enjoyable, though I fear from the initial impression that monsters may be a bit of a damage sponge moving forward.

Gameplay is reminiscent of GodEater and Metal Gear Solid: Revengence ( the MemEs jAck!), fights consists of exchanges between blocks and dodges while getting in their safe zones and attacking them where the sun doesn't shine. GBF players would be familiar with many of the Mobs/ Bosses, their fights reimagined in a 3D space where they can finally not blame their weapon grid for when they fail a boss. Oh yeah, it also incorporates GBF's Burst system as well, and it is satisfying to see each time it is executed ( exhaustion pending).

All in all, GBF: Relink is a great fix for those waiting for MH:Worlds, those itching to see how Gran's battles feel like as he adventures across the realms.

Sure, it had its downsides on release day with the start up issues, but those were rather minor since the game itself ran without issues.
Had only 1 crash in a cutscene and had to re-do a boss fight. But aside that, I played over 23 hours and it just worked fast and performed well.
The story is short and very anime you could say. Some may like it, some may not.

But where the game really shines in my eyes, is how well the multiplayer is made. It works fast, easy and is reliable. 
You can even set the game so that you cannot be spoiled by others in your lobby.

Heck you can even play quests you have not unlocked in your own world as the Host but still play them if your friends have them. The game straight up tells you that you will not get the ranking for it. But you can still do the mission, get EXP and materials.

Sure, it sucks that you cannot play the main story with your friends and I wish the Devs would make that possible since 95% of the time, you have the party of your choice anyways alongside you. I don't see a reason why this cannot be done. Maybe in the future since in Postgame, you can replay the story as you like and collect what you missed out on.

I really hope the Devs don't screw it up with overpriced DLC characters down the road or locking quests behind a paywall (if they do, ideally so that only 1 person in the party has to own the quest for all to play it, like some games do it).",1707012392,1707012392,True,0,0,0.483870983123779297,0,True,False,False

Mission structure is objective to defend, kil bossl, time defense, time attack etc. Its very akin to Monster Hunter with a hub where you get quests and select missions / set online lobby / etc. You will be very at home with its online tools and mission structure if you have experience with monster hunter. 

Combat is active and real-time, char building is mhm you have 12 or 13 Sigil slots, where Damage CAP lvl 65 basically mandatory on every character which will take you 5 slots of your 12 or 13 slots to customize a character, its a bad way of stopping power but it is what it is, nothing is perfect. The game is a hellish amount of fun to play, combat is more or less identical to Tales of Arise with chain links and ultimates across the party, biggest difference is you can NOT swap character on the fly in a mission, only outside of missions.

Back on topic of builds, some are charged attacks, some are skill spammers and some are combo damage dealers which gives a fair bit of variety and spicing in up makes it also easier to split your Sigils across your team.

Yes the translation is sometime questionable here and there, but the voice acting, the art, and the world is amazing.

Gameplay wise totally what i would expect from a good A-RPG, i didn't have any issue with the camera while playing, the combat is very dynamic, the skill tree is pretty big, you have enough skill to unlock in each character to play it like you want.
Every characters feel's good and different too play, at least the ones i've unlocked. they all have their speciality or own gimmick.

And no you can't change character during combat you have to stick with the character placed in the first slot of your party (hope they add the option but i can live without) but the AI for your team is well done, nonetheless i'll still recommend you to watch closely your team comp for a more comfortable playtrough.


The coop is cool : you can create a lobby to play with your friends or join randoms in the matchmaking system to do quest like boss raid, extermination quest and etc...
You have also the ability to set the quest on repeat if you want to farm a specific mission, you still have to play but it will put you directly in a loop without need to return to the lobby with the people in your party who have chose to put the quest on repeat.


The music fantastic/ lovely, if you're already familliar with the Granblue fantasy franchise you willl of course recognize all your beloved OST, if you're not familliar yet, enjoy the discovery.

I play Borderless and haven't experience any crash yet. I play with a RX 6900XT and a i7 11700k, and it run very well.

The game still need some little tweaking here and there like for example i would appreciate more customization in the party behaviour and the pssibility to change caracter during fight, but considering it is a first for the Granblue franchise, they have a great start and will have even more room for improvement in this game and their future games. 

Hope you have a great time with the game like me.

No black screens or cutscene crashes *So Far*. According to the update post, they're still investigating the causes however. That means purchasing this game right now may still be a gamble, so be wary. If you do buy it, don't forget you can refund if the problems pop up on your end. That said, I'll review the game based off its merits now instead.

Anyways: Game is fun. Very fun. Like what everyone else has stated, it's an intricate mix of Tales Of combat (Tales of Arise, Berseria, etc) and Monster Hunter, though more emphasis on the Tales Of. The main story is about 20 hours, however the true meat of the game seems to be afterward (just like with Monster Hunter). Progression feels similar to mobile games (in a good way) in that you're upgrading equipment levels, unlocking them with materials, and upgrading further. Character progression is more about allocating points you get from leveling up and doing missions into a mastery tree that gives you stat boosts, skills, and so on. 

While I haven't gotten very far due to issues you can read further below, I can say what I have played is very enjoyable, and the general gameplay loop is so far quite satisfying. If you're into Tales Of or Monster Hunter, this is gonna be right up your alley. This one was well worth the wait. Just wish PC didn't get shafted but it is what it is.

Story: Anime/10 - This game is basically a spin off of the Granblue Fantasy mobile game thus there is *alot* to unpack if you're at all curious about it. But at Relink's core is a very much ""High Adventure"" kind of story, where you're traveling to a new ""Skydom"" (think kingdom but in the sky) with a band of well established heroes and you get into all sorts of melodramatic trouble. If you're into anime, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're not, then you can skip cutscenes if you want. You're given a summary of events in the cutscene in text if you do.

One thing to note - there are ""Fate Episodes"" you can view that give you a glimpse into each character's backstory. Doing these episodes also unlocks stat boosts. 

Gameplay: 9/10 - Controls are relatively simple and intuitive. Combat is fast and frenetic. Enemies aren't just punching bags either - they'll happily surround and attack you if you're not careful. While I wouldn't call the game difficult, I would say there is some challenge - especially when you're trying to go for certain mission bonuses. Those of you that don't like ""Time Attack"" type missions aren't gonna be happy, because nearly every side quest I've played so far has them. 

So far every single character I've played has been fun and have different combat styles. You start out the game with 6 (1 being your named character) and can have 4 on your team at any given time. The one negative mark I must give is that you can't switch characters on the fly during battle. ""Oh that enemy's a flyer, lemme switch to my ranged character"" is not something you can do here sadly. 

Your team however can sync their ""ultimate attacks"" together, which makes for a pretty awesome moment that does an immense amount of damage if you pull it off. You can set your team to either save (or Hold) their ults for when you do yours, or you can let them do theirs whenever. Either option is useful.

Graphics: 8/10 - Very good looking game, but I've noticed some some textures that seem a bit on the low side. Not enough to be bothersome.

Music - 9/10 - alot of orchestral music here and there, and you'll hear the game's main theme's leitmotif alot.  The music swells when it should and quiets down when it should. Very well done.


Negative Bullet Points:
* No Playstation button prompt options (Why.)
* Cannot switch playable character in battle. Can only do so out of battle and you must go into the menu to do so.
* Graphical options are kinda lacking. Got the basics, but it would've been nice to have more options like most PC games do nowadays. No DLSS or FXR options either.
* Benched characters level up slower than played ones - This game has TONS of characters you can obtain, so if you want to try a new one that you already have in your roster, be prepared to boost them up first. Characters you have NOT obtained yet though, seem to get your main character's level.

On the topic of Localization - I absolutely despise localization that changes personalities or censors things. There is some censorship in this game - though thankfully minimal. Some girls wear hotpants instead of panties. One rather busty lady had a few extra inches of cloth given to her top. Really wish this crap didn't happen. Even if the game is a 10/10, I automatically shave off points if it has censorship.

Did some digging about the dialogue. According to those who actually know Japanese, most of the localization is either adding Western cringe or being overly enthusiastic. Frankly the dialogue hasn't been any different from what I've seen in most JRPGs other than a few more recent popular Western phrases. I'm not at all a fan, but it's not enough to drag the whole game down for me.


Note that I have not played online yet, and I can't say anything about endgame because I'm not there yet either. But so far - other than the botched launch - I've been enjoying this game. That said, I haven't forgotten about the launch issues. I bought this game day one because I was hyped up for it for years. But sometimes we need to relearn the reason why we should wait for reviews. The lesson has been taught once again and I won't make the same mistake with any of Cygames' games again. I'll keep my earlier ""review"" down below that talks about the launch problems along with a rant about the way Cygames is treating the PC playerbase.

Overall score so far: 8/10. Would be a 9 if there was no censorship.

---

Alright. I give up.

Gonna preface this with: My rig is perfectly fine. Windows 10, 3070ti, Intel i7, 16gb RAM. Not the tiptop of the line but certainly no slouch. Can play anything I throw at it. When the game WORKS, I can play it on ultra 120 fps no problem.

Black screen crashes at start up. If you're able to even get into the game, you're not out of the woods yet because it seems every cutscene has a low chance of also crashing. The final straw was a crash during a cutscene right after defeating a tough boss. Like it legit deflated me. Was riding on a high cuz the fight was really fun and I was trying out a new character and the cutscene itself was full of tension and bam - crash. 

Fact is this: PC got the extreme short end of the stick. Sony must've thrown a huge bag of money at them because Playstation had a demo, released early, more DLC content, better special editions, everything. PC's version finally releases and we're once more kicked in the nuts and/or tacos with a bad port job, minimal graphical options, only xbox button prompts (WHY. The game is also on PLAYSTATION. Why not add a toggle for PLAYSTATION buttons???), tons of launch issues, black screens, crashes, I just can not even.

Been waiting for this game since it was announced years ago. The game ITSELF, when it WORKS, is great. But everything I mentioned above makes me both regret my purchase and gives little incentive for me to purchase any other game made by Cygames. Sad thing is with all my troubleshooting and stints of the game actually working - I'm far too past the 2 hour mark to refund it. 

I'm sure (hope) it will be fixed eventually. It seems they've noticed the issues and have promised a fix at some point. But for now - stay clear. You might be one of the lucky ones with no problems. You might not. I don't suggest taking the gamble right now, but it's up to you.

As a wise man once said - my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I'll change my review when (if) they fix the problems.",1706900639,1707010553,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'm gonna start with the cons:
-This should have had a demo for PC players. I feel like if we would have had a Demo, we could have ironed out the issues that plagued many of us for the past two days. You only garner ill will if you don't have a demo that properly portrays your game (if it's good, which I can wholeheartedly say this game is) or you decide to not put one out for one platform or another 

-The camera needs a touch more polish. Sometimes you have to wrestle the camera away from the game's aggressive camera system. I play Gahndagoza (?) and he is a big boi. The system doesn't feel like it likes him very much as it seems to put the camera into the ground. 

-Targeting goes along with that. Sometimes the game targets enemies way in the back instead of the one right in front of or next to you. Changing targets also needs work.

-They really should have just done a MH lobby system along with Co-OP story. An auto-lobby that puts 8-16 people in a lobby to progress together through the story with. Most people don't seen to want to match together until after story, when you get the option to be put in a random mission, but that is only for missions you already completed!

-This is not something you will want to pay full price for the story for. I got to credits, did a few sidequests, on Hard, in about thirteen hours. I knew this going in, as most likened it to MH where you play the real game after credits, so it doesn't bother me, but I still feel like it was too short since there's stories for all the characters that are mostly slideshows with voice acting.

-Localization. Yes, I know it's a hot topic at the moment, but this one isn't very good. From Marvel-esque ""Well, that just happened!"" to it being like an old Asian film where the subtitles have a single word, but the character is clearly saying a full sentence. It's just not good and I hope they do better in the future, which I hope we more of this type in the series!

Alright, now onto the pro's:
-This game is truly gorgeous. Like, I don't typically care for the style of games most of the time, but this is all beauty and spectacle! Everything is just so colorful and well done that it pops out at you and you can't help but take it all in for a bit.

-Sounds and Voice acting (Sub-wise, anyways) is no joke, either. Bringing greats from anime into here really helped my own enjoyment (many One Piece voice actors and Vyrn's VA is Happy from Fairy Tale). The sounds are distinct, too, which many games have issues with. I always know when a skill is off cooldown, I got healed, or an attack is headed my way out of sight.

-The gameplay, though, as it should be, is the real star of the show. Fights are so fun that you can't wait for the next. Bosses that each have their own dazzling mechanics to try and teach you before they challenge you after you complete the credits, environmental mechanics to use for or against you, and just phenomenal character move sets to tie it all together.

-Speaking of the characters, they have done an absolute banger job here. No character feels the same. Each of them feel like a different weapon in MH in that they have their own gimmicks, play styles, and such. The characters can be using the same weapon types and still feel completely unique. 

-The progression mechanics feel great, too. Each character has different skill trees for passive and active abilities (in an offense tree and defensive tree), different weapons to craft and level off passives that work even when not wielding that weapon, and a pseudo-decoration system with the Sigils that can also be upgraded that will cement how you want to play that character. It's the kind of grind I like, personally.

In short, even though I have a few nitpicks and negative opinions, I love the game. I really hope they continue supporting this game and make more of this in the future!",1707010015,1707010015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Has a good amount of content as well. Story mode is decently lengthy and has some incredible set pieces/events but then you also have the coop quests (which can be played solo if you want). You can also replay everything on harder difficulties which changes up a few things. 

There's also a bunch of variation in the characters and how you customize their skills and sigils. It's nothing super complicated or extensive but it's definitely enough to be engaging and fun. For instance you can lean more into buffs, focus on dealing damage, bringing additional healing or debuffing the enemy. There's plenty of these types of decisions in this game for every character.

My brother and I grabbed this after the early positive reviews from the PS5 people just hoping for some fun co-op. We did not expect to find one of the most fun RPGs in quite some time. To us this combines the best elements of games like Tales of Arise, Monster Hunter, and Phantasy Star Online. The combat is fun, the characters play very uniquely and the boss fights are very fun. This game also has a solid single player campaign that has been quite entertaining. Most of the negative reviews are from launch day issues.

- I really enjoy the back stories of the characters, they're more interesting than some other run-of-the-mill generic stories. I appreciate games that have story rooted in realistic experiences.

- I appreciate that there are tiers to the gameplay that you can choose from depending on the challenge you're seeking; story mode, normal mode (story with regular combat), then hard mode, which I haven't played myself, but I have friends who appreciate a challenge and are enjoying it so far. 

- I noticed some similarities to Monster Hunter in terms of the primal-god/beasts' patterns and behavior, like AOE attacks, rotating laser attacks, spotted attacks that you have to dodge with precision to avoid death. There are also goals to complete a quest within a time limit without ending up in critical condition or other. 

- If you enjoy being rewarded for exploration, this game definitely takes care of that. 

- The combat combos are a lot of fun, I find joy in playing as Zeta or Lancelot for their rapid abilities. 

- The English voice acting is childish to say the least, which is why I tend to prefer Japanese with Sub, but you can't really appreciate the story being told during combat if you can't understand the language, so that ruins that aspect of it for me. *shrug*

Bug: I play using PS5 controller and have found that not only myself, but other players have issues with the input lag/disconnecting while in menus whenever using a controller. I've read that it's been disregarded as an issue pertaining to the game itself but rather a controller issue, which I find to be unrealistic if it's happening to a large span of folks without any change/interaction on the end user's part. The company needs to acknowledge this issue since it's causing quite an annoying and undesirable experience for players including myself.

Ps.....Im kidding (No im not)
Anyway this is a Honest review from me who has play main GBF and GBVSR and im gonna point out something before you buy this game

THA BAD ONE
- The combat is too easy , i think because you can revive yourself when you die.
- The combo for all character is so limit you probably have only 2-3 options for each character.
- The story is sooooooo boring , you can probably guest everything from chapter 7 onwards which is kindna sad for me that we wait for this game  for like 7-8 years.
- 80% of the music is from the base game which i have been listen for million times already, if you ok with it and not get annoyed like me  there is no problem.

THA GOOD ONE
- The effects on the combat is so good and flashy its feel great to play the game.
- The city feels so alive every character can interact each other , the VA DID A VERY VERY GOOD JOB ON THIS GAME.
- Djeeta sport underwear in the normal uniform 


Overall i think the game right now is kindna mid and too expensive for the price but if they update more content in game and it was actually good i will change my mind about this game. 
For now i rate this game Gay Blue Fantasy / Djeeta sport Underwear.


Ps......This is just my personal review if you wanna play it just buy it , i think overall this game is good but for now it just not worth the price and the 7-8 years that i wait. 



Ps.......The djeeta sport underwear is just a joke

881020,157386612,76561198030452578,0,81,168,0,168,1706848192,"This is a rare game that I would rate ""maybe"" or ""meh"" if Steam allowed it, but as such I'm giving it a ""Not Recommend"".

I bought the game wanting a deep, open-world JRPG, a la FF8 or Skies of Arcadia. Sail around the map in a big airship, assemble a party, collect loot, upgrade weapons, etc.

Sadly, after about 3 hours in, and at the start of Chapter 5, I have not seen any kind of world exploration system. You just ""depart"" to the mission location via a button-press, and then immediately jump to being on the ground at the mission location. No exploration, no sailing, no nothing. 

Why bill the game as ""airships"" if you never actually get to pilot the airships? The first paragraph of the Steam description uses the words ""captain""- but you don't captain anything- ""skyfaring""- but you are never in the sky except as a transition screen, or in a set-piece on-deck boss battle- and ""sail"", but the only sailing you see the ship do is as an icon on the world map.

Next up, there is the marked lack of depth of all the systems.

Skill trees? they're just a linear progression that occasionally has a few parallel branches (never more than 3), that don't ever offer anything unique, just a few different activated skills. Compared to something like FFX, the skill trees are downright anemic.

Loot collection? There's a few different materials that you collect, that you mostly just ignore until you need to upgrade something. At 3 hours in, I've counted maybe 20-25 different items? No armor whatsoever, that I've seen. No weapon drops. No accessories, nor any other element that allows you to play the game in any specific 'role'.

Weapons are upgraded like a F2P auto-battler, where you spend a material to boost them up by 10 levels, then have to pay a ""limit unlock"" fee to be able to pay to upgrade them the next 10 levels; no hunting for unique items to turn them into different variants, no socketing gems or other upgrades. Just spend a resource up to a limit, pay to unlock higher limit, repeat.

Whether you enjoy the various ""deep"" systems that other JRPGs like FF (materia, junctioning, in-game TCG minigames, water-soccer, guardian forces, weapon upgrades, etc) or Mana Khemia/ Atelier series (ingredient collection, investigation, experiments/ alchemy, class assignments, etc) include or not, they at least mean that it feels like there is a LOT to do **IF YOU WANT TO** in those games. In this, there's just not. 

I *WANTED* to collect a bunch of cool loot. I *WANTED* to explore a bunch of cool floating islands. But I can't, because they're just linear paths that you take a loading screen to get to, that lead you to a few groups of 5-10 enemies, and then a boss fight. And the chests along the way have the same 25 items for you to collect.

Sad.

Please note that this review has been edited to reflect improvements from update 1.0.4, addressing previous technical issues. The game shines with an engaging story up to Chapter 8 and offers entertaining co-op quests that are a blast when played with friends. However, not everything is as perfect as it seems.

Positives

- Story up to Chapter 8: The narrative is captivating, offering a rich mix of adventure and character development.
- Co-op Quests with Friends: These stand out as a highlight, providing a lot of fun, especially when playing with friends.

Negatives

- Story from Chapter 9 Onwards: The quality noticeably drops. The storyline feels stretched and poorly thought out, with too much repetition and little novelty.
- Repetitiveness in Co-op Quests: The game suffers from a lack of variety in these quests, as enemies and scenarios constantly repeat, which becomes monotonous over time.

Neutral

- Graphics and Style: The visual style is generally appealing but feels outdated in places.
- Audio: The Japanese voice acting is excellent, but the quality of the translation often leaves much to be desired, affecting immersion.

In summary, Granblue Fantasy: Relink offers significant strengths in its story and co-op gameplay but also had notable weaknesses, especially in content quality past a certain point. With the latest updates, many of the technical concerns have been addressed, enhancing the overall experience for fans of JRPGs and co-op enthusiasts.",1706866169,1706999527,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]Problems with translation[/h2]
Since people are not getting it... Let me add a simple example. This is NOT localization, this is just completely changing the dialogue, for no purpose.

[b]When you talk to Rosetta in town after meeting the crew, she says:[/b]
[u]Japanese:[/u]
そうねぇ。それじゃあ、

Can you research fun things to do in this city?

While the in-game Translation is:
Let's see,
Guidebooks are pretty useful. Ever thought about writing one?

yes... surely, 
I would appreciate it if there were more people. . .

While the in-game Translation is:
Very well,
I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.

Please explain to me, in which way this is not changing what the real phrase should be? And also, the ""raw"" translation makes more sense then adding this ""context"".

And this is one example. The game pretty much changes everything. And if you still don't believe me, go looking for other reviews, even positive ones, people give more examples than this...

Again, for someone who knows a Japanese, this is making wonder if I'm mistranslating it in my head or they are butchering the real japanese dub.

[h2]Performance and Graphics[/h2]
[h3]Graphics[/h3]
The game is [b]GORGEOUS[/b]. Absolutely amazing. I've been waiting for it for about 6 years since I saw the trailer, and was not disappointed, it looks fantastic.

[h3]Performance[/h3]
While I feel the pain in some reviews, I am yet to experience any problems at all. The game runs smooth, 120fps, not dips, no lag, no issues. I run also with v-sync 60, smooth.
No crashes, no problems. But this is me, does not mean the game doesn't need fixing. Please keep an eye for the patch and bug fixes if you have this problems, I hope your pain goes away when they fix it fellow PC Master Racers.

[h2]Original Review[/h2]

The translation sucks, it must have been done before the whole debacle...
For someone who knows Japanese, but still needs subtitles for fast or difficult phrases it's very cringe.

They change EVERYTHING, not a single phrase is what it should be.

I would NOT recommend it just for this, and CyGames needs to fix this as soon as possible. Not everyone lives or is from english speaking countries, and the cringe is hard.

Also, do yourself a favor and stay away from dub.",1706813159,1706996909,False,220,22,0.574413955211639404,40,True,False,False

Passable, and some people will enjoy this, but it feels like a game that would've been released back on the PSP or Vita. There's not really one part of this else than spectacle that is that engaging. I feel if you like those anime beat em up games, or some musous this may be more engaging for you than it is for me.

POSITIVES
Nice anime art style & art design in general
Granblue was always had good art and this is no exception. Hideo Minaba's style really shines through in this and you can see it everywhere. There's a lot of charm in the games particular anime style.

Good flashy visual spectacle for fights
The fights and cutscenes for them are presented well enough. Reminds me of Bayonetta in some cases, although not as engaging.

Nice character selection/variety
Selection of different characters from slow to fast, from ranged fighters to heavy weapon wielders. They all do different enough things to make trying each one a different experience

NEGATIVES
Combat
It's a bit too repetitive. Once you've played one character for a few missions you will have understood the entire gameplay loop for said character. The approach for most enemies is the same (dodge when you need to dodge, spam X and sometimes intermix Y when you need to attack, use skills when off cooldown). For me this compares to something like Tales of, but Tales of has achieved more engaging combat than this since gamecube with combos and skill variety you can figure mix and match. Those aren't my favorite games either but it's the immediate comparison. Some people compare this game to Monster Hunter but it's nothing like it, and the mechanical depth of each character is severely lacking.

Mechanical Depth
There's not much going on in this game. Your skill set up is out of ~8 on each character, which you pick 4 to use actively in battle. They have fairly long cooldowns so they're use them to usually set up for maximal damage for the X and Y attacks. Nothing really combos into each other either. On top of that it feels like attacks should track more in this game given how much enemies just move around. Attack chains can be super long, but by the time you finish them the enemy has already moved away and now you've missed or have to redo the chain, it doesn't feel great.

Boss phases (bloodlust)
Most people probably like the bosses but the bloodlust phase is just annoying. It's basically a period that just consumes your time where you can't engage in damaging the enemy. So you are running around dodging attacks, and that's it.

RPG Depth
This is barely better than something like FF16 or GoW on this case. It's basically just minor stat increases hopefully adding up to something larger. Nothing really changes how your character performs all too much or how you build them. The biggest RPG decision making is which character you go into battle with, which is kind of decided by elemental weakness comparison, otherwise you're minimizing damage.

Multiplayer
Just do the same missions the game kind of expects you to do in the base game. Even with Post game it's kind of the same mess. There are some extra and more interesting things to do in extreme but not to such a degree I'd ever say this is the ""real game"". It's just overall a bit lacking. Also TO GET TO MOST OF THAT ONLINE CONTENT YOU NEED TO BEAT THE GAME. This means an up to 10 hour story to get to the post game/most of the quest content. Overall It just feels like the multiplayer was tacked on, and this part more than anything gave me that old VITA feel.

Story
It's an anime sidestory that doesn't matter for a plot of a game majority of the people playing probably won't even know. There's nothing particularly special or depthy about it. It's inoffensive I guess, but it does nothing, and you won't be compelled by the setting or characters unless you already have prior engagement with the gacha. Even then it's just nothing crazy.

Small stuff/Quality issues
It's polished for the most part, I never ran into a bug, but there are several minor issues that just add up to being annoying with the game. The camera is slow by default without sensitivity changes. The lock on sucks. Movement is okay, but nothing great, and the game has a few movement/platform puzzles that feel bad to do given the controls of said movement. Sometimes the bosses require a bit of precision to dodge their attack phases as well, and you can just slide a bit into the fire and get hit on a lot of attacks.

This game for me is around a 5/10. if I was much younger and playing this on an older console I'd probably remember it fondly, but given the current era and quality of games this doesn't feel worth 60$s. I don't think I would've beat it if I wasn't playing it so causally on the steamdeck.",1706996303,1706996303,False,10,1,0.47223275899887085,0,True,False,False

This game nails many of aspects of what makes a great action RPG:
- A ton of characters each with unique mechanics. 
- A lengthy progression system with just the right amount of complexity. Not to simple, but also not to complex.
- Engaging combat system with a diverse set of enemies and boss mechanics.
- Superb cinematic quality.
- NO GACHA

However, the story is somewhat short (15-20 hours), doesn't have the most interesting plot, and the dialogue can be cheesy at times. BUT this game's gameplay mechanics, progression, and overall polish makes up for everything and more.

I haven't quite made it to the endgame just yet, but from what I've heard its where the game really starts to open up.

General quality of the game is insane, you can see how much effort and love devs put into it. Combat is awesome, story is fine nothing special, playable characters are diverse enough to not feel too similar, every chapter/main quest area is awesome and you do/see different stuff in each chapter, bosses and their transition from cutscene to gameplay are fucking sick. There are so many small details like; meanwhile with playing a character you unlock (so any character besides the main crew of 6) they say appropiate stuff during story moments and boss fights or meanwhile fighting the boss some kind of action happens at the background that is clearly visible to you if you look that way. 

All in all i am extremely satisfied with the main story and the ending, and supposedly endgame is the real deal here just like monster hunter games.

Having now played it on the Deck it runs suprisingly well for how much is happening on screen
what i will say is on the OLED i will drop to 22ish-25 sometimes BUT it is only for millisecond, long enough to register the drop but you dont really feel it ever if that makes sense. i think one benefit of it coming out on the Ps4 is that the 30 lock feels incredibly smooth closer to like 45 or so feels like on there. the menus are also very very snappy and the loading is like instant so that too does not feel like its taxing the system the way it is. also locked at 30 your looking at around 3-5 hours give or take with the time in cut scenes and menus probably 2 and half to 3 if you are just straight running missions non stop. 

i bought this on a whim, i liked how it looked and what i thought it was. im not familiar with granblue other than the hour i played of the most recent fighting game but ill tell ya a purchase of that is now in the future. 

this is a weird blend of Wayfinder, Xenblade chronicles and monster hunter and pretty much in that order. 

runs well for me at locked 120 fps full tilt. i dont think i ever saw a frame drop no matter how frantic it got. 
though im on a 13700k with a 4080. im curious to try it on steam deck here shortly. 

i cant say much about the story other than its totally serviceable. and overall im enjoying it even though im not totally locked into it. What i will say is this game does something ive never seen but if you skip a cutscene it gives you a summer of what your skipping and what plot is happening before you accept making it possible to fully understand it without needing to see it. that said the voice work and scenes themselves are super well animated and framed. if i was more into this style of story telling i think id like it quite a bit i just fine the Characters a bit too silly and some way to serious. i cant really find a middle ground. 

Combats great as youd expect, i could take more from the open areas because i just generally like them and the look of the game itself. but whats offered is fine so far. 

No real microtransactions, no store, no battle pass, You have a full 3d model viewer of every character, enemy and weapon in the game and one for a good chunk of the 2d art which you would see sold separate in a lot of other games now a days

i havent made it to the endgame but im incredibly curious as to what it looks like and or what a roadmap or continuation will look like going forward because i do see myself spending a good bit of time with this and i almost wish it was a live service so that i knew more was coming. 

honestly my only real gripe is that when you pick a character that is what theyre going to look like the entire time, i know people in this niche like this but i could take more outfits or look changes or something to represent my grow in power as it is a power fantasy at the end of the day. 

my only other gripe is no ultrawide support which is a bummer, weirdly the game doesnt have ps4 or 5 button layouts even though it only launched on there and pc as a port so its an odd ommission since the work was already done, but to that end the games ui and layout is exactly the same as a controller as in right hand side has a 4 button diamond for abilities and a bumper and trigger listed same as the left hand side so just looking at the screen youll know exactly where everything is when it matters. though most of us who have used a ps controller on pc for a while will be accustomed to missing button art. 

i dunno i think its good, im really surprised by it, i got tails of arise recently and i now feel like i probably wont be touching that for quite a while.",1706949970,1706992919,True,41,1,0.756274759769439697,0,True,False,False

According to informations acquired, the core of the game's playtime resides in the post story content, which consists of repetetitive instanced few minutes long co-op battles with recycled enemies and bosses, accompanied by grinding for new equipment with the sole purpose to takle more of this, in my opinion, vapid and uninteresting content.

I am so far enjoying the game, and I find saddening to see all this charm squandered in this manner, since in the first hour it managed to capture and fascinate me so that I thought it could have rivaled games such as Xenoblade 2, but it looks like the developers had no intention to exploint the full potential of the settings and the characters.",1706971346,1706992860,False,6,1,0.388723611831665039,0,True,False,False

Combining attacks with Linked Skybound Arts and all that is just so epic, everyone using their SBA (it's basically like your ultimate), in tandem and whoever starts it changing the end combination result and element is such a well thought and designed mechanic. like seriously, everyone in the party shouting ""FULL BURST!

Decent story, cliche and filled with tropes, but filled with visually appealing cutscenes. 
Lots of things to do other than the main story, questing by yourself or with friends, side quests, and I personally enjoy just levelling and gearing all the characters.

Probably one of the best action RPG I've ever played so far, combat was fluid, fight mechanics feels deeply polished for every single boss.

The story mode has very much the feel of a classic JRPG setting, with the boss fights being pretty fun throughout the game.

I have seen mentions of the game having performance issues and crashes for some people, but I haven't had a single crash or issue through my entire playtime. Even the online co-op was very stable. I will say that the hub area does drop in fps a bit (40-ish fps was the lowest at max settings at 1440p on a RTX 3060 TI and Ryzen 5800X3D), and I think that is due to that area having a lot of NPC's and stuff on screen. Combat was always above 60 fps for me.

Usually I am a chill dude avoiding negativity of this kind but I feel like people should be aware how the game really is because all the Youtubers are praising the game and giving the impression that this is worth your time and money; I disagree and here's why:

The game is a huge disappointment, sadly on multiple levels. Starting with how obnoxious the camera is and the related settings that do not help at all. Targeting enemies and settings related to that are very poor as well. For rest of the performance I cannot really speak of because I am brute forcing performance by using RTX4090 and i9 13900k so it runs well for me, although I can see that the GPU and CPU utilization is higher than in Cyberpunk 2077 on maxed out settings and 4k resolution so that should speak volumes I guess. Oh and BTW, did I mention that this game has no support for ultra wide monitors? Yeah, when you are running anything more than 16:9 then say hello to black bars on sides.

For the game content - story is very mediocre and the dev laziness is beyond reason. Starting in Chapter 8 or maybe even 7 (out of 9,5 chapters because last chapter can't be considered a full chapter compared to previous ones) you start seeing same bosses, just re-skinned with different color. There is of course a story reason for that but dear god does it feel cheap.

The Endgame - the what now? Oh yeah, a mindless grind to just get bigger DPS numbers and to clear encounters faster. There is zero novelty, all bosses and enemies are exactly the same, not even of different color or size. It's all a repeat from story but just harder and oh boy is the difficulty scaling really bad (beat story on Hard and it wasn't challenging at all except literally last boss that has just a silly gimmick - you have a short window to DPS down a certain thing, otherwise you wipe and need to start over the entire fight.
I had taken the effort and Googled out if there is ANYTHING new in the endgame and apparently at the very end, when you are max level already there are 3 bosses of same kind (say Hi to last chapter of the game) but they differ in color and head design, rest of the body is exactly the same.

To say that I am disappointed is understatement. Shame on you whoever made this.",1706986678,1706986678,False,9,2,0.466384261846542358,0,True,False,False

So far i'm loving the visuals, music, the Japanese VA and especially the combat. Super flashy, visually appealing, and smooth. Although the camera and lock-on system needs some work. I'm not experiencing any crashing, other than under 60 FPS on towns (around 50 above FPS playing on 1080p ultra with RTX 3050, Ryzen 7, and 16GB RAM). But overall so far i'm loving this game.


Editing this review after i have finished the main story:
What i must add, is the music. Majority of them are pure art piece! I can see myself listening to GBF: Relink's OST again and again. Second is the diversity of character playstyle, ignore the ""which character is the best?"" bluff and go find a character you actually enjoy playing, Cygames did a great job with the combat and gameplay, try all of them!!! Third... the character design is really nice, some are old and some are newly introduced, tbh I'm never tired of seeing the same characters from other GBF games. Last but not least is totally the super beautiful cutscenes and the overwhelmingly epic boss fights, i couldn't stop pressing F12 to screenshot lmao.


I sat through the credits scene with a smile. But very sad that the story is over for now, but thankfully endgame is a grindfest and more contents to come. Very excited for that.

EDIT: Using the workaround where you launch and leave another game running, I've been able to play the game with far less crashes (like once every 3-5 hours in a random cutscene). 

The game itself is very enjoyable, as a long-time Granblue fan that's played since just before the English option was added to the main game it's been an absolute treat. The beautiful art and aesthetics, the fluid and smooth combat with all the unique character play-styles (Cagliostro my beloved) and a refreshing focus on the main characters of the crew that's kind of fallen away in the main game now there's 50000 god-like (and actual gods) on the crew. The side missions ala a Monster Hunter counter hunts with random players have been fun if a bit easy since it's low level.

This game is basically a 3D ARPG version of the gacha game thats more than decade old now. So if you came from the gacha game, then expect many of the aspects of the game mechanics from the gacha game to be in this game as well but properly executed.

The pros
-great gameplay
-great soundtrack
-great characters and design
-each character feels unique so you cant just do the same strat on all characters

The cons
-story is kind of typical
-movement at times can feel a bit stiff (not awhole lot to where you would notice it right away)
-you cant coop for the story, only for quests that you take at the guild(kind of like monster hunter)
-not awhole lot of exploration

A captivating addition to the hunting genre, this game introduces significant innovations by seamlessly integrating deep RPG mechanics. Boss fights offer a refreshing experience, emphasizing mechanical challenges over the typical hunting game formula of simply attacking and dodging. The story line is decent, though the drawback lies in its mandatory nature and the campaign being exclusively single-player. Players must invest 10-15 hours (considerably shorter if cutscenes are skipped along with side quests) in the story before delving into the Monster Hunter aspect of the game.

The end game is rich in content, providing ample opportunities for grinding. Each character boasts unique play styles, enhancing the overall gaming experience. While the game draws inspiration from Monster Hunter, its potential as a live service game is evident, and one hopes for continuous updates from CyGames. For a debut effort in this genre, the game is remarkably impressive. If you enjoyed Monster Hunter, this title offers a comparable experience expect the same grindy nature and fighting the same monsters over and over again to power up your characters. A notable strength of this game is its effective use of numerical data, immersing players in a flood of numbers that triggers a satisfying dopamine response. This aspect contributes to a game play experience reminiscent of titles like Vampire Survivors and Holocure. On my PC the experience has been excellent, with a consistent 100+ fps on a 5900x and 3080 setup. 

A+ Definitely recommend at full price.

Ok, I have completed the main story and many post-game quests. They also since released a patch which fixed some of the bugs I mentioned so I remove them from my cons. 

- The story is still servicable, but it does get hype at times. It is extremely cliche and predictable, and the pacing feels like it never takes the chance to slow down. Basically, expect a similar story quality to Monster Hunter, but a bit better. Mostly the story feels like giving you a reason for doing the post-game quests.
- The combat is damn fun. Each character plays differently and feels like their own class, despite all of them based on the simply X/Y combo system. Some characters care about timing, some care about how you pace your attacks, some rely on zoning, etc. You can definitely play the game without aiming for S++ rank by just doing basic X/Y combos, but just like any PlatinumGames game, to get the optimal output from your character there's a lot of deeper mechanics to consider. As an example, Katalina seems just like any other character with her X/Y combos and skills, but her special gauge can be built up quickly using optimal combos, and once her special is activated you have to chain her attacks and skills in a specific way to keep her special up for as long as possible to maximize your damage output. You also have other ways to build and maintain the gauge outside of skills, all of this comes together to feel like a dance. It's what I love about PlatinumGames games and they captured it here perfectly for a RPG skin.
- The end game is a grind, just like Nioh, just like Monster Hunter, just like any other mission based RPG. You'll be getting new mechanics each with their own grind and if you want to be optimal in the hardest content that's something you'll have to deal with.

Overall, it's what I expected and hoped for. It's a solid game.

===============================

Here is my pros and cons so far.

Pros:
- The MC is fully voiced
- VA work is good and artstyle is nice
- The combat is fun. Not groundbreaking, but fun, especially when all the systems come together
- The locations are large. Not open-world, but enough to do some exploration
- I actually like the simplified weapon upgrade system from the gacha
- I haven't run into any game breaking bugs besides the KB one

Cons:
- The backstory is delivered to you via logs and you won't understand anything unless you played the gacha or watched the anime
- The whole dispatch mission system feels disconnected from the rest of the game, it is clearly there because that's how the gacha works, but you show up in the town with the intent to save some people and the quest lady's like ""yeah btw you can go on missions if you want lol""


So far it's a light recommend. I think after they fix bugs this will level out around high 80%s, it just won't appeal to many people. Might update after I play more",1706789165,1706978226,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The game, similar to its mobile origins. is all about grinding. But the grind is fun.

I do think this is an easy recommend even if you're playing solo, but postgame will be much more fun with friends. However, the story is singleplayer only. Depending on if you watch cutscenes or not and how you're playing through it, it can take 8-15+ hours, so it's not terribly long at least.

Pros:
[list]
  [*]Raids are fun end game and difficult.
  [*]Combat animations
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
  [*]Game crashes frequently. Not much auto-save.
  [*]Not much mechanics imo, I feel it's a lot of just dodging without much reward and spamming abilities. More of a hack and slash type of game.
  [*]Fun if you have friends.
  [*]Solo is awful for raids, 30-40 min because AI NPC is not very good and doesn't attack frequently. At least they res you fast though lol.
  [*]I'm Canadian, so the price of the game is not worth it at $102~ imo. Better to get it on sale.
  [*]A lot of the gear upgrade is locked behind materials that only drop for end-end game. Talking about Maniac/Proud raids. That means you are stuck with your level 40-50 weaps until end game since you can't uncap them early.

I would say to those who want to try this game to not let that discourage you. You may have to tweak your settings a bit to get the best experience with the hardware you have, Because of the storybook sketch art style it looks awesome even with mid graphics settings.

The story is... Eh. It's derivative and I don't know if some of the dialogues are cringy because of localisation or because of how the story was written. It was aimed at a fairly young audience. It also has the typical anime/manga structure of always trying to one-up itself at every stage, and the final couple of chapters were exasperatingly so.

The character themselves though are really interesting and I prefer their own personal stories.

Gameplay wise the characters feel very different from one other and they are all interesting.

I experienced one crash in the middle of a cut scene in chapter 8. Otherwise it runs very well for me.

Controls are decent on mouse and keyboard, although better on controller. Even if the UI and the tutorials tell you to press an extra button to switch to your 4 skills, you do not need to do so on keyboard, just press the keybind for your skill. This aspect of the port was done with the smallest amount of effort they could get away with, so they didn't bother to change the UI or even update the tutorial for mouse and keyboard, aside from the obvious keybind changes.

The game can be absolutely enjoyed solo or with friends, the systems support both options well.",1706886275,1706968559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of my expectations were meet, I like the combat system very similar to like tales of ( berseria , zestria and arise) if u played these games before u won’t struggle on this game at all , love the beautiful graphics and story is very immersive it hooks u on the geek go 

But this game comes with some flaws aswell like bug at launch for some users , no ultra wide support and no option to disable HUD or hide while not in combat and short story

Chapter 6 Finished as of writing this.

-----SHORT SUMMARY OF MY EXPERIENCE SO FAR-----
I myself like this game, I'm very simple and easily amused when it comes to flashy combat and/or super moves and this one hits the spot of just being cathartic in a sense with how fluid it feels to play it and execute Full Bursts with bunch of strangers online.

If you ever played any mobile games or gacha at all, you will feel very familiar with some of its design and UI, specially when upgrading weapons as an example.
Level the weapon to its current Max Level -> Uncap its max Level Capacity to level it even further -> Level the weapon to the new unlocked Max Level -> Repeat -> Repeat and Repeat till its maximum. The only difference is you don't need multiple of the same weapon to do this unlike regular gacha games, just materials which you get from various quests.

Basically it has the feeling of typical gacha design, but without the gambling and few other aspects that makes it standout from your usual Gacha game that would normally ""encourage"" you to spend real money. I am expecting it will be some sort of grindfest at the endgame from what I've read, but not Gacha Grindy, more akin to Monster Hunter-ish, but with more special effects to rival a disco. And without the annoyance of an ""Stamina/Energy"" currency to interact with the game like most mobile games have of the gacha element, glad that isn't present.

That is just my current experience during story mode and the occasional side-quests, but as for the gameplay itself I'm having a blast with some of its simplicity and spectacularly fun boss fights, can more or less steamroll it like i have done if you just upgrade your stuff and know the basics while on Normal Mode. There is Journalist mode (Story Mode), Normal and Hard Mode i believe. But sometimes i like to challenge myself and get up there to Perfect parry and dodges since the buffs/benefits from it feels rewarding for pulling it off.

--The story itself can be a mixed bag due to its translation from Japanese into English, specially if you understand Japanese and it doesn't reflect the English translation by using weird slangs you normally wont hear people say like ""In a jiffy"" /""Exactomundo"" among other things by recognizing few words and be like ""That is not what he/she said at all"". 
For me i am not bothered by it, all it does is make me second guess why its always so difficult for a 100% correct localization considering the universal language that is English combined with the impact Japanese media have had on the world with anime, jrpg etc, Or if someone believes that ""This is exactly how people talk and behave on that side of the planet"". But this type of translation isn't exclusive to this title so i can hardly judge it at all for it.
Otherwise the story isn't that big of a deal, more like a context of things till you eventually don't pay it no mind and just focus on the gameplay itself like any other games OR don't focus on the odd translations and the try to enjoy the story for what it is and the context it provides you, whichever you prefer. 
But if you played dozen of JRPG games then you will pretty much be used to the kind of story it is offering, It's nothing mindblowing or grand, but its there mostly as a drive to continue until you reach End Game content.

----MY ISSUE WITH THE GAME----
However despite enjoying this game i haven't encountered a single problem or a single crash >>""yet""<< that others are currently facing, by being unable to play a >>Full Priced Game<<. So i can't in good conscious give it a positive rating until the devs have fixed said issue.

Can't get past the company logo splash screen and crashes // Can't boot up the game // Can't get past Chapter 1 Rolan cutscene to continue main story as it freezes the game and hard crashes it // OTHER Cutscenes doing the same thing // Game stops booting at all after said cutscenes hard crashes it // Blackscreen. And whatnot, mostly it hardlocks your progression at Chapter 1 due to its issue and more then a few or dozen customers mentions this.

Normally i would just continue playing it and just have a grand ol' time even if others are having major problems while it functions for me.
BUT i did want to play it for the co-op ""Monster Hunter""-ish quests with one of my friends that can't even play it because of the issues the game have since its launch and seems to persist after the recent patch today.

I am not a tech-savy in any form and just have bare minimum understanding to keep my PC running, but i do troubleshoot a ton like a possessed ghost with a grudge when something doesn't work as intended.
And this is what i have mostly come to understand:

If you as a customer wants to play the game but are unsure if you will be one of the unlucky ones unable to do so, you only need to look at one specific hardware to determine that. >>Processor<<
If its an Intel, either older or recent generation (From what I've read across multiple topics in the discussions and posted specs) you will MOST likely have a bad day and unable to play the game with that specific brand of hardware. (My is an ""AMD Ryzen 7 1700"", it does its job.)
There have been some exception though, but most of those have had to troubleshoot as well for a fix that works for them, and may or may not work for others, which is a gamble. 


----WHAT ARE THE FIXES?----
They vary from ""I guess that make sense"" to ""Absurd black magic nonsense""

The most common one is by using a software called ""Process Lasso"" for your intel related Granblue problems, but it isn't always a 100% guarantee for everyone.
---And if you're lucky as a intel user, one of the two things might work for you with Lasso:
-1.- By just having Lasso passively running in the background and ""monitoring"" your cores while playing the game.
Imagine the Boo ghosts from the Mario games. It won't do you wrong if you keep your ""eyes"" on the cores for some reason.
-2.- By disabling ""Ecores"" through Lasso, which have had mixed results of either working or temporarily working up till Chapter 3 cutscenes and strokes out again.

---The second most common thing that seems to work//not work depending when it comes to the game constantly hard crashing and not booting up at all or blackscreens, which is the black magic that someone found out by accident, with mixed results as well. [Credit goes to ""Valkyn Shade"" for discovering this by accident]
-By BOOTING UP another game entirely first (In this case it was Monster Hunter: World), let it finish loading up till its Main Menu, AND THEN boot up ""Granblue Fantasy Relink"" while the other Game remains active in the background, and boom. The game is booting up, getting pass the Company splash logo, black screens etc. After that you can quit out of the other game in the background. (Unsure what it does for cutscenes, might have glanced over that if it does anything for that issue)
For him and his friends it has been a reliable to get the game running, but suggested to try with other games if you don't have MHWorld or that specific game didn't work for you.


TL:DR;
I'm having a blast playing it, but i really wanted to play this with a friend who has a Intel Processor which the game is struggling to keep itself from running stable at all. As of now NO FIXES have worked for my friend at all.
If you can't boot it up, play it or anything. There is lot of topics with obscure fixes that may or may not work for you as a Intel user. 
Just keep it in mind by using a Intel Processor if you plan to purchase it before the Devs patched a fix, there will be a high chance that you will be unable to play it till then.
So until then, my review will remain negative till such patch have been released fixing this glaring issue.

The launch of this game for me and many others was horrible. However, as many have pointed out, these days many games are released as buggy messes. Tekken 8 PC released with broken and unplayable online multiplayer where you would crash after matching with literally anyone. Undernight In-birth 2 is still a broken mess. Even GOTY Baldur’s Gate 3 had some problems on release where some would experience an excess increase in their gpu temperature. What is important is how fast the game developers respond to these problems. As for Granblue Fantasy Relink, I am happy to announce that at least for me, the bugs and glitches are gone.

What is Granblue Fantasy?

Granblue Fantasy is originally a mobile game released by Cygames, a company based in Japan. It features a dated turn based combat inside a rich world and a great plot that’s supported with interesting lore. There are many amazing characters too that are locked behind ‘gacha’. Personally Granblue Fantasy was a first for me. It was the first mobile game I thoroughly enjoyed. It was the first gacha game I spent money on. It was the first mobile game that forced me to team up with overseas players to participate in “Unite and Fight” events and allowed me to make foreign friends. It’s no exaggeration for me to say that I’m fluent in English now all thanks to GBF. If I didn’t know english then I wouldn’t get to banter with my western friends in our guild. So believe me when I say that this series is very dear to my heart.

What is Granblue Fantasy Relink?

Granblue Fantasy Relink is an ARPG (Action Role Playing Game). It moves away from its turn-based origins and has a multiplayer that's reminiscent of the Monster Hunter franchise. It's a work that's been in the oven for seven years and has been long awaited by fans both old and new to the series alike.

Plot:

GBFR (Granblue Fantasy Relink), does not start at the beginning of the series’ story. Instead it starts off at the 3rd major arc of the mobile game’s plot. This means for many, they will be a bit confused on why some things are the way they are. Like why are both Lyria and Djeeta (no I don’t play Gran) are life linked? What’s the deal with Vyrn? What are the Astrals? These are things someone new to the series will ask and sadly the game doesn’t really do a good job addressing these. I would suggest watching the anime or giving the mobile game a try to better understand the world’s lore.

To put it simply without spoiling anything, there’s a jerk who’s trying to revive the “Forbidden Primal Beast” which has the capability to destroy the skies. As a Skyfarer you don’t want that so you have to stop her and rescue a couple of friends along the way. If you’re someone new to the series, but not new to JRPGs, you might find this bland or a cliche. But if you’re someone who’s interested in GBF lore then your eyes will be glued to the screen for hours. If you’re not a fan of anime and constantly shit on JRPGs then head back to Yingtopia because this game is simply not for you.

Graphics and Art Design:

Granblue Fantasy Relink is a very beautiful game. The world is very nice and polished. The characters all look very beautiful both in-game and in cutscenes. I run the game in the highest settings and I find that everything is very vibrant. There were some moments where I thought ‘Djeeta looks kind of stiff’ but this was not something that ruined it for me. The monsters all look intimidating and the animations of the attacks and skills you use to vanquish them were a feast to the eyes. Personally I think this game won’t lose to any other game of the same genre in this department. And finally Cagliostro is very cute.

Audio (SFX and Soundtrack)

I cannot overstate how amazing this game’s soundtrack is. As some people already said, it would be a robbery if this does not win the award for ‘best score and music’ this year. The developers chose the perfect music to play in every situation. Fighting an epic boss has never been more hype thanks to the background music that encourages you to give god an asswhoopin. The characters are properly voice acted, even Djeeta who was originally a silent protagonist now has her own voice!

Gameplay

As I said before the game has moved away from its turn based roots, and that’s fine. It’s refreshing to see GBF in the style of monster hunter. You use the town as your hub then go out into the world to fight monsters in real time. You form a party of four from the characters that you have. The characters are diverse in skills and in looks. You can either choose to make a party depending on aesthetics, or make a party based on skills that you need to fight a boss or to suit your playstyle. Kinda reminds me of how it worked in my hometown in Fontaine.

In battle you have your attack (square), heavy attack (triangle), jump (x), and link arte (circle). You can attack enemies while jumping, which has its own set of attack animations. By pressing R1 + your action buttons you can use 4 different skills that you can customize to best suit your party. Many characters can heal, but some can also buff up the party’s attack and/or defense. There are some characters who have nothing but selfish buffs who are focused on smacking enemies silly. It’s all very fun really.

“Wow you said there are many characters? There’s only a few here! Where are they?!” Well, throughout the game you get items that are called “Crew Cards”. You trade these to Sierokarte, the annoying runt, to recruit Cagliostro and maybe other characters. This item is finite so choose properly who you like. After you recruit the character of your choice you can spend mastery points to give them new skills, and buff up their stats. You can also go to the blacksmith to outfit them with the proper weapon they can wield, upgrade these weapons and enchant them with sigils for maximum biatch slapping sensation. Personally I would save these Crew Cards in case the devs release new characters in the future.

In conclusion:

Granblue Fantasy isn’t a perfect game. It is however a very fun game that gives the mobile game’s fans what they’ve always wanted…. Seeing Ferry’s armpits in 3D.

You can imagine my face when I found out the game was announced back in 2016 and delayed for around half a decade. The delay was absolutely worth it as the game is an absolute masterpiece.

If you're planning on picking up Relink only to play through the story and then not touching it again I would recommend against doing that, as it was stated and pretty obvious from playing the game, the story is not the focus of the game, more so the endgame. While the story itself isn't a masterpiece, it's not bad either. If you've played any other JRPG's you'll find plenty of similarities between writing. However it is full of epic and ""ooh s**t"" moments.
While playing the story the captain (Gran or Djeeta) will be forced to be a part of your party, however they don't need to be the character you control. After the story is done you'll be able to remove them from the party entirely. The main campaign has no multiplayer whatsoever, which to me, is no problem at all.

Where the game really starts to shine is in its wide variety of characters, gameplay and the endgame. You have 18 characters (19 if you count Gran and Djeeta as seperate) to choose from to make a 4 man party. While the characters don't have specific roles that they should stick with, it's quite easy to see which characters are meant to be used for support, tanking or unleashing huge amounts of DPS. Every character is unique in their playstyle and not just copy paste. Because of this, if you ever get bored of playing a character, just switch it up and you'll be playing in an entirely different way with other methods of approaching your current obstacle.

For the people familiar with Monster Hunter, endgame works more or less the same, You go to the quest counter, pick up a quest, play either online or offline, complete the quest, return to town or redo it repeat.

Personally, I love grinding and min maxing characters so I'm sure I'll enjoy the endgame which I'm now headed to.

- Can run very well on my under the minimum spec PC. I only have AMD 2200g, RX580, 16GB and ran the game from HDD. It run at 50ish FPS consistently at the lowest graphic.
- The graphic at the lowest setting looks like medium setting for 2015ish games, but due to its stylization it still looks really good. The visual effect are 2020+ games tho and can looks amazing at times while still running well
- Loading time is still very fast with HDD at lowest setting, i don't know how they do this, it's quite amazing.
- Quite easy to get into. So far im running on Hard difficulty and haven't run into any spike in difficulty
- ITS GBF RELINK! ITS BEEN YEARS! IT FINALLY ARRIVED!

Cons:
- Its still buggy af. The January 3rd update fixed the cutscene freeze bug. Still, expect more bugs
- Localization is a total bull crap. It strays too much from the original Japanese audio and text. Example... in the Japanese audio a character is mentioned as a ""Miko"", a shrine maiden, but in the english subtitle it got translated into ""Shaman"" which is very far in terms of meaning. There are many more like this and i can keep going for hours about this. CyGames really need to stop using their current english localization team, or atleast provide us with 2 version of localization where one is more similar to the Japanese audio than the English audio. This is a long running theme from CyGames btw, even from the start of the original Granblue Fantasy game. GBF Versus was as bad as this
- Region lock server is tbh... unnecessary. I don't know how it works rn, but it's kinda impossible to find a Raid in SEA region.
- Censorship. The characters model are censored from the original or atleast altered. Lyria for instance originaly dont wear slippers and Djeeta and Ferry dont use spats.
- VIkala is still not in the game, making 99% of the game as unplayable :(

I see people complaining about censorship with outfits and such. Look I hear ya censorship sucks and I will agree some of the changes make no sense. But not gonna lie I'm a sucker for shorts and spats. But thanks to this we get to play the game just at the sacrifice of some underwear.

Story --- really it is an ok story nothing too interesting but nothing that disappoint you like stranger of paradise either.

Gameplay ---- really nice for a jrpg. actually I enjoyed the combat system a lot. Kinda like tales series combat system but a bit more polished and responsive.

Character progression ---- really in depth and mmorpg like genre. VERY VERY GOOD. SUPERB. There are a tons of playable characters to choose from but just an advice try to stick with just a few new character for the story. The grind is real in this game. DO NOT TRY TO BUY every character from the start you will lose like 30-45 levels for the character that you wont be using since at post game the new character comes with higher lvl depending on your character. And yes you can get all character in game at the moment without using anything. To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed in that since I don't get to learn the relation between them. But there is fate episode to learn the character background and how he/she fit in this role. Its just like visual novel nevertheless.  

Graphics ---- AWESOME. I got 60 fps stable at 4k with no dip ever the whole game. Actually i know I can easily get 144 fps stable at 4k for this game even with max setting with my setup but for some reason the game is capped at 60fps although I changed the setting in option to 120 fps in game. But still capped at 60 fps nevertheless it still was a really good performance. Still trying to figure out how to get over frame cap..

cons

I am 13 hours into the game and thats it for story pretty much. I do know that this game is not about story. The real game start post game. I did every single side quests, every single quest board quest (all S++ except the one on the ship only able to get S+) and also every single available fate episode. So I don't think I am rushing the story either. This is the amount of story content you get in this game.

So if you are playing jrpg for story mode, you should consider getting this game at discount or something. This game is not about story mode. It is about the grind after the story. 

As far as cons go thats about it. 

I enjoyed every single minute of it and still gonna grind for post game and I think the ture ending is not the story from what I am researching in forum. The true ending or something in essence lies within the post game I think.  

FOR MY FIRST WALKTHROUGH, everything is SOLO. heck I never play any jrpg in co-op even if that is an option. I just grind hard and tackle the hard one. 
This game do have censorship but I dunno, I never give a f ... abt that as long as I enjoyed the game.

From my perspective, I give this game 9/10 just because the story is short.  Every other thing make up for it though. otherwise this is a solid 10/10 for me.

> Gameplay:
The game consists of hub sections where the player unlocks various things, picks up quests and levels up characters and then goes on adventures in 4 man parties (whether it's actual players joining you or NPCs is up to you). Main missions follow a PSO / MonHun structure where there might be several smaller encounters leading up to multiple boss fights. The side missions may have more focused objectives. 

Combat is action based, very fluid and flashy. There's about twenty characters to pick from, each character having two basic modes of attack along with the standard dodge and block and an aerial attack string. Up to 4 abilities can be equipped aswell to further spice up the combos. The way the dodging is handled is quite interesting too, allowing players three consecutive dodges before ending up in a ""winded"" stage. Lots of characters have timing based attacks where correctly timing them affects damage or completely modifies the combo string. The ""tells"" for the right timing are very clear though and the only time you muck up combos is when you panic or when there's a lot of things on the screen at once.

> Story:
Very simplistic story featuring classic tropes from JRPGs varying from primal elemental beasts, big bad evil, power of friendship etc. Definitely an enjoyable ride with scenarios nicely paced. Moments of glory are intertwined with moments of respite giving you a chance to go back to hub and level up / upgrade / do side quests / do CO-OP. 

> Graphics & Performance
The models and textures are all very beautifully done, animations are super smooth and flashy, overall I really like them. On my 12600K + 3070 Ti rig the game runs incredibly well (constant 120 FPS with no drops or hickups). Also another thing I like is how they've handled LODs - they look like watercolor paintings.
I've not had a single crash but I did have a black screen on boot issue, which seems to have been fixed by the 1.0.4 update. Other than having to restart the game a few times until it boots, I've not encountered any Cyberpunk / Bethesda-esque bugs where npcs float or fall through the ground. 

> Audio
The English dub is ...servicable I guess? But then again that's always the case with JP games. Japanese voice over is amazing with some top tier VA being pulled for this game. The general audio such as effects and attack noises are done really well. Soundtrack arrangement is beautiful, with some really nice orchestral music to add to tension in battles.

> Translation
My one gripe with the game really. Millenial and zoomer lingo sprinkled in moments where it clearly isn't necessary nor does it fit the character. The localisers for Japanese games should stop taking ""creative liberties"" when translating and ruining the source product. If I wanted a fanfic, I'd read one.

> Monetisation model
Game comes at a industry standard 60 € price point (for EU). The special edition features some goodies and basic character recolors, I felt it wasn't worth buying those but feel free to support the devs if you'd like to.
The game features no MTX, no gacha elements, no time gated crap like season passes. You pay the game and get the complete package. The fact that this has to be written on a review really tells the story of how predatory the gaming industry is in the year 2024.

TL;DR
If you like action JRPGs / games in the style of MonHun, you will absolutely love this game. The combat and bosses are awesome, the visuals and artstyle are beautiful, the music breath taking. Performance, besides hicups on boot (which should've been fixed by the latest patch) is solid (stable 120FPS easily done on semi-modern hardware).",1706958209,1706958209,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every time I hear that the game is being delayed again for another year is quite saddening but at least it's now here. If you're a fan of the series, I recommend you that you get it, you will have a blast playing it. 

The PC port is decent but bare bones since there's only 3 settings that you can change in the graphics menu and only supports 16:9 aspect ratio, the specification for the game is on point though there are some cases where it dips below 30fps for instance where you are talking to NPC and it's just the two characters which are Djeeta (in my case) and Vyrn it would dip to 20fps for some reason where it shouldn't be dipping. Pretty minors inconvenience tbh but I still hope Cygames would fix it. In Combat though, the fps is a stable 30 even if there's a lot of SFX on screen which makes the fps dip when talking to an NPC quite weird. I capped my frames to 30 since i prefer having a stable frame rate than having variable frame rate of 45 - 60. I was lucky enough to not encounter the black screen bug that people were having hoping Cygames would fix that as well, so they would be able to enjoy and play the game.

addictive action gameplay. Have played the entire story whit only the base character and the possibilities of many other characters is fantastic.

Complete game without any type of subscription like pay. You buy the game end you have the full experience. 

Played with a 1070 and an old raizen 5 in 1080p and experienced 0 issue of any sort at the moment. 

The soundtrack is very powerful and perfect for the title. 

The only downside imoh can be the length of the story a little bit more hours to expand a little an make it more deep. 

In conclusion a great game that MUST BE in every library!

From a combat standpoint, I have the same complaint of occasionally finding it hard to tell what's going on through all the flashy effects, exacerbated by an awkward lock-on mechanic and camera. On the flip side, Relink's main story, though simple, is reminiscent of the cinematic adventure in FFXVI--minus the endless back-to-back cutscenes and repetitive padding that ruined the game for me. Relink keeps the plot simple, which works to its benefit. The soundtrack is incredible, making the most minor character interaction feel sentimental and adding blood-pumping stakes to the various exciting bosses and set pieces. Beautiful environments. 

I've yet to touch quests in co-op. Those instanced quests are my least favorite part of the game; you're ultimately just fighting the same enemies and bosses in the same levels from the main story. I'm glad the main story doesn't recycle much at all until the last chapter, but since co-op quests are meant to provide long-term playability, there should be plenty of unique assets.

Having so many characters who play differently from each other can help keep things fresh, however. It truly is a blast to try out new characters after sticking with one for a while. I wish Cygames could've managed to incorporate these unlocked characters in the main story more prominently, beyond just a line of dialogue here and there. It can feel jarring for the narrative to revolve around Gran/Djeeta while most players are a character whose existence isn't acknowledged by them or the cast. Not making the main story playable in co-op was also missed potential. 

For Cygames' first AAA effort, it's still excellent. I don't play gacha games, but this succeeds tenfold in convincing me that their world is cool and worth exploring in other games. Hopefully they keep the momentum going with Project Awakening and Garnet Arena (I'm more skeptical about that one with its mention of being multiplayer-focused).",1706910358,1706951072,True,2,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Lots of fanservice for players already familiar with GBF
-Multiplayer is a fun variation on classic 4-player monster hunting, with hints of God Eater/Toukiden.
-The character growth is expansive, characters get be up to lvl 100, weapons can be even higher (200?)
-There sigil equip system is the avenue for playstyle customization that works with every character to an extent.

Cons:
-If you're trying to get to multiplayer quickly it's going to be a slog to start.
-Currently multiplayer is region-locked, although you can match steam download regions if you want to match with specific friends.

It is decently long and reviewing this as just an action singleplayer experience alone with the amazing setpieces, stellar bosses, and music is well worth it in my opinion (even if the story is generic). You do NOT need to be familiar with the source material to enjoy it. Straightforward, fun, and just an overall enjoyment of a ride.
Go on Hard, don't grind, and enjoy a great singleplayer campaign that goes crazy fun mid-late. 8.5/10.

As for the combat, it is fun and while the overall plot is pretty generic, many of the action sequences are actually varied and keep the game feeling fresh unlike other games. You are also encouraged to use various characters and while that is great, one flaw would be that some character kits feel a lot more empty or one dimensional, leading to them feeling a lot more boring to play vs. others. This is especially bad considering aside from the main roster these other characters require an earnable-through-progression ticket to unlock and so if your first pick was one of the boring ones it might feel like a slog. This is alleviated when you get to the later bosses both in terms of getting more characters as well as the bosses themselves which are insanely fun but I can definitely see some people getting frustrated if they were to pick a boring character. Each character's skill tree is also relatively short with branches only giving absurdly minor adjustments like 2% differences as you work you way down and as mentioned already some characters might have fun skills while others just get generic buffs/debuffs or non-interactive/flashy skills.

Overall though the game is great just in terms of its singleplayer story experience. Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves boss focused games or action hack n'slash. And if you aren't that kind of person and feel like you will never play the game even if it goes on sale later on--do yourself a favor and listen to the boss OSTs at the very least.

Since finding the fix (Process Lasso or disabling E-cores), I can say that the game is actually really good. The fights are cinematic, and as someone who played the mobile game extensively, the callbacks to the mobile game are really well done. I feel fanserviced. The combat feels good, and playing co-op with friends is a lot of fun. Gameplay loop is less a traditional JRPG and honestly closer to monster hunter - the main story quests are just there to unlock the next set of co-op quests. It's just a shame that there were technical issues at release. A patch just came out which seems to solve the issue for me too, so I'd say it's probably safe to pick up.

The game itself, however, is fantastic. It handles well, feels well-balanced despite it being a party-based action RPG. Everything looks, feels, and runs incredibly smoothly, giving off a feeling of polish and the overall quality that  is sorely lacking nowadays.

- Animation (Good)
- Combat (Great)
- Gameplay (Great)
- Features and Mechanics (Amazing)
- Characters (Great)

Cons:
- Dialogues (Very Worst)

combat and you can't really pay too much attention on what they're saying. If I were a guy who is
fighting a dragon, do you think I would keep talking while in combat? *sigh
- Animation Acting (Bad)
- Common Sense (Lacking)
- Voice acting in English (Bad)

Was not only able to launch first try after the update with no issues, but I was able to play all the way through to the end of the first major boss with no crashes despite viewing multiple cut-scenes. Will keep the old review below just in case a shit launch is enough reason for you to not want to buy a game.

Was having a good time with the game (when I could actually get it to launch) until I hit a cut-scene crash in Chapter 1. The fact that I had to:

1) Launch the game as an admin.
2) Launch it in DX12 mode.
3) Disable every overlay (Steam, Discord, NVidia).
4) Disable my controller until AFTER it hit the start screen.
5) Not touch ANYTHING until the start screen showed.
6) SOMETIMES have a THIRD PARTY PROGRAM launched (Process Lasso) just to MONITOR the game to get it to launch.

Just to get the game going is absolutely bonkers. There's a ""Known Issues"" post and MAYBE a patch coming this weekend, but until they get their stuff together I'm gonna have to say your time and money is better spent elsewhere.

IF the game actually works, you've got a great game with fun, fluid combat, enjoyable characters, a great dub (if you're into that kind of thing), and plenty to do if you've got friends to play with. Gives some Monster Hunter-esque vibes where you can launch quests from a vendor in 4 player co-op and fight off hordes of baddies, kill giant raid bosses, etc. etc.

Further impressions: so i think i was in chapter 4, and you know what this game is wickedly solid at giving you immersion.  it involves you in action that it could simply put in cutscenes.  not trying to spoiler much but your on an airship, and chasing another airship, theres other airships attacking, you have to board them take them out and escape. it was a wickedly thrilling and tense sequence and i think it really solidified the game as a seriously good one in my mind.

After finishing the main story (that 20 hours  is a joke i did it in ten? what makes it take longer?) the ending, really drags, theres a slog of huge boss fights, and well sheesh that can be punishing when its, like a dozen or so of them, perhaps more. SO YEAH that was kinda tedious to do all at once. anyway though, you get a nice wrap up and intro into the end game, the entire game is above satisfactory. as a person that never had even heard of the franchise this game made a good handshake to it. not that i would ever get invested in anything besides this game, but you get the sentiment.

[h3]Technical issues[/h3]
- Game freeze (or black screen) after see Cygames Logo, If there is an input key
- Some cut scene will make game crash if playing the game with borderless
-----------------------

Remark: I comment toward this game as a veteran player of mobile version. and also mainly play this game in Japanese because I know about issue about localization.

[h3]Main story[/h3]
I complete the main story in 12 hrs with a few side quests complete.
Main story lore is not interest. It just about power of [spoiler]friendship[/spoiler].

[h3]Good points[/h3]
- I have good first impression to the game visual that original web browser game with 2D visual can be transform into 3D Action game. No problem in lag spike or frame rate drop during heavy combat.
- The most fun parts are in quest board which use player skill only (assist mode does not allow in this content). 
- All characters are polished to have specific command button and play styles that player need to learn one-by-one.
- Cygames will add new update free contents as announced in road map and I believe there are more after the third update.
- AI likely play better than you.

[h3]As good as mobile[/h3]
- Signil (or Skill system) is similar to mobile version not complex
- End game contents are beyond level 100 while character max level is 100
- Grind hard (welcome to the rice field.)
- All quest boards are session quests, pickup the quest and facing the boss directly without exploration.

[h3]As bad as mobile[/h3]
In short, English localization still bad as same as mobile version.
- Chapter title between JP and EN are completely different.
- Some dialog talk mistranslate to something else.

[h3]Bad points[/h3]
- Boss combat flow is quite redundant (Boss appear -> No overdrive -> Overdrive -> run for your life without fightback -> Break -> no overdrive -> ...)
- No AI command for what they have to do specifically.

[h3]The worst points[/h3]
- Camera is the worst. For examples, The camera keep focusing the boss instead of incoming attack ground areas. The camera focusing at bad angle that make vision hard to estimate distance of incoming range attack
- In town navigator is useless, no information about distance to NPC just show up icon and let player find byself.
- Cannot change or remap for controller buttons
- Region lock in multiplayer and I cannot matchmaking.
- Some board quests are difficult or likely impossible to obtain max rank with solo play.
- All flying boss fight are not fun.

[h3]Etc.[/h3]
- During choice choosing in main story, Djeeta always has only one face expression.

-----------------------
[h3]Recommend decision[/h3]
Overall, I give recommend to this game.
- If you dont care about game story or you care only action part there is fine since the story is not attractive much.
- In case you interest the lore but cannot read japanese, you will confuse a lot because of bad English localization.",1706941022,1706941096,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The issues being:

- Frequent crashing especially during/after cut scenes: Had a situation where I had to beat a certain boss 3 times because the game kept freezing during a cut scene which I fixed by making sure I instantly skipped that cut scene the moment it showed and another where you couldn't skip the credits of the game because it would lead to a crash.

- Random Matchmaking takes forever to find a group: I feel like something like this shouldn't happen considering the game just came out. It would be great if they added an option to look at all available missions that are looking for a player to join them (i.e. SOS in MHW)

IT'S NOT ALL BAD THOUGH

- The boss fights are amazing and well thought out! Really enjoyed every encounter I had in the game

- The character roster is quite varied. With the amount of material they have to work thanks to the mobile game, I hope they bring a lot more characters in the pool we already have

- Story was short and sweet and it might be pretty simple and predictable but I enjoyed it nonetheless

- The environments are absolutely stunning and the fact that we don't get a map might be seen as a con but It promotes exploration and it personally made my experience quite enjoyable thanks to the little things I discover around the world


Overall, I feel like a lot of these issues were caused by problems with optimizing the game for PC players or it might be an issue with their servers.

I hope they fix all the problems so I can change my review :) GOOD LUCK CYGAMES!

this review is posted on Feb 1, 2024; at the time of writing i only give this game a thumbs down due to technical issues and would otherwise recommend it given future patches fixing current issues.

I can not in good faith recommend this game at the moment, not because i don't like it.

when the game runs, it's an extremely good time, with a lot of care put into the audio-visuals and general gamefeel. Progression seems like it will feel nice, gameplay is intuitive and feels good all around, with elements of the phone game it originates from being plentiful in ways that are well implemented.

however, at the time of writing, the game took roughly 30 minutes of effort to get to even boot past logos and even then it's a coin toss on whether or not it loads properly after that. Even still, after you get into the game you are at unknown risk to crashes that [seemingly] originate from cutscenes. all of the community ''fixes'' are  grasping at straws at best, some working for some others not. 

i'd say approximately an hour of my ''playtime'' is likely just wading through the game being unresponsive. That, on top of multiplayer region lock on *specifically* the steam port of the game is more than enough to hold off on buying.

the only other con i have at this time is a mild gripe with localization. I personally don't care if localizers take creative liberty on phrasing given that the original intent / 'vibe' of a line or character writing is retained or elevated in some way, it's innocuous most of the time. In this game it feels like localization occasionally loses the original 'tone' conveyed, but it's not a make or break thing.

tldr; if you wanna spin the wheel on whether or not you will have playability issues, it's a real good time. Otherwise don't risk it until Cygames puts out a patch that demonstrably fixes the above.

This game is pure fun and a must play for anyone who enjoys a pure and clean action rpg!
The story keeps your attention even if it's a bit cliche in some ways but the real meat of the game is the action and everything surrounding it!

The bosses are some of the most fun and badass bosses I have ever fought in a video game! The spectacle of the bosses, their attacks, their music all of it is AMAZING and so damn fun to play against!

But all of that would mean nothing if it wasn't for the fluid, responsive, and most of all stylish actions you can preform with the many characters this game has on offer. Every single character plays uniquely from one another, with a different style of play for each of them! My current favorite is a character named Zeta who uses a spear and can loop bounce on any enemy infinitely as long as she lands the attack and you time the next one correctly, it is so damn fun!

After you beat the story there's a pretty hefty endgame grind if you're looking for it with some new bosses and some revamped bosses from the story to fight, as a big player of games like monster hunter and warframe i have been absolutely hooked to it. Though thats in large part to the stellar gameplay and unique styles of play the characters in the game have on offer which makes sure I'm never bored.

All in all I highly recommend this game, it is beyond fun and I look forward to every piece of content that they will eventually add to the game in the future!",1706937389,1706937389,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Really fun for GBF fans with lots of fun and even more fanservice.
- Beautiful artstyle by Minaba Hideo (as usual) that captures the essence of GBF's universe.
- Engaging hack-and-slash gameplay, and I hate the HnS genre, so that's great.
- I really like the raids, they remind me a lot of a cross between MonHun and FFXIV.
- Incredible Music. the soundtrack elevates the overall gaming experience.
- Draws parallels with Dragalia Lost (RIP), offering a similar vibe to its midgame and endgame content.

Cons:
- Crashes during loading up to the main menu if you do as much as click a single button lol. and also after Chapter 1's cutscene.
- Platforming puzzles reminiscent of FFXIV, the bane of my existence.
- Auto-targeting issues with LT, which makes you unable to rotate the camera when locked on to something. trying to rotate with the right stick instead swaps target. This means you might swap to targeting a wall lol.
- Assumes players are already familiar with GBF's universe, which may be confusing for newcomers as some characters kinda just don't tell you anything and assume you already knew how you met etc.

final note:
Ignore the localization complaints; they're blown out of proportion. The game is perfectly enjoyable, and those nitpicking should calm the hell down, it's not that serious lol. Learn Japanese if you want to read the Japanese script and take a shower.

If you are someone who loves to min/max this game is for you. It has a Monster Hunter vibe during the endgame where you simply queue up to fight stuff to grind mats and get levels. 

Would love to see more content for endgame added in the future other than grinding. However, I am satisfied and will likely max out my favorite character before I put this on the shelf.

If you're thinking about buying this game I highly recommend looking into Tales of Arise. It has a significantly longer (and arguably) better main story at around 60 Hours on hardest difficulty.

For people looking to get the most out of their money i'd refer them to Arise.

The game has whole new storyline, so you don't need to play the mobile game to understand the story. The game also recap character backstory and lore nicely in non intrusive / artificial way.

Pros(+):
+ 18 Playable character with their own moveset and mechanic.
+ Quite wide variety of how you want to build the character.
+ Engaging boss battle with unique moveset.
+ Cutscene story isn't just bunch of character standing and talking(like g*nsh*n).
+ Good gameplay loop with ""Monster hunter""esque mission based hunt.
+ Available in english and japanese voice.

Grey(*):
* Early game is quite slow, let it cook for atleast 2 hours.
* Not much of customizable look except for color palette.
* Unlocking character let you to skip grind as they're unlocked around your party level.

Cons(-):
- Performance dipping hard on some hardware.
- English translation is inaccurate with japanese voice.
- No native controller rebind option, even though it's made with controller in mind.

While the game is very good and really worth the full price, special edition on the other hand is really not worth it. As it gives booster material, color palette, and 1 weapon only MC can use.

Haven't played it much but wanted to push reviews up for the weekend. For those coming from typical jrpg experiences, there isn't the typical issues you would expect in eg ateliar or neptunia, or even ff. Character design is awesome as always, you get 5 travel companions to create a party of 4 (incl you) for, the characters are actually decent in combat, with healers and aoe mages and etc. Limited skill points that you can use to boost yourself or your team mates (and they actually contribute to the fight so investment isn't wasted). You can jump over terrain cliffs and etc, and attack mid-flight holds your character position, so you can hit air targets. Character combat ai is surprisingly decent, I can trust my healer to keep me alive for instance.

Cutscenes are short and skippable but it's so good I watch them, which is really rare. Town interaction is fun, characters each have their own personality. Combat has link skills and your spells deal sufficient damage to make it worthwhile to use them but with a cd long enough to not spam. I did not come from a granblue background (think I played their mobile game tho) but the story is well introduced without being too naggy. 

In other words, this is as good as if not better than the latest ff, or whatever you choose to put your jrpg benchmark to be. Totally wasn't expecting it to be that good tbh. The dlcs just shorten the initial grind a little, up to you whether you want to go for them. 

To developers, the scene hangs a little when you combat ult, and the top level of mouse sensitivity could be higher, I'm maxing it out but I just wish it's a bit more sensitive.",1706933212,1706933212,True,0,0,0.478723406791687012,0,True,False,False

I bought this game after thorough research on if this game would be the ""type"" of game that I would enjoy. I enjoy games with cooperative battles, stand-out characters, and a bit of grinding. I really enjoyed games of the likes of Castlevania: Harmony of Despair, Warhammer Vermintide 2, and Monster Hunter World. I would thoroughly recommend this game if these things fit your gaming enjoyment. 

This game out-shined my expectations. All of the characters feel great to play and have a decent story behind them. Each one stands out. You also do not need to pull for any characters in a gacha format. All of the characters are made available to you right off the bat/by progressing the story. Speaking of that - the story is fantastic. The battles were memorable and the graphics/visuals were pleasing. I was also pleasantly surprised because I had read many reviews that the game was rather short. I found it to be a good length when playing on Hard mode. This is the type of game I wish received live service. Continuation of the fantastic story with additions of new characters and fights would be awesome. They could progress this story even further and keep adding new content making this game stand against popular games like Genshin Impact. If they keep their design/marketing/selling choice as well - this could become even better than those titles because people do not need to gamble for their characters. 

Regarding the functionality of the game - I encountered few to no bugs (at least, i never noticed or remembered any.) I also encountered no crashes or startup issues which some players said that they had. The game ran smoothly for me, however I do have newer end hardware. 

If you are on the fence about buying this game, I recommend that you pick it up. This game is even more fun with friends but - be warned - the story mode is only single player at the time of this review. The cooperative play comes later where you rematch bosses, play events and trials, and obtain more loot and drops.

Even though the Playstation version doesn't have region lock and allows you to pick your region in game whenever you want. There is a temporary fix, by going into steam settings and download settings, and then changing your download location to that of the location you want to play with.

Happy to support this move because I always found their character ip endearing and gameplay fun.",1706926186,1706926186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

cons: i want every character to lose their vocal chords as a mod and i want them to also not bother to learn sign language, as none of them have anything of value to say at any point in the game.

the story at least makes sense, but i truly cannot be bothered to care... the story interrupts the fantastic gameplay, the fights rule so hard. i love it for the fights, but god if i could just erase the story entirely i'd be happy.

+Better version of the browser game mechanics(especially character acquisition)
+Graphics justify modern hardware(one of the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen but that's most likely because of the art direction).

-Gameplay is more casual than its competitors( though thats a good thing for some)
-Not enough characters at launch( 5 per element was ideal)
-Lockon system is an afterthought
-The grinding mechnics carried on from the mobile game
-Criminally inaccurate Japanese to EN translation for subtitles(no h8 on the english dub voices)

review ในส่วน 20-25 ชม ในเการเล่น โหมดเนือเรื่อง

นิยามของเกมนี้  คือ hack and slash  ในรูปแบบ Party 4 คน    ที่ผสมรูปแบบเกมเพลย์หลายๆแบบเข้ามา   

จุดเด่นของเกมนี้
-กราฟิค งานศิลป์  สิ่งแวดล้อม  ทำออกมาโคตรดี
-ตัวละครเท่ๆ  เยอะมาก  มาพร้อมกับ  Move set แตกต่างกัน
-ระบบพัฒนาตัวละครแบบ   RPG   ที่ผู้เล่นสามารถ อัพสกิล  อัพเกรดอาวุธ และมีbuild ให้เลือก หลายแบบ  
-ระบบทีมแท๊คติค  ต้องมีการวางแผน เซท  ติดตั้งสกิลก่อนลงภารกิจ  
-ระบบล่ามอน และรวบรวมของ มาอัพเกรด
-ระบบ coop  online 4 คน
-ระบบ แพ้ทาง ด้วยธาตุ  และการต่อสู้กับบอสสุดมัน และอลังการ
-ระบบภารกิจที่มีประมาณ 6 รูปแบบ ให้ผู้เล่นได้เล่น
-ระบบ ช่วยเหลือผู้เล่นที่อยากสนุกกับเนื้อหาในเกม   แต่เล่นเกม  action ไม่เก่งตัวเกมก็มีระบบ Ai มาช่วยเล่นแทนแต่ผู้เล่นยังต้องบังคับการเดินไปมา  และใช้ได้แค่ระดับความยาก ธรรมดา

Gameplay หลักๆ
ตัวเกมจะให้ผู้เล่นเลือก  ตัวละครในทีม มาจัดตั้ง Party 4 ในการทำภารกิจ  และลูกทีมแต่ละคนจะมีความสามารถแตกต่างตั้งแต่
combo  สกิลโจมตี  , passive และธาตุ   เมื่อเซททีมเสร็จผู้เล่นก็เอาทีมไปลุยภารกิจ  เมื่อจบภารกิจ และจะได้สิ่งตอบแทนมา  เป็นเงิน  exp  แต้มสกิล   ไอเทมอัพเกรดอาวุธ  และอุปกรณ์เสริมพลัง แบบสุ่ม   ตัวเกมจะให้ผู้เล่นทำภารกิจ ไปเรื่อยๆ เพื่อปลด lock level และเนื้อหาใหม่ๆ   โดย mission ที่เตรียมไว้มีประมาณ 6 ประเภทเช่น  จัดบอส  ป้องกัน   เอาตัวรอดมอนเตอร์เป็นเวฟ 

ระบบความยากและความลึกของเกม
ในการต่อสู้  ผู้เล่นต้องวางแผนตั้งแต่เลือกสมาชิกในทีม และจัด Gear item  ให้เหมาะกับภารกิจที่ลง  เพราะมอนเตอร์จะมีการแพ้ทางธาตุแตกต่างกัน   ความเร็วในการจัดการมอนเตอร์จะส่งผลต่อ  Rank ในการจบมิชชัน   และบางภารกิจก็ต้องมีจอมเวท ทีมีสกิล AOE หรือ CC ไว้จัดการมอนกลุ่มใหญ่  ถ้าผู้เล่นจัดทีมแบบตีประชิดหมด เอาโดนหลุดจนเควสล่ม หรือได้ Rank น้อยตอนจบภารกิจ   


ข้อเสียที่เจอตอนนี้
1.bug  จอดำหลักจบคัทซีน เจอ 2 ครั้งแต่เล่นจบ  ทำให้ต้องกลับไปเล่นใหม่อีกรอบจาก Save ล่าสุด  
2.bug  เข้าหน้า title game ไม่ได้ เจอ 1 ครั้ง   แก้โดยการรีคอม
3.ระบบวิ่งเก็บกล่องที่น่าเบื่อ   การของรางวัลที่ได้
4.ระบบ  บอสลับตามฉาก   ที่ทำเพื่ออะไรไม่รู้ในตอนต้นเกม  มันดูไม่ค่อยสมดุล     มันควรในรอบ Replay หรือไม่ต้องมีก็ได้  เ


สรุปสั้นๆ    เกมเพลย์แมมโคตรมัน  กราฟฟิคและดีไซน์ตัวละครโคตรเท่   เนื้อเรื่องแบบ The Movie มาเป็นของแถม  

 คะแนน 8.5-10   ให้แค่นี้ก่อน  สำหรับ 20 ชม

This game is stunning especially in the audio/graphical department. Game play is snappy and fun, on hard I've had a couple of fights that actually were tough and engaging but in my estimation never felt unfair and annoying. I understand that this game has been crashing for some people and that's a real shame, hopefully the devs buckle down and fix those issues so people can enjoy this game as much as I have. I really hope the devs keep updating this game and they actually promote this game harder. I think that this game is (so far) a great and enjoyable time at this time I could absolutely recommend but I will say read the negative reviews in regard to the potential crashes. I cant say much about the mp aspect of the game, i haven't engaged with that portion yet but my first impressions still stand. Fun time so far!

The story seems like a continuation of the anime, so I was a bit confused with the story until I watched the anime. The multiplayer team synergy being important is also a plus with how you can bring unique skill, and move around sigils to suit your playstyle. So many characters to choose from. Potion being replenished each fight is so convenient. Super cute emoji and players interactions. The downside i have seen so far is the clunky camera (will get used to it eventually but still annoying), and the search online party still have connection issues sometimes. Would be nice if they implement voice chat as well.
