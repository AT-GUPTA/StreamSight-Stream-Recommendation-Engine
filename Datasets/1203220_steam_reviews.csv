I STILL suck at this game but it's enjoyable.

Takes a bit to understand the fluidity of combat as it'll come off as clunky at first, once it settles in you'll be in for a good time.

There's a few downsides to this kind of combat and it's because it's a BR and has combat mechanics resembling that akin to a fighting game, the netcode is infuriating and may leave you in distraught. Ping plays a huge part in this game and if yours is over a certain threshold (100+) it becomes more of prediction than it is reaction since your actions won't correlate 1:1 with what affects the other players. 

It's a very difficult game, nothing wrong with that; Say you're not a fan of studying mechanics, then its likely preferable to enjoy it for what it is. Play when you're in the mood for the gameplay provided and don't dig too deep.

If you decide to invest, there's a lot of guides online that can teach you how to do the stuff you see high-end players performing. As I mentioned earlier this game is ping based, its also FPS based as some things are simply impossible at lower FPS (~200).

Overall rating I held on release was 8/10; Today I feel 5/10 simply because netcode.

But wile I will recommend this game to everyone for years upon years. I have to be honest. With 1000 hours so far i have experienced this game have Huge ping or tick rate issues. before it wasn't to bad to deal with from time to time. tho annoying I have found ways to deal with it and become even better from it.
for those who want to know i`ve been in astral 2 before and was stuck due to having too many matches where my average score was higher than the entire lobby giving me less points even if i fought in the castle, doing the challenge when it spawns and coming 3rd 2nd or 1st. no complaint on that.
But to continue my main point. 24 Entertainment needs to desperately fix the ping or tick rate issue. 2 days ago, i have been experiencing way more inconsistencies. as a matter a fact its so bad now i`ve become so afraid to engage in fights because i`m not sure what could cause me to lose the entire fight. for context. there are times i will hit someone who clearly should get hit stunned, ignore damage and normal attack me, i have clips that show them not even glow blue to avoid the stagger and i have been losing that way frequently recently, another issue is that way more of my combos at 20-45 ping will fail and i have to be making new combos that work on higher ping players. with the risk of having more inconsistent movement. all of this is just a small portion of what i`ve had to deal with wile trying to be really good at the game.
why is it that people who have higher ping have a higher advantage over lower ping players. this NEEDS to be addressed. i have reached my limit. this needs to be fixed. until this gets fixed i will not change my review. i`m just one person but i`m sure a lot of people who have this way worst than me. PLEASE fix this. its terrible.

lastly there are times where the game with lag out for no reason especially when you load into a match and its at 144fps but then drops to 12fps or lower when you look at a specific player or players. like what even is that. if i restart my game mid match all lag goes away. is there some memory issue with the game? how long is this going to keep happening. and its not my pc. i had a friend buy parts to make his new pc, experience the same issue and upon restarting the game is back t normal.

I will make a video about this showing all the issues with analysis to back up my points and i wont stop till they see these issues.",1708832778,1708836791,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

This title stands out as a unique and innovative gaming experience, from its combat mechanics to its graphics, creating a distinct and captivating gaming journey.

First and foremost, the unique combat system of Naraka: Bladepoint is something I cannot overlook. The perfect blend of martial arts and traditional weaponry makes each battle intricate and highly strategic. The developers have crafted a tight team and opponent system, from precise strikes to ninja-like maneuvers.

The graphics in Naraka: Bladepoint are a true work of art. The expansive world with diverse landscapes, from towering mountains to ancient towns, is authentically and beautifully portrayed. The realistic play of light and shadows creates a vibrant and stunning canvas every time you step into the world of Naraka.

One of the most distinctive and noteworthy features of Naraka: Bladepoint compared to other games is the ""Grapple Hook"" system. It's not just a handy tool for movement but a crucial part of the strategy. Mastering the Grapple Hook can put opponents in challenging situations, leading to thrilling and dramatic action sequences.

While the game has its standout qualities, it's not without minor flaws. There are issues with balance in some characters and weapons, occasionally resulting in unfair situations in battles. However, the frequent updates from the development team help improve and fine-tune the gaming experience.

In summary, after 918 hours of play, I still find Naraka: Bladepoint engaging and passionate. The combination of a unique combat system, excellent graphics, and intense atmosphere creates a game worth playing and experiencing. Naraka: Bladepoint is not just a game; it's an adventure that immerses players in a beautiful and captivating martial arts world.",1708455313,1708455313,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

In general battle royal is a fun aspect for me, but having the abilities to fight with swords and different abilities is quite fun!

Is it hard to understand the game? no, took me maybe 10-15 minutes to understand fully what I am doing yet I HAD and still have fun playing, manage to get first place in two matches (did quick match, my guess some are bots? can't really tell, yet some are players for sure, you can see the skins and outfits and so on). 

However, and this is minor I guess, connection can be a problem sometimes so make sure you have a stable connection without something that can effect it (don't browse or download anything while playing), also I advice a good PC, because the game is still taking a lot. 

So overall ? I love it, graphics are great, sound is good, weapons and the whole system is fun, I guess some heros are overpower yet it make sense, almost every game has this issues (Call of Duty with stronger weapons, StarCraft and so on).

1. The abilities, buffs and weapon attack types are way too confusing to be a casual game and the lack of skillbased elements in the game makes it way less skillbased.
2. Unpolished game graphics and server (lag) wise.
3. Too many claimable's to the point where it's confusing (basic gacha style interface which I don't support)

THE LONG VERSION:
I recommend it since it's free, BUT only if you don't take it too seriously. This game has an extremely cool concept and I love the art style of it, however it's sadly executed poorly.

It's as if the game is in beta because it's extremely unpolished. It's graphics isn't optimized well enough and a little laggy on the server side. There is also way too many ""rewards"" to claim to the point where I'm not sure what I should prioritize to level up etc before the next match, it's just too confusing.

And my biggest problem with the game so far is that it's competitive, that's fine nothing wrong with that. But if you are going to make a ""competitive"" game, I think it's important that RNG is minimized, but more importantly not having any indicators on what mistakes you did that led to your death, never teaches you how to actually improve. For example I died a couple of times where i thought I could parry an attack, however it did not work. I didn't get a single indicator nor learned why I couldn't block that attack from the tutorial. I still have no idea if it was a hitbox problem, just lag or something else.

I hyped this game up for a while. I knew I should have stayed away from this title. Putting hope into early access games is always a gamble. No cross save, some elements of cross-play however unable to have clans(clan members must all be on the same platform) Xbox keeps giving me free money for the game, and the devs say i have to pick one account or the other. Again, super anti consumer. Major bummer.





This game is amazing. It would be cool if there were more US servers, with better ping; usually around 30-50. The Hard Bots, are bad enough to feel great about yourself, but not quite good enough for higher level practice. The fact that the XP gains are in bot matches is sweet, as who knows what kind of player base this game will hold.. With the game now on GamePass though, there has been a nice surge. I purchased on a sale, and have now spent some IRL$ to make the cost difference to MSRP. I have recommended the game to some people, and they have enjoyed it. Hopefully this game gets the full support it deserves. Could be the next Warzone, or fortnite, or even a solid choice in the MMO and MOBA spaces. Major potential!

Update after many more hours:
It would be nice to have cross save. At the very least, it would be cool if clans could be cross platform. One is able to play cross plat, but just no clan progress

Update, per steams request.
It would be nice to share clans across platforms. At the very least.",1645894055,1707420845,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From its precise timing needed for counters to overall gameplay, it is fun. I love the intricacy of the skins and map as it is immaculate. I have played this game for multiple years and always end up coming back to play. There are some problems though, mainly targeting the in-game purchases. 

In battle royales that I have played across the many years, NARAKA by far has the most expensive in-game purchases. You are guaranteed an ""Exclusive Item"" after opening 100 chests in the Treasure Pavilion, which costs up to 184 USD (pretty insane just to obtain 1 skin or weapon skin with cool animation VE that you don't even have to option to choose which one!). This is just absurd as someone who is a student and plays this game wanting some cool cosmetic items from time to time. Plus, you are not even guaranteed a Legendary item after 10 boxes, it just resets this 10 box recurrent mechanism after receiving an epic item. So, you could just receive all epic items and not a single legendary after opening 50 boxes. Realistically, If you want to get a skin from the loot box system I suggest not to and to buy a bundle. Even Gatcha games which have immense effects on gameplay with a P2W system have cheaper bundles and prices. And if you do not spend any money in this game, it is still viable to receive an ""Exclusive Item"", but only within the Lotus or Immortal Treasures. And keep in mind that the threshold for opening boxes until obtaining an ""Exclusive Item"" is 100, and after this 100 it is not a recurrent mechanism. So, you can open 100 more boxes and receive nothing. This mechanism does say there still is a chance at receiving an ""Exclusive Item"" before opening 100 but have only seen this happen very few amount of times (the chance is 0.3% but I do not believe that). And as someone who indulges in these amazing skins and weapon skins, it is difficult to keep on playing if these items are just nearly impossible to obtain. At that point, it is just window shopping. 

(And just want to state, that I love this game and the gameplay is on a whole other level. But the Purchases are not...)

I know that In-Game purchases are optional and you may be asking, ""Then don't purchase anything if you are annoyed about the Treasure system"". Well, Womp Womp; I still am going to. But it would be nice if NARAKA could maybe think about their player base (mostly young adults) and make a treasure system that favors those who play this game on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. This game is a Chinese game so I have no idea about the market as far as in-game purchases for Chinese administrated games. But having a CHANCE, yes a CHANCE to obtain an exclusive skin that you can't even pick after 100 boxes later is ridiculous. Please at least take this post into consideration as I am sure half the player base feels the same. 

Thoughts from other players on reddit:

""Yeah, I personally never got anything pass purple rarity levels from the free lootboxes they gave me. I've been playing for atleast 10 moths. I hate lootboxes in general, but this game and the way it ""treated"" my free lootboxes was a dead giveaway never to spend. It's a shame, I love one of the costumes from Ziping Yin (a ghostly tale one) but Id never buy for that, it's potentially too much and the odds are always against you."" -Accomplishes-Big-219

""The design in skins in this game is very top tier. Like extremely high effort - not an excuse, but it makes sense why they’re so expensive. But yeah. I wouldn’t just throw money at the boxes. You’ll never get what you want when money is on the line. I’d just buy direct outfits you actually like to get them guaranteed and just play the game a lot to get the free boxes they give out. Luckily rn it’s anniversary so they’re giving out a lot of stuff and even OLDER chests!"" - Full-Composer-404

""Yeah, the prices are absurd and generally, people who play for a long time would tell you to just avoid loot boxes here altogether. That being said, it's all just cosmetics, you'll get some along the way from events and just by playing the game. You DON'T need to spend a single penny."" - seraphimax

First and foremost, I have to say that the gameplay is incredibly addictive. It might have something to do with my fondness for For Honor; however, I find Naraka to be even better and more accessible than For Honor. So, if you're a regular For Honor player, you'll likely breeze through this game. People often say that Naraka is easy to learn but hard to master, and I can confirm that if you can hold your own in For Honor, you can dominate in this game.

Now, let's talk about the graphics. To be honest, there isn't much to critique here. The graphics are pretty impressive, and the animations are smooth and satisfying, without any awkwardness.

However, the primary reason I'm writing this review is to address the server problems. Many reviews have highlighted issues with EU and NA servers, including complaints about cheaters and Chinese players seemingly causing problems. But from my experience in the SEA region, these issues don't hold true. In my 87 hours of playtime, I haven't encountered a single cheater. As for Chinese players, they play just like anyone else, and I've had competitive matches against them. They're not the gaming gods some portray them to be. Regarding matchmaking times, solo queues can take a while, but in trios, I've had match-ups in seconds, with the longest wait being just three minutes during peak times (with over 50,000 players online). In my opinion, it's unfair to condemn the game and lower its rating based solely on these issues. If I took that approach, I'd be writing negative reviews for many games that neglect the SEA region. However, I understand that developers may not consider all regions their target market.

In conclusion, would I recommend Naraka? Absolutely.
Would I recommend it to EU and NA players? I can't say for sure, as I haven't experienced their server issues myself. But, judging from the reviews, it's probably better to err on the side of caution and avoid buying it, I suppose.
Would I recommend it to SEA players? Without a doubt.

People complain about it on other forums, apparently xbox / gamepass has a setting to turn bots off but on steam we have no setting for it so it's just pure boredom.

The game itself is decent but don't bother if you are into the pvp unless you have no job / responsibilities cause it's not worth the reportedly hundreds of hours you need to put in to start seeing a decent amount of players,

>Ping compensation mechanic being abused by players playing on servers they're not meant to (There are literally combos that you can only pull off on high ping due to air attacks pushing people farther/higher to give players with high ping more time to react)
>Infinite spammable combos
>Inconsistent parries, i can only guess dependent on ping
>Lots of bots, making it unsatisfying when you can easily tell whos a bot, and realise that about 70% of players you meet in ranked matches are bots (with such a big playerbase, why do the devs even feel the need for bots past low ranks??)

If you really study the game you can usually counter the ping abuse, infinite combos and parry problems, but even if i like studying how games work, why would i want to spend so much time on finding out the minuscule details of the game code instead of just playing the game to get better, especially when I can get a better and more fair experience from other games out there? You basically need to be on the skill level of the top hundred players to be able to consistently counter ping abuse. It's a shame because i really like the idea and love action melee combat but at this point if i want a fairer competetive experience i'd rather just play some FPS. And even if i wanted to just play casually, too many people abuse the game in unranked matches too.

Combat, fight, team play is good if you play with friends.
Random team (Trios) have 3 S-group
1. Spawn Die --- spawn at risky died fast, can't do dmg and go out DC, some rank up some not (mostly Viet) and some rank player who want to decrease their rank's score
2. Safe player --- spawn far from other group, gathering, loot but not go fight until last 10 team or not help in the team's fight. Always safe their life, maybe not wrong play's style but sometimes player who joined in this team can't reborn with ticket
3. Smart's style --- Spawn not too risky, gathering some equipment, go fight and retreats for restore health and armor. This is not be more fighter but think big picture for long game. Can get better stuff before fight and on the way can go to be third party for kill both group who been fighting. Mostly player on the 3. is older than other, be patient, can wait for re-spawn and mostly can speak English. 

In ranked match, we need dmg, helpfulness for team and playtimes to rank up
If play as team you can beat other player if you solo, can fight and survive is good to team
but for someone who fight, fight, fight with nothings (armor, weapon, etc.) and dont restreat to restore
YOU'RE NOT RESILIENCE FOR STRATEGIES TEAMFIGHT

I am in ASia's server so this is full of Vietnames that always speak Viet in Voicechat not matter your name have Chinese letter, Japanese or Korea. Lack of commu with international language.

This game from China so Gacha is so bad not valuable to add money on it, SALTY (depend on you's need) 
Like other multiplayer game Men always things This is a men's game
So For a girl who wanna try just play it for fun, muted mic for toxic or play with your group that's good

Don't recommend for new player, a bit hard for practice some fighting technique.
Game Dev NOT CARE to banned toxic behavior, report function is just seasoning.

Once you start getting into higher tier lobbies, you'll find that mechanics become key. Every second of a fight is crucial, and you need to be constantly aware of what you're doing. As some might say, think of it like a fighting game. Every weapon has it's own styles, its on combos. Every character has their own unique abilities that needs to be mastered, both to fight against and with. Synergy can be key in group fights.

Overall though, it's a fantastic game and I've loved every minute of my time with it.

In the casual game modes 90%-100% of the looby is filled with bots, and I don't believe that's actually because of the supposedly low player count in western regions but due to an intentional matchmaking system putting you in bot lobbies. This would also explain why it only takes about 10 seconds queue time to get you into a match. The devs really think that playing against bots to get you ""familiar"" with the game is more fun than playing against real players on your own skill level. 

The weirdest part about it though is that the Naraka community seemingly supports this or doesn't care about it. If you mention this issue on any forum you'll get responses like ""just play ranked at least to platinum to be matched with less bots"" (note that you're still playing against mostly bots in plat too, in RANKED), or simply mentioning that you're not good enough to be matched with real players yet. Weird response considering there's most definitely other players who suck as much as me at the game who I'm good enough to fight against. And even if this wasn't the case I'd heavily prefer to get railed by a higher skilled player than fight against an actual bot in a PVP game, I bet that's the case for almost everyone.

The developers are player oriented and even the achievements are fun and reasonable to get, which is an extremely rare treasure nowadays. And basically that's it, there is not really much to say about it, [b]this game is obliviously a must-to-try without any questions[/b] a masterpiece and perfect in the current state. Congrats and much love for the studio, please stay like this forever in the future updates, having a blast with my wife and friends! 10/10

Beautiful, original, majestic, charming and so on. The first stength of this game astonishing in every way, when you first spot the great snake on the sky, as you try out every single move an excitement to your eyes, up-most perfect in every single possible way. Especially happy with the skins, both male and female heroes got every single option from the scale of cool looking badass skins to the sexy yet not revelaing enough to keep the beauty and charm. Chinese culture was and always will be on top appearance, they just have a culture of knowing everything.    [/th]

Easy to learn and hard to master, spiced up with a parry mechanism in between. The movements and comboes are easy to invoke, yet hard to use right in the thrill of the fight. Just as any perfect game should have this is the second strongest trait of this game, everyone will find joy in it. Meeting against a much more skilled player could be rather annoying and more frustrating as in other games, so I would suggest to play bot matches after midnight. Also the fact that you can costumize your own character always blows my mind, a feature so easly can be done and wins in every single game, unlocks infinite potential combined with different hairs, skins and accessories, absolutely love it.

Showdown is the part where Naraka started to expand it's wings with complete explanation of stories. Got huge PvE updates, modes and souls-like bosses. Even seasonal rouge-like events and special pass for it. Hero cultivations also gives detailed background stories, arts, skins and else. Just enough.    [/th]

The voice acting is insanely good for every hero without an expection. They even do get represented under the name of the hero, representing how much they honor the actors as they bring the characters to live, another act not really common in video game industry sadly. Naraka shows way too much good example for every other title. Also the in-game atmosphere is perfect, there is no other game where you can locate enemies this good, directions are clear, not a single distrupting noise there. Also the background musics are fire.    [/th]

Maybe the first time in my career giving 5 star to this category. This is how achivements should work. Not too many to choke on it, fun to get and achievable expectations, not a hustle at all. 90% of them is inevitable to get if you just spend time on the game. Golden standard as in every single category, this is how it should work, this is the literal meaning of what achievements should look like.    [/th]

Did buy it back in the days, and you know what happened when the game went on free-to-play? They compensated it with much more gold than the game cost, so I could enjoy freely the full extent of that battlepass. I felt so honored which other studio does this to it's players once switching to free-to-play model? I gonna help you, none. Instantly bought the extended edition to my wife and friends once they started playing and choosen to continously support the game with gold purchase. They do deserve it, perfect example of honorable asian conduct, I'm pleasured.    [/th]

this game has a charm to it that truly makes it unlike any other battle royale out there. it's also one of the most beautiful games i've ever played, with detailed and realistic scenery and incredibly intricate item skins, outfits, hairs and other equippables.
the different souljades and charge attacks and combos keep this game interesting when it comes to fighting. there's always something more to learn! however, this also makes the skill cap for this game quite high. might not be for you if you're not up for the challenge.

deducting a point because on the smaller servers there's no way of avoiding bot-infested matches, even if you're playing ranked mode :( it's not the fault of the game but something that comes with not having a larger audience in the west. hopefully that'll change as more and more people realise the unique charm of naraka: bladepoint! ^u^",1703324853,1703324853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here are a list of positives and negatives that I considered before deciding not to recommend this game. I won't mention everything, so I don't bore you, so only the main considerations will be discussed.

[b] (Notes) [/b] 
[list]
    [*] NARAKA utilises a kernel-level anti-cheat, which can access a wider, deeper range of information in your system to detect cheats.

Stay with me, I will try and paraphrase what I have read as simple as I can...

NARAKA's anti-cheat system requires you to disable two settings, VBS and memory integrity, which is used to prevent malicious code from being inserted into tasks under protection. Hence disabling such settings may be dangerous...

I have little knowledge about technology, so the websites I used for this information are listed below:
~ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity
~ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs

I just thought I would mention this before moving on.
It is completely up to you as to whether you believe this is a negative or not.

    [*] NARAKA is client-based, meaning that what you see on your monitor will always look like you have 0 latency. This leads to no rubber banding for example, regardless how high your latency is.

    [*] There is no region lock, meaning you can freely join servers from all over the planet. 

Knowing this, many players, however mostly experienced players, find enjoyment in server hopping to hunt easier prey, like me. This has been the case in my experience with the South East Asia (SEA) server.
 
I am aware that some people do find pleasure in such challenges, so again, I would imagine  that this point is based on personal preference.
[/list]



[b] Positives [/b]
[list]
    [*] The combat in NARAKA is fun to a degree.

    [*] Moving around is enjoyable, like when using the grappling hook, climbing, and sliding.

    [*] The character/hero customisation is interesting, with the ability to use AI to sculpt faces.

    [*] Though many parts about NARAKA feel similar to other battle-royales, I believe it has it's own individuality.
[/list]

[b] Negatives [/b] 
[list]
    [*] The original price for NARAKA was $29.95 AUD and now, it is free. This reflects what this game is actually worth. I'm mostly just disappointed that I had to pay for this.

I imagine the developers don't struggle with finances due to the large amount of in-game micro-transactions.

   [*] The anti-cheat itself, as intrusive as it is, doesn't seem to be working as intended. Cheaters are abundant.  

    [*] There are no Oceania servers for people like myself who live in this seemingly uninhabited area of planet Earth.

Thus, my experiences have been based on the SEA server (140 ping).

This high ping leads me to parrying, which is an issue as NARAKA is client-based, which I mentioned earlier in notes.

In short, do not bother parrying if you either have a high latency to the server or if your enemy has high latency to you.

While it may seem well timed on your monitor, by the time the data arrives to the server (high ping), your parry wouldn't have worked on your enemy. 
So from your enemy's perspective, you did not parry at all and can be attacked as if you were open.

I hope this is understandable. 

I also don't see how adding another server for Oceania players would decrease profits in the long-term. Oh well.

    [*] Steam Charts are not always indicative of the amount of players you will play with or against in-game. 
Even while there are bots and server hopping players, unfortunately queue times are still unpleasantly long (SEA server experience).

    [*] NARAKA is well optimised, if you install the game on a solid-state drive (SSD), which the game recommends
 
Playing this game on a hard-drive is awful, from long freezes to many stutters. After playing through two or more sessions, the textures and models are cached I believe and the game will return to a semi-normal state. 

So I understand we are moving into a future without HDD's, though must it be essential to have a SSD to be playable? I think I am just in denial.

    [*] NARAKA enjoys advertising their cash cow, which are in-game micro-transactions, as they are littered throughout the menus.

    [*] Lastly, NARAKA, must have difficulties in getting attention from players, as every time you exit the game, their social media profiles are shown on screen.

Please have some restraint.
[/list]

I hope this stupidly long review can be helpful for someone interested in NARAKA or for someone finding a reason to move on to something else.",1628738001,1703316831,False,3,3,0.557572305202484131,0,True,False,False

I like hard games, I like Asian aesthetic and historical culture [as well as folklore], and I like uniqueness.  This game checks all those boxes well, and I've seen the game grow in playability since it's early seasons; In fact, I don't think they even called them seasons at first.  It's not perfect, and my biggest gripe at first was that it was a game with an upfront cost as well as many micro-transaction options.  The game is now free to play, however, and you unlock legendary skins/items every now and again from just playing, as well as offering ways to unlock playable characters of your choice with in-game currency.

When mentioning this game in conversation, I've been met with disinterest because of it's lack of popularity as well as some off-hand racism.  I encourage all that are looking for a challenging and fun game to give it a try despite these stigmas.  I'm very glad I tried it out that first time.

Since this is an honest review, I'll mention cons as well.  I feel there's just a bit too much going on in the main menus as far as events, currencies, packages, skins, doo-dads, links, texts, ect.  I DO enjoy it to some extent, as it's a fun tribute to the Chinese culture to have festivals and events and cool little gifts; However, it's just a bit excessive of this function, to the point where I don't know what some things are because I simply want to get into a battle most of the time and not try to track down what kind of coins I just acquired randomly and what shop I can use them in.

Gameplay-wise, I have a great time.  There are some very good players in this game, and it's very important to try to pick apart what exactly they're doing better than you and try to use those skills for yourself; Which is akin to martial arts, and I think that's cool.  A high-skill ceiling for sure, BUT those that are scared of this shouldn't fear TOO much.  There is a bot mode with 3 difficulties that you can play solo or with your friends so that there is no chance of being whipped up and down by the 'Lord of the Lobby', as I've affectionately named the player you can see in the lobby before you spawn in that has a mastery rank that you can't even understand.  Piggy-backing off that point, when you play PVP, there will be bots in the mix, and you will feel great for defeating many of them; But when you meet the 'Lord of the Lobby' in that same game, your fate will likely be sealed before you realize it is he/she.  It makes you pay more attention, if anything; BUT the skill jump can be a bit of a shock when it happens.

Might I add, you can accomplish the in game quests/achievements in the bot modes.

Overall, this is one of my favorite games to play lately.  I'm a bit of a casual gamer, as you can see I don't have thousands of hours in this game, only a hundred or so; But I still find it challenging and fun.  For fans of the Dynasty Warriors series, it will feel homey but also much more polished and fluid.  If I may interject with a comparison here, there are many, many Dynasty Warriors games, and they've gathered quite a following over the years.  However, they have been much of the same game with improvements here and there on graphics, features, and playability.  This is a fresh take on a very similar concept of gameplay, polishing it up and also incorporating pvp and online co-op.  Dynasty Warriors holds a place in my heart from years and years ago, and I think looking at the two side by side grows my love of Naraka to and even higher state.

I won't give a number rating for this game or any other game, that's not my style.  Just know I like this game a lot and I think more people should give it a try.

So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do.

- awesome idea and flair to the game
- combat is quite enjoyable
- graphics are nice
- free events
- it's fun



[h1]Cons:[/h1]
Sadly some of the combat mechanics are not that well implemented. Even though it is fun, it feels quite clunky and unresponsive at times.

- Bad netcode makes combat inconsistent, punishing you for things you can't change
- Parrying as a core mechanic of the game doesn't work consistently. Succesfully parrying depends on your ping and the enemy's
    --> the parry window doesn't start when the animation starts (on your screen you parried in time but the attack goes through)
   --> Even if you parry with perfect timing, if the enemy's ping is too high, it will not count as parried
- I personally dislike the amount of stagger the combat entails in this game. If you get hit in team games, say goodbye to your freedom of movement as you will be staggered to death.
- Bots in ranked queues up until gold elo and in deathmatch
- Sometimes buggy environment interaction
- Devs don't care too much about issues voiced:  
     . No adjustments made to trios (Eg.: You will be perma stunned in 3v1 by grapple hook spam and spear spam), this is simple to fix but there has been no change since beta   
     . Complaints in their discord about the inconsistency of parries and other issues are answered with 'get good'  
     . Infinite combos that kill you from 100 to 0 without you being able to do something have been in the game since release and haven't been addressed",1628769495,1702424325,True,0,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

For that reason, I would not mind spending thousands USD to open their treasure boxes system as a mean to support their game. This is just my personal principle, e.g., if some game developer provides good gaming experience plus you made a lot, like literally, then would not mind supporting the game with my money.

However, when it comes to their treasure boxes, it is extremely frustrating and utterly disappointing, it is very arbitrary and very likely to be considered as a ''dishonest/fraudulent scheme'' in most countries. 

I am writing this based on my own personal experience. Since November 2022 to date, I have spend no less than HK$80,000 and guess what, I could not even got all season 5's red skins (incl. Fu & Ji Lanterns'). 

Further, the gaming community is getting toxic since after they made this game free for play, you have idiots everywhere arranged by the system for you, throwing all your game wasting your time. 

Since the game has become free to play, more imbeciles appeared and ruin the game experience. The developer doesnt seem to care and did nothing much which is really upsetting and dumb. Simple job but maybe their salary too low, cant brainstorm something better. It doesnt take much to punish toxic players who afk, fucks around, or even throwing the match halfway through.

But hey, no, they just focus on creating new fraudulent schemes like orb restyles? which even you spent thousands and wont get anything good.

They label me as ""esteemed guest"" what some stupid low IQ reason. The point is, for fuck sake, I got nothing being ""esteemed guest"" in the game? no special item, icon, drop rate, or anything but low drop rate and restyle for me.

Imagine at times having purchasing 600-700 treasures boxes and got not even 1 single red item.

Imagine the only time you get 1 red skin after spending more than 1000+ USD plus and what you get is a duplicated red item (which automatically turned into a useless spectral silk). 

Again, I invested because I appreciate their efforts in maintaining the game and creating new attractive skins. But if it is such a dishonest fraudulent scheme or system, this really puts me off completely.

Therefore, if you are new, my suggestion is just play it for fun since its free, and don't bother investing or contributing to the game.

My hope is that more and more people will boycott them because of their retarded fraudulent system.",1674315874,1701898559,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros- combat / fighting, World, ability to switch skin of the wep you pick up to your own, Messaging, beating up the entire lobby with nothing but a white weapon,bots

Cons- Combats (when there's a foreign player it ruins the experience of the lobby)
            it can get tiresome on your finger canceling all day if you want to be ""cracked"" like that, Bots. 


Certain things are overtuned i.e long sword, the dagger , and nun chucks ( love them tho)
Having paid for the game but the legendary skin in is a gatcha box, that you can get duplicates in. 
Put it finally added a pve mode, but the hours are limited for it, so i usually can't participate. 
Since it has a pve and pvp mode i can suggest it, but ONLY if they continue to improve it. 










In team kurami is fking stupid broken bs that heals multiple times a fight then you got tianhi the annoying running ass monk. Which makes it worse is the servers are merged some games i have 116 ping for no reason fighting eu. inputs dont work sometimes which is very frustrating. the spear you have a dumb skill which  you can't stop, that takes half your hp it super easy to use no penalties. otherwise its fun



edit: As of the game going FTP i would encourage trying it. its just with a $25 package and constant skin in the shop and dwindling player base, i could not suggest it before. it takes skill, it takes mech, or you can run around closely with friends



edit: i play this trash because i been playing it forever. but bro font do it. the f**king balances SUCKS. new heroes with gold focus talking half of your purple armor bar while healing, flying champs being able to fly and heal, zai just being able to come back and kill you from ulting only with no wep is crazy. the champs do way to much damage for no reason. champions enhance the game not flat out kill the opponent bc your dogsh*T",1631169144,1701482027,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just in the recent patch notes that will come out the day after this review, there will be much needed optimization and even if it does not perfectly fix the problem I am glad they are making the steps towards the right direction.

[b]POSITIVE NOTES:[/b]
☀ High movement
☀ Good combat mechanics (also i really like the focused melee combat)
☀ Good maps
☀ NO SBMM Thanks god
☀ You can buy old items!
☀ I really like the skills
☀ Very high skill gap
☀ Variety of modes 
☀ Super customizable characters 

[b]but now let's start with the NEGATIVE NOTES...[/b]
☀ Some items cost too much money
☀ Dumb gacha mechanics 
☀ Sometimes the netcode is horrible
☀ Zai need a look her ulti is too much you get stunned almost everytime and you can't do nothing
☀ Ranked mode need a rework when you start getting almost every match yellow lobbies ranking up became a very very long grind and unnecessary i hope they remove this mechanic...
☀ Parry incosistent, it not work properly everytime and this sucks 
☀ spyware? i don't know where this thing cameout but it's fun to see people caring about their privacy with a random game while they have installed every sort of social network in their phone and keep posting everything about their lifes, if you really care about your privacy you will not even own a smartphone.",1690651916,1700850621,True,18,5,0.525845587253570557,0,True,False,False

so from my original time of righting this review I have clocked many more hours into this game recently. I decided to give it a try once more and I'm pleasantly surprised at how much fun I'm actually having with a battle Royale game. 

the combat, the aesthetic, characters, uniqueness of each character, the customization tool for the characters, the maps, the overall Gameplay loop, and by god the cosmetic outfits are incredible. this is obviously a free to play game so there is going to be lots of micro transactions, just like any other F2P battle royale. 

recently there has been a big increase in the player base, I haven't noticed any stability or network issues. when I played it first about a year ago, there were huge problems with network issues and rampant Chinese players de-syncing everywhere on NA servers...this seems to have chilled down. I'm able to sign up for matches and get into one within 3 minutes time every time I queue.

the one thing I do want to bring up is the bot mode, you can level everything up just by playing bots, you have 3 difficulties and  the higher difficulty AI doesn't suck. I feel like I actually learned how to properly use the mechanics in the game by playing bot mode for about 25-30 hours of game time. when I started playing with real people, the first couple times you play against other players it will fill in bots, you may think you are doing incredible but after 3-4 matches you will start getting your butt kicked by other players. that is when I went back and trained in bot mode and cultivated characters, leveled up runes, etc. I've now been playing against real players in Trio mode/duo after playing medium to hard bots and It seems to have made a significant difference in how I play and use the mechanics, I understand blocking, countering, charge up moves and characters abilities. I'm not ""MLG"" or crazy good by any means, but this is one of the few games I've played where bot mode can ACTUALLY help make you better at the game.

:original review:
This game is probably the most fun I've had playing a battle royale, its a unique and original Idea.

the graphics are amazing, the character customization is awesome, leveling progression on everything is decent.

but please, never get rid of the bots and being able to level up everything playing against them, sometimes its rather difficult to get into a match, or there is to many players from other regions desycning and hacking. sometimes I just want to play and have fun while being able to level up playing against CPUs instead of dealing with people from china and EU lagging and making it hard to fight against them.",1642188365,1700842987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My Steam account was compromised, leading to unauthorized use of my account across various games, including Naraka. This resulted in a ban due to activities I did not commit. The account was used from multiple IP addresses for hacking in games like PUBG and Naraka.
After regaining control of my account, I provided detailed evidence of the breach, including records of offsite logins and the account recovery process. This evidence was sufficient for other games to understand the situation and lift the bans. However, Naraka's response was starkly different.
Despite presenting the same comprehensive evidence, Naraka refused to lift the ban on my account, citing 'technical reasons'. Surprisingly, their customer service acknowledged the situation indirectly by suggesting I repurchase the game to transfer my account information, an unreasonable proposal given the circumstances.

Issues of Concern:
Inconsistency and Unreasonableness: The refusal to unblock my account, despite clear evidence and actions taken by other game operators, is both inconsistent and unreasonable.
Failure in Customer Service: The solution offered by Naraka's customer service demonstrates a disregard for consumer rights and a lack of empathy for players who have been victims of account breaches.
Lack of Support in Crisis: As a consumer, I felt let down by Naraka's inability to provide meaningful support or understanding in a situation where my account was compromised without my fault.

My experience with Naraka has been frustrating and disheartening. It raises serious concerns about the game's approach to customer service and account security issues. I hope my experience serves as a warning to potential players about the risks involved and the lack of supportive response you might face in similar situations.
Prospective players should be aware of these issues before investing time and money in Naraka. It's crucial that a game not only provides a good playing experience but also reliable and fair customer support, which, in my case, was severely lacking.",1653918357,1700723412,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's good for challenging and engaging combat with forgiving and rewarding system placed. When you do pull off combo chains the feeling of accomplishment is there. Although cosmetics are indeed a bit more on the expensive side events make up for it allowing cosmetic items to be given for free or at a discounted price. The competitive scene is very in-depth and the skill gap can be always expanded with room for improvement. Towards the beginning of the games first arrival the controls did feel clunky, however overtime as the game has matured the controls have never felt better with the advent of how good your wifi/Internet connection is to the local server.

This has been a well-known issue ever since the game came out & even though it is rather easy to fix, they prefer to release shiny new skins instead of a long overdue region lock. It's just sad honestly, because a lot of NA and EU players stopped playing the game because of it, even though it is overall a great game with a lot of potential. I run this game with RTX 3090 Founders, 64GB RAM and i9-10900K and I must say, the optimization of this game is not the best. Personally, I can run it on Ultimate settings, but out of all the games I own it is one of very few, if not the only one that makes my CPU and GPU run a bit more toasty than it needs to be.
The game is overall beautiful and I really enjoy playing it, especially with friends. However, these are issues that you could expect to be fixed after more than a year of this games' initial release.
I will probably still continue to play the game, but there is days when it just gets too bad with the non-existant region lock, that you simply cannot enjoy the game as much.

According to the description, it's a melee-based battle royale. Although there are ranged weapons, their use is very limited. So how can you create melee situations in a genre where players are running around on large maps? The game's answer is the grappling hook, which is the main tool of mobility. I think the implementation is very impressive, it allows you to aim almost freely, you can shoot at anything while jumping or running, pull yourself towards it, and your character will dynamically grab onto any object or building element, and then you can continue climbing, jumping or attacking. The locations also support this kind of verticality. Of course, we can also hook our opponents if someone wants to run away from us. For beginners, this is probably the biggest difficulty, learning how to escape, because you need to know that you cannot hook players who are in Focus.

This is an element of the combat system, which is based on a rock-paper-scissors system. There are basic attacks that don't hurt much, but you can combo with them. You can attack in Focus by holding down the attack button or as part of the moveset of certain weapons. These are highlighted in blue, they do more damage than the basic attacks, which bounce off of them. So if a basic attack and a Focus attack clash, the latter wins. The third element is the Parry, which can only be used to counter Focus attacks, but the latter can be cancelled, for example, by jumping or crouching, and if you manage to bait out your opponent's empty Parry, you can punish it with basic attacks.

These are just the basics, the tip of the iceberg. Thanks to the uniqueness of the different weapons, the variety of different movement and attack techniques and character skills (not to mention the macro play of BR) the skill ceiling of the game is sky high and can only be learned with a lot of experience and watching youtube videos, as unfortunately the in-game tutorials are not very detailed. This has been improved recently, but it can't replace experience. This may sound scary, but I can say that learning the most basic combos and movement tech is enough to have fun and, speaking from personal experience, sometimes even to win.

The gameplay is also influenced by your choice of character. Since anyone can use any weapon, the main difference between characters is their abilities. Everyone has three standard abilities that can be used relatively often, and three ultimate abilities. You can only bring one of each in a loadout. Of course, this is not the only difference between our heroes, as each of them is a unique character, with their own story, attitude and looks. Most of them are a collection of Chinese fantasy tropes, with a few Japanese-inspired characters (onmyo mage, samurai) thrown in. Their design is almost like from a gacha game, with everyone being extremely sexy and (optionally) underdressed, but they can also be made unique with a variety of costumes. I think these look very cool and spectacular, clearly the main attractions when it comes to cosmetics. There are also additional ways to customize your heroes, such as belt, head, and back ornaments, you can change the look of weapons, the lobby backgrounds and poses, and the faces can also be customised in great detail, so everyone can create their dream waifu or husbando, or some horrible freak, whichever is your thing.

Cosmetics, and with them the microtransactions are the game’s primary source of revenue, and the devs went all in on this. There are multiple currencies, premium battlepasses, time-limited events, multiple kinds of lootboxes, daily, weekly and seasonal tasks, FOMO at its maximum. Whatever monetization tricks you can think of, this game has it. The menus are also very complicated and resemble gacha games, with lots of sub-screens and notifications everywhere. While the game was sold for money, I would have easily chalked this up as a complaint, but now that it's free, I don’t really care, but I can understand this being annoying to people. You can pick up a lot of cosmetics just by playing for free and casually though, so you won’t stay Deault for long.

The main attraction of the game is the Battle Royale mode, which can be played solo, or as duos or trios, but there are also other game modes, such as Bloodbath, which is a kind of deathmatch, or Capture the Spirit Well, which is a 12v12 objective capturing game. What's also interesting is the Campaign, or story mode, which can be played solo or co-op. Here you have separate missions, each with its own little story, cutscenes, with different tasks, and bossfights. Of course, this is also designed for multiple replays, each mission must be completed on different difficulties with different characters to get all the rewards and reach the endgame. This game mode is currently only active on weekends, but it is expanded seasonally by the devs. I really liked it, both in gameplay and story. While the narrative is pretty basic, but it was nice to learn more about the lore and characters. Unfortunately, in my experience, matchmaking in this mode on lower difficulties takes a lot of time, as most of the players are already grinding in the endgame.

The number of players has long been a problem. The game is big in China, with lots of players and million dollar tournaments, but it hasn't really taken off here in the West. Because of the small number of players, most lobbies are filled with bots, so you only encoutner human players in the last few circles. Players with very different skill levels can also end up in the same lobby too, which is also not a great experience. This didn't really bother me as a casual player, but for someone who takes competitive gaming seriously, it was a big negative. This situation is likely to improve now thanks to the game being free, but it’s hard to predict how much. It's not easy to get into the game and therefore not beginner friendly, but it also has to overcome certain prejudices. For example, many people write it off just because it's Chinese and F2P, and I've also seen the Kernel-level anticheat branded as ""spyware"", and it has received its own review bombing on Steam. Still, I see many positive reviews too and I hope the game expands. 

I'm not a Battle Royale fan, and I'm not into competitive multiplayer games either, but I did put 100+ hours into Naraka. The great movement and combat system, cool characters and spectacular fights in an interesting eastern fantasy world, and a little bit of FOMO of course, always drew me back to the game, and I don't regret the time I spent with it. If you have an affinity for BR, or multiplayer games in general, I think you should give it a try, there aren't many games like it.",1690297956,1700598069,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are quite cool but as any game, it is always advised to have graphics lowest as possible as in some big fights and due to all of the effects, it can lag you a bit and in this game having the smoothest experience is essential.

Really recommend this game but give it a bit of time when you start, it is really frustrating when you start as the game can match you with extremely experience people if you play quick play so, at the start, I recommend you practice with BOTS in easy then medium then move towards quick play and ranked for a more ""Closer to your level experience""",1700394881,1700394932,True,2,0,0.508011341094970703,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1. It's fun when it's fun, that means when buggy interaction and ping issues don't appear, but besides those external factors, the game does have balancing issues, it is what it is, and sometimes getting combo-ed to death by three people in trios can be cancerous too, but OVERALL quite fun with many different interesting weapons and heroes.
2. Aesthetics of this game are fire: maps, characters, weapons, skins, locations, scenery
3. Game's movement is satisfying and cool (武侠 Wuxia) as fuck, but can still be unpolished and make awkward movements because of the map's geometry being too complex & detailed.

Cons:
1. Game is laggy and stutters like hell, which is very detrimental to a competitive game. (My GPU is 3070ti, CPU is ryzen 5 3600, 16gb ram, installed the game in SSD too) Maybe my setup has bottleneck, but it should not be this bad, and the un-optimization is killing my interest slowly for the game.
2. Most skins look good but have no effects, and yet they charge every dollar they could get away with it, the prices are outright abusive and meant to milk us and lootbox hooh-boy is such a massive scam, never ever get drunk on this game's lootbox
3. Fucking bots needs to be removed from every game mode besides bot mode, because these bots ranges from being absolute clowns or the equivalent of playing dark souls, making inhuman plays such as 1 frame dodges & parries, which all in all degrade enjoyment as now everytime I have a thought at the back of my brain whether the guy I fought is that skilled or a hard-mode bot.",1700215239,1700216587,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Please add DLAA to DLSS 3! Frame Generation with DLSS 2 Quality Preset is very blurry (and that's the best you can currently do quality wise)! DLAA in Vermintide 2 with DLSS 3 looks crisp and sharp!

+ and update Showdown already, it's been forever since you guys added anything!

_____________

*UPD 12.06.2023:

Showdown is unbalanced and needs more attention:

- Recommended ""sense"" level is unbalanced or doesn't meet reality. You always need to be at least 50 sense lvl above the recommended to succeed. (Doom, None Shall Pass - Speedrun and Enigma Peak are almost impossible to do even with sense way higher than recommended) - and again, why are you forcing me to play it with random people if I want to play it solo!? Balance it for solo play!!!

- Showdown solo or trios with no random fill is absolutely unbalanced therefore unreal, specially with bosses, unless you're going sense lvl 500 to easy or hard.

- They simply never balanced it for solo play, never! You'll have to do the work meant for 3 players all by yourself, so it will take 3x the time :(
_

- Devs are still Cryptomining on your GPU in the main menu!? 428 Watts being pulled from my 4090 in the main menu, while mid-matches on max settings only with a peak of 280 Watts! What the F is this!? Why till now there is no fps limit options for main menu / lobby, in-match ... !? GPU usage and temps is the same thing, 90-95% usage, 68-70ºC - in the main menu, while max. 58ºC and 55-60% usage - in matches!

- Game still poorly optimized, mid-matches your fps drops to 100 (5950x overclocked, RTX4090), while in some areas you get easily 200 - 240 fps. GPU only getting 50-60% usage on max settings in matches!

- Still no DX12, no DLSS 3.0 and no Nvidia Frame Generation :(

- Mental censorship everywhere, specially in-chat, so F annoying ... sometimes you can't even communicate properly cuz of the amount of paranoid “sensitive content”.

________________________________________________________

Horrible competitive / PVP experience from launch till now Feb. 27, 2022, EU servers predominately filled with Asian players (oft VPN abusers who lag a lot, even randoms in duo or trios are losing connection through the whole match in your team ... therefore your stuff doesn't even register on similar enemies / players against you), unbalanced skill gap, players from Bronze V that die like flies (cuz they don't even know what dodge or parry is) ... face in the same match Platinum and even higher ranked lagging Asian players against them! Very oft you'll die to an epileptic masturbation 3-4 hit kill no-life player that swallowed every possible YouTube tutorial on how to be epilepticly efficient with combos (especially keyboard+mouse vs controller) ... vs a silver guy that is trying to understand the game (a silver guy dies in 3 hits from a platinum or empyrean trio player on spawn as he gets highlighted on the map because the no-life activated a bounty quest = minus reputation points for the silver guy = depression = refund or removal of the game = player base cuts in half). In addition, bad performance and big fps drops with a 3080ti and a 5950x overclocked, on any graphical settings (currently using the lowest settings for competitive and it's still very bad) The Asian invasion into the EU has been an issue since the release ... but nothing has been done yet.

I just can't believe how they queue up empyrean ranked trio players against silver ranked in solo (I faced it a lot) ... yo! If the guy's rank is so high in trios, it's obvious that you should NOT queue him against anything lower than platinum, even if the empyrean's guy solo rank is bronze 999 ... where's the common sense!? It's like putting a butcher vs. sheep in the same lobby ... Oh, let's queue him against bronze because he's bronze in solo, and we're just going to ignore the fact that he's fucking empyrean in trios!

All I see is more and more donations in the shape of very expensive skins and gambling. BUT, where are the quality of life improvements?

Very bothering cons up till this day:

- Very unbalanced PVP matchmaking (also the non-competitive ""Quick Matches"")

- 95-99% 3080ti GPU usage in the main menu (Home, Heroes and Weapons tabs), on lowest graphical settings ... Crypto Mining while the player is AFK!? GPU goes up to 75-80ºC in the main menu, while idle, are you for real? Bitcoin or Ethereum!?

- Very annoying news feed popping in your face every single day (with the majority of the time with nothing new to show), if you click on any of them accidentally — they'll open externally, in a browser. Why can't we have an option to simply disable it forever, or at least for a week!?

- Begging to follow their social media, on every game exit ... why!? We got that you have Twitter, ok? We got it ... why EVERY day!?

- Also the game still freezes / hangs for about 10+ seconds on exit. Even though it's installed on an NVMe! (while hanging, the CPU temps reach their peak)

- Despite having full screen enabled in the settings, it's actually running borderless ...

- The store is in $ U.S. Dollars globally, no regional / local currencies ...

- Still no DX12 (half a year after release)

- No region lock

...

The amount of swearing, hardware harming (broken key caps, dead mouses) and wasted nerves due to these issues was not worth buying this game (from a PVP perspective).

*Don't get me wrong, I like how the game feels, plays and especially looks on max settings, it's great! BUT, right now, PVP the majority of the time is a big unbalanced disappointment ... PVE on the other hand is extremely boring! For me, it would be a game changer if we had some 2-4 player Co-Op PVE modes, against a bigger / smarter amount of bots, Vajras, Terracota Warriors (in waves, all after you, like zombies) ... more challenging and entertaining PVE mess! It would turn the toxic PVP experience into some great time spending with friends! (because I have a feeling that competitive PVP will never get fixed).",1644024440,1698351533,False,147,13,0.797753989696502686,0,True,False,False

Is a great game, i makes you expend money for looking cute and stronger
the main reason of my negative review is....

YOU CAN GET BANNED AND LOOSE EVERTHING YOUR PROGRESS IF YOU WIN TO ANY HIGH LEVEL PERSON IN ANY COMPETITIVE MATCH  (i got banned on CLASH SEASON cause winning with random teams. with no explanation in part of customer services trying months to solve the unfaily ban, so i decided to surrender and admit that this game HAS A POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, they can't even verify if someone really used hacks, none of the proofs and time were worth it they based by ranked skill if you have a very good match they ban you, so be careful having some good games if you're going to try it, please take my advice and DON'T EXPEND MONEY INTO THIS GAME!, Have Fun",1698284167,1698284167,False,2,0,0.509703516960144043,1,True,False,False

About the game play, just like other reviews, it is a great game, the mechanics is perfect. But the design team had toss all the good stuff into trash can. No matter which style you play, you will always encounter bugs that just won't be fixed season after season. The player with high fps can physically be faster than you (180fps vs 60fps feel like you are going against sonic). Which made the team really can't notice if someone turn up hacks such as auto combo and auto parry, because those crazy ""superman speed"" move can actually be performed by high fps player. Along the side of mechanics, the lag of the game is insane, updates after updates, patches after patches, and the lag is only going worse.

The mechanism of the weapon system, especially melee weapons with various swords, means that we have to be smart in positioning, dash right and left behind, and slide forward. Overall, the focus mechanic of this weapon is the same, but the skills of each weapon in this mechanic are very different, it depends on us as players, we have to know what weapon is appropriate to use in counter, attack or defend conditions because the grip of each sword weapon here feels very different. For close combat, mid and hi combat, we have to know the timing and feel it. This is really a very difficult battle and tends to be surprising if we are hit by an opponent's combo coming behind us or locked with his grappling. We also have to be able to be similar to him through the balance of the additional talent abilities, even though we don't know what attack point the damage will be to the opponent's body. Not only talking about swords, here there is also quite a variety of weapon ranges where the bullet drop is also quite difficult to shoot because the opponent's movements are very agile and are influenced by the environment on the map.
The point is in this game, if you want to be able to compete, start learning about each weapon, then soul jade to adjust the additional abilities or skills of the weapon, and don't forget to understand the character of the hero you use. Regarding the battle map, here it is the last number, but it can be the first number if you want to run and attack, attack by surprise, or run away to hide and then get your revenge again. The message here, don't be too careless when you look at all the cosmetic/skin variants on offer, starting from the heroes and the weapons themselves which are very tempting and pleasing to the eye, your wallet may run low because this is really beautiful to have.

Maybe this is a brief review of this game, I really love this game, and it really stuck with me because of the innovation. If you like it and want me to review it more fully, give it a thumbs up and help upvote the comment..",1698132886,1698132886,True,27,1,0.729534566402435303,5,True,False,False

I've gotten multiple random disconnects when my internet connection to everything else on my PC was perfectly fine. Sometimes the game doesn't ever unfreeze and just crashes instead. Sometimes my internet browser will crash while playing Naraka and is unfixable to the point where I have to restart the entire machine. At least one of these problems is basically guaranteed if you alt tab for even a second during any loading screen. I can say with the upmost confidence that these issues have lost me at least 30 rounds, enough to make me lose count. Sometimes everything runs smoothly, but then you run into an opponent dealing with one of the aforementioned issues which ruins the experience anyways by either giving you an unsatisfying free kill, or by dying to a Chinese player on a VPN who is teleporting around the battlefield cause they have 500 ping.

These issues are frustrating for sure, but it's amplified tenfold because past all of these constant technical issues is a wildly fun and refreshing Battle Royale game.

When Naraka works, its one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences I've had in a long time. The melee combat is a much more engaging and exciting take on the BR formula than any other game in the genre I've seen. The rock-paper-scissors formula of basic attacking, focus attacking, or parrying is simple enough to understand and get the hang of while more advanced mechanics baked in like jump/crouch/dash canceling, weapon and character specific combos, and souljades that change the properties of your weapon's attacks give the battle system some much appreciated depth that keeps you playing more rounds and striving to become a better player. 

Gameplay is enhanced with 7 different characters each with unique, customizable abilities who are all unlocked for free at the beginning of the game - along with new characters confirmed by the devs to be released later for in-game currency. (Yoto Hime is only free for a limited time I think, so might not be free when you read this) With 5 different melee weapons each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, there's a lot of mechanics to learn and utilize. Of course there are still a multitude of different ranged weapons to wield, each also with their own different properties, but you wont be winning any full on fights with just these ranged options. This is because of how fast and fluid the movement in the game is. With grapple hooks and fast vertical movement a la Assassin's Creed (and actually less frustrating than AC), there are plenty of ways to reposition and maneuver around a fight and find different angles of attack.

The game is surprisingly entirely skill based, with the only aspect not being totally level at first is the glyph system - which is reminiscent of old League runes. Unlike old League runes however, it's extremely easy it is to completely max out your glyphs in Naraka with currency earned from playing the game. 

When you want a break from the BR mode, want to practice new combos and tech, or just want to de-tilt from the constant connection issues that got you killed very first 3 ranked games in a row, you can't do much better than the Bloodbath mode. This deathmatch style game mode is more fast paced and low stakes than the classic BR modes; with 10 minutes to score as many points as possible by killing as many other players as you can with the entire game's arsenal available from the start. It's an enjoyable change of pace and I hope to see more unique game modes released in the future.

When it works, Naraka is one of the most enjoyable Battle Royale experiences you can get. It's up to the devs at this point to keep me playing for a lot longer by ironing out connection and stability issues, because if left unattended for long enough it could change the recommendation of this review.

EDIT: It's been just over 2 years since I originally wrote this review and the game has changed significantly. A ton of new heroes and weapons, a new map, some interesting crossovers, console releases, and a new f2p model which probably should have been the case on release given the inclusion of a cash shop. Putting a cash shop in a game that you already have to pay for to play is a very bold move. One that I think only a handful of much more massive and popular games could get away with ie. FFXIV/WoW, but certainly not a generic looking Chinese developed online game that still has a broken translation in parts 2 years out from release.

A few side notes that I forgot to write back in 2021 was that the glyph system is redundant and functionally only exists as a coin sink. I also dislike the level of customization the game allows for these non custom heroes players can choose from. It's bad for game clarity and [i] WOULD [/i] disenfranchise any interesting design elements present in the characters the developers have created if there was any to begin with. All of these heroes are boring to look at and have almost zero personality. 

Overall, I would say the connection issues have generally improved, but not enough to significantly alter my interest in the game. The freezing is gone and the game generally loads much faster than on release, but the constant latency present in every aspect of gameplay is still extremely noticeable and taxing to the general experience. This essentially perma-lag that seems to be built into the game, possibly even by design, is still my biggest gripe and ultimately the reason this is a game I might revisit a couple times a year rather than a staple title on the top of my recently played library.

(Also as an aside, the near weekly blog posts by the developers that are solely lists of all the players they have banned that week and putting them on blast is a fucking gigachad move and I am a huge fan.)",1631048853,1697080317,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: Now that I have an additional ~100 hours into the game I felt it's time to update my review. The game left a strong first impression; a primarily melee based battle royale with good movement and still good range combat that felt balanced. That said, I've found my desire to keep playing has declined significantly, and I think it's largely due to the character abilities. The balancing there could still use work. Abilities on most characters feel either worthless or totally overpowered, there is very little in between. If there were game modes without the abilities I think that would be a good band-aid, but it's something that needs work.

Edit2: I've decided to come back and play a few games after taking a break for nearly 2 years. Now that the game is free to play, I do still think it's worth a try if you're interested (as is the case with all free games.)

I played for two hours, then never played again until recently. With getting back into it, it was easy to get into the flow of the game, get used to counters (use tutorials or fight your friends if you can make custom rooms, which I'll get to in a bit), and get the victory royale. 

It's a fun battle royale to wack people with staffs, swords, great swords, and dual blades. It's Monster Hunter but PvP, lacking monsters (you can do PvE) and Rise movement x10. If you're wondering where the Standard/Deluxe/Ultimate Editions are at since the free-to-play conversion, you can buy the upgrades in-game. Upgrading your game will give you more freedom than the F2P limitations also. For about 980 gold (about $9.86), you can play the Ranked mode at Account Level 20 instead of the 50 and create custom lobbies to play with friends. You can still join them as a F2P, but not create them. Buying characters do not have a limit also if you buy an edition.

Anyway, jump into the world of Naraka if you're tired of shooting stuff and just want to wack people. Here is my refer-a-friend code (invite code) after completing the tutorial also: chmpwqawyy",1696281134,1696281134,True,15,0,0.635284781455993652,0,True,False,False

[h2]Short Game Description[/h2]
Naraka Bladepoint is a free-to-play action and adventure battle royale game where sixty players will try to survive until they are the last survivor standing. For that, you will fight against others throughout a wide map while using different weapons as martial arts together.
[list]
[*][h3]Positives[/h3]
Discussing the positives, first of all, the game is now completely free, so now you can play this game alone or with friends, with many different game modes to choose from, giving you many hours to do different things without investing any money in it. Secondly, the gameplay is well done; it has many different unique attacks with each weapon as counter mechanics and character abilities that make the game even more exciting, requiring you to use them more carefully. Thirdly, despite the game having microtransactions, you can achieve most things by playing and completing quests.
[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]
On the negative side, the most notorious problem is that the game takes too much time loading textures if they're not on SSD (it's stated in the game, so they warn you in that aspect). It is somewhat disappointing in comparison to other games that can do the same but faster. Besides that, if you purchased the game previously, the reward you get for purchasing the game was somewhat disappointing; they could've been more generous. Too, the game feels somewhat messy; it feels like they spammed pile loots throughout every spot, achieving, with that, a map with a wide amount of useless loot. The last problem I have found is that the interface has too much information on screen in some sections of the game, which feels a bit complex to understand and, at the same time, unnecessary, especially when you are looking to upgrade your characters.
[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]
To sum up, Naraka Bladepoint is a good game that has good mechanics and makes the experience enjoyable as you learn, but the main problem is that the game feels somewhat overwhelmed by unnecessary interface elements that sometimes make the learning of the game difficult, and you need an SSD to play this game or you will suffer at the start of the game. The game is a 7.25/10.",1696243119,1696243119,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are layers game that I just won't ever understand.

Gameplay: Difficult as nails to get the mechanics down, but so damn satisfying when you do. But even then, there's always someone who knows the mechanics much better than you and annihilate you. I'll never fully comprehend the mechanics.

Costs: The game costs money. Okay, fine. But then you see that the game also has Free-To-Play systems in place. Battlepass, cosmetics, unlockable characters, etc. Why does it cost to play but also have microtransaction in-game as well? I'll never understand

Matchmaking: As per above, the mechanics and learning curve wouldn't be a huge problem.... if I matchmaked with folks on my level. Instead, I get matchmaked with Chinese players who know how to cancel moves and pull off insane 1-shot combos.... The skill gap is very evident and I just don't understand how.

Enjoyment: Despite what's mentioned, the game is actually stupid fun. When you can string a combo yourself and read your enemy's attack before they can pull it off, it's madly satisfactory to down them. The character customization is also top notch, the same level as what you'd get from an RPG (Skyrim, Cyberpunk etc.). You can make your player look yourself if you really want that. It's just difficult to fully recommend this game at this present time as the enjoyment can quickly dwindle within minutes of playing.

1/10/2023
Ever since this game went FTP, everything started to make sense. I've actually been smashing this game out on PS5 and boy does it feel good to be back.

The fights - Intense, visceral, challenging but fair, and still ever so satisfying to pull off chained combos, better yet, learning how to stop one. 

The Cost - It doesn't cost anything anymore, it's free, with it's free to play micro-transactions still in place. It simply makes sense now.

Matchmaking - A little odd. It's like they certainly took in my criticism and fixed the issue by placing you into a bunch of bot lobbies at first, then eases you into the real fights with each game you play. It works, and i'm now matched with people at my player level, allowing me to learn and do better in the next game.

Enjoyment - Still same same as what I've mentioned. It's fun, lots of fun. Even up against bots, you will find yourself learning the game's mechanics before you get thrown into the deeper end, humbling you in the process. But with one small downfall - No Aussie servers, making me still match make with Asians that are 10x better than me, but that's also part of the experience at this point.

Overall: They have certainly optimised and improved the game like they said it would. Hats off to the devs for being so passionate about their product. It's definitely worth trying.",1635978014,1696133112,True,0,0,0.549490869045257568,0,True,False,False

With the help of ping boost, foreign players (especially Chinese) get huge advantages in the game! No hits are recorded on players. I have tested played on foreign servers with a ping of 160ms. I managed to find out that about 1/4 hits are not registered for foreign players! The registration of mini stuns has been tripled. The display on the monitor of the players does not correspond to reality, they sometimes disappear or move. This is not fair play! And that's not to mention cheats and scripts (autoblocks, macros, aim, etc.). If the developers do not introduce a regional ban or a ping ban, the game will close (except for China). Personally, I hate to play when opponents use cheating !!! I pay money for the game and out-of-game items, and I have the right to demand changes! I hope the developers will turn over to this post m similar to him and take action. I really like the game for its unique gimple and stellistics! I give a bad rating because of this problem. if it is removed I will change the grade. I ask those who agree with me to support this struggle, because now is the decisive moment!

В игре есть очень большая проблема, пинг буст. С помошью пинг буста инностранные игроки (особенно китайские) получают огромные приемущества в игре! По игрокам не регистрируются попадания. Мною была проведена проверка сыграл на зарубежных серверах с пингом 160мс. Мне удалось выяснить что по инностранным игрокам не регистрируется примерно 1/4 попадание! Регистрация мини оглушений увеличена в три раза. Отоброжение на мониторе игроков не соответствует действительности, они иногда исчезают или перемещаються. Это является не честной игрой! И это еще не говоря о читах и скриптах (атоблоках, макросах, аимах и т.д.). Если разработчики не введут региональный запрет или запрет по пингу, то игра закроется (кроме Китая). Лично мне противно играть, когда противники используют мошенничество!!! Я плачу дениги за игру и внетреигровые предметы, и имею право требовать изменеий! Надеюсь разработчики обротят на этот пост м подобные ему и предпримут действия. Игра мне очень нравиться своим уникальным гимплеем и стелистикой! я ставлю плохую оценку из-за данной проблемы. если ее уберут я изменю оценку. Прошу согласных со мной потдержать эту борьбу, так как сейчас решающий момент!

您好，请支持本帖！ 游戏有个很大的问题，ping boost。借助ping boost，外国玩家（尤其是中国人）在游戏中获得巨大优势！玩家没有命中记录。我在国外服务器上测试过，ping 为 160 毫秒。我设法发现大约 1/4 的点击数没有为外国玩家注册！迷你眩晕的注册数量增加了两倍。玩家显示器上的显示与现实不符，他们有时会消失或移动。这不公平！更不用说作弊和脚本（自动块、宏、目标等）。如果开发商不引入区域禁令或ping禁令，游戏将关闭（中国除外）。就我个人而言，当对手使用作弊时，我讨厌玩！！！我为游戏和游戏外物品付费，我有权要求更改！希望开发者能翻到这个和他类似的帖子，采取行动。我真的很喜欢这款游戏，因为它独特的 gimple 和 stellistics！由于这个问题，我给了一个差评。如果它被删除，我会改变成绩。我请同意我的人支持这场斗争，因为现在是决定性的时刻！

What sets Naraka: BladePoint apart from other games in the genre is the variety of weapons and characters available. Each character comes with unique abilities, adding a layer of complexity to the gameplay. The maps are also thoughtfully designed, with impressive attention to detail.

I've come back to this a few times and all they keep working on is the cosmetics. 

But here's my two cents.

Positives - 

Unique melee combat focused battle royal game with emphasis on high skill ceiling combat.

The game-play is awesome when it works. Makes you feel very rewarded when you make a good choice with attacks or abilities to best someone. 

Really good looking environments with some pretty cool location changes across two BR maps. Ton's or other types of match types too including PVE experience.

Bunch of characters with unique abilities you can combo with a ton of weapons to create some pretty cool combos.

Some cool cosmetics for those that care about that.

Full customisation of a characters face i.e you can make someone look like squidward.

Free to play.

Negatives -

Terrible net-code. This combined with server hoppers doesn't make for much fun. Skills / Attacks can get avoided just because of this which can cost you a game. Typically got people skipping frames and teleporting around because of this. You'd think the person local would get an advantage but it goes to the person connecting from the other side of the planet???

You can literally go too another server and infinite combo someone because of poor connection. (Btw you mention this on their discord and you just get admins / E24 reps ignoring it like its not a problem or saying anyone can do this on any ping / frame settings). 

Combine the above with frame rates this becomes a nightmare where there is no consistency of things connecting or not connecting. Some combos are impossible on certain frames (low frames causes the user to possibly miss key inputs, imagine this on a platform fighting game.)

Poorly optimised. It seems like regardless the spec of your PC your always going to get frame rate dips and inconsistencies.

E24 regard the combat as ""rock paper scissors"" i.e basic attacks, charged attacks and parry. If some of those don't line up as expected because of frames / net-code then it just becomes frustrating which is probably why the player base has tanked since release (but that's just a speculation). Which brings me to my next point... 

Some matches can be desolate i.e you don't play VS anyone apart from bots or you get sudden influxes of experienced players into games and can be super competitive. The player base (at least in EU) is not large enough to give an enjoyable progression curve for anyone new to the game. I'm not looking to be the best, but i'm also not looking to play vs try hard server hoppers who ping abuse in ranked.

Bad character design and balance. Literally all the characters look the same to cater for a certain stereo type / trope. Pretty much all the female designs are ""Hi i'm obnoxious and think i'm better than everyone plus I have zero personality."" The male characters are just bland save a few.

They can't help themselves to release a character that is not broken or imbalanced. But this is  typical for most games these days for marketing purposes. i.e this character has to be a success so we need to make sure people play it for whatever the reason is.

----

In conclusion -

By no means I want this game to fail. It is a cool concept and is really fun to play.

But the negatives far outweigh the positives at the moment and they haven't really taken any steps to fix them since release. 

Will I keep playing? Yes absolutely because it is a fun game, but then i'll just get frustrated again because of inconsistency and uninstall till I see new patch notes. 

Because of that I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone.",1694432201,1694543478,False,9,0,0.614039301872253418,0,True,False,False

(The game is fun in of itself but what absolutely ruins the experience is the matchmaking. Due to not having enough players the game que takes up to 8 minutes sometimes and then you get matched with either people way above your skill level or you play vs bots. Not a fun experience at all.

And dont even get me started on all the asian people playing on the eu server so they can smurf / ping abuse. just a matter of time until the game dies in eu/na at this point.)",1684501074,1694266990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-After market changes to virtual goods, you never know if the product you just purchased will be the subject for a up coming censorship patch in the future. They will basically ""re-design"" the whole product to be in line with China's standards for games.

-The communication between the developers and players is next to non-exist, they simply won't listen to players, and will just do everything in ""their way"".

So please, don't waste your hard-earned money on this game.",1659976064,1693847618,False,3,1,0.525221824645996094,0,True,False,False

It has constant movement bugs and it has some of the most toxic 3rd party bs ive ever seen. 90% of the time you counter someones charged attack they hit you through your counter or theres a clash animation when you clearly have an opening to advance on your opponent. not top mention the counter feature doesn't work half of the time you press it. People who play this spam the counter and solely rely it. I shouldn't go from averaging 30+ kills a game and losing because i cant dodge out of hit detection that no where within range. I purchased this game only for the devs to make the game free. its been over 2 years since its release and I'm still suffering the same bugs and stun lock exploits. You will lose to someone who simply plays the game more because you have to upgrade your character and techniques which is also an abysmal process. Ill admit the cosmetics in this game are top of the line and the game rewards you quite frequently but if I don't even get to see what i just unlocked half the time in game WHATS THE POINT.

Yes, it's dangerous, but their reason is valid too.
You need to dive into the system in case you have or are running a cheat engine.

It's deadly for some people
But it is reasonable for them to play for free and without cheaters. Just don't think badly of others.
I was scared at first to be honest, but when I play it from time to time I turn it off then play it or when I stop playing I turn it back on. it's still ok..

But think about it when you're trying to play, or probably already playing, a ""crack/pirate"" game.
This is a different case. If you use a third-party program like Aimbot on someone else's game, there will probably be some errors after using that game.

So probably first think of the utility and the reason why.

gameplay is great now it's free to play. much less ping abusers on the servers. or more players is meaning im running into them alot less.

my only real complaint is the star skin system/loot boxes. but as stated now completely avoidable as loot boxes arent the sole place to get a skin anymore. they also give alot more crates out for events so eventually you wind up with everything anyway.

the gameplay is great, the combat can be satisfying and yes, it is for sure fun to play, but still I do not recommend to play - why?

GREED - 24 Entertainment is one of the most expensive if it comes to extreme skins. I would compare this to like to a 5 Star in Genshin Impact or smth like that.

To get a Extreme Skin in Naraka if you hit pity you have to spent 250 bucks, but wait... there are 2 extreme skins in a treasure. This means you have a 50/50 chance to get the one you want, if you are unlucky, you will just throw 500 bucks to them and if you think that's it, oh hell no..... In the recent patches we did get Star Collection. 

Star Collections are very limited and even harder to get.

I have friends, they started arguing with me because of this. Yes no one is forced to buy them, but does this mean, we as a gaming community should allow everything? This implies any company out there. To make a comparison, I would compare this to like a 5 star in Genshin Impact. Gache Game, you have a banner and a pity, just the price is different. As we know a extreme skin will cost minimum 250 bucks, for 250 bucks, you could get 3 five stars in Genshin or 6 Bikinis in Lost Ark or even 25 Battlepasses in any game you want. 

Way more content, way more variety and most important for sure way better value for that much money!

I want to set a sign, actually WE should set a sign, because without us 24 Entertainment would be nothing. They need players, they need their money so they are what we want and as a Gamer, we should be able to say stop, this is too much. In the end, do whatever you want. I will never judge someone or like that, but I wish we could get positives changes.... This would be great for everyone of us. 

To make one thing clear, I never said it should be free gifted, it's just we need a limit.... 250 is humongous",1675697187,1692745560,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Gameplay and combat tactics required highly response user inputs to make combos with very fast time frame but the game seem to be f*king lag, fps unstable while in combat. This can be deal with a decent PC.
- The server is unfair since people mostly come from china with low ping and can easily beat other people from other countries. You mostly will die whenever counter with a chinese team. In some cases you will die within 1-2s while don't know why.

I don't like the extreme cosmetics being locked the way they are but theres usually plenty to choose from for your characters once you have played a few seasons so you can just invest in getting the season passes. If you buy one season pass as well and don't spend the gold from it you usually have enough or close to enough to unlock the next season too which is nice.

Gameplay overall is fun if you like melee combat and generally I find it well balanced. Being able to play bot rounds if you just want to hack and slash or jump into the campaign mode each week for some RPG lite elements is good so its overall got a good selection of gameplay.

Sticks to the wall when your jumping near a wall, player should press and leave down a key so the character can hang from the edge, climb up or down, etc, this issue of hanging to the wall by its own gets people killed when trying to escape or runaway and the character just sticks to the wall when everyone is just chasing you, ridicul0us.
3. Epic item vs Legendary sucks, i mean, legendary items are way too broken, it should be similar in damage like epic ones but a bit more, not too much, right now is just ridicul0us the amount of damage that the legendary ones have.
4. The hook, omg the hook, you need to aim first and then press the action button to use, nonono, should be one key or button only, pressed down and aim, release to shoot. grab or climb, the way it is, its just to slow, you lose the enemy, you get killed and others just too fast, big no no.
5. Sprinting(running) too slow, way to slowwwwww, looks like the character is jogging but a bit faster, omg.
6. Ultimates, a lot of them are to overpowered just like the legendary weapons, other ultimates do even less damage at a point, that is better to just keep using whatever weapon you have rather than using the ultimate, ridicul0us, lol, its a laugh.
7. At this point, i started playing Naraka when it came out, still all these issues are still in the game, i wont be wasting money in a game like this, eventually if they those fix it, as soon another better game from someone else comes out, eventually this one will go down and will lose a lot of player, and im not planning on searching for a match in a lobby for 5, 6, 10 min.

Not only that but, the special currency system in the game, (Gold), there is no way to earn it without using the gold they give you if you had bought the most expensive pack. Even buying the battle-pass extra rewards there isn't enough Gold generated to buy anything else. This a big problem, I have all ready spent 60 dollars on the game and I am not going to spend on a game that lags, freezes, and crashes when I play it. I have filled out multiple surveys for the game.

Its completely broken. Parrying in this game works 50%~ of the time, the other 50% it just goes through your parry. Its like playing rock paper scissors except rock beats both scissor and paper.

You will have fun at the first 50 hours but as you progress you only encounter OP bots and high ping OP asia player

My complaints

1. Fighting is fun and requires skill BUT you will get destroyed from enemys with much more playtime than you
   - high lvl bots and good player (there a many pro player) will constanly spam you so that you cannot do much about it

2. Matchmaking sucks you will encounter dosens of people with high ping from asia who woop your ass 

3. Lootboxes, played 100 hours and only received once a golden item, most of the time you will get items you already have

If the developer would create some great servers without high pink asia player, improve the matchmaking by a lot and do more fair lootboxes this game would be a solid 8/10",1632327958,1692044376,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Edit: Game has a great core concept and stands out from any other Battle Royale I have played. That being said there are some core issues that need to be addressed with both connections and game-play before I can honestly recommend the game.

There is no ping restriction to the servers so anyone can connect to whatever server they want. This poses an issue in a game with tight controls and parry timing when up against an opponent on the other side of the world (literally).

Additionally the weapons and characters seem to be very unbalanced. There are some weapons that are completely worthless compared to others regardless of whether they fit your play style or not. 

The ranking system has some serious issues that could be addressed with some transparency on how the scoring works. Why when I get 15 kills and do 20K damage in top 3 am I only rewarded 11 points, but in a loss where i'm still within top 10 and have only 4 kills do i LOSE 7 points. Its frustrating and makes any progress towards a ranking system feel hopeless.

Aesthetically the game is fantastic. All the characters sound, look, and feel unique. The environment is great (spare the few times your character will be stuck from some free running glitch)

The main issue is that this game is being pushed so hard as the next big e-sport without having the dedicated team to balance and regulate content it would need for that legitimacy.

The game wants you to disable HVCI_KMCI.
The kernel is basically the “core” of your computer’s operating system, having total control over all programs. This means any software that operates at the “kernel level” can easily make changes to your system without you even noticing.

When HVCI KMCI is turned on, essential Windows processes are isolated so they aren’t prone to tampering. When you turn it off, they are no longer isolated; unsafe but run faster too. This means, when HVCI KMCI is disabled, Naraka Bladepoint‘s anti-cheat can read your files and catch unauthorized commands much more efficiently.

Turning off HVCI KMCI also does give you up to a 12% performance boost when gaming! But it all depends on what games you’re playing since they all utilize the Windows processes differently. You might think, “Then, just turn it back on when I’m done gaming,” right? Well, toggling the setting requires a reboot so it might provide another level of inconvenience.

Still, at the end of the day, it’s all up to you whether you’re comfortable with turning off a security feature or not.",1628745007,1691719002,False,2,1,0.493239372968673706,0,True,False,False

The presentation and environment design are also top-notch. I'd often have to stop myself from just staring at a nice landscape and get back to looting. I really like the character and weapon designs, and it makes me want to whale to look as cool as I can.

Battle royale isn't the only mode, there's also deathmatch, a PvE campaign, a bunch more I haven't touched yet, and a new capture point team battle mode, and they're all fun since the core game is so well made.

The in-game purchases can get a little scumbaggy, but it's all strictly cosmetic so it won't interfere with you if you don't want to spend anything. Half of the cosmetics are still earnable for free, anyway.

Awalnya beli gim ini karena jenuh dengan DotA dan gim FPS selain itu karena kepincut karakter gim yang cantik. Sayangnya 2 tahun lalu gim ini tidak ramai di indonesia sehingga mencari komunitasnya sangat sulit dan saya berakhir vakum meski hanya bermain sebentar dan iseng beli bundle package skin Yoto Hime + battlepass iseng.
Kemudian ditahun ini, entah mengapa gim ini masih ramai dan dilihat-lihat selalu ada konten baru dan menarik. Saya langsung install lagi dan siapa sangka ternyata akan ada event menjadi Free to Play (tanggal 14 juli kemarin) diikuti dengan event teaser new class code name TESSA dan yang paling mengejutkan event yang saya tunggu 6/7 bulan lalu yang sempat dirumorkan dicancel akhirnya diumumin juga tanggal kolaborasi NARAKA x NIeR.

Semenjak event free to play dirilis serta cross dengan konsol saya akhirnya bersyukur karena sang dev membuat event untuk pemain yang sudah terlanjur beli pass gimnya dengan diberikan kompensasi 4960 gold), skin eksklusif, treasure dan event undang pemain baru. untuk saat ini saya sudah bisa bermain dengan damai karena bisa bertemu dengan orang indonesia. mungkin karena ini gim dari china makanya kurang diminati di indonesia. 🤣🤣

Fantastic, unique battle royale. Phenomenal combat system with a huge amount of depth. Definitely can be frustrating at first, but the game eases you in with bots to show you the ropes. Once you get the hang of it it’s an incredibly fun, tense, and rewarding combat experience. Best of all, this game has a solos mode! 

Much like Apex this game features characters with unique abilities. All the characters feel and play different, and levelling up your account let’s you select passive boosts that further help tailor the game to your play style. If you want to focus on fancy combos and getting your ult as quickly as possible, you can. If you want to have more options to escape tricky situations, you can. Also, the game has an incredibly detailed character creator that lets you customize the appearance of every character in the game (except the one character that is a crossover character from another Netease game). You can make some god awful monstrosities, or some incredibly faithful recreations of characters from other properties. I’ve seen my fair share of Wukongs, Draculas, and even a comic accurate Drax the Destroyer running around. It’s very, very cool. 

The game definitely needs some work; performance and server stability can leave a lot to be desired. Drop the settings a bit (DLSS helps a ton if you have an nvidia card) and expect to lose a few games due to some unfortunate lag. Hopefully this gets ironed out with some patches. 

Highly recommend giving this game a go.",1630039919,1690693355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In my opinion the skins and weapon skins are pricey (around 1,000) gold each and seems a little over the top but can't say much for a now free game.

Naraka is in such a good state, even moreso now that the game went F2P. Now you literally have nothing to lose, so just try it if a melee focused BR that isn't just mindless mashing seems interesting to you. graphics are gorgeous and there's a LOT of content here, I even enjoyed the battlefield style capture point game mode with 2 massive teams going against each other. 10/10

NIER AUTOMATA COLLAB SOON 

OG review date :  13 Aug, 2021

A fresh take on an extremely boring and overdone genre. 

I've played the open beta and had an enjoyable time only bogged down by some performance issues. Thankfully it seems they've ironed most of the them (while you may need to add a launch command here on steam), the performance increase and stability is very noticeable even on my old system.

Yes there are bots for the first few games to ease you into the mechanics. If you want to get your teeth kicked in real quick, just queue ranked and only ranked. The faster you climb, the faster you'll get destroyed :^)

I only play trios with randos and I've been having a lot of fun even as someone that really dislikes BRs.

If you think not being able to cancel every single move is ""clunky"", you might not like this, even if it isn't slow.
Movement system is very good and weapons have a nice feel to each of them, the animations are flashy and the fights get tense.

Using a mix of medium(majority) and low settings(volumetric fog, post processing etc), at native 1080p. I get a very smooth experience and the visuals are still decent.  (anti-aliasing SMAA on high)

no regrets, definitely worth the small price for entry.",1628792700,1690459944,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Naraka is best described for me as a Battle Royal 3d Fighting game with expressive movement and sword-play combat as the primary focus. I could have wrote an essay on how much there is wrong with the game many years ago but the Devs have been fine tuning this game over regular updates over the years it's been out and the balance is in a relatively acceptable place as it stands. 

Pros - Expressive movement base game, high mind games, incredibly high skill ceiling at the later ranks. High levels of customisation, lots of events and rewards, cool characters and weapons, consistent map and loot placings. Combat feels fluid and incredibly satisfying once it clicks, good lobby system, customisation of games, lots of game modes and possibly the highest character customisation almost to date, rivals even SF6 custom character abominations. 

Cons - They fixed huge amounts of the cons over the years. The match making placing you in 150+ ping lobbies is frustrating and unavoidable without a VPN. The net code isn't good enough to handle anything over 100ms. Queue times are very long in the later ranks but smooth games below plat. High level of bots in the lobbies of lower games to fill out numbers, circle closes in too slowly, would be nicer if it was 15mins games max instead of 20-35mins.

Reasons of me quitting was due to the match making which has mostly been solved.
Would I recommend this? yes for sure, if you're a fan of fighting games or BR games or sword based combat PVP games? absolutely. There is also PVE modes if you're garbage at playing PVP skill based games and can only deal with scripted fights with bots/NPCs.

It's clear the devs aren't interested in making this game better and the player numbers are showing. 

ON TOP of this , the game has the WORST lootbox system in a game, as in mega greedy.
They recently released a new lootbox, requiring you to spend 240+ USD for a CHANCE (since it's only a 0.6% chance) at getting a legendary skin. If you want more than one then there is a chance you can get DUPLICATE legendaries too.

This is worse than any f2p scheme, stay away.

Add in no ping lock and it's not ever going to be a viable competitive game.

That's because they use them in PvP (*PLAYER* vs *PLAYER*) game modes where it's supposed to be full of people. Not only that, but the only indication that they were bots was certain animation jank involving the grappling hook. The answer? Despite what other reviews say, it wasn't an issue of population. They were prevalent even on release in all queues. No, it was an issue of psychology. If you feel good playing the game, you will be more likely to buy microtransactions.

Naraka continues to be fun. I've only ranked Platinum on the NA servers, so I'm very middle of the road, but I never quite feel like I've hit a wall on my progress learning as I've experienced with other PvP games. The game remains fun and rewarding, even if I lose. The community is very helpful, and offers feedback to improve. In my previous review I compared the game to other Battle Royale games, but as the game develops I can't ignore how much skill is involved... like a Street Fighter or Tekken fighter. Sometimes queues for ranked games can take a while, but the matchmaking is really fair. ...and if queues take too long, campaign mode, and bot training modes are great to test your skill. Bots on hard have been talked about as Hax (Heh!), so you won't have to worry about getting bored and running out of ways to challenge yourself.

It's been years since I've had a game that didn't make me lose interest after this long. Great Game.

*** AFTER 4.5 HOURS ***
I love this game. I don't quite know how to describe how much I love it, but I'm going to try. There are games, special games, that require skill and strategy, where the competition is fierce and the difference between a champion and just a player comes into rare and clear focus. Starcraft is like this, so is League of Legends, or Fortnite.

This game is such a perfect blend of all the things I love... it's like Tenchu: Stealth Assassins combined with Dynasty Warriors and maybe Tekken or Street Fighter; then wrapped up with Starcraft or League of Legends cosmetic stores and leader boards with a soupçon of Battle Royale mechanics.

Having most of the weapons in the game be melee really makes the combat great, and meaningful. Combos, interrupts, disarming your opponent and martial arts are all things you can do... or if you're like me, mostly you have it done TO you. Yet, in spite of how awful I am at this game, I can still enjoy it, because you really viscerally feel that the other person beat you because they were clearly the superior player, and not because they had an aim-bot or anything like that.

I can also enjoy the game, because of how overwhelmingly beautiful it is. The settings are great, and detailed, and yet subtly muted so as to allow the vibrant color of the characters to shine through; like anime characters bursting with all their color and outrageous animation into the real world, the contrast between the mundane and the fantastic allows you to always feel like the main character. The balance of the aesthetic is perfect. The little details like the sound of running across clay shingles on a rooftop, contribute not only to the immersion of the game, but also strategically. It's hard to be stealthy while ""clank-clank-clank"" you're running over terra cotta shingles, and it impacts your game play.

I will likely update this review later, because I've only just scratched the surface of this game. The one thing that put is head and shoulders above the rest, is you can tell that this game was the labor of love for a great many people. It's worthy of being called art, as well as a game.",1629151458,1686919516,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

Are you a fan of martial arts and have been looking for a game to satisfy your needs? This is it.

You will in this game find:
Solo, Duo and Trios queue (Rating (V-IIII-III-II-I) :
Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Solar, Empyrean, Astral, Asura, Unrivaled Asura. 
There is also the option of Quick Match. 

Expect a healthy number of bots in any mode - however they have been given some varying levels of AI difficulty and some are wired to be able to face Unrivaled Asura players. Do not take all bots lightly *wink*. 

You will find alternate game modes. These alternate game modes aren't available at all times as the player base heavily fluctuates in is online hours. 

9 unique melee weapons with unique abilities.
7 unique ranged weapons.
16 unique heroes with unique abilities. (3 Varieties of your F ability and 3 varieties of your V (ultimate) ability)

Climb your way up and ranked and you will verse more players, who are also more experienced. 
Expect a lot of bots on the way to greatness. It's to smooth the learning curve as well as to keep you occupied. Do not despair x)

You can practice the different modes through ranked, quick matches and custom rooms. 
Game sense and overall prowess is best trained through Herald's Trial and mechanics are probably best trained in Custom room/Training Grounds. This is also a muscle memory and strategy game. 

Hope this helps.

Naraka is pretty much what I expected after the open Beta. They drastically improved the FPS drops that haunted players while loading in the first 10 sec of each round. They also added a few new weapons and characters. 

Its an amazing Battle Royale without heavily leaning on being one. What I mean by that is eventhough the game is basically a BR it often feels like an action MMO. Unlike most BR games you are not getting hard rolled by other players if you have a rough start and youre not finding super good gear. The skill sealing is so high that as a good player all you need is a white armor and a white melee weapon (I feel like having only 1 ranged weapon makes it almost impossible to win a close on 1v1) to outplay a worse player that has better gear than you.


The room for improvement is so damn high that you cant just practice your aim to get better you actually somewhat need to learn how each character and each weapon plays in order to counter them, which is a great thing in my opinion.

P2W? Microtransactions?
No P2W only cosmetics, they pretty much have everything in the MT universe: Different Game Packages, Loot Boxes, Purchasable Cosmetics, A Battle Pass, pick your poison.

Edit: I still stand by what I said after 20 hrs the only thing is now that I dont have lobbies full of bots I have 6+ minute queu timers. Unlike most people I actually prefer having 80% of my lobby as bots as long as I can play the game. Almost everyone plays ranked (same goes for me) but even in ranked (currently platinum 2) it takes so long to find game which is okay for games like league where you have alteast 20 minute games but in battle royales this is frustrating for obvious reason. I dont mind meeting a stronger opponent but waiting 8 minutes just to be one comboed by sb who is lv 1600 is not fun.
That being sad if you enjoy BRs and especially enjoy real time action combat based MMOs such as Black Desert Online, Tera or Vindictus I feel like you cant do anything wrong with Naraka.",1629064142,1686048774,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really enjoy the game but it's annoying when you get into higher ranks and it's just chinese players abusing cheesy mechanics.[/strike]

EDIT: after much consideration and realizing the dying state of this game, I gave it one last chance when they released their newest character Zai.

[h1]Biggest problems/concerns:[/h1]
- Low player count and bot problem. Bots are absolutely not helpful in learning this game, they serve no purpose and are only a nuisance because there are different types of bots, one's that run away and waste your time, and one's that spam staggering attacks. You will likely get 1 or 2 teams in your lobbies and sometimes you will play against all bots.

- Ranked system is absolute garbage. with the diminishing playerbase already, you will hardly fight new players to Naraka, and most of the time you'll run into player's who are unrivaled asura's (max rank) in gold lobbies. 

- Naraka's Partnership with Gameboosting / Latency software proves that they don't care about who plays on NA servers and cater to the losers who switch from EU or Asia servers onto NA servers. 

- Hacking / Report system.
 - There are so many hackers who move over to NA servers to cheat and get away with it. why? because Naraka's report system is the worst report system I've seen in ANY game. You can put in a report for hacking, it will then ASK YOU for a clip of it along with so much other useless information like the suspects name / in-game ID. How can you report someone who's using chinese characters in their name if you can't even fucking read their name to begin with?

- Characters are extremely unbalanced. Like to play as a healer? well prepare to get stomped by awful players who abuse cheesy character's and ultimate's that literally give them a panic ultimate and a full health bar with EXTREMELY overpowered damage and long lasting ultimate's that almost never have any counters (Tianhai/Yueshan).

- This game does not have 60,000+ players like the community tab says on Steam, It is likely this game has around 100 ~ 300 players as a more accurate figure.

- Cosmetics are being pumped out with every update as they ignore everything else wrong with the game. And your cosmetics can be changed at any time to be censored when the developers wish to do so.

- Leaderboard is flooded with Chinese / EU players

- Optimization is horrible, and for latency NA servers will give around 50 ~ 90 ping. and it's really inconsistent.

- Teaming in ranked matches is very likely to happen as there is such a shortage of players and you will see it happen.

- Tarka Ji ultimate still has not been nerfed to remove his unlimited uppercut stunlock.

[h1]Final thoughts / Closure[/h1]
As a beta player and someone who really looked forward to this game succeeding, it's just a very sad feeling that this game will not succeed outside of China. It is a very fun and rewarding game when you play against people your skill level and have fair fights, but that is only about 10% of your playtime, the other 90% will be you dying to chinese losers abusing their elevated ping and auto parry software, fighting the most absurd bots only to realize you might have just won a full game against just bots.

Really in-depth character customization if that's your thing. Like REALLY in-depth. Not many people using cheats. There's a few here and there but its rare. overall I've really enjoyed the game. the battle pass is all cosmetics. everything is cosmetics. The battle pass gives a balanced amount of rewards. It's worth it due to the steady stream of in-game materials that you can't just buy with gold. same thing for the cosmetics. a lot of them can't be bought with gold. There is a large satisfaction in skin achievements because you know you only have it because you earned it. They're constantly releasing content and limited-time events. there's a lot and they're all good and unique.There's also a ""story"" mode where you team up and accomplish tasks and kill bosses. There's a separate level up system from anything in the game. kind of like another game mode. It takes a hell of a lot of effort to progress and continue and its satisfying seeing your progress. The levels get easier and easier until you hit the next tier and then its super hard again.overall i'd give it an 8.7/10score reduction due to minor/medium character and combo imbalances in the main Battle Royale modes.

EDIT 4/6/2023: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. There are so many hackers you can't play a match without being cheated. The devs are doing nothing about it.

EDIT 6/3/2023 Its fine. They fixed the cheaters. I'm sure it'll happen again but its not like The Cycle where it just got completely fucked off with cheaters. They fixed the issue. It's a great game again.",1679628522,1685817372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Naraka is a really good game with high skill cap. The game has the most fluid movement and combat system in all of the competitive games I've played. It builds around its basic movements and feels very intuitive. The combat implements an intricate rock-paper-scissors system. So to speak, you'll go very far with strong fundamentals!

Each mode is a lot different from each other. If you thrive in chaos, play trios. If you like simpler fights, flexing and trying out different combo variations, solos might be for you. I personally enjoy duos because it's not too chaotic, but its balance make for interesting fights.

Now with its bad sides: depending on your region, most matches (especially until platinum) will be filled with bots. Worst case, you're the only real person in your match. As new players grind their way up (past platinum), they'll start finding the huge skill gap between them and players who have learned their fundamentals. To add salt to the injury, lobbies will often be filled with players way, way beyond their elo.

Here's to wishing Naraka gets a wake up call to market the game outside China.

Anyway, give it a try. I promise it's an insanely fun game. Every fight almost feels like a highlight reel.",1630132652,1685465654,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The incredibly fluid movement options makes traversal fun, so the typical downtime of battle royales isn't nearly as boring. 

Combat is fairly balanced with character abilities making you feel powerful while being manageable to fight against. Combat is fairly simple at the surface, but with the many advance techs, cancels and movement options you can deploy to mix up your opponent, the meta game becomes deep quickly. What I especially like is that, even at a top level, finding counterplay doesn't seem impossible nor does it seem like it becomes a ""just dont get hit"" kind of game. There is a good amount of guessing and bluffing involved, so you always have to play against the player's mind, rather than just trying to land some killer combo starter (this is what most online fighters become). There is always room to improve and the reason you lose is often plain to see.

The music is good. The PvE content is solid. There are custom rooms available. There are good tutorials, videos, explanations and training modes available.

These are the five ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated Key lime pie recipe:

· Sweetened condensed milk: This sweet, smooth, and creamy Key lime pie starts with a can of sweetened condensed milk.
· Key lime juice: Key lime juice comes from the Florida Keys. Key limes are more acidic than regular limes, so they pack a flavorful punch.
· Sour cream: Sour cream contributes to the rich texture and lends subtly tangy flavor.
· Lime zest: A tablespoon of lime zest enhances the bold citrusy flavor.
· Graham cracker crust: Use a store-bought or homemade graham cracker crust.

How to Make Key Lime Pie
Making Key lime pie at home couldn't be easier. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below – but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

1. Make the filling: Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Pour into the prepared graham cracker crust.
2. Bake the pie: Bake the pie in a preheated oven until tiny bubbles appear and pop on the surface of the pie.
3. Cool the pie: Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack, then transfer it to the refrigerator to finish setting. Top with whipped cream and lime wedges, if desired.

How to Store Key Lime Pie
Cover the cooled Key lime pie tightly with storage wrap or foil. Store in the refrigerator for up to three days. Serve chilled.

Can You Freeze Key Lime Pie?
Yes! You can freeze Key lime pie for up to three months (but make sure you don't add whipped cream or toppings until after it's thawed). If you plan to freeze the pie, bake it in a foil pan. Wrap the cooled pie in at least one layer of storage wrap, then follow it up with at least one layer of foil. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
""I love this recipe, it's fabulous,"" says Stephanie White. ""I also experimented and used lemon in place of the lime (just to find a use for my over abundance of lemons) and it turned out great.""

""This Key lime pie is delicious,"" raves Debidoooo. ""I make a homemade graham cracker crust and add one-third cup of toasted shredded coconut to the crust. Everyone raves about this pie. Try it…..you won't be disappointed.""

""This recipe was excellent,"" raves one Allrecipes community member. ""The only change I made was to substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream because I didn't have any. Everyone enjoyed it.""

Ingredients
3 cups sweetened condensed milk

¾ cup key lime juice

½ cup sour cream

1 tablespoon grated lime zest

1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Combine condensed milk, key lime juice, sour cream, and lime zest in a bowl; mix well. Pour into graham cracker crust; place pie on a baking sheet.

Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until tiny pinhole bubbles burst on the surface of the pie. The filling will be wobbly but not browned.

Transfer pie to a wire rack to cool, then thoroughly chill pie in the refrigerator before serving, about 1 hour. Garnish with lime slices and whipped cream.

On top of that the game menu is a mess.
There are general quests, there are quests you can accept for one specific game, there are quests for events, each event separately. Each and everything is in different place. Its a complete mess. 

This game is a equivalent of market square in 80ties : there are trash shops on every corner, huge ads, shops have loud music to grab your attention. And if you actually want to buy something you are going to search for it for one hour and at the end you are going to settle for suboptimal product just because you are just tired and want to go home.

I would like to bring to your attention that I have been experiencing significant issues while attempting to play your games due to severe lag. Even though I am playing in my own region, the game appears to be unplayable. I am puzzled as to what might have caused this, especially considering that the game's performance was not this bad when it was initially released. The game seems to have a shortage of players, which might explain why so many bots have been added.

Given the current state of the game, I believe that it should be offered as a free dual game. My computer's configuration, which includes an rxt 3070 and a ryzen 7800x, performs flawlessly with other games. Unfortunately, this is not the case with your game, which is currently unplayable due to the excessive lag. The game just freakin dogshit excuse my language. This game should never ask for anyone for money dual is not even playable at all. even lowest setting and my pc optimized by professional where i got my pc from. This game just soooo bad. I would never recommaned anyone buy it. They trying so hard bring people with their skins etc. this not worth a dim if they not going fix the issue. Its sooo bad in my region when i switch to game smooth as hell. Then you know its not your pc or connection i got 1000/1000 fiber internet even. 

There is zero zero transparency either. all these people just riding that *** seems someone refuse be honest to them self there are so many player have same issue. 

I would appreciate it if you could address these concerns and take the necessary steps to ensure that the game's performance is improved. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I am not that high in ranked; I am only in Solar, yet I seem to always go against server top players. I know this is probably because the games playerbase isn't large enough to support me only fighting people the same rank as me, but man it can be frustrating sometimes. The same with quick play, except the opposite. I seem to mostly fight bots in quick play. The movement and combat are both satisfying. There is almost always an event of some sort going on so you don't have to just play the game to play the game if that is something that you don't like. It is a very fun game to play with friends as well. Working on team compositions and finding out which characters click with others is a lot of fun to do. The most annoying issue that I had has thankfully been resolved. Xbox and steam players, whether or not on PC, could technically join the same lobby but could not friend each other or play with each other directly. They fixed that thankfully. Now for some reason we still can't join each others ""Chambers"" (Kind of like a guild but not really). Anyway, this game was definitely worth the price.

Requires fast SSD/M.2.
Crossplay with Xbox players.
Game servers in EU, NA, AS, SEA, China. There is no SA server, so ppl from that region will have 200+ ms ping (pretty much unplayable).
Supports keyboard + mouse and gamepads.
Game has own anticheat system. 
All in-game micro transactions are cosmetics. No pay2win. Pay to look better) 
Frequent content updates (season passes and time limited events). 
If you want to know, what edition is best (Standard, Deluxe or Ultimate) - it is Standard + Season Pass unlock (+10$).

Game modes: Survival Ranked/Casual (Battle Royale), Bloodbath (Deathmatch with bots and players, matchmaking waiting time is 4 minute right now), Showdown (PVE for 3 players, but it is possible to play in Duos and Solo, if ppl are ""Gut"". Time limited - only for Friday, Saturday and Sunday), Bot mode (Survival with bots - 3 level of difficulty), Room matches (players only, PvP). And some other time limited modes. 

Game mechanics. Since it is close combat game (with ranged weapon elements), you need to adapt to your enemies. It is not look&kill shooter game. It is not masher simulator either, like DMC, because of parry system (from souls-like and fighting games). 

There is no block button at all, but Greatsword and Polesword have blocking properties. 

There is light (fast), charged (blue, slow) attack and parry. If you got stunned with any light attack, you can't do charge attack, but you can dodge after stun at some point. If you started charged attack before enemy hit you with light - you have priority and you will make good damage. But charged attacks can be parried. And you can't parry light attacks. So it is triangle system. Because of different ping, parry timing will differ too - some ppl play with 40 ms ping, others - with 140 e t.c. 

Fast movement and fast retreat/recover is mandatory. Also two types of dodges (click shift/hold shift) require proper stamina management. 

There are lots of stuff, that you can do in the game (upgrade account level, upgrade weapon level, hero cultivation e t.c.). More than 10 heroes already, some of them are free and others you can buy with in-game currency(tae/silver). 

Combat depends on weapon you use(katana, dagger, spear, long sword...), characters just have some additional features (skills and ultimates). 

Currency in game: gold (real money). If you pay for season pass unlock and complete it fully, you will receive all gold back (+-1200 gold). Silver - tae, you will receive basically for doing anything useful) Same with silk. Dark coins - you use to buy stuff in survival mode from special chest (Rift dealer). Also there is special season pass coins. 3x coins, if you complete task in survival mode, will grant you +1 season pass level. Usually season pass has 130 lv, last SP was shorter. For fast SP grind you need to complete daily, weekly and monthly (season) tasks. From usual matches you will get not so much exp. 

Keep in mind, than in Survival Ranked first you will play only against easy bots - to understand whole game better. Only with ppl you will play at Platinum rank and higher. But matchmaking time will be longer too. Usually more ppl in the evening and very few or nobody in the morning. So this is not a game, where you can play all day (if you want to play with real ppl). 

Overall it is a great game and developers/publishers support it, constantly making new stuff. 
Because of lack of ppl in EU/NA region, it is difficult to be a main game. 
But for few hours after work it is good enough for sure) 

All usual quests and 95% of achievements you can do solo in bot mode. Exception are: The Overcomer, Hand of Grace, Fickle Fortune. The most annoying achievement is Accuracy Assured, where you need to level up ranged weapon to 25 lv. Basically all my time in this game was about completing this one achievement)",1682425825,1682425825,True,167,5,0.810487806797027588,0,True,False,False

Dec 2022: Lol. Horrendous and repetitive match making. Dying game. Pretty sure steam charts numbers are mostly bots. Uses addicting loot box system for money along with very limited skin releases. Chinese smurf/vpn funnnn on NA/EUI Not much going for it anymore.

Jan 2022: A very fun twist on a battle royale feeling like it got meshed with a MMORPG. Dorito bod dudes with hourglass women like many mmorpgs, but the combat is fun and very different being mostly melee based versus the gun based popular mmorpgs.

The player has to combine their chosen hero's abilities with a wide assortment of weapons to put together a combat strategy. It's essential to learn combos, juggles, synergies between different weapons, characters, and powers, as well as building map knowledge to survive. The skill floor is high, but reaching it is very rewarding. 

For the fashionistas the game offers a lot of character customization. There are paid cosmetics and a battle pass, but the game is pretty generous about free cosmetics and a lot of the cooler high end cosmetics are available through gameplay. 

The game features a bunch of side-modes alongside the main BR mode. There's ranked and unranked BR, a death-match mode that's great for practicing, a neat PvE mode with unique mechanics, various alternate BR modes with different loot rules and a much smaller, more aggressive circle, and a fully featured practice mode where you can experiment with all the weapons and practice against AI bots that can be set to be passive, defensive, or aggressive. 

The game uses bots to fill out matches and the NA servers can be spartan off peak hours and at low ELOs, something to keep in mind. 

Overall I strongly recommend it to anyone who finds the idea of crossing a fighting game with a BR compelling and wants a challenging experience that rewards diligent practice, strategy, cunning, and and fast precise inputs.",1682146913,1682146913,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Im not that interested in FPS Battleroyale games like COD WZ and Apex Legends.
[b]As a (MMO)RPG PVP player i do like Naraka Bladepoint allot however. It is scratching a similar itch! [/b]

Its not an easy to pick up game if you dont have experience playing melee based PVP games. Learning from other players in the game or watching extra youtube guides is highly recommended to know about (movement) mechanics the game is relatively poor at explaining.

The problems the West (NA, EU etc.) is facing with this game are a mild concern:
- Player population is pretty low for a battle royale, queue times are relatively long compared to popular online games. Marketing is low, while the game is pretty popular in China.
- They currently use bots to fill up quickmatch and even ranked games, due to the lower playerbase and not wanting to have super long queues. The amount of real players increases in ranked when you hit gold/platinum+ rank.
- The ranked matchmaking is sometimes unfair. There is a big skill gap between players but because the pop is low it is possible that you (as a noob - average player) and the best players in the game are getting matched together.
- The servers: mid netcode and other players having high(er) latency... ultimately the game is playable but sometimes parry windows are not functioning like you expect.
- your imputs might not always come through due to the earlier mentioned server state or your pc not being that high end. For some reason higher FPS (and Hz) makes your imputs a tiny amount more responsive. A hard requirement also is installing the game on a SSD. Dont even try to play this on a HDD.

I do think it is a shame that this game is overlooked by many or not given a fair shake due to having some yanky mechanics that arent that easy to pick up as a new player. It is very rewarding when you get better at it.
I do hope that Netease and the developers will give the West a little bit more love too though, as it goes both ways.",1681900409,1681901966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't even bother if u located outside of China & South East Asia.
Dev team trend to change this game to spamming focus attack and instant parry. Dagger & nunchucks are unbalanced rn and extremely annoying to play against, if u have latency above 50+ or low fps, u gonna get rekted by dagger&nunchucks spamming BS regular attack combo that root u on ground many times in a row.
No sign for new map and game mode. Player base shrinking drastically.

Combat is fine but i didn't come to fight bots i came to fight people but even when the game ""has over 8k players"" it takes forever to get inside a match so for the last two months i've been fighting bots intentionally instead of having them sprinkled in to player matches. So sure if you enjoy doing pve sh*t when you came solely for the pvp then get this game.

Pros
1.The combat feels nice overall and the only real downside is parrying has a weird delay.

2.It's graphics looks pretty good overall but once the fog rolls in while your in a forest, That 
b*tch comes to life.

3.Overall the game puts me a good mood.

4.Buy into the battle pass,keep maxing them out & you'll never have to pay for another bp.

5.The character customization is pretty decent.

6.Overall decent voice acting,besides tarkas jis english voice actor. Trash tier va.

7.The devs give out a decent bit of free stuff through the mail.

8.Overall both maps decent & the second map brings in weather effects,I wouldn't mind seeing some added into the first map.

Cons
1.They do the scummy thing with micro transaction where they just under cut you the amount you need to force you into buying more.

2.You get duplicates of items from loot boxes.I do not care that we get a higher chance of getting a better bit of gear, that is a non issue because if it was done the normal way we would of gotten all the trash gear out of the way and then only get the good stuff but that is the real issue since they only want to drop loads of money to get that outfit you want.

3.You can't change the color of your armor due to them wanting you to waste chest rolls on the recolors that are already in the game.

4.The game crashes, So far only twice.

5.Tarka ji english voice actor is god awful.

6.Need to region lock the game due to not being able to communicate with non regional team mates.

7.The pussified brain dead team mates
""i'm going to spawn in the middle of nowhere so we can live longer then die instantly as soon as a fight starts because i'm such sh*t a games in general i normally can't get past tutorials on easy""

Thoughts
1.I would like to see a beast master,summoner or shape shifter hero added into the game.

2.I would like to see fist weapons added to the game because pridefall & starfall show off how cool it can be.",1651521211,1681344236,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do, however, play Herald's Trial, i.e. Quick Match, which feels _really_ good when you win knowing you _just_ beat a bunch of real players xD You also gradually learn the difference between a bot vs a player. I might edit this review when I get to rank matches, but overall, I am having lots of fun. It's been a while since I last played a BR game and had this much fun, even SOLO.

P.S: For someone who is a fan of King's avatar (全职高手) and the game they play in it, this is it!

Edit: So, 118+ hours later, I still fully recommend the game, even if I get my a** handed to me at times. It's super fun and challenging at the same time. Winning combat is still as satisfying as when I first started playing the game :)

Difficult in the 'easy to learn, hard to master' type of way. What I mean by that is: If you don't play fighting games or have the capacity to sit in a training room for extended periods practicing how to move and fight, you're gonna have a bad time.
The movement in this game is similar to GunZ the Duel (arguably a bit harder) but like any super mechanical game it all comes down to muscle memory so practice practice practice and it becomes easy... until you get outplayed by someone who exploits your unrefined movement and fighting ability. So, hop back into training and beat them later :)

When you start ranking, you'll either have really stupid easy mode bots in your game or bots who seem to 0 frame parry every blue/charge attack. There will be actual players sprinkled in as your rank increases. 
Once you reach gold or platinum rank-- which doesn't take too long once you get comfortable btw, you will start playing versus some of the best players in the game.

1- ""chinese smurfing"" on EU and NA among new players, their high ping makes it impossible to hit them.. literally!

2- EU and NA players are leaving thanks to the Chinese players using VPNs to get easy wins .. once again using rubber banding.

3- Almost every match you have squads teaming up together, mostly chinese players farming points, and its usually ""4 players vs 2 in duo"" or ""6 vs 3 in trios""

Conclusion --> Great game overall... very bad and horrible management in the West.. Cant even prevent VPN users from playing on the Western servers. Frankly..Don't bother buying this game as long as the devs keep blind eye to what's going on with the current state of the game in the west.. Also Hackers are barely getting banned since you encounter them on daily basis!

Update 3/ 5/ 2023

current state of the game,  in every match is mix of bots and fuuck ton of chinese players in the lobby

.. i rarely come across actual players from EU.

Update 2/ 4/ 2023

-Nothing has changed, just more events and no bug fixes

- Chinese players are openly teaming up together during matches now, they wont bother hiding it. Videos has been recorded and submit, yet nobody got banned

People look at the steamcharts and think the game is healthy, while failing to realise 90% of the players aren't even on NA. Either remove loot boxes, make them cheaper, or make the game free. Western servers are dying. 
[EDIT]
Highly competitive, BR aspect is not as much as you would think, however I wish solos map was a bit smaller. Overall, fantastic game; monetisation method is eeeehhhh since it is pay to play, but it is cosmetic overall so it doesn't entirely matter, plus the battle pass is very well worth the price. RNG on loot boxes is, well, random. I have had relatively good RNG so far, opening 23 chests and getting 9 epics.
I do recommend this game only to people who can have fun in competitive play as even the low level play is very high with Chinese players on VPNs, so definitely do research on the game and the mechanics if you are interested in the game. It feels like a less arthritis-inducing GUNZ to me.
Do expect this game to become an ESPORT once the devs have interest in investing towards that as the game is most certainly only going to grow.

As we know so far, there are plenty of games that are filled by Chinese people: CSGO, PUBG, APEX, and League of Legends......This phenomenon is normal for those old gamers, which makes the game more competitive.
However, I want to say Chinese gamers are not born for games with talents, same as everyone. Gaming is like life, we should put effort into it, and then we gain. The past of half year ago, there were less skills resources on the internet for new players from different countries, and it caused many Chinese players had diverse skills that other players didn't have. But now, many overseas bloggers post on latest and detailed videos with skills and combo , although it takes time for learning and practicing, but it guides overseas players benefit as same as Chinese players. So far, the rank list appeals with mass of excellent Eurpean players, and rank top of solo is an Eurpean player as well.

The game is considered competitive, but I would say it is more a game of luck. Those who are lucky to find a better drop - have more chances to win. Some characters have weird hitboxes, the parry is not always working, and some weapons are extremely strong, I would even say broken. 
I really like the aesthetics and environment, the assets look cool as hell and customizations are beautiful, but it would be better to be able to change the top, bottom and shoes apart instead of choosing one single skin. It's weird that you can customize your character's face even more in detail than in sims, but you don't have too much choice with the clothes.
In order to make this game more competitive it would be fine to do an adjustment of the battle system, because i feel like it's not fair to be defeated with 3 hits broken pole, or the focus of the katana that it's almost impossible to parry as the player can release the charge button  when he wants and you can't predict.
The only thing you may have to learn is the combos of each weapon to try to parry them when they are on blue focus, IF YOU HAVE LUCK the parry may work!
Also bots may be annoying because they can see you through the walls and even when you are hiding in the bushes.
Despite all that, I like the game because the feeling of being more lucky next time and winning keeps you excited for hours.

If you are wondering why this is a potential problem, I'd recommend googling the implications that come with disabling memory integrity. But for those who don't want, core isolation essentially protects core windows processes from being accessed by potentially malicious software, by disabling it, you're essentially exposing these processes to potential hackers that can tamper with them.As for whether said anticheat does contain a virus is very unlikely. Other games have built in anticheats that also access the Windows Kernel driver, such as RIOT Vanguard that is necessary to run Valorant. The only difference between these two systems is that Valorant prompts you to grant it permission to run in the kernel upon installation, whereas NARAKA asks you to disable it so it can access it, and with the fact that both games have been out for years and neither have had any legal actions against them aside from multiple [i](valid)[/i] suspicions means that they may both share the same trait of being safe to use.Considering the large amount of players and the plethora of positive reviews, I would doubt that the game comes with a virus. Those that claim that it's another Chinese game that the government are using to spy on machines, though could be right since there is a possibility for anything, are most likely over-exaggerating how dangerous this game is, especially since it's been reviewed by IGN & GameSpot and is available on PC and consoles including Xbox and PlayStation, the latter not even having a memory integrity for you to disable in the first place.[i]And if you're worried about your data being sold, I can guarantee that you've browsed enough of the internet to have that happen multiple times by now.[/i][i][b]TL;DR[/b], anticheat probably isn't a virus but the way the game wants to run is super sus and I'd hope they change it in the future. As for the game, it's a lot of fun. For me, it was an alternate to Spellbreak after it shut down earlier this year and, although I do prefer Spellbreak, it's a great choice for someone who loved the game like myself.[/i]And if I'm wrong about all of this and the game is revealed to have ratted all your computers, don't blame me xoxo",1679691383,1679691465,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Yeah reinstalled to try to get into a match... dead game is dead... 40k players in China maybe...

What It Is:
A battle royale focused around melee combat rather than guns. This is actually a lot more entertaining than you would think, with movement being a big part of the gameplay.

Gameplay:
A very combo heavy, methodical combat which requires you to be on your toes constantly, especially when fighting multiple enemies at once. Movement skills are a must, quick inputs and good timing are necessary. It's to the walls at all times.

Difficulty:
Skill ceiling is not visible.

Graphics:
Pretty good, they aren't the best or groundbreaking but you won't be disappointed by them by any means. Personally I like my frames so I run them low.

Audio:
Fantastic 360 degree immersive sound.

Replay Value:
Depends how far your patience goes. This game is a true test of it.

What I Like:
The combat is unique, the gameplay is fast paced, the animations are smooth. Everything is here for this game to be really nice and unique and fun to play.

What I Don't:
Nerfed a large portion of the games movement via scale rush, and haven't address any of the realistic balance problems the game has. 

I don't even have fun anymore, every single match in Gold V to Gold I and back down again is just a bunch of SEA sweatlards and it's ruining the NA gameplay, not to mention local leaderboards are broken because of CN players using VPNs (RIP to being #1 in my state since randomly one day an Asian player was at the top :shrug:)

Leaderboards are infested with boosters using new accounts/friends to drop ELO and farm.

Improper teaming within Asian teams is common at higher ranks (they like killing NAs).

Hitboxes are buggy (both because of latency/netcode and because they aren't very accurate).

Parry has reached a state of full uselessness.

There is NO proper ranked system for matches. You'll be matched with Silvers in Plat, and Plats in Bronze. It literally is just a clusterfrick at this point. As of this review I am Gold IV and have been Plat once, and in that time I have seen more Plats as a Gold IV than I ever did as a plat. It's goofy as hell.

I wouldn't buy this game to be honest. The devs show no interest in fixing common and REAL player complaints, instead erring on the side of using surveys which are vastly weighted in favor of the CN player answers (most of whom all main the broken characters/weps so they never receive the nerfs they need.)

Honestly man, after 240+ hours  (80+ IN GAME, ~500 matches) and being WR on one of the characters (former Temulch #50) I can honestly say I hate the state of this game. Devs have released a new character which is busted and basically replaces an existing one with better skills. They don't seem to actually care about anything other than shelling out 20 dollar skins for weps and characters at lightning paces.

If you're an American with a social life or a family or full time job you will never achieve SEA levels of sweatiness, leaving every game to become dodge the guy with the asiatic name until final circle and then get smacked because their parry worked facing 180 degrees away from you.",1631496508,1679438899,False,53,3,0.736446380615234375,0,True,False,False

If you attack, you have to wait for 1-2 seconds to be able to move or do anything other than continuing hitting. So if the opponent decides to run away, you have to stand still waiting, while he's hopping one thousand miles away from you.

If the enemy decides to run away you have two options - give up or chase him across the map for the rest of the game, because there are exactly 0 ways to stop them. You can hook into them, but all that will achieve is that you'll have to stand still for another 5 seconds while the enemy keeps running, because it stuns them for microsecond, while you slowly fall down and then wait for the afteranimation cooldown to end before you can chase.

The fights themselves are a chaotic mess, since characters have super short bursts of speed that can be used indefinitely. So they can just roll around while you try and fail to even target them.

Also wait times are atrocious. Up to 10 minutes waiting for a match during day time",1679424277,1679424277,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Played Naraka when it launched and really enjoyed the game but was struggling with mouse & keyboard controls and vpn users abusing the ping advantage not to mention straight up ch**ters. I came back to the game on & off and still felt not much had changed. I decided to play again this current Season 7 and overall been having a lot more fun in the game than i had before. The balance of bots and real players feels similar to CoD DMZ which i really enjoy, currently platinum rank in trios with the #1 Yoto in my town. I played competitive street fighter for a few years and this game is possibly the closest thing to Cap-com's classic & Tenchu mixed together. There are still some ping abusers but overall feels a lot more balanced than it did before with the addition of game pass. I recommend it to anyone who likes fighting games, be prepared for a very tall skill ceiling, you will get destroyed at first. I got into Genshin Impact and that has helped my m&k skill coming from controllers and recommend that to new players before getting into a game like this.",1652658502,1679170974,True,0,0,0.436666667461395264,0,True,False,False

The gameplay seems simple at first, but the parry and ability to delay attacks, along with modifying moves with the Soulgem system adds a lot of depth to it. The monetization is a bit much for not being a F2P, but the thing that makes this bearable is full progression in the Bot Mode. I just don't have the time to dedicate myself to a single game, so being able to progress at my own pace and enjoy the game on a casual level is what makes this the only BR I've actually enjoyed since PUBG's first release. I hear that this game sucks if you're trying to play it against other people like a normal BR, but I have to thank 24 Entertainment for allowing people like me to enjoy the game. I'm still buying the cosmetics and battle passes too, so more BR devs should really follow in this game's footsteps in this regard. ♥",1678623253,1678623253,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sounded like a mere suggestion, in reality this game can ONLY be played on an SSD. My WD Black hard drive died right after playing this game for 5 mins top. It was under a year old so I got a new one for ""free"" easily. I would had never tried to play this game on an HDD if they simply were 100% honest and said they made this game to be played on an SSD only.

What really grinds my gears is that I reached out to the devs, no respond. I posted here about the issue and on the sub reddit, my post got removed within minutes. The concept of this game sounds amazing but the devs are shady, I just upgraded my PC - using an SSD now but now I don't feel like i can trust this game/devs.

But worry not its not that hard you only have to choose from a bountiful of champs to pick from, no they're not balanced at all, but don't worry just become a meta slave! and you'll be A okay.
Meta will be a combination of trash champions that people with low self esteem and body oder that just wont go away and their mother has given up hope on employment for them.
No matter how much the community complains about the obvious advantaged other champs and weapons have above others there wont be a patch/update for like 2-3 seasons and even then the nerf is hardly noticeable. The term ""nerf"" to E24 only means reducing damage but 5% maybe (this really doesn't change anything) *visibly sick*. 
There are a ton of weapons to chose from ranged and melee and an infinite way to combo with them which is amazing.
Its too bad that in recent seasons they are only re skinning weapons that have the same move set and calling them ""new"" e.g (spear, staff, polearm and greatsword) the difference between these weapons is very minor but im unable to blame E24 for this due to time not providing enough weapon variants throughout history.
Anime fans will be hyped though there is big sword that skinny anime twink boy wields, dagger that sneaky assassin has (meta for that last 4-5 season. no i wont stop complaining), longsword oooo crouching tiger, hidden dragon anyone?, dual blades are cool, nunchucks wow so cool bruce lee so wow or some call numchucks because they cant read and lastly the weeb sword thats been folded over 10,000 times!!! katana!!!.
there are ranged weapons and they are about what you would expect from a melee focused game.
                                                                                  Summary      
This game is fun you'll have a fun time, not in ranked when you get bent over by a team that has 4k more hours than you.
Weapons ranged and melee are all fun to use. All champs are fun just balancing needs correcting but no dev gets it right so you'll just deal with it like everyone else. Overall you'll have a decent time.",1676804352,1677495568,True,65,48,0.718990802764892578,6,True,False,False

They want to censor skins after they were released already, after people already bought them which is a massive red flag from this developer. This alone should cause caution or refusal to purchase from their ridiculous in game cash shop

The monetization is loot boxes and constantly tries to nickel and dime the playerbase despite being a pay to play game

The game is loaded on ""infinite"" combos of which the devs have had plenty of time to fix and just have not done so. There is actual combos in the game, but there is little reason to do them when you can just throw an infinite and guarantee the kill. While in some cases they have to have specific circumstances such as flat terrain this isn't the case for every character/weapon nor is this an excuse to leave infinites in the game, those who defend this use the infinites themselves and usually can't win fights without them to begin with.

The game is immensely imbalanced with some characters just having clear edge over the rest of the roster entirely and in some cases like the greatsword being able to charge up a vertical level 3 and 1 shot you even in the highest tier armors while you can parry it, the ability to 1 shot or infinite isn't the players fault, it is the devs for not actually caring to balance the game for proper competitive play. Infinites and 0hko in this kind of game should never be an issue.

The game is littered with chinese VPN users which is where a huge portion of the population is coming from on the charts of which be ready to face extensive lag and desync. Despite this being against terms of service and regulations, nothing is done or will be done about this. 

The Servers themselves are just not that good nor are the hitboxes, expect weird happenings such as being hit when you are behind your target, parried even though you swung at a different target, smallest adjustments to height causing your weapon to whiff for no reason even though animation wise the weapon visibly connects, etc

The games ranked systems and matchmaking will pair you with players way above your skill threshold, Bronze ranks can fight gold and above. Don't expect to be properly matched up against people of equal skill

Game doesn't explain itself all that well and you will find yourself digging around for information, the Wiki provided in game is completely outdated and unusable. Expect yourself to be studying from other players on how to play this game and it's movement mechanics and combos

If You don't have a solid state drive or better expect massive issues with crashing, stuttering, lag, etc due to awful optimizations. The game will actually warn you if you launch from a regular hard drive that the game is recommended to be on a solid state. Considering how many games out there run just fine on a hard drive this is the devs poor excuse for being lazy on it's optimization to run better.

Console players are at disadvantage due to input issues and lower frame rates, despite this we have crossplay that is mandatory turned on and cannot be turned off on steam but can be shut off on consoles, which creates an unfair atmosphere

There is bots galore even in ranked mode which gives a false sense of superiority and creates bad habits, half the time you won't know if it's a player or not just starting out till you realize just how braindead the bots are. There is a way to turn off bots on the xbox versions but not the steam version. Once you play a lot you will run into more players, but this is also a unique way to get you past that 2 hour limit of play time so you can no longer refund the game and see all the glaring issues.

Voice acting is dreadful and gets annoying after a while, especially when your in loading screens and your characters say the exact same line to each other every single time you go in a loading screen with your friend

Game is more centered around rock paper scissors and movement, abusing ""focus"" which is a form of super armor in a way, proceeding to whoever gets the hit in will just throw you into an infinite, while there is ways to get out of the infinite all they have to do is land another attack and your back in the ""combo"". Landing another attack is simple when attacks cause you to fly across the screen and hit them at ridiculous ranges.

Map is far too large for such a small group of players and a lot of times you will find yourself mindlessly wandering around trying to find someone, the community seems to instead prefer to all spawn in the same regions but this isn't an excuse for this design. Bots will randomly teleport to your location to keep things ""active"" and then randomly die later to the gas due to poor AI

The game suffers from cheaters all the same with the VPN's flooding over here and just doing the same here, videos on teleportation among other exploitative cheats are a thing you may encounter next to lag switching and the regular desync.


Despite the issues the game can still be fun and technically it can be fixed if the devs would actually sit down and address the issues currently present instead of worrying about more cosmetics to pump their cash flow or making the game mobile and also work on previous gen consoles but until they actually manage to fix the game I can't recommend the game to people. It is quite cheap on Sale, so if your interested in it wait till then as you can buy the game for like $10 or just go grab this on xbox game pass PC as it's free on there this way you save yourself the trouble of spending money on it",1677098406,1677109543,False,9,0,0.566807329654693604,0,True,False,False

Game is fun for a few games in a session especially with friends. There's lot of in game events, which is nice. The character customization is nice as well (you have to grind/pay for a lot of the stuff on the customization tho). 

Too heavy on gacha for a game i have to pay for, but these are purely cosmetic so you don't have to spend any extra money if you don't want to.
However the gacha is really scummy, so be mentally prepared to spend a lot of money if you want the rarest cosmectics (or hope to get really lucky).
 
Technical side: FPS problems with RTX 30XX cards. Had to create a firewall exception to play the game, had issues with wifi connection after i did this. Also the game tries hard to gather your personal information, which is just bizarre (this does require your consent tho).

Gameplay wise: There's A LOT of bots. Parry mechanic feels off. There's a big power gap between different player levels, which is stupid in a battle royale game.

The game has a lot of good ideas with subpar execution. If you want to play a melee combat focused battle royale game, Naraka is the best one out there, even with all it's horrendous flaws.

Pros:

++ Melee combat focused battle royale.
+ Game is fun for few games at a time, especially with friends in the team mode.
+ The battle pass refunds the in game currency, if you complete it.
+ PvE Game mode is actually not that bad, another fun for a few games at a time mode where you smack some monsters and it has a pretty nice difficulty curve.
+ In game events
+ Looks good
+ Character customization
+ Controller & cross platform support.
+ All heroes are unique, both gameplay & visual/audio design.

Cons:

--- I have to disable my firewall to play the game (wtf?)
--- Personal info gathering
--- Too much gacha in a game i have to pay for.
-- Scummy gacha.
-- FPS problems with RTX 30XX cards
-- BOTS
--- Survival mode is really boring at times, there's nothing to do on the map and there's too few players
--- Big empty maps
- Parry mechanic feels off
- Targeting assistance is really wonky at times, you can disable tho.
-- Player level difference bonus is huge
-- RNG on looted items
-- PvE is only available on weekends between certain hours. You can't just log in with your friends and play it.
- You have to log in every day for events/passes/etc. You can't play whenever you want to if you want to complete them.
-- Event pass is obviously rigged, to try to push you into buying levels (the levels are REALLY expensive)
- Projectiles don't travel like you'd expect them to.
- Grappling hook collision.
- Trees
- Cliffside combat.
- Can't play with fist weapons/hand to hand combat in a wuxia game (really?)
- Cross platform problems
- Can't change character skill loadout in game, this has to be done in queue/before you queue.
- Heavily limited access to cosmetics without spending extra money.
- Chinese smurfs.
- All cosmetics are locked to a single hero. You can't cross customize with any of your cosmetics, which honestly sucks.",1676189726,1676191886,False,3,0,0.502688169479370117,0,True,False,False
1203220,113611480,76561197987384688,0,2,6552,0,1102,1677124334,"All the negative reviews that cite the issue with Chinese players ruining the game for the NA/EU audience could not be more true. I read them, bought the game anyway to give it a shot and your very first public match you'll be greeted to just how bad it is trying to play against someone from China using a VPN. You can't hit them, you can't counter them and they'll land 100% of their abilities on you no problem. 

The fact that more of an effort hasn't been taken to remove these players using VPN's, lag-switches and other nefarious methods to get the upper hand in this game shows just how little the Dev's care about porting this game to the west. It's to the point when you queue into a match, just look for the players with Chinese characters in their name and you'll already find the winners of each round.

Couple the above with the fact that this game is basically a melee-clone of Apex Legends with a generic ""eastern"" theme and suffers from the same lack of new maps (any), that Apex did for months means you'll get tired of the same play each time. 

If getting face-rolled for hours on end by Chinese players in an apex-knockoff battle-royal game is your jam, then 10/10 this is for you. For everyone else thats sane and isn't a masochist, look elsewhere.

**UPDATE: 12 FEB 23**
At the urging of a friend I picked this game back up because he said, and I quote, ""they changed the game a lot! It's a lot more friendly to new players now!"" allow me to enlighten you all to what new player friendly is for this game developer...

-There's now a rating system for ranked matches, think arena rating and MMR from like WoW if you played. You start of at like Bronze V and work your way down numerically V, IV, III, II, I, etc until you're in the next bracket so on and so forth. 

In theory, this means you're only supposed to go against other players around your same MMR, hence keeping the Chinese players that have no-life'd this game from its inception out of your games, right? Wrong. 

There's so few players in that low MMR (low bronze for new players) that the queue times for those matches  would be astronomical so what did the Dev's do? They fill those low-ranked matches with bots, ez-mode bots, in ranked matches. However they give the bots random names like Taitai2000$ and other randomness so you think you're playing against other players and giving you the ""feel"" like the MMR system is working. It gives you the illusion that you'll be able to work your way up the brackets and -gradually- face stronger players as your own skills improve. Its a farce. From Bronze V to Bronze II it's nothing but bots with the occasional other NA player in the same boat as you. There's even a badly translated tooltip on one of the screens that reads something along the lines of ""robotic players decrease as you ascend through each stage"". The whole thing is designed to catch you and make you think you're successful. 

-Then we get into Bronze II, I and Silver Tiers and above. This is where you encounter the carries. Chinese players back again in full force, tanking their own MMR, or queuing with brand new accounts that sit AFK in party so it drags their main account down into your MMR so they can fight you for the ez-wins. So what does this all mean? The game is still not region locked. You still fight players from China and all over the world and fight their internet connections, their lag, and their no-life status on the game. Instead of region locking the game like many NA players have called for the Dev's create this fake MMR system. A system designed to pull the wool over your eyes, and make you believe you're actually achieving something. In reality all you're doing is being prepared as fodder for ""far eastern"" players who are either too bad, or too bored of playing against each other that they want to ruin your gaming experience instead.

Maybe in part because it's the first time I've played on with such an emphasis on melee.  And I was having a real good time with it too.  I was focusing on achievements though, and I think that's what eventually killed it for me.  There are a pair that require you get a melee and ranged weapon to level 25, and the time it takes to do this is unforgivable.  I was focusing specifically on the ranged weapon one and it kind of took all the fun out of it.  Yes, I could have just said screw it and started playing normally again, but as any completionist would agree, that just wasn't going to sit well.  So I think I'm done.  I put a good chunk of time into it and bought the game on sale for like 10 bucks.  So I can't really complain, it was totally worth the money.

If you love leaderboards and ranked this game gets addicting. HOWEVER no option to turn off bot overfill on RANKED. Bots will actively clash every attack and parry every attack when in a middle of a light spam clash off, you think you can animation cancel to get them to parry? nope. They always parry on the last frame they can so its impossible to play against. At this point id rather play against ping abusers and top 100 players then have a lobby full of frame perfect bots and maybe 1-6 real people in the game. I was so excited for mostly player lobbies everyone talks about in plat1+  but uh currently  50mmr away from solar 5 and so far 90% bots every lobby i get no matter the game mode. IF you like playing against AIs that simulate player behavior while still being frame perfect get this game. I still reccomend because its perfect fighting mechanics and makes you think, and is super fluid. But it needs more players on the west, or at least a way to play against only players vs AI(Machine learning is absolutely op).",1675628565,1675628565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1st of all melee weapons are an major point in the game. I am very doubtful that you will be able to win an entire match based only on range weapons (if it comes to solo queue). 
All the characters have their own abilities,  just as I've seen in other most recent BR games.
Graphically games is a gem, of course if you can run it on your PC that is on max settings, but even on lower settings it looks amazing.

Disagreements:      I'll have to say, some people say the movement is bad, clunky, that it's too hard to play or learn, or there is not enough payout in general. I stand on the other side of the fence to say that is incorrect. Once you get things down, fights are exciting. lol. I haven't been excited in a game for a long time, like, heated excited when massive fights break out and people are flying everyone. XD 

Agreements:     Chinese (I apologize in advance, though the truth) need to stay on their server. The high ping is a disruption to NA players and can ultimately turn away a lot of players. Not due to the game being too hard or can't learn, but really the issue in lag where you can even parry on time, and the other person saw nothing and was able to rock your world. It's a situation that I believe will be the downfall for Naraka if they do not fix this asap since it has turned away some of the audience for NA already.

Final Thoughts : The game is great, I love it and will continue to get better and be a Chinese player killer. lol.  A few things to note though, are there is ranking, quickplay, and a Bloodbath mode when you reach level 10.
DO. NOT. SLEEP. ON. Bloodbath mode, nor training. 
Bloodbath is a 8 man fight to the death with fast raises so you are in and out of the fight and get solid practice.
Training is a EXCELLENT way to learn the items in game, use them and get a understanding of them, and even have a advanced bot you can fight that will do a few tricks players will use so you can adapt better in situations. 

P.S. Don't button mash....You will get parried. XD

P.S.S Lootboxes are ass drop rates, and super pricey. Everyone has to make money, but this is a bit much. In today's age, money is a hard source to come by (enough) to even live here in the US (can't speak for anywhere else). So people are not really for lootboxes unless feeling rich. Even Genshin Impact you have better chances at the top grade drop for less so, that's food for thought on the lootbox systems.

Sure you get bot lobbies at start a lot, even when higher rank there are still some bots here and there. But I have been fighting against a lot of real players too. It really depends on which time you play this game for now, since the playerbase in the EU is low. 

I really like the visuals and that you can learn a lot of skills/movement/combo's in this game. It has a lot variety of weapons and also characters with different abilities that you can also customize (skills, character, outifits, accessoires ect) to make the character your own character. 

Playing in custom lobbies with friends is also a great way to practice when either the queue time is a bit low or you just want to get better.

not noob friendly but fun to learn, sweaty to master!

EDIT:

Game has revamped PVE and it feels alot better, still needs more content and development and being able to play it only on the weekends is still disappointing, but fighting the bosses does feel great to accomplish! just would like maybe 8 more of them haha!

they fixed the game pass issue.

The only thing i can tell you here is dont get tilted and dont give up. Its worth trust me.

Here some quick beginner tips:

Watch some Guides even tho most of them are outdatet they still give very usefull information.

Also look for bloodbath and 1v1 Custom matches in the beginning as much as possible to get used to the fighting system so you dont have the tilt by going to loot for 8 hours only to get destroyed over and over again without any learning effect.

Movement is key in this game and makes 60 % of the skill difference, maybe even more. So after learning the basic fighting you need to learn how to move efficently. It actually is also 50 % of the fun in this game, since you are doing it all the time.

I love the aestethic of the game and the different filter options it has (so you can customize the looks fitting to your liking should you have a strong enough pc) 

The combat is simple but complex enough for every taste and every mechanic has counterplay. 

There was never a time i felt like i couldnt do anything about anything its always shit i could have dodged then go for a light attack etc. 

I like games like these really much and i enjoy it. 

Some people say there are bots or it is a dead game which is not the case at all i really recommend you trying it out there are pvp modes:

Battle royal
Arena
PVE 
and everything is connected to reward systems that you can either buy for money or just grind. 

There is a gamepass for it which is really good value but i myself never bought anything for money except the core game for like 30 bucks. 
 
I have nice aestethic freedom due to the customizer tool for skin facecial features etc. 

The team really puts in effort to make the game balanced and i think it is. 

SO far i've played like 10 games in gold of which i've won the past 6 as 1 rank and i gotta say it feels so rewarding once you understand the system to a detail. 

For example now there is a ashen katana that is only available through grinding quests and it actually rewards you for putting in the time(to my knowledge not even buyable throug money) 
so it gives you the sense of prestige if you want it.

the combat system is easy to learn hard to master. 

the characters are all attractive and unique while simultaneously fully customizable to the point i literally turned one of mine in to a full blown furry with a slight muzzle and everything. so 9.5/10 with the character editor. (can be done with any of the characters for the most part because most have animal ear attachment options) 

the only issue i can come to think of is the dual blades being a bit strong, very minor balancing required, im enjoying the game now <3 good work yall

The skill requirement is massive. It is not a hack-and-slash game unless you enjoy losing your weapon and half your health.

The movement can be insane if you know how to and watching a top player play, you will feel like you never played a fighting game before.

Unfortunately, there isn't a big player base. It is mostly bots you will play against except maybe during weekends when you're around mid gold and under. When you're above that, GL because thats where the real fight begins.

Now the problem was long LONG queue times. When i started out i played solo match just to start. Sometimes i lasted a while sometimes i died fast. 
So when i died i wanted to get back into the game and play again. problem was sometimes those wait times would take 5- 17 mins. yes you heard that right i waited 17 mins for a quick match game. at that point i gave up waiting and the game. Other problems were imbalances that i notice. some Players that have played a while were in the quick match games that could move and dodge way faster then new players. grapple longer and quicker as well.  Also customer service was not working, along with text, and customization. 24 entertainment said they were fixing it but its been a week and nothing. So here's my two cents

Pros: Fun mechanics
         Great Graphics

Cons: Medium to very Long wait times
          Text still didn't work
          Type any word into customer service and nothing helps

The weapons have neat and varied movesets and the combat feels rewarding once you start to get the hang of it. Movement is pretty quick with the grappling hook once you learn the techniques. 

While the cosmetics are expensive, you can get a decent amount without microtransactions over time. Each hero can be character customized with a pretty decent character creator. You can go as far as to make some unholy abominations of characters if that is what you are into. 

When you start you will be playing with some bots as it adjusts to your skill level. I thought it was a bit weird at first but after a few matches you'll start getting placed with players. Matches seem to be mostly around 50 players for me. There are a few different game modes to play in as well.

I like Naraka's setup, its design and combat systems are cool and it takes sometime to get used to the way its defense is played. The Ranking-System is a bit off, since in almost every match ""EU"" there is 1 to 5 much higher ranked player present and those usually destroy me in under 5sec with no chance of even getting in a hit, that's frustrating yes, but its a PvP game so . . . normal :)
All in all i can say i like to play Naraka, as a standard Battleroyal game its a nice asset to the genre!

This games monetization however including its RNG setup concerning loot-boxes and prices for Skins ""mostly just re-skins"" is absolutely appalling. And now adding to this an Addon that servers no real value to the game and charging no small amount of money for that is as well just sickening.

So to answer your Question why none of my friends play this game, because the answer is: Its a Chinese game man, they make it a principal to try to make you pay for everything and we don't like that!

They like the game, but they do not like your monetization. That said seeing how you are charging for the Asura DLC and for every season to come, in which you give basically no chance to obtain the loot by playing, even if one play's a lot i might take my leave of this game as well, its getting silly.

Sadly another game done correctly and screw up because of money . . . . . quite often these days!

Competitive combat mechanics with a very high skill ceiling
A variety of unique playable heroes
Amazing character customization
Freedom of movement the likes of which I've never seen
Frequent updates

Cons:
Some of the ultimates have 0 counterplay unless you happen to be playing the hero that directly counters it.
Bots
This game does not need 9 ranked tiers right now.

Overall, this game has quite a bit to improve but it is at it's core, a very good game with a lot of future potential to be great. Definitely the best in terms of BR.

From the moment of installation I felt like Holy Christ carrying his cross to Golgotha. After being forced to reload the game several times, I was finally able to see the menu, only to get kicked back to the desktop in a matter of seconds. And before anyone starts thinking that my hardware was not sufficient, I'd like to mention that the game was optimised for high details with nvidia experience. Once I was able to access the lobby - finally, what was the first thing I saw? A bunch of notifications like: pay for this to unlock that. What was even the point of paying money for this game, if from the very beginning i get informed that i won't make any real progress without paying more money. But to hell with that, I should've expected that from a multiplayer game. Finally I managed to play a few matches, and it didn't really surprise me, that I got kicked back into the lobby or all the way back to desktop. After reloading the game i saw a notice that the match is still ongoing, and asking me if I wish to continue. I push the YES button, and where does it lead me? To the entirely different match than i was in before. On my steam account it shows me almost 5 hours of gameplay, but nearly four of them were spent trying to make this game actually work, instead of playing.

Countless posts online about seemingly rigged chances at boxes, for the premium loot box you would have to spend $300 for 100 chances which guarantees one (1) of the highest rarity items from the loot pool, and you can get duplicates of the same item

There's also a shop where you can outright buy items which is still gonna cost you, anything that looks like it took more than 5 minutes to create is gonna cost you a minimum of $12 (on sale)

And I was really enjoying first few dozens of hours of this game. I think I played it for 20 hours on saturday and sunday when I bought it, I was way too absorbed into it. But the more I played it, the more I realized how insane everyone else is in this game, and that I felt I just can't get to their level.

What makes this game so damn hard (for me at least) is the parrying. When you do a focus attack which is when you charge a horizontal or vertical attack that deals much more damage than common attacks, the opponents can parry the focus attack and then they can counter attack right after parrying which deals around 1000 damage (depending which gun the opponents use) and you have 1000 health and armor goes 500 white, 750 blue, 1000 purple, 1250 gold and 1500 red.

So there's a lot of mind games in this game, the higher skill you reach, the more careful you have to be of your opponents. Making sure you won't get parried when you focus attack and being able to combo your common attacks. I'd recommend checking out OSK Gaming on youtube, he does a lot of great guides for improving your gameplay.

One thing I could add is that the cracked players in this game are asian players and there's no region lock so eventually you'll be matched up with them and you should start saying your prayers when you face them.",1664729912,1664729912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Imagine you are silver 5, barely understanding the game and you are matched against #4 on the server with hundreds of hours in RANKED mode (1,6k mmr vs 4,7k XD).
Shooting part of the game is awful to partake in.
Zone moves too slowly, makes too little damage, match takes 30 minutes and it's maybe 5 minutes of actual gameplay.
Filled with bots, acceptable within first few hours but these are present in every lobby, other chinese franchise (CB) that had 4-6k players daily matched bots only for like first 20 hours and afterwards players from every skill level got their games and enjoyed themselves, this has daily 130k and can't ? impossible. 
Steamcharts numbers are boosted by chinese that just come over to EU/NA and smurf on people with bronze rank while being solar+ in china absolutely demolishing already small playerbase. look how many play at 20 pm CET, prob has ~15k globally split into servers and then 10 game modes running at all times, Slaughtered by their own devs keeping it this way for EU/NA without region lock and the fun fact is EU/NA are actually region locked from chinese servers, irony.
Set region lock, remove solo modes, make it F2P or at least drop price by half to retain players otherwise I give it a year maybe 2 until tipping point.

EDIT: 5 out of 8 people i've got to meet so far stopped playing due to chinese smurfing. In lobbies ""with ease"" I die 90 % of the time to those. Tick tock tick tock.",1662659651,1664545747,False,1,0,0.502369701862335205,0,True,False,False

The difficulty of this game is not inherent. Inherently, the combat system is easy to learn, difficult to master, and extremely fun. No, the difficulty of this game is in how many people have already gotten a head start on you on the mastering part, and how few resources (guides, tutorials, and the like) there are to help you catch up to them. To fully enjoy this game, you will have to make the conscious effort to get better at it. If you do, though, you will be rewarded with some of the most fun you can have in a battle royale game.

Fortunately for players that want to put in that effort, the game is actually quite balanced, resulting in a fairly smooth - if steep - learning curve. At first, though, it won't feel that way. You'll always feel like you're playing the weaker character or the using the weaker weapon. You aren't. Given enough time and experience, you'll get owned so many times by seemingly OP moves from every weapon and seemingly OP abilities from every character that you'll realize that everything is OP. And when everything is OP, nothing is. When everything is good, then you get a good experience playing anything. Until you inevitably get owned again by something else, that is.

Then there's the character customization. It is no exaggeration to say that this game - a hero based battle royale game of all things - has one of the most detailed character customization systems out there right now. The default characters are all well designed, yes, but there's something special about creating your own perfect looking character then teaming up with Handsome Squidward and Geralt of Rivia to fight against Shrek, Guan Yu, and Thanos. If that example isn't clear enough, then let me state that with the exception of the voice acting (which is quite good) and the body type (which makes sense from a gameplay standpoint), you can change practically everything about a character's appearance. You can sculpt the face to anything you want, and choose from a variety to hairstyles to go with it. You have access to not just clothing, but also accessories that you can put on a characters head, right hip, left hip, back, and so on. Want to make a bejeweled anthro dragon? You can. Want to make a celebrity? I've personally played with Keanu Reeves and Michael Jordan. Anthro bunny girl? Do you even have to ask? Horrific monstrosity that should never have seen the light of day? That's practically the second default.

The detail in the character customization is a reflection of the detail in every other aspect of the game. Weather changes. Sand shifts when you move through it. Sometimes the matches can happen at night and you can see the figure of a woman on the moon. It's beautiful. And everything sounds right. Footsteps on a stone floor. Sliding across gravel. The zip of a grappling hook. The swift zing of a blade cutting through air - or flesh. Beautiful.

The main negative point against this game is actually outside of the gameplay itself. Despite being a buy-to-play game, this game has the monetization system of a free-to-play. Not every character in the roster is available at the start and must either be grinded for or paid for. There's a battle pass and a premium battle pass. Most of the cosmetics are only available for a limited time, the detailed ones are paid (at exorbitant prices), and the few that you can get for free are locked behind a loot box system that the game is stingy to give you free boxes for. The menu UI also looks like it was taken straight out of a gacha game. You are constantly bombarded with banners, promotions for various things the game is related to, and notifications for mail/missions/loot/etc with no way to get them all out of the way except going through them one by one.

There are some good points to the paid systems. For example, the premium battle pass will pay for itself as long as you complete it after buying it once, and the gacha system's guaranteed item pity does not reset until you hit the number of draws for the pity (the game even has a helpful counter that tells you how many draws you have until you get an item of a certain rarity regardless of what you've gotten before that point). But despite those, the level of monetization in the game feels extremely out of place considering you already have to buy it to play at all.

All-in-all, Naraka: Bladepoint is a great game that deserves more attention than it currently has. While the monetization system in game is somewhat off-putting, it is just for cosmetics and doesn't affect the actual gameplay (or your ability to make your character a clone of Shaquille O'Neal) at all. If you have any interest at all in action games, melee combat, parkour, or battle royales in general, you should definitely give this game a try.",1663962629,1663962629,True,16,1,0.653614819049835205,0,True,False,False

I bought this game when it was on sale, and I've been hooked since. It's a very fun game, with a high skill ceiling, without being too difficult to grasp the fundamentals of. This is very much a skill-based fighting game, and doesn't really play out much like a traditional BR. There's advanced movement tech, the combat flow is super addicting, and beating someone will always feel satisfying. Your first few games will have some bots in them to ease the new player experience. I initially thought this was kind of lame, since I'm not a fan of versing bots in a PVP game, but I found the bots to be very helpful as a new player, as it introduced me to the basic fighting 'loop' or 'flow' of the game. 

The difference between bots and players is very noticeable, and at the start you're going to think this game is quite easy, or basic on the surface. Skilled players who practice combat and movement tech can outplay their opponents 1/2 or even 1/3. While it can be dissuading at the start to get completely stomped by these players after dominating bots for the first couple of hours, sticking with the game and learning the mechanics is definitely worth the time, as the barrier of entry to learning these mechanics is actually very simple. 

Once you get the fundamentals down and start getting the hang of focus dashing, attack cancelling, and parrying/dodging - the game really opens up. There are lots of incredible guides online on YouTube which are very helpful for new players to understand the rhythm and flow of combat, and even putting in a little bit of time practicing these movements and tech made the game vastly more enjoyable for me. You soon realise that the game is made up of quite small technical combos and movements, and highly skilled players are just incredibly good at chaining them together. Once you get those small 'combos' and movements down, like Focus Dashing, crouch cancelling, and parry cancelling, then you naturally string them together, and soon you find yourself in a lot more control, beating a lot more people. 

The game's combat is based off a rock-paper-scissors system of attacks. It basically looks something like this: 

Charged Attacks (Focus) > Light Attacks
Light Attacks > Parries
Parries > Charged Attacks (Focus)

Throw in ranged weapons, unique hero skills, and a dodging mechanic, and what we get is a simple yet nuanced base combat loop which rewards control, prediction, and reaction. A lot of the fights come down to predicting what the other player may do, and making decisions off that. If you know a player always does a Focus attack after their Light attacks, you might predict their next chain and get a crucial parry off, turning the tide of the battle. You can react to what a player might do, like dodge out of their attack and make a huge play off of one clutch aerial combo. What you get is a very 'cat and mouse' like combat loop, where players are constantly poking and testing one another, waiting for an opportune time to strike or punish their opponent. 

There are solos, duos, and trio game modes, as well as some other casual game modes like Bloodsport (TDM) and some PvE and PvEvP ones. I can't speak too much for the casual modes, as I mainly play the ranked ones, but Bloodsport is a good place to warm up and become familiar with the weapons and mechanics of heroes.

There's a decent variety of weapons available, and they each have their own unique playstyle. There are small strategies and approaches you'll need to consider when versing each weapon, which further adds to the depth of the game. 

Contrary to popular belief, I found the servers to be quite populated, and have never waited for more than a couple of minutes for queues, with near instant queues around peak time. My favourite game mode is Solo's, however the most popular game modes are definitely Trios and Duos. For context, I play in Australia, and connecting to the SEA node I get about ~100ms, which is very playable. There's only been a few times where I've died to ping related issues, and those could have been mitigated if I had played better. 

The first thing many players complain about is the abundance of Chinese players in their games, regardless of whichever server they're on. While some of these may be Chinese players connecting to the server from China via a VPN, the majority of these Chinese named players are players within the region, using Chinese characters in their names. This game is massively popular in China, and is somewhat of a cultural phenomenon amongst Chinese diaspora around the world, and as a result, the best players and meta usually comes from that region. So we get a lot of people who want to presumably imitate the level of players over there, and use Chinese characters as their IGN's via Google Translate. In my ~100 hours of playing this game, I can confidently say that I haven't played against anyone with a Chinese name who has a terrible connection, or even lost to another player due to ping differences. 

If you're into highly skill-based games, with plenty of depth for both movement and combat tech, then I highly recommend picking up Naraka. I consider myself a pretty competitive person in terms of the kind of games that I enjoy playing, and I haven't had this much fun learning, and grinding out a game in years. If you're picking it up, my advice is to stick with it and really learn the mechanics and fundamentals of the game, and not to get demoralised or disheartened when you lose to a better player, as I guarantee you that learning the game is not as hard as it looks. The barrier of entry s(kill floor) is actually quite low with learning the tech and fundamentals, and once you learn the basics of movement and combat, you really begin to enjoy the game. On the other hand the skill ceiling (maximum potential, or 'skill') is quite high, with skilled players being able to easily punish and win fights due to their proficiency with combat and movement, and knowledge/prediction of what players might do. If you have any doubts, I'd recommend picking it up on sale, however I would gladly pay full price for this game having experienced it myself.",1663592469,1663592469,True,54,4,0.829974591732025146,3,True,False,False

The game has legit amazing skins for the weapons! Obviously, you gotta cash to get some of the rarest ones, but a lot of them are free and quite easy to obtain! They stream often on twitch and offer them twitch drops so make sure you check this out!

They hooked up me and my friends during the Free to play Weekend and we instantly bought it! (Got lucky it was 50% off!)

The amount of work the devs put into movement makes it truly fun to navigate the world. And there is some serious depth to all the systems in this game, meaning once you hit a wall and feel like you cant beat people in your tier its time to learn some new tech to get the upper edge. You can tell that there is serious passion behind this game. 

I would consider the combat to be souls-like however they have implemented it in such a way that it feels completely different, also its really designed for kb/m. The reason it reminds me of Nioh is the speed and depth of combat. If you have enjoyed any souls-borne/souls-like game and find the br system of something like Apex Legends appealing, then I highly recommend you try this game.

My only gripe, you should be able to enter free training with a friend and practice 1v1ing them, also it would be great for teaching the game to newcomers, so I really hope they add this natively (apparently there is some sort of workaround but it just makes more sense this way). If they added this I would gladly give this game a 10/10.

Pros:
-Firstly and foremost, the game is pretty solid and basically gives you everything that you re hoping for.
-Great graphics, fun playstyle unique weapons, characters and skills. 
-Although the game has a lot of in game purchases it doesnt affect gameplay to the slidest.
-Unique gameplay, out of the box, battle royale.

Cons:
-During fighting, the camera is a little bit shaky, meaning the rotation of the camera while targeting a player is at sometimes unstable, nothing to much. 
-Low variety on characters and weapons, but i ll give it a pass cause its still an early game.
Overall, a pretty damn good game with a unique style of a battle royale. Still needs a lot of work.

No region lock, meaning  you'll be facing lots of Chinese players who haven't touched grass in a long time, and get your ass beat.  Once you grasp the flow, however, it is addictive. Lots of heros to refresh your experience when you feel like things are getting repetitive, likewise the variety of weapons make it easier for you to adopt a new fighting style. The battles really have a feel for them, and you can experience some genuine adrenaline trying to survive. You can play solo or go with a duo / group of 3 people. The game's got a ranking system too which makes it all the better for competitive players such as myself. Moreover, it is not a pay-to-win game, you heard it right! Asian developers, and yet you can get the best cosmetic products simply by spending event points or unlocking chests. Last but not least, the visuals are outstanding. They really excel at conveying the traditional eastern style, I play in the medium settings and even I can stop and just appreciate this relaxing scenery sometimes. The optimization is not the best though.

I've never played these type of games before but after playing the beta this game has been growing on me , So I've decided to buy into the base version , I'm glad I have bought it , I'm really enjoying it and the more I play , the more I discover just how involved the stats go for building up your characters . It's got good progression. At the time of writing this I'm now Lv 35 and I've unlocked a few treasure chests and costumes plus some skins for weapons. Beware of  buying GOLD . It's ludicrous expensive. Some costume sets cost 3000 gold that equals around £20 or more for each one . I'm not spending money on cosmetics but I can see how people will become addicted and buy into it so be careful . You could easily spend hundreds of pounds without realising, I don't mind buying a battle pass now and again but that's all, I'm just going to enjoy the grind and have fun unlocking items in game. The map is a really nice place to game in with beautiful locations and the fighting animations are awesome to see. One more thing - The LOOT boxes suck balls. Gambling should not be allowed in games PERIOD.

Your rank is locked to your region so what happens is top 100s in Asian servers will go to NA and EU servers and start in Bronze V. This makes the ranked modes an absolute nightmare if you haven't spent a great deal of time sharpening your mechanical skills before even touching it. I regularly make it to the top 5 and all it takes to stop me dead is running into someone with a a name written in hanzi or kanji. Between their server lag, the hit or miss netcode and their 2000 hours in the game, I simply can't touch them. A ranked mode should never be so bad that you are running into smurfs every single game. That said, I still give the game itself a fair shake.
It has some of the best melee oriented combat I have encountered. The art style is gorgeous.
It's very unique in a an overpopulated genre. The flow of movement when mastered is a pleasure to watch and feels great to perform. It uses a paper-rock-scissors system to determine the victor when using light attacks, focus attack and ripostes that works amazingly well.

I'd recommend this game on the following conditions:
- You want a game with top notch melee combat.
- You want a a challenging experience in skill based combat.
- You like Chinese mythology themed action games.

I would not recommend if:
- You want a fair and balanced matchmaking experience.
- You are easily frustrated.
- You want to play a range focused game.",1662846424,1662847839,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

however i cant say i recommend it because the game seems to favor high ping players over low ones. players with high ping will normally faze through attacks when they should be stunned or staggered, teleport behind attacks that can visibly be seen connecting, and they Normally ignore parries that should have connected. (parries in this game are incredibly important because they are counters that not only stun the player but make them drop their weapon) this is an issue developers said they addressed in the recent patch, but they did not and in fact made it worse. 

players normally complain about this issue of favoring high ping players to no avail. its a VERY large issue and i can not recommend this game to anyone, unless its fixed because in a good number of cases it makes the game unplayable.",1662583416,1662583416,False,1,0,0.502369701862335205,0,True,False,False

There is depth to it like mordhau and chiv but not at all the same game.
BR is interesting to see for this type of game but it fits.
Yoto hime is a bit over tuned I feel for getting gold focus in her ult but other than that all of the chars are in line either doing dmg or not taking dmg for an ult, you either excel at one or the other. The ranged weapons exist but are easy to counter by just attacking and you'll destroy the projectiles.
I've had a lot more fun than I thought I would and I highly recommend this game for 20$!

Its super fun to play, characters and their skills are also extremely fun in their own way and no character is 'extremely busted' they, i would say are all on par with each other as they all bring something to a team/duo solo etc.
NOT pay to win which some people say, its pay only for cosmetics, which you don't have to buy if you choose not to.

I would say the only few cons with this game is their servers do need a bit of an update, it can take quite a while to get into a q more than 10mins at a time and when it gets later it can be up to 30mins (CASUAL MODE) so if you feel like you want to play you're kinda forced to play rank and some people dont like the aspect of rank.

The game's monetisation is exactly, almost copy paste, from that of Apex Legends but with an £18 price tag.
There are 3 currencies:
      Tae: The freemium currency that you'll use to unlock characters and low tier cosmetics which you'll eventually have in abundance
      Gold: The premium currency that you use to purchase cosmetics or lootboxes
      Silk: A crafting material where you can unlock certain cosmetics but unlike Apex where you can unlock all cosmetics at  any time there is a store rotation of a select few skins

As the game is freemium with an £18 price tag the player base is pretty low and as such you'll encounter your fair share of bots to boost up the players in the lobby. Another symptom of the low player count is that ranked is abhorrent! For example, I'm silver 5 (pretty shit) and when I queue up I'm matched with the server's #177 player just so I don't have a long wait time. These issues can be solved from an injection of players by making the game free to play.

Readability is the final point I want to touch on - as the game allows massive amount to customisation it's hard to tell characters apart from a glance and some abilities are game changers like takeda has an ability where he can auto-parry your attack, sometimes mid animation; take your weapon away and heal basically guaranteeing a won 1v1.

Overall, I would love to recommend this game however there are some glaring flaws both with monetisation and player base.",1662486588,1662487036,False,1,0,0.503816783428192139,0,True,False,False

On another note, I played this game for 10 hours before taking a break for a few months due to not having time. After trying to get back into the game, my account was reset. All progress was gone. Not talking about season stats but my overall stats like character level, overall playtime across my first season, etc. I spoke to Customer Support and they claim that I was only level 7 and logged in 6 times but that they see no abnormalities with my account and made sure to reassure me that they do not wipe accounts and that I probably left the game open for 10 hours. Keep in mind, I have played for 10 hours, which means at least 6 times I left the game open totaling up to 10 hours in idle time and also never played the game. I was level 1 when I logged in on Sept 3rd, 2022. I purchased the game after the official release (not beta).

I wish I would have kept the screenshots and videos I had of the gameplay but that is on me. I know I can get the levels and Tae (in-game currency) back but it is frustrating that many players have reported having this issue (including my partner) and yet the Customer Support team claims that I must have idled in the game for 10 hours, which doesn't make sense given that they show I was level 7 on August 21st, 2021 and when I logged in on September 3rd, 2022 I was level 1, which is an abnormality in itself.

Pros:
+ Good mix of fast, reaction-based gameplay and mind games/predictions. 
+ Cool weapon designs with unique strengths, all of which are surprisingly well-balanced. 
+ Awesome Costumes/skins.
+ Characters easy to unlock.
+ Progression systems to keep you motivated outside of only competitive modes.
+ Surprisingly chill community with little to no toxicity

Cons:
- Low content creator and off-game population (at least in US) 
- Loot boxes/gacha mechanic prohibitively expensive (get the season pass)
- Heard stories of lagging Mainland Chinese players (haven't come across any yet)
- Your friends probably don't play it

Mixed:
~ Very cheap battle pass (partially pays for future passes as well), but somewhat required to get a significant amount of cool skins
~ Heavily Eastern (Chinese particularly) aesthetic (some might not be a fan)
~ (VERY) High-level gameplay requires practicing combos, movement, skill timings/interactions, etc. Very different from beginning playstyles",1662243338,1662243338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

this game is full of VPN users from EU, CHINA players and everywhere else. this game allows cheating, this game allows for those to scum others with poor latency, this game allows for people to fight freely with most cheating possible.
what this game does, their matchmaking allows for high level players to play with low level players that knows the game so well its almost like they made the game not the DEVs. On top of that they allow high level players to scum low level players to let them win to make them happy to keep spending money on this game. 
This game has a good foundation, however in the current state of this game unless they limit the ping to maybe a playable state of PING rate. The game can be fun, however the game and the amount of crap the DEVs allow is a poor way to run a game. 
In one instance after checking a players in-game card was so miss matched in the match the moment we dropped in it took 3 minutes he had all yellow gear and weapons, this player wrecked me and 3 others in 3 minutes and then after resurrecting he was there waiting for us to spawn and continued to kill us match over. how is that ok? that is the meaning of this game cheat and cheat more all within 3 minutes.

With that being said let's do some little review. The game itself is great. You can choose from various heroes who all have some speacial abilities, which you can use in fight to kill someone or help your team (if you feel like playing in teams) to get out of the bad situation. The game itself has a nice graphic and even you find a little of a story of the characters, what builds a attachment to the game a little. 

The main problem this game faces is when people from Asia join the European server (and vice versa) because, even though this game is highly skill based, those people can ruin even the most skilled player. How? Well those people has higher pings so it often happen you just cannot hit them, even when you see direct hit. This is something what is killing the game. Another thing that is killing the game is the setup. Like let's be serious, the most of the people of the west world (EU, USA....) will more likely play regular BR because the asian type of environment is not for everyone. Even I would play rather BR with medieval knights than samurais, even though I like the idea of it.

Upsides
.Great graphics
.Great game play
.Extremely high skill ceiling with options for casual or competitive play. 
.A great mix of game modes. 
.A lot of free cosmetic earning potential
.Great character customization and cosmetic animations
.Uniquely includes full face customization on all characters except 1 all for free. (think dark souls face creator.)
.No paywall blocked off in game benefits.
.Very limited ranged weapons (This may be a bad side for some, but for me it's benefit. I enjoy the engaging melee fights much more). 

Downsides: 
.Server problems (players with high ping can get away with more than would normally be possible. This is the NUMBER 1 DOWNSIDE OF THE GAME)
.Loot boxes (this personally doesn't bother me as they're easily earned and don't gate any benefits in game. They also seem more fair than others, but perhaps that's just personal luck. However, for a paid game loot boxes are a little scummy). 
.Battle pass? (this could be considered bad, but it could also be seen as free stuff even if you don't buy the paid part. It's up to you. If you do buy it and complete it, you can afford the next variant of the paid version for free. Theoretically, you could do this infinitely if you have the time and finish it). 

Conclusion: If your looking for a fun BR type game but FPS's have never appealed to you, this is a great alternative. As a person who's never been great at games like APEX or CSGO, this is a game that scratches that fun BR itch with a fun innovative and relatively new melee system. From me, it's an easy recommend!

As per the game itself, there is server lag. As, it doesn't seem they have got that fixed totally yet. Loading times are horrible but once in game, it starts to become more stable, just have to give it a few minutes to fully load. Graphics wise, its good looking and the environment looks well done. If you max out your graphics then it'll probably look even better but, as for me I have mine set to medium or low to help with the loading times. Gameplay, it's not bad. Though you can't adjust your FOV or field of view. And if you can, well then I have yet to figure out how. The combat is semi fluid, some hiccups here and there but nothing that'll break the overall mechanic of the gamplay. You can play this with mouse and keyboard but I prefer gamepad/controller just because it is easier. Though the shooting will probably be easier, of course, with the mouse and keyboard. Cosmetics, as per always with these type of games, their are a lot of options, though its a pay to look good thing. Not my style, I rather just earn them thru in-game currency and not pay for them with actual money. But that's on you if you want to spend the money. 
Overall, I would recommend getting this game. Though get it when its on sale or when the price drops. As, the price of it now seems like a lot to spending on such a game. Maybe if it got polished up some more then yeah but for now, wait until it drops a little in price to pick up and see if you like it.",1661791951,1661791951,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

I'd like to start out by stating that I've started playing Naraka in Season 4, which ended a few weeks prior to me writing this review. I am also in no way a great player, I climbed up to Gold rank in Solos, and I'm overall not very competitive. The game might be showing a little more cracks in mechanics among the very skilled players, but those are too far above me for me to really notice.

[b]Graphics and Optimization[/b]
The game looks stunning, no better way to put it. Especially if your PC is powerful enough to run smoothly on the highest settings. From the terrain and environments to weapons and characters, everything looks crisp and pristine. The tougher question is with optimization. If you do not have an SSD to install the game to, you will most likely NOT BE ABLE to run this. Naraka is a tough piece to run, so be prepared for that if your PC isn't among the powerful ones.

[b]Gameplay and Mechanics[/b]
Naraka is a Battle Royale game first, so all the classics from this genre are present. Closing circles, looting for weapons, healing items, perks and equipment, it's all here, and needs no introduction. The largest catch is that Naraka is primarily focused on melee combat. Yes, ranged weapons are an option, and can be quite devastating if used correctly, vast majority of fights get resolved face to face, in a good ol' brawl. This changes the fluidity of the genre just enough to remove a large portion of stress from getting sniped while running across an open field, as anyone looking to take you down has to get in close. Another thing to mention is traversal. With the use of grappling hooks and seemless parkour, moving across mountains and rooftops was never easier.

[b]Content and Accessibility[/b]
I'm pleased to say that Naraka is overflowing with content. Multiple modes, with the classic competitive ranked Battle Royale leading the charge, casual modes like Bloodbath (Deathmatch), and the new absolutely awesome PvE mode - Showdown. Naraka has something for everyone, which is also the reason why I became so easily hooked. If you're like me, and you don't like playing overly competitive games, have no fear, doesn't matter if you want to play a simple Deathmatch, a PvE pseudo story driven mode, or even against Bots to just chill and not try too hard, Naraka will always reward you with  EXP, and allow you to complete daily quests no matter which mode you play. This makes the game easily accessible to both Hardcore and Casual players.

Another huge boost to the volume of content are events. Naraka constantly comes out with new events that give you something to do ingame, and earn cosmetic rewards for your characters. As soon as one ends, another one begins, nothing out stays it's welcome, everything stays fresh and new. At the time of writing this review, we received a whole new beautiful map, a new Hero to play as, and a vast amount of skins and customization options. If the developer keeps up this pace, I don't see myself getting bored anytime soon.

[b]Customization and Monetization[/b]
Now, Naraka is not a Free to Play game, as we all see on the Steam Store page. Although, as is usual in these games, it does contain microtransactions, which might be a Red Flag to some. There is a Battle Pass each season with free and payed rewards, and there are Loot Boxes. There are two types of things you can purchase. EXP boosts to help you level up your account and Battle Pass quicker, or Cosmetic items. Nothing that would give you an advantage in game, which is appreciated. Also, a large amount of cosmetics can be purchased directly, so you at least know what you're paying for, which is still better then dropping money into RNG loot boxes, hoping you get the outfit you really want. For me, the monetization is not a big deal, I don't see issues with this, as long as it stays like this.

As for the quality of these cosmetics, and customization options for your Heroes, I  have never seen it better in ANY Battle Royale game. You can either use one of the default faces, or create your own using the classic sliders we see in modern MMOs. The amount of creations I've seen fighting against me range from absolutely stunningly beautiful, to... Handsome Squidward? Outfits are also high effort and beautiful, so hold on to your wallets, they will try their best to convince you to dress up your favourite heroes for a couple of bucks more.

+ Gameplay is smooth, the different weapons are varied fun to use, and movement is fluid and satisfying.

- Costumes are pricey to obtain, especially since you have to buy into the game to begin with, but this is made better by events and becomes a non-issue if you play enough to complete the battlepass (which refunds itself and gives incredible sets of costumes, weapons and accessories every season).

Decided to add more to this since i have more hours.

Pros:
-Combat
-Characters
-Character customization
-Weapons in game thus far all are really fun to use aside from new on release weapons being a bit unbalanced at first but generally gets hot fixed pretty quick
-Frequent balance patches
-Dragon used as a sort of red-zone/airstrike is visually pretty cool and unique
-Solos, Duos, Trios Que so you don't have to be stuck with randoms if you don't want that
-Movement ""for the most part"" this one is more of a pro con as if feels go to move but can feel awful to climb and scale rush at times when you're in combat, sometimes the parkour decides to flat out not work and you can get stuck on terrain.

Cons:
-Optimization for hard drives is abysmal you NEED an SSD to play this game, i personally have no issues since i have one but friends who have attempted to play this on hard drivers have constant stutters and frame drops
-The game is not region locked and Chinese players abuse high ping to their advantage being almost untouchable a lot of the time due to latency. If you're a casual player you won't have this issue in normal matches but if you want to dip your toes into ranked especially at plat plus it is a lot of high ping abusers.


Overall opinion:

For $20 i feel like you get a lot of value out of this but also would probably benefit more in NA if it went free to play, i personally enjoy the combat twist on this and the movement of it as i am personally over battle royals but this game is a fresh twist on it and feels more like an arena fighter than anything else to me just on a giant map. Also this game is definitely an easy to pick up difficult to master type of game, there are really good newbie guides on YouTube that id recommend for you to watch if you plan on getting into ranked. Overtime you will eventually be matched with better players so if you're stubborn and refuse to learn the mechanics of the game it will become very frustrating to play",1631848710,1661434640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even with distant servers in SEA and no dedicated OCE server (pls?) ive had between 110-35 ping and its fine.
The game does recommend you install it on an SSD and the performance is night and day, the warning is there for a reason; follow its advice!

Weapon diversity is fantastic, balance of ranged/melee and the ability to augment your character both before and during the game with Glyphs (pre-game) and Jadesoul (in-game) to help you play the way you want is perfection.

Character choice is really nice as well with team oriented ones (healers) still able to put up a fight because the core gameplay is the melee/ranged engagements instead of being purely ability reliant. Tianhi is my favorite transforming into this giant demon thing but its not invincible, slow and distance dependant grabs justifies the large damage output when successful (he himself is quite fast for a big demon when moving though)

However, understand that this game has a lot of things you won't be used to. Here is a list of things I found that were good from a beginners standpoint and some things that might stop you from playing for more than 2 hours.

The Good
1: Visuals are amazing
2: No connectivity or lag issues yet (recommended to have good internet).
3: Many playable characters each with their own abilities.
4: A very engaging and new style of BR (mostly melee and some gun combat + some unique movement options).
5: Optimized perfectly (from my experience).
6: Lots of cosmetic options (although some newer items/characters have fewer)
(Of course there are more things that I either forgot to add or haven't played enough to tell you about).

The Bad
1: The learning curve is quite steep due to the amount of complexity involved (it will take some time to get comfortable with the game mechanics).
2: Not a game for those who just want to drop into a multiplayer match and play the game since there is a lot to learn; you will be punished for being oblivious and will not enjoy the experience (luckily, there are 2 tutorials in the game including a bots training mode and casual mode).
3: Reading, yes you heard that right, if you don't like to read walls of text describing or teaching you about different abilities or weapon attacks/combos you will not enjoy this game at first. However, as you get used to this game this will become a non-issue. Oh and you might gain a few more brain cells which is nice.
(I actually spent more time reading in this game than playing it during my 5 hour duration).

The Ugly
1: This game is super fast paced, you will die fast if you aren't careful and movement is hard to learn so good luck running away, if you are OK with fast paced game-play then ignore this.

Overall for beginners I would say this game is worth it just to try it out. Although, you kinda have to commit to buying it because you won't really have a good idea of what this game is offering in just 2 hours of game-play unless you jump into a casuals match.
Game ranking: 9/10 (my opinion) because this game had no technical issues and the grind to learn the game mechanics has thus far felt rewarding enough to keep me playing. Let me know what you think.",1661404415,1661404415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And if you've ever read or watched King's avatar.. this really feels like their tournament mode, without the MMO impact. 
I've been crushed pretty quickly here and there, had some great fights (at my amateur level) but still thoroughly enjoyable. Go watch a few Naraka Tips videos, to help make the game much more enjoyable, like most battle royales not much hand holding.

Its has amazing in depth combat with an easy to pick up hard to master design, with very well balanced weapons and characters. For the price point I don't think there is a game i would suggest trying more. (slightly biast because i love melee combat games)

here are a few pros and cons to the game

Pros:

1. It's main game-mode is a battle royale, but if you are not into battle royales this one has a few things to offer you. It has other game-modes so you are not stuck playing a BR 24/7
2. This game doesn't suffer from many of the same issues most BRs do. There is no danger of randomly dying to a sniper after 15 minutes of running around, And combat is typically a bit longer w/ more interactions throughout the match.
3. every interaction is meaningful and fun.
4. looting, while it gives you an advantage, is not the determiner of the winner of a fight.
5. The combat system is ""easy to pick up hard to master"" making the sense of progression feel great as you start clapping other players cheeks with a good timed parry or dodge, or a perfectly performed combo.
6. There are no 0-death combos, which is a problem a lot of melee combat games suffer from, naraka does not which in my opinion is awesome. 
7. There are a lot of playstyles, none too much better than the other, you can choose the style that fits you best, and take it to the top. 
8. There is always room for improvement, so you could play for 1000s of hours easily. 
9. There is a very large player base, and the company that owns the game is very capable of supporting the player base and growing it when they need to. 95,000 online and active players at the time of posting this. The player base at the current moment is almost exactly as it was when it was released. So the chance of the game dying any time soon is very minimal. 
10. The god-dam character customization is awesome. You can literally upload a picture of yourself, and it makes your face in-game. Like WTF! Thats badass. Also if thats not your thing you can customize almost every aspect of the face down to the width of the base of the tip of your nose. It's a bit ridiculous, but awesome. 
11. where a lot of games monetize through cosmetics, so does naraka, but they allow you to earn a large portion of cosmetics through gameplay as well. So no need to drop 50 bucks just to look cool.


Now for some Cons:

1. It is a BR at heart, so playing in the BR game-modes is pushed if you want to level faster or get unlocks. Which for many might not be a problem, but as someone who deosn't typically like the BR format I thought it was worth mentioning.
2. while they have an AMAZING PVE game-mode, It is timelocked so it can feel a bit frustrating when you feel like playing it. 
3. The netcode in a majority of cases is beyond good enough, but against certain players you might get hit due to messed up parry timings, or attacks seemingly hitting before they should. For melee fighters netcode has always been more difficult especially if you put it in a BR format. 
4. If you go to play online your first handful of matches will typically be majority if not all bots. I'm not sure what the point of this is, but it might start you off with unrealistic ideas of how the game plays out.
5. While a lot of the time you'll find yourself in quite a few interactions throughout a match, It is a BR so you might find yourself searching for players time to time. 
6. Probably the biggest negative in my opinion is the queue times. Sometimes queues can last up to 5 min. While not incredibly common can definitely be a bit annoying.",1661332917,1661332917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can still play casual, and there the hackers seem to be more chill. There is also no region lock, which accentuates this issue, as you play with the chinese that have a huge ping here.

Also, one of the biggest issues I see with this is that you pay for the game, yet you still have to pay a tremendous amount of money in game for micro transactions. While they don't necessarily affect the gameplay, I find it ridiculous that if you pay 50 euro they still ask money from you to unlock skins and such, to the point you may pay 3-5 times more than the price of the game to get what you may want if it's locked behind RNG.

The combat is not quite that fluid either and it definitely lacks at this price point, not to mention the small choice of characters you can play with, while also most of them being locked behind a pay-wall or grind-wall, with no way to know if you want to unlock any of those characters because you can't even try them.

It goes without saying that it is an online only type of game, so if they ever decide to shut down their servers you can't even come back to the game to play it, so all your investment in it will just go away.

On a reduced price it may be worth it, but at full price, absolutely not. With the amount of money they ask you for those micro-transactions it should be free.",1661286647,1661286647,False,5,0,0.521206140518188477,0,True,False,False

However, this definitely is more of a PUBG than an Apex Legends, with all the pros and cons that come with that distinction. I personally loved PUBG but could never get into Apex.

If you like battle royales, have a good PC (like, decently above recommended specs good, I have a 1080 and 7700K and can barely maintain 1080p60fps at medium graphics) and think the trailer looks good, definitely give this a try.

 This has become one of my favorite Battle Royale games so far, and it's such a nice change of pace compared to all the Shooters.

Graphically, it's quite pleasing. While i'm normally playing on Medium for performance even then it still looks good.
I love the music and sound effects. 

The gameplay is a little hard to get used to at first, but after 16 hrs played i have the hang of it.
Learning combos is something i still need to work on. There's a good selection of weapons, although i rarely use Ranged because it's hard to hit the target unless you're using  a controller (Aim Assist). 

Each character has their own specials, and when leveled you can alter their specials changing how they work.
My personal favorite is Takedo, mostly because he's a Samurai literally voiced by the Ghost of Tsushima himself. You can also deeply edit your characters and make them look however you want.

I have no issues getting Trios or Solo matches, although late night sessions take about 5 mins max.
It does say it supports Cross-Play i believe, and that would include Xbox i'm assuming. There are more modes i've yet to try out as well.

Sometimes i'll come across chinese players that seem to always be god mode. I've yet to beat them.
I'll come close but they always have some trick up their sleeve. So theres that. But i'm not one to jump to conclusions. They are probably just experienced. There ARE bots, but the game says they show up less the higher lvl you are. Either way they're sometimes difficult themselves (unless they're players and i cant tell) but often you can beat them. Good practice. 

Lastly there are a LOT of events, Battle Pass, or hidden menus etc each giving you the ability to earn some sort of reward or currency etc. But they're not really explained very well so you just have to kinda click around till you figure it out sort of thing. There are good cosmetics, although so far it seems to be really rare to unlock anything good. Kinda like Apex Legends. And they do sometimes push things like, Follow this or that. But you can tell it to stop annoying you (For that day).

It's by no means a deal breaker though. For $10 you can't go wrong, even for $20 i'd say that's reasonable considering how fun it is. I wouldn't personally recommend the DLCs but if it's your thing then that's your choice. 

All in all, i'd say this is totally worth checking out if you like BR's but want Melee combat with interesting Character choices.",1661253037,1661253037,True,1,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

Other than that ive started during the free weekend and bought it on sale, I have had my head kicked in more than once by competent players but there are other players closer to my skill level so thats nice. The fact the game puts you in with bots for the first few games honestly didnt bug me, and every so often a bot might get sprinkled in even later, but you can turn that off if you so wish.
The combat system is pretty fun, if a bit unwieldy to get the hang of, but as a new player with only 10 hours in, im having a good enough time having a go at it. There is an advanced tutorial that puts you in a faux match and shows you the ropes, but the game doesnt direct you to it, you gotta do it yourself. You can find it in the menu where youre picking which mode you wanna queue for, its under training.

-Stun locking is a bitch. Combat just boils down to who can stun lock who first, it gets old really fast.

-even though you pay 10-20 dollars for the game, you still have to unlock characters. That's something I've only ever seen in free to play games. And while you can unlock them with a currency you can unlock in game, you also need that currency to upgrade your characters stats for things like being able to find better loot or grapple further, things that make it easier to win and get more currency, so you get into a rather long grind to unlock characters you should probably already have unlocked after paying for the game.

A lot of people don't like how they can't talk about fallout without me getting into a political debate with them. I don't mind since I ""catch them off guard!"" Anyway, I love fallout New Vegas, it changed my life.

Character design is super entertaining, and if your not into spending lots of time doing it yourself they have a very convenient import system to get already made designs from others. There are some awesome and unique looking characters you can design. The actual appearance editing reminds me a bit of Lost Ark, which is a good thing as I think both are great. And the apparel that you can unlock are super good looking as well. 


It is challenging, however very rewarding watching yourself improve in small aspects like movement or combat. I think the combat is a blast and its cool finding different combinations of weapons, weapon modifiers, and heroes.

Way too much crowd control. Expect to not have control of your character half the time, especially against certain characters. You will be juggled, stun locked, and have your weapon taken out of your hands constantly.

Disrespects your time heavily.

Of course, we also have a large selection of long-range weapons at our disposal here, but our main weapon is intended for close combat. With knives, swords, katana, spears, nunchucks and more, we face our opponents in direct combat. In order to meet the Battle Royale claim, we don't need any abstruse key combinations here, but the melee is based on actions that we can trigger using the right and left mouse button. The landscape, the characters and a large part of the armament come from the Asian region.  Similar to the operator known from other titles, here we play one of nine different heroes. Each of these heroes has special hero abilities. Of course, we can also customize the look and clothes of our heroes. Some can be unlocked through game progress, but there are also skins that can be purchased through an in-game shop. When we start the game for the first time, we land directly in a tutorial mode. Here we are first explained the basic controls, such as running, jumping and climbing. Next we will learn about the grappling hook. With its help we can reach higher points or overcome gorges. After completing the tutorial, we have two more training sessions available. But we can also repeat the introductory training at any time as often as we like. The two other training sessions now deepen the combat mechanics and other systematics. So we can still learn some things about buying items and also about revival in the extended tutorial. In free training we can configure a sparring partner and thus familiarize ourselves with the various heroes, abilities and weapons. We can also get to know the soul jade better here. Because this serves us to optimize skills or brings us helpful effects, such as self-healing. Combat Mechanics:
When it comes to combat mechanics, we have to differentiate between melee and ranged combat. Both have their own control mechanics. What both types of weapons have in common is that we have to keep an eye on durability. Even if the pure control is manageable, the correct use in combat must be learned in detail.The control of the fights is based on the right and left mouse button in close combat. With these we can trigger vertical and horizontal attacks once. If we keep the button pressed we can carry out a charged attack. Several attacks in a row result in a combo attack, which always ends in a particularly powerful attack. We don't need to learn complex key combinations for this. But what we can't trim with our melee weapon is the vegetation.Naraka: Bladepoint has the potential to establish itself as a real alternative in the battle royale market. It offers chic graphics that are still easily scalable. The gameplay differs from most other titles on the market due to its focus on close combat, but still manages to use a familiar control concept. In addition to the well-structured tutorial, there is also a quite demanding bot mode. In this way, newcomers and those switching to the game can first gain some experience before they plunge into combat against living opponents. Because in real combat it is difficult for a beginner to gain a foothold. Because the pure control may be easy to learn, but you need some time for the right combat management. Here it is important to find the right combination of the two attacks and avoiding enemy actions.

Of course, one could of course criticize the in-game shop. But this one is somehow part of the genre, because for many players the latest skins are probably almost more important than the actual gameplay. After all, the shop is focused on visual extensions, so the title definitely doesn't follow the Pay2Win scheme.

We can recommend Naraka: Bladepoint to everyone who, after many years, is looking for a change in the battle royale genre, but also to those who have previously shied away from this genre because they are not fans of shooters.",1660948047,1660948047,True,1,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

 I played only solo so far as none of my friends play this game, so I wanted to learn a bit before going into duos/trios. And unfortunately, solo is unplayable beacuse of the new character. Its unkillable. For those who dont know, a quick summary of her set: healing and more healing and def boost and lethal attack immunity. Unless you can one shot her with perma stagger before she pops her ult, its not worth to pick up a fight. Well, she is probably gonna chase you down and slaughter you sooner or later anyway.

Kurumi, for example, is clearly not installed. She's invisible. I can play as her, and I can see her face floating in the air.

Every couple of minutes the game will freeze and then render something that should have already been present.

Perhaps the game wasn't made properly? I mean, no other title I've played has issues like this. Usually, a game will load the map and structures and players (etc) then simply render them when the player turns the camera to observe the object. It seems like Naraka doesn't even bother loading things until it is far too late.

It has an okay tutorial but it only explains the basics. For the more advanced tech you'll have to watch youtube videos or figure it out for yourself. I have a ton of hours and I only encountered very few people who I suspected that they may be cheating. But I was not even sure if they were just good or cheating. And yes there are a lot of players with Chinese names but this game is huge in China so it's expected. They are the same as you tho they are not cheaters, lag switchers or anything. They have normal ping and most defenetly they are just Chinese people living in your region. Acutally I met more people playing from NA in the EU server who lagged. The lag situation is weird cause most of the time it just feels like a disadvantage just like in every game, but sometimes I met people who's attacks I couldn't dodge cause I got sucked back into their attack mid dodge. That's the only advantage they get, they'll still have a huge delay on everything. I'm not sure if you have to have a certain ping to get this but it's not common. You'll meet this kind of people like once of twice every 100 hours or so.

If you have reservations with the game, you can always play using XBOX GAME PASS for free and play on pc using that. 

Please note, cross save doesn't work. Not sure if implemented later.

I've played PUBG and Apex Legends for over 1000 hours, but this game doesn't feel like a traditional BR to me. As a fighting game, it's more like Mordhau than a multiplayer action combat game, but it's still the best action combat/melee multiplayer game that I've ever played. It borrows heavily from Apex Legends, but it's distinct enough to avoid feeling like you're playing the same game.

The Souljade system adds a lot of variety to gameplay, and each weapon and hero is meticulously designed. The variety of attacks and combos available for each melee weapon keeps the game from feeling repetitive and instead makes it very addictive and rewarding to improve in. So even newbies can compete with the best players in the game if they read a few games and practice enough. Naraka, in contrast to other games, never gives you the impression that you can't beat the most sweaty player. In light of the fact that you can grab and climb just about anything you see, the grapple and free climbing system is truly remarkable. In terms of animation quality, it is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen in an action combat game (and it's not even close). In contrast to other games I've played recently, this one doesn't feel janky at all (New World, BF 2042 Beta, Elyon). Because you can traverse and climb everything, I haven't encountered a single bug like falling through the map or getting stuck, or glitching through objects.

The heroes, weapons, and environments all have fantastic textures and model designs, and the audio for each weapon and hero ability is distinctive enough that you can always tell what's going on around. The user interface (UI) is simple, clear, and easy to get around in. Even if you choose to cancel animations, the game will not feel jerky or glitchy.

The negative aspects of the game are unrelated to the game's content. The player base is to blame for all of the negative aspects. People are most upset about meta picks, long queues, and a confusing ranking system. However, the root of all of these problems is a small pool of active players (at least in the West). Another problem is the game's difficulty; new players will shy away from it due to the fact that more experienced players will smash their faces in. You'll get rolled a lot in the beginning. Those who persevere, on the other hand, will [hopefully] come to appreciate this game for the masterpiece it is.

Finally, the RNG lootboxes are a source of much dissatisfaction among players. To reiterate, there is no pay to win in the game (incredibly refreshing for an Asian developer!)! In order to counteract the best cosmetics being locked behind RNG, the shop has a slew of great skins that can be purchased outright. The base price does not affect your ability to play the entire game. Glyphs are the only thing preventing you from playing on an even playing field with your opponents and teammates, but getting all of them maxed out only takes a few days.

In terms of gameplay, fun, and fluidity, many of the games I've played this year have been an embarrassment (most notably New World and BF2042 Beta). In my opinion, the most important factor in determining how enjoyable a game is to play is the gameplay, not the visuals. Everything works in Naraka, and it's a lot of fun if you put in the effort to improve. Being victorious in a duel, hunting down a target as a third party, or obtaining a clutch play, snipe, ulti, or other satisfying outcomes is gratifying. The game has a high quality feel to it, and I have no doubts that the creators put a lot of thought and care into it.

There are still some developers out there who are focused on gameplay rather than glitz and glamour, and that's why I wrote this long ass review: it's a real gem that is sadly being overlooked in the West.",1659764129,1659764129,True,108,5,0.795369446277618408,10,True,False,False

More balanced.. Still gotta git gud scrub.. there's always an Asian better than you XD and they could indeed be playing anywhere in Asia...

But if everyone keeps giving up on the game because they don't want to get better or really any other reason, is just going to hurt the western scene in it more. I can appreciate the Devs trying and realizing it's too late in life for a ping lock unless the player base grows more. Skins are still amazing. Map updates are seamless. New heroes and their abilities are epic and varied. It's a Looter FIGHTER Battle Royale. Not an FPS. Closer to Soul Calibur than to CoD.

The game is beautiful. Well designed. Movement is amazing and battle mechanics are fun... if you can see or participate in them. The developer never issued a Ping Lock so everyone can play in what ever region they like and lag all the way to victory. And if you're in NA... well you're that region! Get used to Asia in majority of your games splashed with some EU and South America (they at least share the server). Also you're own ping will be too high to be able to play the game! So if you're an amazing theory crafter/mind reader/predictor of movement... this game is for you! I played in hopes that it would get better but it has actually gotten worse. The developer doesn't care at this point and is just leeching money... How do you have Bow/musket weapon description for LITERALLY EVERY WEAPON?? I sacrifice rate of fire with my katana? Yeah fo sho! Lazy. Lazy. Lazy. Which sucks for the reasons first stated. I kept playing in hopes of ping lock being issued and I enjoyed the game despite its flaws

I've run into top 500 players who cc you to death and that is fine it's skill, but... 
I'll be a whole grapple hook away from a server hopper and then they'll do a blue attack and i'm dead. 
They teleport to me and attack me through walls.
When it goes to spectate they are teleporting all over the place. 
I'll deal loads of damage and then all of a sudden i'm the one with low health and they're full.
I'll hit them while they heal and their heal goes through instead of them getting stunned or knocked out of it.
I'll grapple them and they don't get stunned. 
They parry my normal attack which can't be parried, only blue and purple attacks can be.
I'll parry a blue attack and they just hit me through it then continue their combo.
I'll use a skill like the monks bell and they hit it but don't get pushed back. The list goes on.
The devs need to fix this. They need to block people with ping over a certain number from playing with other people below a certain ping.

The good:
- Combat is fun, fluid and feels satisfying
- Wide variety of weapons and characters for a newer game
- Frequently updated, developers communicate with community
- Various modes for different types of players.

The bad:
- For some reason, an overwhelming amount of Chinese players are playing on NA servers. This is a problem as ping is king in Naraka.
- Low player count means matchmaking is slow and inaccurate. When you are matched against players around your own skill, the game is a blast. 9 times out of 10, you will be playing against a handful of the top players on the server.
- Looting and UI need some love and optimization

[i]I was wrong to give this game a positive review at first because it's just another title buried deep in another greedy corporation's pockets who don't care about their game and community's health.[/i]

The biggest issue with this game are the Chinese and Japanese (but mostly Chinese.) - No, this is not a racist thing, and it's not entirely their fault for causing this problem but as well as the developers because they can't seem to bother pulling their sh*t together. This game has the worst case of smurfing i have ever seen in any game and it is on such a large scale that it is literally digging its own grave. I mean, who's the smartass from the board room who gave the green light to implement three different ranked modes with separate elo across [b][i]ALL FIVE SERVERS?[/i][/b] Smurfing has never been easier ever before than it is in Naraka. 

- And yes, the game does have consistent patches with weapon and hero balancing but it is on such a minor scale it hardly fixes anything. Instead the game is drooling for your money with overpriced cosmetic chests and purchasable apparel and weapon skins while the dev team's main focus are never ending limited-time events and other gameplay content updates. Perhaps consider fixing the game [b][i]before[/i][/b] you add a ton of new stuff when it is in such grave danger? Continue like this, there will eventually not be anyone left to buy your cosmetics anyway..

What do you get when you create a game with a steep skill gap and give it poor marketing? You get a game with a medium to small player base and struggles building a larger community because new players are chased out almost immediately by veteran players. So the game is then left with having all the most skilled players go up against each other as the very few new to familiar players get their cheeks clapped.

It is [u][i]IMPOSSIBLE[/i][/u] to elo climb in this game because unless you're playing at a time where most Chinese are asleep, they [b][i]will[/i][/b] invade your ranked matches and they won't be anywhere near your lobby's actual elo. 9 out of 10 games i and my friends play, there are always at least 1-3 top #1 players with platinum and up elo in a [b][i]BRONZE[/i][/b] lobby across all the different modes. Yes, you read that right. [i][u][b]B r o n z e.[/b][/u][/i]

The game's mechanics however are pretty decent but the star of the show is definitely the unique mix-up for combining martial arts with battle royale. - Brilliant idea and something new in the battle royale genre for once and felt refreshing to experience. 

[i]I do understand it is quite difficult to make a fighter game without a steep skill gap though. As fighter games just have that [i]almost[/i] inevitable factor, especially with so many different variations that are embedded in a looter battle royale, where there are so many various items with each their own statistics and abilities. So of course there are going to be some imbalance within said items and a challenge to equally scale them with each other, but locking the ranks to be the same globally server-wide and only separate across the different modes; solo, duo and trio, would be a [b][i]GREAT[/i][/b] step in the right direction.[/i]

And for those who are thinking ""but you're just bad, so get better."" [i]- I'm not all that ""terrible"" which i'm not saying to brag but rather to prove a point as I soloed to nearly gold my first season after starting to play.[/i]

Good Game Graphic, not a pay to win. 
Learning process of this game is pretty smooth, you can pick up this game really fast if you play Pubg and other mmorpg before.
Try out the game first before paying for skin, it kinda like league of legend if you want to look good you have to pay.
There are rune pages to increase your ability in game.
There are many different reward for beginner player, leveling up process is pretty fast due to multiple even happening at the same time. 
I hit level 20 within 6 hours of game play
The ranking system is this game is a bit unbalance at the moment. (Hopefully they will fix this)

Not only is there a weapon that will kill you in 3 hits (greatsword), but there is a character(Tarka Ji)  who can literally stun you infinitely and kill you no matter what weapon rarity he has(katana) or how much health/armor you have.
I have experienced so many laggy enemies where i focus attack and their extremely delayed parry still gets me before it even shows on my screen.
this game is in a bad state for anyone new or even people trying to return to this game after leaving early on.
I am simply waiting for nerfs and bug fixes and literally people jumping from other servers just to ruin everyones fun.

Edit: they are making the game worse, the dagger updates they have been adding are destroying this game. As with the greatsword they made it with the dagger, it is not a fight. The dagger gets free hits in just because it can dodge any attack and combo with way too much damage. Not only that but they added a souljade making its damage increase dramatically making the weapon able to be used by the worst of players and able to kill the best of players.

Gameplay wise it is my favorite Battle Royale title out there. (minor issues like stunlock abuse and strength of daggers not withstanding)

I cannot however continue to support its monetization system, which I believe is one of the worst out there in the PC gaming market.

You have the battle pass, thats fine and passable sure - every game has them now pretty much.

On top of that though you have the standard cash shop which is whatever.

Even more so, you have standard loot boxes but also seasonal ones, and neither box has duplicate protection.

In theory, you could spend over a thousand dollars in one season trying to get all the cool cosmetics you want out of the seasonal box and get less than half of them, thereby being royally fucked out of the ones you didnt get forever - duplicate items giving you a piddly amount of spectral silk (which has its own shop) as a consolation prize.

Even in Apex Legends, a game published by industry demons EA, loot boxes don't give you dupes.

There's also the issue of lag and VPN  abusing players from asian countries on the NA servers, which overall makes the game less fun for native western players who aren't god level in skill. Couple that with high prevalence of bots in public matches, even ranked, and you've got even more issues to be addressed.

I would say if you DO buy Naraka, only buy it on sale or buy the standard edition, and don't give them any extra money. Statistical averages show if you try to get all the cosmetics, you simply won't unless you're either lucky enough, or you have deep enough pockets to endlessly throw money at the game.",1648344758,1658361776,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am now Gold 3 in Duo Ranking and I do enjoy the game way more than before.
All those cheaters are gone. Ofc, there are Tryhard gamers in this game but it is not impossible to get as good with some practice. 
The current Event Mode is super fun to play and the rewards as well. 
There is no p2w, only skins for characters and weapons and you get a ton of free stuff too.
With the crossplay there are way more people playing and it really is fun.
I do recommend this game but you gotta learn how to play it to enjoy!

Old review for comparison. They really did a good job.

If you don't protect your game it ends like this: 
infested with chinese and general cheaters. 
You have 24/60 players in a game.
Barely any NA or EU players because it's not fun to play against ""esport asians"".
All my friends stopped playing out of the same reason.
We asked for seperate servers but no.
You can literally just ""buy"" cheats from websites which are undetected. 
What are the devs doing? Sleeping on it.

I do believe the developers should make the game F2P and sell cosmetics /chests only this would allow far more people to play it and allow people who may be discouraged about the ""skill gap"" to continue grinding to get better. This would also help the ranked system balance more where newer/worse players are in the bronze to silver ranks and the guys who play it all the time are at the top of the leader boards and can actually fill their lobby in a decent time. This game has a ton of potential if the developers listen to the community and focus on the communities wants and needs and not their own. The fighting game style combat is amazing once you learn the basics of juggling counters and feints. Also developers still haven't fixed the ""bug"" that doesn't allow steam to play with xbox yet and THEY NEED to make this a priority to help with player counts as well no one wants to play a battle royal solo all the time.

COMBAT: Massive potential for the combat, but as of right now it feels just a bit off. The game may seem almost clunky because you have to be VERY deliberate with your inputs. Ultimately rock, paper, scissor combat. Figure it out from there. Dodge/Stamina, you know the drill.

UI: There are so many little things in the menu to check and click on. A whole host of notifications. Guaranteed updates incoming.

Recommended for someone looking for a new style of battle royale. Got it on sale so I'm ok with the purchase. My initial review was like ""wtf is this combat"" because the buffers created a learning curve. Most games don't need you to be that deliberate. Still think this game, however, needs a good deal of combat tweaks.

If you end up having trouble with this game, try changing the combat settings to your liking. There are a fair amount of options for movement/climbing as well.

Very challenging though, I am still getting schooled more than I am winning, but I am constantly improving at the combat. 

There's actually a lot of mechanics to the combat itself, so it kind of plays out like a fighting game, where different attacks, crouch attacks, uppercuts all outplay other ones. Once you start learning that it goes beyond button mashing it gets enjoyable, and then all kinds of mental games start to make their way into facing your opponents.

Honestly the game is fun when you first pick it up, but that is majorly due to the bots on your game, honestly you barely even notice they are bots, but if you think they are lagging or just low IQ players, they are probably bot.

YES, this game DOES have an issue with matchmaking and ping. Having played for 120+ Hours since September of 2021 - it has gotten a little better with the addition of crossplay, I'm personally just waiting for the Playstation Release to help alleviate numbers. 

However, the mechanics are mostly smooth and REALLY fun to play with. If you're prone to getting angry, or are expecting the learning curve to be easy - no, this game is not for you. 

One of the main downsides though is sadly the cosmetic/loot-crate system. 

As a player who is always keen to unlock all the drip for my big bitty girls - it was disappointing to see that not ONLY is this game Pay to Play, and not ONLY does it have a loot-box mechanic, but ONE SKIN can run you $10, sometimes even $20-30 depending on what pack or skin you want. 

This is one of the most greedy systems for microtransactions I have ever seen. The skins are not disappointing by any means, and you can get these loot-boxes for free with a little work, however this - as with all loot-crates, require a certain degree of luck - AND the duplicate issue is...bad to say the least. 

Overall, 

The game has some teething issues. The mechanics are fun to learn and play, and it is worth the $20 to spend. However, if you are prone to getting angry, this game is NOT for you. If you are looking for a smooth experience like Apex, Warzone or any other established BR - this game is NOT for you right now. 

The microtransaction mechanics are downright extortionate, so if you are a fan of unlocking skins without paying money...well, good luck to you. I sure as hell don't have that privilege. 

Now if you excuse me, I'll be buying 45 cent ramen noodles while looking at big ol bitties.",1657403669,1657403669,True,3,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False

Players with severe time differences need to be region locked because they lag and in melee combat that is an advantage.

If you see them.... Run. I give this game a solid 6/10 because the Devs dont listen to their community and are only worried about over-priced skins on some really hot character models. If you like melee BR its worth the 20$ and loads of fun. The movement kind of plays like bloodhunt key words: kind of. The grapple hook dodging and jumping make combat fun charges light and heady mix ins and timed parries are punishing as they make the other player drop the weapon they were attacking with.

After playing for several hours and enjoying the hell out of it, I then realized that I only took advantage of the 3 months of game pass for a $1.00 and have since cancelled and do not plan on renewing, I knew I had to get it on Steam.  Prior to my purchase however there was a little reluctance due to the lag and sometimes un-playability of the game on XBox.  I figured for $13.oo I'd give it a shot on Steam because it was that impressive.  Great decision!  The lag on Steam is very minimal compared to XBox and it is ONLY the first like 10 seconds after zoning in, then it's butter.  For those of you on the fence just grab it.  Better experience than XBox and from what I see, the developers are finally coming back to this title and starting to invest more time and attention. A+ Thumbs up!

Let me elaborate:

1) Basic bare bones combat
I was expecting something like Shadow Arena with several very distinct skills and playstyles per class. Here all you can do is light attack, strong attack, parry, block, roll, hook, dodge, a skill and an ultimate; just the basics. Lame. If you're going to be doing a melee battle royale, the combat better be at least action MMO tier. 

2) Terribly optimized 
For the level of meh graphics on offer, the game runs pretty poorly. 

3) Bots 
There are bots everywhere and it completely sucks the fun out of the game. If I wanted to farm some bots, I would just play some stupid cash grab MMO. 

4) Grind
You're going to have to grind to unlock about half the heroes, cosmetic items, glyphs, etc. It isn't a short grind either. 

All in all, I would have liked to refund the game before exceeding 2 hours of play time but Stockholm syndrome caught hold of me and I couldn't help but play some more to see if it's any good. It's not that good, 6/10 at best.

Typical battle royal loot tier system but the combat is the selling point (Think FortNite Loot).  You are rewarded for playing offensively vs turtling or running away in most other games.  Which is way more fun.  Think about how fun classic WoW pvp is vs playing WoW 2022 arena where you have to blow through every defensive CD to kill instead.  zzZZzzz..

There is a learning curve but spending 20-30 min practicing will greatly improve your results in game.  Like many fighting games there are combos and mastering them is very satisfying.  This game has a very anime style battle feel to it where you can have a great impact in the game by being skillful.  Fighting multiple opponents is common and you will get cheezed more often than you clutch but that's what makes those moments where you outplay multiple people feel so special because you spent that time training.

I've had a lot of moments where a battle can feel like a movie.  Right now its on sale for $13 but its normally $20.  I don't agree with the sentiment that this game needs to go free to play because every game that does it is rife with hackers & cheaters.  

If you can't afford a $20 buy in then you really shouldn't be playing video games.

Finally I wanted to add that they've added a lot of content to the game since release; 3 more heroes and 2 new weapons.  They balanced the souljades and added map features that add more dynamic to the game such has anti ult zones, map/terrain improvements, more game modes (duo queue!) than simply battle royal.  More heroes now have defensive cd's that can intterupt combo chains and allow you a fighting chance vs being beaten down from 100% life to 0% without the ability to fight back.

This game has changed a lot since release and if you're curious to try again I highly encourage it.  Also playing with friends is much more fun than playing alone.  Naraka is also very entertaining to watch (especially on twitch!).  Don't let the negative reviews lead you astray.  I've had a lot of fun for a small $20 investment as there is no p2w only pay for cool cosmetics.",1657011542,1657011542,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This is a very unique Battle Royale game. Melee weapons instead of guns = no camping and non-stop action. Combat system is simple and intuitive yet provides very high skill ceiling. Grappling hooks and parkour provide insane mobility not only for map travelling, but also in-combat. Beautiful scenery and architecture with red and gold leafed trees, pagodas, temples and so on straight from Wuxia/Xuanhuan Chinese fantasy. Non-cartoonish color palette and visual style, highly aesthetical character design and combat choreography. Basically complete opposite of games like Apex Legends, PUBG and Fornite.

I believe for anyone who prefers melee combat to modern warfare and also for those who prefer Asian character design to Western, Naraka is by far the best Battle Royale game on the market and it's easily worth every penny of its price even if you buy Ultimate Edition. For those who are more or less OK with existing battle royale shooters and don't accept buy-to-play model for BR in the age when Apex and even PUBG are FTP — well, Naraka was clearly not meant for you.",1656876091,1656876240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Fun to play if you have friends
- An unique feel to the BR genre
- Obama and Shrek is in the game


Cons:
- China Nr.1
- Unenjoyable when you play solo
- getting stuck on non-existing structures and obstacles
- Counter/Parry works but only if the game feels like it
- Be the third party or enjoy being third partied
- Optimization is non-existing
- Don't feel happy when you kill someone, cuz it's a bot
- 2v1 is gg
- winning early fights feels unrewarded
- Coin toss on spawn location
- Not enough trees and obstacles
- Queue simulator is included
- Lagg switch is a thing
- Game uses a talent system which is a handicap for new players
- Don't let the 20€ price tag fool you of this game! You still need a RTX 9080ti to run it properly
- Super populated, however this is only the case if it was CN servers
- Best place to learn foreign languages when in pre-lobby (only if your voice chat options are enabled)
- Start game -> Win game -> Get 20+ kills -> get +1 point on your rank 🙂
- Insane balanced characters. Source: ""Trust me bro""
- Sticky keys???
- Game is sus

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Bought it thinking that me and my friends would return this game. But surprisingly it was a great experience. Playing from the NA server, I have a ping range of about 40ms to 80ms, occasionally spiking to over 200ms, however it doesn't really effect the game play.

Pros: Great graphics, fluid combos, satisfying abilities and possible parries. 

Cons: Have a limited play window before everything goes wrong. You would usually want to play around 2pm to 9pm. That is when the server belongs to the NA players. However, the moment it does into 10pm. All the CN monsters awake, and your ping will spike hard. 
I am not sure why they would prioritize the amount of players from a regions ping compared to the supposed region. Like if I'm from NA I should always have around 60ms, not altered because some people from other regions want to play in my region. It really doesn't make any sense.

As someone who played in the beta and release, I had a ton of fun! 
I stopped playing due to lag (I left before Valda was released)
(I also dropped cash to buy the deluxe pack to get the ultimate skins)

However, 2-3 weeks ago I wanted to see how the game is and it turns out at peak hours, I can actually play the game and it was optimized! The community is nice and helped me out in getting better to not die every 2 seconds. 
Now I am 370+ in the NA Solos Leaderboard, capable of fighting even other top players! 

I've never witnessed a hacker in the whole time i played so I had no problems. My issues are more on the fact that queues take long but the Xbox Game Pass helped a lot with it (speaking from roughly 13 hours after the pass was out) and the playerbase in NA is getting higher as time passes! 

My other complaint is the nunchucks LOL

The game's definitely reaching higher numbers due to the xbox game pass and I absolutely urge you to try it out! 

I do wish the game is Free to Play though, it will make the game a lot more accessible and the devs make money off microtransactions anyway.

It would be best for everyone if they stuck to their own servers instead of taking advantage of the high ping, it does not help that the player with the high ping has the advantage.

i played the game a year ago for a few days and stopped due to this issue, I check back every few months to see if they have fixed their game, but sadly this great game is still unplayable and I recommend people to avoid buying it until you see that these issues are fixed.

Everything about its gameplay is fire, continuously improving and learning new skills even with the time I've put in. You can mainly play ranked solo/duo/trio, bloodbath, and custom 1v1 lobbies. My play time is split between ranked solos and bloodbath. Ranked is what you'd expect, sweaty lobbies with 70% real players and 30% bots usually. Sure there are bots but I treat them as walking loot bags, there are a handful of actual players in ranked matches who will make you wish you ran into a bot instead. If you want to chill and relax a little bit you can do bloodbath which is what I love the most. Simply a free for all with 16 players usually about 5-8 of them are real while the rest are bots. match lasts like 10 minutes, full loot on spawn allowing you to practice against real players and bots, yes you need to practice against bots they got auto parry which will be the death of you if near a real players.

They have failed to really grow the player base and it's been stagnant and dropping in numbers for a while now. It might be a worthwhile game for you if your available hours mesh with the spike in players on your specific region but otherwise your queue times might be a little long. With that in mind, you're really only allowed to play ranked matches where there are enough bots injected into your game (at any and all ranks) to inflate your performance as long as you don't die off spawn. With this in mind, the average player who wants a fast queue time will be resorted to play the ranked mode over the several other available modes because of queue times ranging from a full bot lobby instant popping to a 15 minute queue that finally popped because those other people just finished their game. That will only take effect at a higher rank, but there is nothing preventing the system from injecting someone of a high rank into your ranked match even when you're a brand new player. The match will be deemed extremely difficult, and you'll get extremely high rating for the match dependent on kills and placement. 

Personally, despite my opinions on the game, I wish they were to make this free to play as it's a really fun game to play and there is no arguing that. I've invested close to 400 hours between my two accounts and I've tried to get many people into the game but many failed due to the strict learning curve associated with this game. This is how it will go....

1. You make your account and queue up for a quick match to play against a non ranked environment.
2. Your queue insta pops and you feel great about it. 
3. There are probably 2 other players in your game, and it's your two other teammates in your trio.
4. You will run around and fight some AI who sometimes run into walls, have incredible parry reaction speed sometimes and sometimes it's just not there at all... there is no middle ground. 
5. You will likely win your first 1-3 and they will be fast queues because of the amount of real players in the game is low. 
6. Dependent on your performance in your other matches, your queue time might increase as more and more players get injected into your game. You will  progressively see 1 or 2 real parties, then maybe 3-6 , then maybe more.  This will progressively go up and up as you get going into your levels, but within the past several months playing both ranked in platinum where the queue times hit 10 minutes reguarly. I have yet to see a full game of real players. I never see more than 3-9 different names in the kill feed throughout the entire game and it feels like a vacant game now. 

on the other hand, if you had a friend to play and you were local to each other where the ping variance wasn't too severe.. I give this a 10/10 for customs.  The most playtime I get in this game nowadays is a custom lobby where several of my friends perform KOTH",1654999548,1654999548,False,84,2,0.767766416072845459,1,True,False,False

The only reason I have only a couple hours is because I can't seem to catch the NA servers when they're at peak population. I wait for 5-6 minutes in the queue, refresh it, wait another 5-6 minutes - nothing. Seemingly no players online and no lobbies being filled. It's a damn shame because Naraka is such a satisfying game, and actually has a surprising amount of content! Not to mention, it is visually very pretty. I don't understand why the player base is dead.

In short, if you get the game and live in NA (or plan to use NA servers), just be prepared to wait a while for matches, unless you're THAT eager to play Bot matches (which IS an option). I would also not spend the money for the BP, as you won't be playing games often due to lack of players, therefore not leveling up your BP, ultimately making it redundant and a waste of money. 

*DISCLAIMER* you can earn all the cosmetics in game, no purchase necessary. Though some unlockables are only acquirable through certain loot boxes (which you can earn or buy), and through certain events.

Otherwise, Naraka is a very solid battle royale experience and will reward you for being a consistent player.

Pros: 
- Fun to play if you have friends
- An unique feel to the BR genre
- Obama and Shrek is in the game


Cons:
- China Nr.1
- Unenjoyable when you play solo
- getting stuck on non-existing structures and obstacles
- Counter/Parry works but only if the game feels like it
- Be the third party or enjoy being third partied
- Optimization is non-existing
- Don't feel happy when you kill someone, cuz it's a bot
- 2v1 is gg
- winning early fights feels unrewarded
- Coin toss on spawn location
- Not enough trees and obstacles
- Queue simulator is included
- Lagg switch is a thing
- Game uses a talent system which is a handicap for new players
- Don't let the 20€ price tag fool you of this game! You still need a RTX 9080ti to run it properly
- Super populated, however this is only the case if it was CN servers
- Best place to learn foreign languages when in pre-lobby (only if your voice chat options are enabled)
- Start game -> Win game -> Get 20+ kills -> get +1 point on your rank 🙂
- Insane balanced characters. Source: ""Trust me bro""
- Sticky keys???
- Game is sus

The long version: This is a great game. If you like martial arts action with some general mixture of Asian-themed mythology, without looking too closely at some of the bits, this game scratches a lot of the right itches. Many people don't like it because it's similar to f2p games, but it's not free. I'm not one of them. 

BUT, and here's the warning for those who are on the fence about getting this game, it has two major failures: Hackers and the pay-2-win thing. Now, I'm not saying you have to pay anything to win, but there are characters who feel very much OP hidden behind a grind/paywall. You can grind for them, or you can pay for them. My suggestion, if you play this game, save your coins first for one of the pay-2-play characters. The chest you could get for 4,000 will only mostly get you a cosmetic, though some are admittedly cool, but that 12,000 will feel much farther away if you go that route. 

The far worse issue is the hackers. To be fair, it can be an issue in any game, especially since competitive esports has helped make those hacks into big business. Fortunately, not too overly common, but definitely there. When you first start playing, you will get a sense of accomplishment, but you will soon realize that you're being placed against bots. They'll run right at you through objects, though they couldn't possibly see or hear you beforehand. Sometimes they get stuck on objects and terrain and keep running. That's a major problem. This helps in the early parts of the game because you are shielded from the best players and worst hackers. As you face more real players, however, it makes it hard to tell sometimes who's a bot and who's hacking. In their defense, devs promote reporting of hackers. After you die, there's a report function if you observe the player who killed you. There may be other ways to report other players, but they aren't as obvious in-game. Going to the official website (and Google will help you here), you can find a page where they ask players to help them combat hackers. You can either report in-game or submit a report on their website. Players who submit a valid report are rewarded with a legendary spear skin. I feel like that's a pretty good deal and shows at least they're trying... unlike some others I could mention.

So, the take away. The game is a lot of fun, and it's possible to complete achievements in matches that are mostly bots. Though it's pretty easy for the most part (not much of a challenge), it's a good way to help players practice and get better. The game is beautiful, features decent mechanics, and offers a refreshing change from standard battle royale games. The change is mostly thematic (there's still a storm). The character customization is decent. Clothing and hair options are limited right now. Re-colors of other outfits are too common. Loot boxes often give you things you don't want or need, for characters you don't use, but I've made some very good finds. Hopefully this will expand greatly as the game continues.

Should you get it? On sale, for $15, it's not bad. There's a battle pass (thanks, Fortnite, Rocket League, et al.), which costs more money after buying the base game, and some feeling of p2w elements (though perhaps a lot of it is just smart players choosing to use more powerful characters), and some of the complaints raised in this area are valid. Is it a balance issue? Is it p2w? Still, at the end of the day, I'll be putting a lot more hours into this before moving on. Nobody says you have to spend anything more on the game after buying in. And that's a good thing. I recommend it, even with the ugly stuff, if you think it's something you'd like.
 
Game on.

Update: Things have changed a bit since I wrote this review. There aren't as many people playing in my region as there were before. Makes it easier to climb ranks, but it also makes it more difficult to get matched with players of equivalent skill level. With all of the promoting of this game for North American players, I suspect that it isn't just my region experiencing this issue. Having said that, you may want to consider carefully whether you really want the ""battle pass"" since there may or may not be a Naraka next year or the year after, depending on their choices. Another thing, and this is only a warning for those who find demonic possession troubling, the most recent hero draws his strength from a demon which is inside him. There are many different spiritual elements in this game, and this isn't the first time the developers have included things that might be troubling to a few players, but this is the first time I've seen a character who clearly struggles with an invading entity within himself. Since I supported and encouraged others to play Naraka, I felt it necessary to make the changes clear to anyone interested in avoiding that subject matter. Many will think this foolish, but some won't, and I'm writing this for them. 

Also, the problem with hackers has only appeared to get worse. I find the competitive modes mostly unpleasant for that reason. And when hackers turn up in the bot modes, you'll know because they'll target you before they should even be aware of your presence, catching up to you when it should not be possible, and you'll be dead from attacks that happen much more quickly than they should. They'll teleport away to evade you, and drop back in when you're not looking for them, crossing huge sections of map in the blink of an eye--and no, I'm not talking about the characters with teleportation abilities.

Theres a good chunk of cosmetics that aren't obtainable for purchase even after the battle passes or previous events have ended.

In overall, it's a beautiful game with the best character creation mode ever done. The concept of Asian battle royale with melee weapons for the most part is great.

But everything else in this game is horrible.
The optimisation is the worst ever, I barely have 60fps while I have a 1080ti, it stutters like hell and randomly tells me my game files are corrupted when I'm in game. The loading is so laggy and long that I can't choose the location I want to land on and I need to wait for 5 mins before I can interact in the world to get destroyed in a second right after.

I mean, if you want to play a BR game, play a free one with normal optimisation, not this game. Or unless you're only interested into character creation, but it's not worth its price just for that aspect.",1653850913,1653873153,False,4,0,0.518824398517608643,0,True,False,False

- Very fun change of pace from traditional battle royales. 
- Low skill floor to pick up and understand the game.
- VERY HIGH skill ceiling learning how to combo various mechanics.
- Beautiful game
- Regular in game events and new content including new characters (1-2 per season) and new weapons and items
- Battle Pass has stuff at every level on the free track allowing for easy access to free cosmetics without paying for them
- All cash currency purchases are cosmetic only
- Gains and Losses in ranking is based on largely on your own preformance not your teams (trios or duos)
- Has a rotation of additional game modes

Cons:
- First game will be very very laggy if not installed to a solid state drive and can be very GPU demanding. (recommend playing in bot mode for first match of the day)
- Match Making has improved significantly to match players by ping but can still run into people playing wtih very bad ping due players trying to play on other regions servers.
- (personally dont see this as a bad thing but figured i would list it anyway) Game has LOTS of cash shop items even though its not a f2p game (cosmetic only)
- Some tool tip and item descriptions have poor translations into english

Conclusion: I have 156 hours in the game across 3 seasons and have hit as high as gold in ranked (took several months off due to life being busy or the hours would be much higher) This has quickly become my go to battle royale and has been a lot of fun for me in solos and with friends in duos and trios. Price is very reasonable but if you are unsure follow the game because free to play trial weekends are given fairly often. If you can ever get it on sale its an absolute steal.

So if you are not a strong fps player it will not cripple you in combat, but you could be at a disadvantage in some fights. Grapple mechanics are smooth and critical to game-play and fights, and characters are unique and variable. 
Overall there aren't too many bugs in interactions, they do occur with the fast paced highly interactive combat, but are usually rare to see. The amount of mobility and types of mobility in this game, from grappling, to wall climbing, ceiling interaction, scale rushing (running on a vertical surface and then using your weapon to dive in a select direction, even directly up) is liberating and heavily raises the skill ceiling of the game. 
Combat has a base level of experience that you will be able to get by with in most fights, however because of movement variability, weapon combos, stagger effects, dash canceling, i-frame length choice etc, the skill ceiling in combat doesn't really have a cap. If you run into an experienced player sometimes you will feel like there was absolutely nothing you could do to even move before your meet your demise. I have over 1500 hours over multiple accounts, and still get rolled from time to time. Time spent, practice, and skill will be rewarded with more victories in this game. 
Final note, the NA community is still small overall, we have dedicated and friendly players that want to see more people join, but due to the devs lack of focus on the promotion of this game in NA, we remain small. I note this because our small community, broken into 6 game ques, normal match (solo, duo, trios) and ranked (solo, duo, trios) can result in long que times, or a que never popping at non peak hours. This will likely get worse the higher up some competitive ladders you go. Once you get into gold rank which should be easy to achieve, it is also likely you will be seeing some top 100 players on the server in your games. Yet because of the AVERAGE skill level of the lobby being at or below your rank (bots count toward that average) you may not get rewarded very well for outperforming good competition. Grinding ranked ladder at high rank is punishing and will require dedication. The devs have made some improvements to this over the last season, and it has made a positive change, so they see the problem and are trying to create solutions.
Some final notes: Early games you join will be almost exclusively bots to ease you into gameplay, even ranked. This is not reflective of overall game experience, there will likely be some bots even up to gold rank in your lobbies. I have come to love this game, having never played a fighting game or a battle royale, and have climbed as high as 150 on the solo leaderboard. If I have figured out gameplay, so can you. When your starting out please head over to Twitch.tv and check out some Naraka streams, and ask questions, it will greatly help with steady growth in the game.

The game looks amazing, its a very good looking battle royal. The combat is enjoyable and fun to fight with. Definitely more unique than the vast majority of battle royals. 

Main concern is the player base. It's not that large so finding lobbies is hard and you can be sitting there waiting for a match long enough to finish a cup of tea. However, once you do get into a lobby you will be greeted by 4 thing; 1 - bots, there are plenty of bots and its easily noticeable, at first is I assumed that because I'm new I was playing against other stupid people, well there may have been a few real players here, most were bots. 2 - Stupid people, as mentioned in the previous point you will find just bad players, not that it's an issue or anything but just a group you will find (me lol). 3 - Sweaty players. Biggest issue for me when I end up in a lobby is when I end up against players a good few ranks higher than me and they without a doubt have been playing for a while so they easily beat my ass without me even realising it. 4 - Hackers/ ping abusers. You will possibly come across players which are either just cheating or abusing ping to beat you to death without you being able to realise someone was even there. Though some of these are common issues in all battle royal games, I feel like it's far more noticeable here due to a smaller player base specifically the bots which is the largest issue. Further more, some of the animations feel weird and some things are a bit iffy when jumping around on specific things. One thing I noticed, the character can be climbing up and read a roof, the character will somehow manage to throw themselves backwards to grab onto the roof piece, regardless of how far away it is, its pretty funny but doesn't really make sense. 

Overlooking the negative's I do really enjoy this slower paced battle royal feel which the game has, it allows you to have time to do those little mini quests you can find which is a very cute feature (wish there were more types of those) as well as the assassination quests you can find giving you the chance to find a player easier (to realise they are a sweat and they kill you instead). The graphics are great, the map looks gorgeous, characters all look great and have some cool skills. The combat mechanics as mentioned before is fun with cool weapons and individual skills which can be found for them. 

Despite all those negatives, the game is fun to play. Maybe not worth the full price and if it was cheaper the player base would probably be bigger, but alas. It is what it is, regardless of everything I will still be playing and forcing friends to get it as well to make the most out of the game. I do hope that more people will get into the game, which would make it far more fun to play. However, it's still a blast regardless.

Less ""I just spent 30 minutes combing through dead bodies trying to find armor and oops I got shot from 2 miles away and died GG no rewards for me I guess"", and more actual time spent in combat, despite the lower number of overall players compared to some of it's ""competition"" (For lack of a better term).


Fights are more about timing, patience, and quick thinking than just mindlessly W+M1-ing your opponents to death with a rocket launcher or laser accurate gun, since it's all melee combat with wire-fu inspiration mixed in with a little sprinkle of ""Anime"" vibes.

Death comes fast to the unprepared, and yet the game makes it easy to quickly sort yourself out, because it allows you to customize even how you automatically pick up items, and to what extent based on how many bag upgrades you have found on your mission. Find yourself using a lot of armor powder, but rarely sticking around to get hit HP wise? Tone down the number of stacks to 1-2 for health items, and claim the rest of the space for other essential items.

That alone should tell you that they care about the player experience, and the combat is no exception. Simple, but very tricky to master, especially once you step away from the grounded simplicity of Rock-paper-scissors and take to the skies mid combo, or use your grappling hook to slide past your enemy, carrying them off of a ledge to buy your team time to prepare for the inevitable counter attack.

1. First few matches are gonna be bot matches to ease you in. Don't fret it gets harder quicker. 
2. Bloodlust mode for getting better quicker and learning how to fight pvp.
3. Collect all the doramu's? (whatever they are called) during pre match 3's. It will give bonus loot win or loose to whole lobby if lobby finds them all. (including silk).

But my thinking was like I spend 14 bucks on 2 coffees so no big deal. I'm glad I did. It's a fun game smooth mechanics, cool fighting styles and great graphics. I saw a few comments saying that the cheating was bad and there was a lot of lag switch use ... I didn't run into any of this granted I have played for that long but if it was as bad as was mentioned I would have ran into it at some point in the 2 hours I played right? Well I did not. But the way some of these others reviews talked about it was like it was a huge problem. When people say the cheating is bad.... ! First two games to pop into my head are GTA5 and CoD Warzone. That right now seems to me to be the pinnacle of cheating and modding.  What I did notice was a huge skill gap between east vs west players but even thats laughable at best in my opinion. So naturally I applied the most common excuses used by inexperienced or bad players to save face and that is lag or cheaters. Yes in the beginning you will experience a ton of bots but to be fair it says that as you load into games and it nothing new! Fortnite does it! PUBG does it! Again to be fair you don't have to make an initial purchase of Fortnite and now PUBG either but its neither here nor there.  The question is do you want to play a fun game? No its not gonna change your life. But its fun and fast paced and its great when you just want to play a quick BR.

You also don't really get much in terms of rewards and the outfits you do get are rubbish , they look like European or Western outfits even Pirates, It would of been nice to see at least see one Kung Fu outfit with the traditional white socks and black shoes other than just the expired Bruce Lee outfits or the one other character that has them as an outfit. 

Overall its a dead game that a lot of cheaters , pay to win and losers with too much time on their hand will defend.

Furthermore there are stuff like souljades that either apply boosts to your hero or they chance/enhance weapon quick and charged attacks
Then we have grapples which can either help you maneuver around the map or help you engage/leave fights
Now lets not forget about a really important thing in this game which is that every hero has their own ability and ultimate ability which are sure to turn the tables on a fight if you know how to use them
This game also allows you to make talent pages which could be more grapple distance faster ultimate charge or even getting more dark tide coins for the shop
There are a lot of customization for each and every hero and if you don't like how they look you can change their appearance
The sounds of this game are beautiful and there is a different sound for pretty much everything like walking on grass sounds different from walking on a rooftop the charge of the weapons also makes a sound (and has a cool outline effect on the hero) dashing/dodging countering someone sliding etc.
This game is a 10 out of 10 it is really awesome you should try it

Cheating is unbelievably rampant, game quality has fallen off a cliff, the devs do nothing but release new skins and balance patches as though those have any meaning. Spend your money on something else.

I really want to give this game a good review and if things change I eventually might. Right now however I can't in good mind recommend it. When it first came out the game seemed pretty good, was fun to play, and I convinced a few friends to buy it. I even did some streams of it on Twitch. I stopped playing for a bit and then today decided to drop in and give it a try. After a round I decided it was time to write my review. My feeling is that as time has progressed quality of the game experience has declined. That being said I want to be fair so let me list the positives and then the negatives:

Positives:
(+) Visuals: This may be one of the best looking games I've ever played. 
(+) Sound: Another massive success here. The biggest accomplishment though is how well they've done with directional noise. The footsteps of another player match where they're coming from, they match the terrain they're walking on, and really give you a great sense of where other players are in the world. Running through these environments, hearing the distant sounds of combat, and listening for approaching players is this complete sound experience that demonstrates just what the developers can achieve.
(+) Gameplay: The gameplay itself is another massive success. Combat has a great deal of depth and tactical structure. Movement in this game is total wish fulfillment. You really get the sense of being a graceful martial arts master, running on walls, and flipping through the air. They nail the gameplay.
(+) Customization: Usually games like the have some skins or items you can buy and that's about it. Naraka however has an incredibly robust and fun to use character customizer that let's you adjust even the facial features of your characters. I've never seen this in any other game of this style. Another huge bonus.

Negatives:
(-) Learning curve: The learning curve in this game is brutal. Many souljades only have brief descriptions of what their effects are. This is particularly an issue with souljades that modify how your attacks work. There is a great deal of information that's just not ""visible"" and so creates a great deal of challenge in learning the game.
(-) Matchmaking: There currently isn't a good limitation on the skill range of players you'll face in a match. You can be bottom of silver and face gold tier players. I imagine this is because the player counts range pretty heavily given the time of day. Still its an issue that creates results in lobby's being absolutely destroyed in their first few minutes as high skill players obliterate weaker ones. Since the skill curve is so high there is a massive gap between one rank of players and the next creating a situation where the inclusion of one higher skilled player throws off the entire balance in a game.
(-) Cheating: While much of the community wants to pretend that cheating is rare or not a big issue, it's a really massive one that the developers just haven't really done anything about. Now I've been playing competitive games for most of my life and I'm not a young guy. This game probably has the most rampant cheating I've ever seen and probably the broadest range of cheating. Cheats you'll see include:

Macros - You see these come out a lot in the end of matches. Macros as you might guess allow players to take advantage of input cancelling to jam together multiple actions into a single move that no human could achieve manually. I've sat in matches after I've died watching the last two players (both using macros) autocancelling each other into oblivion until one of them knocks the other into the corruption and they die. It's both funny and sad.

""Wallhacking"" - What I really mean is just that this player can visually see where everyone is on the map at all times. It's happened to me where people know exactly where I am inside buildings and I've watched it happen to other people. It is at its worst when people just start firing bow shots into walls because they're shooting at you without being able to see you. This hack is often paired with an aim assist.

Luck Hack - A simple hack that allows players to adjust the drops they receive. I've been in matches where I'm killed by a player who only has legendary soul jades and equipment within the first three minutes of a match.

I think the thing that really bothers me about the cheating in Naraka is how blatant it is. Cheaters make no effort to hide their cheating because they believe that nothing will happen. Thus far, I have not seen that anything has. All of this is piled on top of the current issues they have with ping abuse and player regions. I've also seen people talk about optimization but the game recommends that you have an SSD if you want a reasonable experience. Once I got one and installed Naraka on it I haven't had any loading issues.

Conclusion: Naraka is a game I really want to like. I want this game to succeed. The developers have shown they have an incredible level of skill and love for the game. That's why it's a shame that the game itself just isn't all that fun to play right now. To me the anemic response to the game among western audiences and its weak performance on Twitch is indicative of this. I think this game could be huge. It could have a massive e-sports following. The problems it has though hold it back from the success it deserves. I'm going to leave my review negative for now but I hope that eventually things will change and I can make it a positive one.",1637957731,1649278563,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The concept of the game was a great idea, playing it, it felt smooth and rather fluid in game movement and fighting. Absolutely loved the first few hours of the game (0-100 Hours.) And then things happened IRL and got a new better computer. Upon wanting to return to the game, I was now greeted with a brand new prompt never seen before. 
Prompt: Please Disable HVCI_KMCI

I started to think that was a bit off..I Mean I played the game before without the prompt before I built my new PC...So I did some research. Basically it stops Malicious code from being Injected into your PC.. which is quite odd.. So I asked a friend who does Cyber security who just laughed and said don't disable it. if a program begs for you to that should be a Red Flag.

Soo, I stopped once again playing and dusted off the old PC that didn't have any of that to Test the game to see just how far it came...and oh boy...My reaction went from ""Enjoying the Game!"" to ""What the fuck is this shit"" in a few moments. I was so happy to see other servers now released for the world..but upon joining them I noticed they seem to just be dominated by players that aren't from the region the servers are in. After a bit of playing I have noticed that they are using Ping to their advantage and afterwards just given up on the game...It's quite sad to see that this has happened to a otherwise fun game.

I see the Developers seem to be replying to comments, but they just seem like a bot posting messages with the same thing. I feel like they don't much care for the western audience...and even if so the fact that HVCI_KMCI needs to be disabled being a red flag. makes me think this game is more of a Please Avoid at all Costs. Until that gets fixed.

It should be really easy to get fixed..seriously approved by Microsoft..basically from what I remember being told..Which is kinda once again a red flag.

To put it simply, players can find ways to comfortably play and be competitive without having to aim well, as ranged weapons are strong but outclassed by good movement. Melee combat still requires some form of aim, but it is not as unforgiving as other shooters in that if you cannot manage recoil in firefights, you just lose. Players need to be able to fight well, not aim well.

Reliance on favorable RNG from lootable equipment also becomes a non-issue as the game has ways for you to complete your preferred load-out through shops, 'supply drops', and overall, the size of the map compared to the number of players per round makes loot very abundant.

Playing against bots becomes a non-issue when you consistently make it to the top few survivors. Surely you don't expect to fight bots there?",1648476801,1648476801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Naraka has added NEW FEATURES that is EXTREMELY FRIENDLY to new players and seasoned players which is the new PVE mode or BOT mode. I believe that has solved the skill gap in the game so new players can become more comfortable with the combat styles and use it as kind like a training grounds or for seasoned players to hone their skills in combat it offers two levels of difficulty Casual and Hard so it has something for everyone. As well as new PVP game modes that keep you on your feet to always stay sharp.

Naraka is not the type of game where you get good and thats it, you have to always be hungry and stay motivated to be better, there is always room for improvement. 

As far as cosmetics go I definitely give it a 10/10 keep in mind it is not cheap I think if it was lowered to about 10-15$ it would be well worth it. 

THERE IS NO PAY TO WIN SYSTEM.  in the game, weapons cosmetics are strictly that.

As far as hackers go in pvp yes occasionally you will come across them do not let that push  you away from the game. Hopefully there will be a better system in place top solve this issue but for now try your hardest and fight like hell

Team work makes the dream work keep that in mind.

The Battle pass system may seem intimidating with how many levels there are and the challenges you must complete to obtain them. But you can complete them in the PVE mode so now you wont have to grind hours on end in pvp to level up giving you more focus when it counts in the battle field. 

All in all the game is extremely well rounded and polished. It is definitely worth getting and investing your time into. It has great combat styles as well as beautiful scenery to fight it out in. It would be super cool to get new maps but the game is still a true beauty

Update: installed it on the ssd; game still crushes unexpectedly (not even displaying an error courtesy) and still have fps drops; not as bad as before but still makes it unplayable if those fps drops happen exactly during a fight. call of duty warzone still runs smooth. this game cannot compare.

Update 2: standing with my previous points + a couple of extras: game quits unexpectedly at random times. don't have any other running applications (not even browser) and every 3 or 4 games, it quits once; sometimes during a fight, sometimes while just looting stuff alone. and then there's the hacking problem; there's LOTS of hacking cheaters in this game. it almost seems to me as if they never get banned. i meet hacking cheaters every 2nd game (wallhacks caught watching a wall and then killing their target instantly via some teleportation hack, macro exploiters that get you in a stunlock until you die, and many more). these cheaters usually have skins on their characters, making me think the people that should ban them, don't. also the fact that you can find at least one every 2nd game you play.",1635186216,1647947268,True,0,0,0.508196711540222168,1,True,False,False

But for real, it is a really cool new perspective and take on Battle Royale. 
More of a traditional combat style with its swords, katana and more
At least you wont get beamed by a rifle from a mile away like in other Battle Royale games :)
Takes a while to learn how to properly engage, counter and basics of fighting

In short, it has similarities to Apex Legends mechanics wise and it is a splice between traditional chinese combat and Apex Legends

Pros:
- Cool character customization options
- Unique Souljade items which is similar to perks/power up


Cons:
- Somewhat uneven matchmaking
- Cosmetics/Skins seems to be roughly the same but in different colours
- Ranking up seems a little tedious as you dont get many points even for winning
- Super high chance of getting duplicates from their lootboxes called ""Immortal Treasure""
- Customer Support is literally useless

Additional things that i think would make the game better:
- Rewarding players with Tae as random reward after each match
- More events with actually nice cosmetics/skins/etc
- Duos game mode(UPDATE: Added)

Game is a melee oriented battle-royale, set in Chinese culture. Just because combat is mostly focused on melee weapons, you still have a few ranged options to chose from as well. If you die, you die because you can't play melee (you won't get sniped by Hanzo or Widowmaker from 300m just because someone plays sniper rifles for 9000h in FPS). Game is not easy, and somewhat foggy about ""what should i do, to not die to some Korean player with spear?"". There are a few tutorials in-game, but they are pretty...basic. Enough to play against bots, but not enough to play against players. All weapons have their own combos; every character have their own skills (some are straight useless in most cases but generally everything is playabe).

[list][b]I'll try to summarize pros and cons in easy form:[/b]
[*]There are quite a lot of people on every server, so it shouldn't be a problem to find ranked game (unless you play when gamers amount is decreasing, then queue time is getting noticeably longer);
[*]Game has nice but repetative vibe - graphics, sounds, multi-language dubbing lines, animations;
[*]Games are not that long - i think they end at around 25th minute at most;
[*]There are some waifu and rule34 materials *wink*;
[*]There is build-in voice chat in-game (on top of normal text chat);
[*]You can play with up to 2 friends (since lobby is capped at 3 players);
[*]There are few game modes on top of ""normal"" game.
[*]You should use SSD drive to play, HDD will make your game freeze quite often and it is crucial to be freeze-less to stay alive;
[*]Battle pass costs almost as much as base game. It offers both free and paid tiers of course, but you probably experienced in other games that difference between free and paid is visible (but free to play games like Narka has to make money too, right?);
[*]There are quite a lot of quests. Daily/weekly/seasonal/character specific (not like this is bad by itself, but you almost exclusively gain in-game currency from quests, you can't grind them by just playing (this is to slow progress of gaining skins and push you to paying with real money for them));
[*]You'll open chests rather rarely. This is bad because your customization progress will be slow if you won't invest real money in gambling boxes and feeling of ""expanding wardrobe"" is non-existant (comparing to Overwatch where you get chest every account level or after doing some quests. Here you get chests from battlepass, character quests (so like 2-3 per character) and you can buy them with hard cap 4/week.
[*]Game is made on Unity Engine, and has its own anti-cheat (that is kinda garbage, game is flooded with cheaters & script/macro users);
[*]Game is [u]not[/u] pay-to-win, you can upgrade weapons ONLY in-match with lootable glyphs (everybody can do that and it is part of gameplay);
[*]There is no crafting system but it does have lootboxes with skins (a bit like Overwatch);
[*]Skins are quite expensive for ""free to play"" players (the most expensive costs 98000 silk and i have like 30k after 70h in-game) so your best bet is to get them from chest (not every skin is ""chestable"", some are exclusive to battle pass or promo codes (#gambling));
[*]To change nickname in-game, you need to pay with paid or grindable currency.
[*]Game is absolutely the purest form of tryharding that exists. Recommended only for players that enjoy sweatin' to the limits. It is fun when you are good, but it will take time to get to that level if you don't have background in frame-perfect games like Tekken.[/list]

[i]*note* Battlepass costs either 1360 or 4360 gold. All premium tiers (if you unlock them) will give you only 1280 gold back. So here goes your money - you either buy more to sustain battle pass for few seasons, or be forced to buy some gold every 3 months.[/i]
[list]Gold packages available in store:
[*]240G - $1,85
[*]1200G - $9,25
[*]3000G - $23,15 (+1 lootbox)
[*]6000G - $46,25 (+3 lootbox)
[*]12000G - $92,5 (+10 lootbox)[/list]

Only thing that hurts me personally about this game is cashgrabs and gambling taken straight from mobile games on top of paying $20 for game (that is far from perfect). Battle pass, gambling boxes, paid exclusive skins and maybe more in the future.

Don't buy it - it is a hot garbage, and Twitch audience is already dying in EU/NA. I doubt this game will bloom but might wither for few years being populated by pros who can't play other games, and cheaters. Don't make same mistake as i did.

I have tried EVERYTHING to get this game to run smoothly. Trying to get into a match gives me PAIN like scraping your nails against chalkboard. My 13 hours spent playing this game is mainly me waiting for the game to load so it's playable. Once you finally load into the wait lobby, the countdown apparently started while you were loading in and you load in at the literal last second, unable to select your spawn point or character. Then once the match starts, you're still loading. I died literally within seconds of match start because i was still loading in and a person got a shot in on me. I couldnt even load into bot mode properly!! Ping is always SUPER CRAZY HIGH even with my high speed internet through ethernet cable. It has its good points that are mentioned by others below but the fact that I cant even play it overshadows everything. 

This game is not optimized at all and at it's price point, I can not recommend anybody buys this until they fix the issue.

Imagine Jade Empire like environments with Crouching Tiger/Hero moves and gameplay with grappling hooks and climbing. The character models and environments look great and the gameplay is actually pretty good. Kinda reminds me of gameplay from Black Desert. Loose, fast but also pretty solid.

The game is fairly priced and if Chinese mythos and ancient martial arts are your thing, I think you would fall in love with this game.

In its tutorial, the melee-focused battle royale game teaches you to combo by clicking repeatedly—no problem, I love clicking—and then introduces its weird countering system without really explaining it.

You start learning that your parry has a Sekiro-like margin of success, and even that's predicated on a poorly-explained color system that tells you if your character has the ability to parry a specific attack altogether. Dodges are effective, but can be easily adjusted for by a smart, forward-thinking player.

Weapons are a bit unbalanced and you will find some games to be very frustrating because you will get stun locked and destroyed instantly. However that's pretty standard for BR (unbalanced weapons and instant death that is) so i guess its to be expected. Those factors aside still pretty entertaining and character customization is great. Love that you can make your character look completely crazy with purple skin and pink hair if you really want so 10/10 on that. All and all I'd give it a solid 7.5 or 8 out of 10.

When you start logging hours practicing, you can really appreciate the combat and how fun and rewarding the game can be. Also, I think it's really nice that the emphasis of the combat is more melee oriented. There are bows, a single musket, a pistol, the legendary swarm... but it doesn't feel like CoD/Apex Legends/Overwatch, as these games have multiple SMG's/Rifles etc. I LOVE how the balance of each various weapon combined with character specific abilities feels in your hands.

1. Unbalanced matchmaking - You are getting paired with people who are 100 times better than you.
2. No Region-lock, making it possible for chinese people and alike to join.
3. Extremely low player-base, sadly enough, this game is already in decline, and it shows in the queue times. Especially when i played during the morning my time, this game felt extremely dead, with endless queues, or very long queue times. (longer than 15 minutes)

At this moment, i cannot recommend Naraka: Bladepoint due to these 3 point primarily. Do not understand this in the wrong way, the potential is there, but there is a lot of work to be done to get this game to a sweet spot, and to become enjoyable.

For now it's a experience like this:

Wait 5-10 minutes in a queue to only get matched with and against people who are way too good at the game already, or that are learning the game, this mix is not enjoyable and quickly causes you to just close the game and forget about it.

Also occasionally has terrible performance, with lag spikes, textures not loading in and in my case, the game files even got corrupted by themselfs, which without any other option kicked me out of the game and gave me a penalty for leaving a game in progress. This should also be changed so that people who encounter problems like this and are forced to leave don't get penalties for leaving when the game basicly forces you to leave.

Maybe in the future this game will reach a point where it's enjoyable to play, but for now i cannot recommend it.",1646646192,1646646192,False,1,0,0.496882319450378418,1,True,False,False

The learning curve is more of a learning 90 degree angle. They give you bots to smack around for the first two hours so you think you are good at the game and play past the refund time. Then you get hit by a brick wall of pain. Your cock will get ripped off. Many times. This game is unforgiving. The players that populate this game are either hapless newbies like myself getting free vasectomies every 3 seconds or ultra hyper pros that really should touch grass once in a while. (Insert comments telling me to 'get gud') Now, I was aware of all of this when I bought it. I read the negative reviews and watched videos. What bothers me the most is that I paid $13 for this game, (got it on sale), and was met with the most free to play system of monetization possible. You got a battlepass, which is to be expected, but also lootboxes, premium currency, and paywalled characters that you have to grind for.  You do get lootboxes through unlockables here and there, and you can buy them with the common currency, (although they are stupidly expensive and everytime you buy one the price goes up, which is bs. On top of that, you can only buy 4 or 5 every 3 days or so.), but that's about it. As far as I am aware, you can never earn the premium currency, and the prices aren't cheap. With this system of monetization, it should really be free to play. It feels like I paid for a slice of a game. Yeah I can play it, but all the sick costumes are locked away. Now I don't have a problem with this type of monetization, even in paid games, but in a paid game you expect it to be obtainable in decent amounts through gameplay. Don't buy this game. If it ever becomes free to play, go for it, but unless you are a serious masochist like me, forking over the cash for a cock and ball torture session with lootboxes is not wise. I will continue to play it though, because while the combat and gameplay is overwhelmingly difficult, struggling through to get that flawless katana combo triple kill triggers more dopamine receptors than crack.",1646112518,1646112518,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It's a very high pace, filled with actions that will keep your blood pumping and heart moving.   I've started watching this game since it was in beta and purchased it when it was released, and I have to say that it's worth every penny I paid for.   This is one of the to-go games that I wind down after a long day at work.   The game has a diverse set of character choices as well as weapons.   You will always run into players with a different play style on the battlefield, and it forces you to think before you act.  I love the outfits! When you look good, you play better.  It has minor bugs here and there, but the game update frequently.  If you're still contemplating whether or not to get this game, you should just invest and start having fun! Whether you play with strangers or your friends, it's an endless experience.   Sometimes I find myself playing this game for 7+ hours straight because it's THAT addictive.  Don't mind the Chinese players; they're there to help you improve your skills.   The game would be boring if you didn't get challenged by better players.  Just keep practicing, and one day you will defeat those names you can't pronounce.

In the case of stuttering and serious delays, it is impossible for players to freely play their operating skills. So this also proves that those players who can play well and operate well are definitely Cheating is adopted, because only cheating software will not be affected by the game's lag and delay.

I have played this game with both a high-end computer and a low-end computer, and I have also used various so-called methods that can eliminate delays and freezes. However, when both high-end and low-end computers have lowered the picture quality of the game, the stalls and delays of the high-end and low-end computers are equally serious. This fact is enough to prove that the lag and delay of this game are only caused by the optimization of the game itself or server problems. It’s safe to say that anyone who has played NARAKA will be very clear that what I said is the truth. The game is indeed very lagging and delayed.

And combined with the facts mentioned above, I can say with certainty that the masters of this game will definitely not dare to play face-to-face with you in life, because there is no way to use cheating software when playing face-to-face, so the manufacturer of this game absolutely It is impossible to hold a face-to-face competition below the line, because once face-to-face cannot use cheating software, then the master's operating skills will not be able to show. This also proves that this game is full of deception. Perhaps the official secretly allowing some players to cheat is to confuse the public. This part of the cheating players will spread the information that the game is not stuck, and use the excellent personal operation caused by the cheating software to confuse the public. , Let the public mistakenly believe that the game itself has no lag and delay, or make the public mistakenly believe that even if the lag and delay are serious, they can play their operating skills freely. Simply put, the facts have fully proved that the quality of this game is very poor and the game manufacturers are resorting to deception to seek benefits. I also won’t bother with those who disagree with facts and cannot refute me on the basis of definite facts, because there is no essential difference between the statements that cannot be proved on the basis of clear facts and the nonsense of lunatics.








The most common despicable method used by China's bad businesses is to hire others to spread lies to mislead and deceive the public in order to achieve the goal of profit. For example, NARAKA is indeed full of cheating. In order to maintain NARAKA’s reputation and avoid loss of popularity, game manufacturers will hire others to spread lies on the Internet. These hired people lie that they have played NARAKA for a long time but have never encountered cheating. The purpose of this kind of lies is to mislead and deceive the public to make players mistakenly believe that there are very few cheating in the NARAKA game, creating the illusion that the NARAKA game environment is very good. So don’t believe in other people’s claims that lack evidence of facts, and the facts of your own experience are credible, and only believe that things with facts are correct. 






The Chinese people's concept is that what they say should be regarded as true by others, and there is no need for facts to prove that what they say is true or false. That’s why many Chinese people think that they only need to say that their account was stolen by others for cheating and then the account was blocked, or that the game official banned their account indiscriminately, then the game official should take what they said seriously. , And then lift the ban for the banned account. These Chinese believe that there is no need for factual evidence to prove that what they have said is true, and that they only need oral statements to be regarded as definite evidence. The Chinese believe that proving the true nature of things does not require a clear factual basis to prove it. Therefore, many Chinese believe that taking out their own account remote login records, which does not clearly prove that their account has been stolen, can deceive game manufacturers to unblock their accounts. Because as long as you use the game network accelerator VPN, the login area of ​​your account will change with the VPN node area, so as long as the account that has used the VPN, the account will be logged in from another place, so as long as the account that has used the VPN to log in from another place will be It is possible to create the illusion of being stolen, so the fact is that logging in from another location does not clearly prove that your account was indeed stolen. The facts that can clearly prove that your account has been stolen are based on, for example, the confession of the criminal who stolen the account of another person, or the traces of information that had been stolen from your account by hacking software before the account was blocked. To be precise, the hacking software stealing the trace information of your account does not fully prove that your account is really stolen, because you can use the hacking software to steal your account, and then forge the evidence of the stolen fake, and then you can use it. Fake evidence to deceive game manufacturers to lift the ban on the account that was blocked for cheating. Unless you can come up with factual evidence to prove that the hacking software stolen your account has nothing to do with you, only in this way can you fully prove that your account is really stolen. The point is that all three-year-olds know that there is no essential difference between the statement that cannot be proved by facts and the nonsense of the lunatics on the street, so they are completely unreliable.



任何说永劫卡顿不严重可以正常玩或说什么可以流畅不卡顿玩的说法都只是水军孝子为了忽悠人而编造的谎言所以永远不敢面对事实性验证 ，水军孝子的说法就和街上疯子没事实性的胡言乱语没有任何本质区别 ，这就像街上疯子随口来句明天就是末日所以大家应该把自己财产全部花光才对，然后你让疯子用事实性证明自己说的是真是假，疯子就各种东扯西拉逃避事实性验证 ，比如疯子说他可以证明只是不想证明 ，在比如疯子为了逃避验证反问你怎么证明明天就不会是末日呢 ，在比如疯子为了迫使你不在要求他验证 ，就说如果自己用事实性验证了那你就必须把自己全部财产都给他你敢答应吗 ，然后没脑子不懂得根据事实性明辨是非真假的憨憨听到疯子那样说就会因疯子的那句明天是末日这句话而感到忧虑困扰，不断考虑明天到底是末日还是不是末日呢 ，到底该不该把自己钱花光呢 ，疯子虽然没有用事实验证自己说的是真是假 ，但疯子让别人拿出事实性证明不会是末日别人也拿不出确切证据那不就证明了明天也还是有可能是末日 ，所以没脑子的憨憨就会不断忧虑明天到底是末日还是不是末日到底该怎么办啊不断的被疯子的一句明天是末日这句话给困扰烦恼这不就是纯粹的愚昧吗 ，所以说但凡有脑子的都该清楚任何没事实性验证的说法和事物，都和街上疯子的胡言乱语没有任何本质性差别，所以根本不可信。聪明人都只信经得起事实性验证的事物或说法 ，而疯子的那句明天会是末日这话本身只属于是没能被事实性验证的说法那么聪明人就只会当作是完全不可信的屁话所以根本就不会被这句话影响更不可能因这句屁话而困扰烦恼





这就像水军孝子们随口编造的我可以流畅不卡顿玩永劫是同样的道理 ，既然任何说永劫流畅不卡顿水军孝子们不能用开直播玩永劫这种没有造假可能明确可信的办法证明自己说法的真假 ，那么任何说永劫流畅不卡顿的说法都只是和疯子胡言乱语一样没事实性验证的不可信屁话而已 ，而没脑子的憨憨就会因为没事实性验证的屁话去折腾自己的电脑花费冤枉钱换配置结果被水军孝子嘲笑死 ，而聪明人在永劫可流畅不卡顿玩这句话没被事实性验证前根本就不会信只会当作是屁话所以就不可能被水军孝子给忽悠欺骗 ，就像我之前说的 ，大家可以自己去永劫直播间把观看清晰度调最高开个全屏自己去观察主播玩永劫的流畅卡顿度 ，看自己是否能接受会不会影响到自己的正常游玩自己用亲身体会事实性去验证才靠谱 ，自己观察后发现卡顿严重发现游戏品质差那就说明永劫垃圾是事实 ，而对于水军孝子为了忽悠人而撒谎说的什么我看主播玩很流畅我自己玩很流畅等等任何没事实性验证的说法都只属于不可信的屁话 ，除非能拿出事实依据证明自己的说法才可信 ，比如明确指出哪个主播不卡顿然后你自己去观察发现真的不卡顿才可信 ，比如说可以流畅玩的除非能开个现场直播玩永劫用事实性演示出自己真的可以流畅玩才可信 ，至于什么图片或视频事实是都包含了造假可能所以根本不可信 ，比如图片完全可以打人机帧数高时进行截图所以根本不能证明永劫是否真的可以流畅玩 ，还有视频也可以在人少服务器压力小或者永劫最流畅的时候拍个视频造假 ，因为玩过永劫的都该清楚永劫有时候会相对流畅很多有时候又突然变得非常卡顿 ，所以视频和截图显然充满了造假伪证不可信因素所以不能当作证据 ，有脑子的都清楚只有开个直播玩永劫才是没有造假可能值得相信的验证办法





还有但凡玩过游戏有脑子的都清楚如果永劫卡顿是玩家电脑问题就应该是一直玩起来都是同样的卡顿程度才对 ，不可能是今天玩流畅而明天却突然卡顿变严重，或者变得越来越卡顿也就是游玩卡顿流畅度在不断变化 ，因为有谁玩单机游戏会是今天玩卡顿明天玩又突然流畅吗都只会是第一次玩是什么效果那么之后玩都会是同样的效果 ，除非电脑换配置或更新出异常才会玩起来卡顿流畅度发生变化 ，也就是只要自己电脑没有发生变动那么玩单机游戏的游玩效果就始终都只会是相同的效果感受 ，所以这个事实性就足以证明永劫有时玩流畅有时变的突然卡顿严重就说明永劫的卡顿问题只是游戏本身的变化导致的绝对不可能是玩家电脑导致的 ，简单说各方面的事实性都已经完全证明了永劫的卡顿严重只是因为游戏本身的品质差而导致和什么玩家电脑等等其他因素都没有关系 ，而任何间接或直接说永劫可流畅不卡顿运行的说法或什么图片视频也都只是些经不起事实性验证不可信的造假和谎言 ，所以但凡有脑子的都只会非常肯定永劫就是个品质垃圾纯粹靠水军孝子们用各种手段谎言去带节奏忽悠别人骗人购买入坑的渣游 ，不需多说不必争辩我已经说得很详细很透彻了所以三岁孩子都该懂 ，而任何没脑子憨憨或水军孝子们没事实性验证的说法或造假伪证也只等于是街上疯子没事实性的胡言乱语所以根本不必理会 ，因为正常人是不会搭理疯子乱叫的",1628756184,1645737196,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,8,True,False,False

The graphics are great, there are fun events, and it is a great game for those with a competitive attitude. That being said, the player base in NA is quite small, which can lead to newer players playing against the top rank NA players. While I enjoy this most of the time, I sometimes find it discouraging and can see that it may have an impact on new casual players who are not so competitive. While there are some imbalances with each season the team generally listens to the community and corrects them. One issue i would like to see addressed better is anti-cheat and prevention against teaming in some way, these are both serious problems to have in a BR. Overall the game is amazing and easily one of my favourites, it is fun solo and even more fun with friends in duos or trios.

Cons: Despite my thumbs down, that has more to do with my region than anything.  The NA region has a painfully small player base.  People are VPNing over to us and it's not great.  High pings, light attack spam and brutal queue times (15-20 minutes, per match) even at peak make this game hard to love.  There are also some minor cheating irritants. The skin sales are a little excessive, but that's *every* game right now.  

I got to Gold IV in the season I played a lot (about halfway up the ranking system), and was consistently paired against top 500 players in my region (platinum, solar, etc.).

The game also desperately needs a region lock. There are too many Asian-region players in NA servers and it messes with the gameplay because of latency (again).

Queue times are very long (3-5 minutes) and they really suck if you die quickly since it's a battle royale. Again, there are caveats to this with teamplay, but solos means you're screwed if someone kills you early. It doesn't seem like that many people play this game, although the numbers on Steamcharts are high considering this game's presence in Asia.

Don't see why they would want you to do that but its suspicious. Its a base windows security option that creates a virtual server to scan code for malicious bits, before allowing it to access windows. Its a great security option that stops low level drivers from allowing the code to access your kernal. Its actually ridiculous they want you to turn it off and it a questionable change to their security requirements. Essentially this makes the game unplayable unless I want to open my computer up to malicious code. Worth mentioning that starting the game anyway has a chance of locking that feature on your computer. The game literally will stop you from turning it back on. Can't be more disappointed.


Starting with the bad. 

This game has some of the worst monetization I've ever seen in a game. The battle passes are long and grindy and the skins are expensive. 

Hacking is a noticable problem, even with their overly intrusive anti-cheat. People will often chain combos faster then they should be able to, infinite juggle, perform unrealistic animation cancel, and preform multiple animations at once such as countering and using a skill(which you cant normally do). 

There's also a huge problem with foreign players taking advantage of switching servers. There are a lot of chinese players in particular on NA servers, who are either hacking or taking advantage of the ping differences to avoid damage, as there hit box wont usually be where their model is. The devs cleary don't care about this, I havent seen any mention of addressing or fixing it. They just want to make absurd amounts of money on their skins. I wouldn't spend a penny on the game outside of buying it. Not only do they not deserve the extra income, but you will get plenty of free stuff and save your self on over paying for pixels. 

Fortunately for them, the gameplay is quite good and they have a fair amount of free cosmetics for people who play during their frequent short term events. The game boasts one of the most fluid movement systems in the industry and a fun skill focused combat system with lots of flexability in playstyle based on your weapon and character of choice. If you can look passed these things and aren't planning on taking the game competitively then you will enjoy it. If you are very competitive then you might want to skip it, as there will definitely be situations where you will be questioning the validity of a fight. Whether it be infinite juggles, impossible animation cancels, the enemy not taking any damage at all, or them countering every strike you make. Either nullifying the strikes damage or disarming you in the process.",1631340177,1643763366,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]Foreword[/h2]
I got to know ""Naraka: Bladepoint"" through a friend.
At first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.
First of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.
Exactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.
Unfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.
Nevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.

[h2]Positives[/h2]
[list]
[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content
[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly
[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends
[*]Pleasant graphics
[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent
[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame
[*]Different game modes and events
[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons
[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)
[*]Well thought through character designs
[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.
[/list]

[h2]Neutral[/h2]
[list]
[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.
[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.
[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions
[/list]

[h2]Negatives[/h2]
[list]
[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially
[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat
[*]Voicechat is not well thought through
[*]Partial performance losses
[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)
[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation
[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta
[/list]

[h2]Review written out[/h2]
Naraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.
I love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).
So while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.
Only the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.
For example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.
This is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. 
However, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.
(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).
However, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.

Unfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.
The game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.
There are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.
This is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.
Unfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.
Sadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.
You partly punch through enemies bodies.
Various focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.
This is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.
For example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.
According to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just ""memes"" . 
But you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.

Another big problem is the matchmaking.
Even with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.
This is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.

As negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.
I love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.
This reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.
In addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.
Especially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.
The map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. 
Great lighting design really highlights some of the locations.
You can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).

But my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. 
The ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.
Getting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.
So does slaying a moonbane.

[h2]Epilogue[/h2]
All in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.
I love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.

Even though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.
The accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.

I would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.

I would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.
I'm looking forward to your opinions :)
With best regards

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a really interesting battle royale game. Instead of the current gunfight battle royale, they try to make a game that is mainly based on melee cold weapons(most of the ranged weapons in this game are inferior to the melee weapon) combat to make this game different. The system of this game is very attractive. The graph is not bad, the optimization of the game is fairly plausible. The music on the main menu and the music cut in during the battle are very good, too.

However, we can not ignore the shortcomings of this game. For now, there is only one map in this game, not good for keeping the enthusiasm of the players. For the first 20 or 30 hours, you may find this game is really interesting, however, after you know how this game work, you will find that each round of this game sometime is a little similar. However, I think the developer still could fix it, and I just hope that NetEase would not screw it up.

This game is impressive, but for now maybe still needs to be polished. Unless you want to try this game now, maybe waiting for the patch is a good choice. Which edition of this game you should purchase is also an important thing for you to consider, as many people reflect that the DLC of this game sometimes does not work even if you purchase them.",1631633988,1643445063,True,72,6,0.752925574779510498,5,True,True,False

The netcode in this game, the way it handles desyncs and large latencies, combined with the fact that you will be matched with people across the world, make for an utterly miserable experience online, even when I was winning it felt bad.

The reputation system is something that I find not only annoying, but also pretty scummy for a BR that has a $30 dollar entry price. The monetization is a bit more intrusive, which as well is detriment for the same reason that the reputation system is a freaking bad idea.

High ping players and region locking has been mentioned a few times here and there on the Dev logs, but no implementation or a solution seems to be on the devs priorities, and you will find the same ammount of cheaters the longer you keep playing ranked matches (and to the nay-sayers of this detail, read my initial review or educate yourself and search for any Naraka ""plugin"" as the asian players know the you-know-what-i-mean type of, lets call it ""tool assistance"", I swear the asian market for this type of thing can rival those used on games like CS, Fortnite and  GTAV). All these things are some of the details why the game does not have a presence on Twitch, and why there will never be a well entablished and proper esports scene as the devs intend to, which, with the state in which the game still is, should not be a priority untill most of the problems are solved.

Plus, after returning and playing the game 10 more hours, a personal nitpick I have is that, there is little variety for a game focused on melee combat besides that of the skills used by each hero. Sure, its a BR title and it would be hella difficult to balance it if every character had a bit of variety on animations, hit boxes and whatnot, but if you're the type of player that looks to learn different playstyles, You won't find it here. So I still cannot recommend this, use those $30 bucks on a better game.

Edit 1: changed typos and should mention that, within the latest update, the devs have added a reputation system that affects you when you leave a game, even within the prep time. If this reputation gets lower than 7500 and 6000 points, you'll be banned from playing Herald's Trial and Quick Match respectively. Practically you won't be able to play most of the game modes. What a way to kill your game, mofos. Just to point out, I've regularly have seen a concurrent playerbase of over 100k players, close to 150k, but now the numbers are standing just over 33k, so yeah, 24 Entertaiment and Netease, enjoy your future dead game if you keep doing nonsense like this.

And to anyone else, better find something else to play and don't buy this, and if you have already bought the game, let the devs know your concern and place a negative here, because if you don't let them know this is such a bad change, you've wasted your money like this dum dum here.

Will continue to add more as the insanity grows, we'll see how bad this ends later on.

-----

Naraka: Bladepoint is a game that has great potential, that unfortunately will meet its end if the glaring problems that many other users have already pointed out are not fixed by the company.

And my view was changed because I kept practicing right after the 20ish  hour mark, a moment in which I though will be abandoning the game, but by sheer stuborness I begun to learn more about the game mechanics, and discovered things like traverse tricks, combo interruption, combo transition, etc. The game is really fun when you learn more and more about the way these mechanics work, becasue many players might think that, since its a Battle Royale it should work like any other game in the genre, or that if you have Fighting Game knowledge, you'll automatically do fine, which is not the case.

I used to be completely destroyed because I though this way, but after learning the mechanics and the potential that this game has, I'm having more fun with it.

But even with all that I really cannot recommend the game, since it has an overwhelming problem with high ping players and cheaters, and if you are on of those in denial that the game does not have any cheaters, let's remember that any type of game that has had any competitive element has suffered from cheater, heck, even Fall Guys had this problem, so with that I rest my case.

Plus the game has other problems, like no camera speed optimization, and the camera itself becomes frustrating in many places on all the maps.

I'll still be playing this game because I'm a stubborn bast', but if you don't want to suffer and be frustrated, avoid this game like the plague. Anyways, if these problems are not solved sooner or later, I can see the game dying soon enough. Even gacha games have better customer service experiences, which is a detail that should be very telling of the state in which this game is, and the grim future that it has if something is not done soon enough.",1632588889,1643214401,False,2,1,0,0,True,False,False

However, if you are recommending someone to play the game and they miss the box on account creation to use a friends torchbearer code they can no longer say that you referred them. This is annoying and although I have had two people install the game I will not be able to get the associated items.

Additionally the way you unlock battle pass exp is insane. You use rare tokens to get quests and they are completely removed from your inventory if you fail the quest in that round instead of letting you finish the purchased quest in a later game. Also, battle pass progress is way to slow.

Not to mention the issue of foreign players joining in on the servers far away from their country to take advantage of the lag. When this happens they will not take damage when being hit, counters won't appear on screen when they are performed and you will randomly be disarmed, even during light attacks (which you cannot be disarmed during) and your health will be depleted more than single hits should damage you do to the server not properly registering hits during combat.

Game is fucking fun. Downside is newer players might get destroyed. The devs tried compensating with bots in game, but it COMPLETELY fails in comparison when fighting an actual player. Bots are pretty much just punching bags. For newer players I highly recommend looking up guides and tutorials on youtube. The skill gap is pretty heavy, but once you have a general idea, its incredibly fun.
One last thing is, you need homies to play this game lol. Playing by yourself is literally cancer.

TL;DR: An interesting take on the battle royale genre that is sadly overshadowed by technical issues. 
Things like high ping (no SA servers), unfriendly new player experience (b2p, veteran players have some advantages) and small player base. 
If/when you find a good match you might have a ton of fun.
Unfortunately most often than not you will spend a long time waiting in queue, only to join a match and proceed to get destroyed and sent back to it a few minutes later.

-- The Good --

- Fun melee take on the battle royale genre*
- Gorgeous graphics
- Well optimized (I have medium specs hardware and have no issues)
- Bots which can help new players practice*
- Multiple different modes, if you're not in the mood for BR*

-- The Bad --

- No SA servers
- Bad netcode
- No region lock
- Bad matchmaking
- Small player base
- Unfriendly to new players
- Progression crawls to a halt after a couple levels
- Bots which fill the server and pad the stats
- Loot boxes on a b2p game (cosmetics only, but c'mon aren't we past that?)

-- The Ugly --

All of the above together. 

My average experience can be described as: 

Spend over 5 minutes waiting in queue. 
Join NA server with around 150ms ping. 
Server is filled with bots, a couple players here and there.
Kill a couple of bots.
Die to a player that's either a veteran of the game or abusing high-ping (or both).
Go back to queue.

-- Thoughts --

An interesting melee battle royale that's unfortunately burried beneath a host of technical issues and design flaws.
Given the major problems this game has, most of the positive things that sound good on paper don't actually work - and in some cases might even contribute to the problems.

Melee combat:

First and foremost, which is the bread and butter of this game and what entices players to jump in.
The main combat revolves around three actions, Regular attacks, Focus attacks and Parrying. 
Focus attack beats Regular attack. Parrying beats Focus attack. Regular attack beats Parrying. 
Simple enough right? Well, it all goes through the window due to the ping issues (lack of regional servers, people abusing high-ping).
When fighting high-ping players you're often not able to hit them at all, or what it feels like it.
Regular attacks that hit on your screen just go through them. Want to parry their Focus attack? Good luck.
It is by no mean a one-sided issue as I've noticed that some times enemy attacks that clearly should have hit me completely missed.

Bots:

They help new players learn the game and can also fill servers so they don't feel empty, which is good. 
The problem is, after you're past early learning curve, they just become a nuisanse.
Other than their 0ms parrying ability, they just become pushovers. Most of them die mid-match because they're stuck outside of the zone somewhere anyway.
It is nice that you can play against bots and still complete make progress towards your account/hero/battlepass levels, but this is mainly a competitive game, I shouldn't be forced to play against just to get a stable match.

Small Player base:

Given the above, it's no surprise that the player base for this game is small. REALLY small.
Most matches are 90% filled with bots, which is awesome to start with, but quickly becomes boring.
Some times I run into the same few players over and over in the span of a couple matches.
There are a variety of modes by itself that's good. But when you have an already small player base, splitting them into different modes only serves to worsen the issue.
If the small player base is a result of the issues, or if the issues are more aggravating because of the small player base, it's hard to say.

New Player experience:

New players don't get their own queue so unless they play against bots they will get matched with veteran players, who will usually just destroy them.
Adding to that, the game boasts an account progression system called ""Talents"".
As you level up you unlock slots which you can fill with ""glyphs"", which can also be upgraded using in-game currency.
These give passive buffs which range from worthless/niche (less damage outside of zone) to must-haves (higher energy cap, energy recovery speed).
This puts already new and inexperienced players on an even worse position compared to players that have already unlocked these buffs.
Also, unless there's an event going on (which there were plenty when I joined) progression quickly halts to a stop.
There are only 3 daily tasks, after completing that you're stuck with end-of-match experience, which is low. 
That coupled with slow/bad matchmaking and the small player base makes it very unsatisfying.

-- In conclusion --

There are a number of fundamental problems that bog the game down and prevent it from being great.
I'm no game developer, but if I had to change one thing it would be to lower or remove the barrier of entry. 
Transitioning to a f2p model - or at the very least hosting more regular free-weekends -, this might inject some energy into this game.
Of course, resolving the other issues is also a priority, without which new players will probably not stick around.

This is a good game, I wouldn't have written this ""essay"" if I wanted it to fail, it's just sad that I and many others can't enjoy it because of these issues.",1640750450,1642364471,False,2,0,0.531355977058410645,0,True,False,False

There is currently a huge problem with chinese people playing on the NA server abusing their extremely high ping, making it completely impossible for actual NA players to enjoy the game. It is impossible to time blocks and combos properly when the other party is snapping around the battlefield slaughtering everybody and the devs refuse to do anything about it. Until this is fixed, I am changing my review to negative

Game is really fun but between the final beta and and release,  the devs decided to lock a bunch of cosmetics behind a shitty microtransaction based loot box system. The gameplay itself is a nice change of pace and I've really been enjoying the game. Only complaint is the movement system seems to be a bit unrefined for a twenty dollar game with as many microtransactions as your average f2p mobile game

Edit: Game was fun until the Chinese players took over and ruined it. Now every game you get killed by a squad of 3 people with ping so high you are dead before you even see them",1629778805,1642142740,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When the game isn't working, there are constant frame drops, textures don't load, and there are constant warning to install the game on a SSD despite the fact that I have it installed on a SSD specifically designed for gaming. 

Somethings to consider: 
I am playing on a gaming labtop that is above the system requirements with giga speed internet. 

All of my graphic settings are turned to the lowest settings that can be set for this game ( inorder to make it playable). 

I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game on a few occasions to see if this games works better but i am often met with a warning that the game files are corrupted and it makes me back out of the game.

CONS: This is where I cannot recommend this game. You get laggy Chinese people who don't know how to stay in their own servers. You will see a guy running into a wall or stopped in mid air hanging there for 10 seconds and BAM he's behind you already with a full charged attack and just 1 shots you. These people aren't good, they rely on lag to teleport around the battlefield and destroy you. I have 40ms ping and 1 gig internet. I'm not the problem, all the chinese players are the problem. I will only recommend this game if they do a country ban or a personal ban of someone with over a certain latency. Anyone lagging should not be allowed to play games that require pinpoint accuracy. 

GRAPHICS: Great

GAMEPLAY: Awesome, I feel they punish you for doing focused attacks too much, they already require you to stand still and take hits to the face while charging, but being punished by doing an easy block, you also have your weapon dropped when your attack gets blocked, it really is a poor mechanic. Everything else is fine though. 

STORY: I haven't encountered one besides character backstories which who cares really. 

MUSIC: It's okay, I think it could be better.

With only 180 hrs played, I can say this game is quite hard to master but easy to learn. It's not for everyone. Especially people who don't like a challenge and motion sickness.

Hacker wise, never met them once. Maybe not on my server (SEA). Idk about others who said they had met them before. Guess I'm lucky :D

The Chinese players are friendly and funny (most of them), until they got serious. If they shout and scold, that's when u know the enemy is better. They got the skills to be funny and chill, had better time playing with them than the others. Or maybe I just know how to communicate with them and the haters don't. Idk.......
Tip: Try to comm with them, they're not too bad to talk to.

Maybe people got upset from the constant cc by the enemy's sword play and skills. Well, nothing much to say about it. They're just better. After all, it is [b] NOT [/b] for everyone.

Overall great game, definitely should give it a try. Nothing like the others. Tho better to play at least at constant 60 fps, it will ruin your combo and mess up your timing if they are any spikes. Take it from experience.",1641630406,1641630406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great game, but the major problem (for cosmetics) is that the battle pass costs 1360, yet it only gives you 1280 for completing it.  They should give us the full amount, while releasing their own shop (seperate from bp) or event exclusive skins as a way to create revenue.

I really enjoy playing this game, but I can't recommend it to anyone; in fact I would recommend you never touch this game to begin with. This was finally a battle royale I had fun with, even playing it solo (I usually only play BR games with friends for context). However, due to server issues, pricing issues, cheaters and horrendous staff. No. You will have more fun watching someone on Twitch.

[h1]Pros[/h1][list]
[*] Complex movement and simple controls streamline the game's systems. This game does not play like For Honor, and this is good. You would get cheesed way too much
[*] Movement is also really fun, bolting around or hooking someone (despite the cheese) is a great feeling
[*] Quick spawning, this is nit-picky but I'm so glad there aren't drops
[*] Winning fights and fighting in general is fun in my opinion[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1][list]
[*] Sad pricing, this game has loot boxes that can only be bought, expensive skins and weapon skins, tiny-tiny drop rates on good cosmetics, tier skips and more with the random flash events or seasonal events. Pathetic in Apex, and it's pathetic here too
[*] Terrible support and staff, you will not hear anything good come from dealing with them. The Discord is in a massive disarray with peoples problems being chalked up as castaway notes
[*] Unbalanced characters and weapons, you can easily do a 100 to 0 combo. Some characters are just cheese if you learn their basics
[*] Server instability and general high ping
[*] Region lock is useless as high-ping players can still enter using a VPN
[*] Matches take a long time to find
[*] There is no way to buy previous battle passes, this game is not doing well in the US so it makes no sense for them to have all these great cosmetics that no one will ever have... silly and stupid if they're gonna charge so much for them
[*] Battle Passes do not give enough for the next season and then some. You literally have to level it up 150+ just to get your value out of it.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
So, despite me liking this game I just feel like there is no boundary of respect between customer and seller. I've played enough to no longer find the game fun because the issues that were nagging have just taken over. I just think you would be better off not playing this anymore. I'm sorry, because as someone who pre-ordered and loved the game, even being a community mod at one point. I think I'm moving on

Old review: I have played the battle royale genre to the point of boredom. However, Naraka does something very different. It combines concepts from a bunch of my favourite games (For Honor, Sekiro, Assassins Creed, etc) and makes it work. The combat and parkour feel very fluid and dynamic, with all sorts of combos and out-play potential, without getting too difficult. There is an assortment of game modes to further sharpen your skills. Other than gameplay, you can spend hours customizing the different heroes with many types of skins/accessories to choose from. The bots can be annoying in the beginning, however, they are replaced by players as you level up.

After that I didn't had the chance to actually buy it so I had to necessarily wait for the right occasion, but now that I did it... I wish I didn't spend the money.
Unfortunately right now I can't request a refund anymore because I got past the 2h, but this is because I really wanted to believe that this game was something else, was another BR different and interesting from the usual COD or BF. I mean, gameplay-wise is but the fact that the majority of the playerbase is Asian, doesn't really help with it at all. What I'm mainly complaining about is the fact that:

- First the SSD problem. Like, why would you even ""lock"" the game performances behind this simple yet annoying thing? Not everyone can buy it or some probably are not even interested in buying it. So honestly this is definitely a sh***y move from you devs. Like everytime I boot up the game, I have to wait at least 10/15 minutes for the textures to load. IN THE MAIN MENU. And before some intelligent folks come here blaming my setup, no, it's not that. I play other games which doesn't NECESSARILY requires SSD to work correctly, while this one here instead it's literal hell. The same problem happens also in another game called ""Super People"", but while here after waiting at least 1H you can actually play, there it's totally impossible to play it unless you install it into an SSD.

- Second problem, the fact that the playerbase like mentioned it's almost all asian and they have high pings. But I won't add anymore since I don't think that region locked server will be a thing, mostly because otherwise the game might die here in EU and NA as well since it's played by really few players compared to asians. I mean, technically it's already dead here in EU and NA so that's why you allow CN people to play with everybody.

- Third problem, the fact that is not skill based. It's just ""first come, first serve"" type of game, there's no strategy at all here. The first that starts the fight win, simple as that, also the counterattack it's broken as fuck. Sometimes it works, other times not so much. It's a gamble 99% of the times and I hate gambles.

Long story short, no, I don't recommend this game unless you'are a masochist and want to be beat up from CN players with high pings and a terrible counterattack system. Otherwise feel free to buy it and do like me, play 99% of the games with bots in casual or hard, your choice, and still unlock stuff (battlepass and such) because yes, you don't have to necessarily play ranked or quick matches against other players. You can just play bot and unlock everything. Of course minus the ""team-based missions"", but those are really few and just in events (of course you will earn less than playing ranked or with other players, but it's not like you're going anywhere, right?). And the rest 1% just go, survive for five minutes before a CN player comes and beats your a**.",1640971169,1640971169,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have yet to find a melee fighting game where the combat feels so smooth. If you like samurais, ninjas, sword fighting, martial arts, and parkour, this is the game for you.

The game has a difficult learning curve. It matches you against bots your first couple games, giving you a bit of confidence, only to lose it once you start fighting real players. Practicing combos, counters, dodges, etc against bots in free training will go a long way. Also, a recent addition to the game is bot mode, allowing you to play the survival mode against all bots whenever you want if you find you are getting wrecked by more seasoned players of the game. If survival mode and battle royales aren't your thing, there is a deathmatch mode called Bloodbath where you get to fight and revive endlessly.

The character customization is very detailed allowing some fascinating (and horrifying) creations. I personally enjoy playing as a Super Saiyan Pikachu and get a good laugh every time I log on.

I see lots of complaints about high ping abusers/cheaters and although I am not very high ranked (Plat V) I frankly have rarely encountered this, if ever. While  it may be an issue at the highest ranks, the majority of the player population (new players especially) should not encounter this. 

On top of that, plenty of Americans (my friends included) will name their characters/account in Mandarin even if they speak perfect English. You may feel you're getting wrecked by some Chinese VPN ping abuser when in reality It is some dude across town who has played a few hundred hours more than you. If you need to win every match, this may not be the game for you.

At the end of the day, slashing people with swords and zooming across the map with grappling hooks akin to Attack on Titan is my favorite thing to do right now. Patience is a virtue in this game, and accepting the difficult learning curve and embracing the process of always trying to get better will hopefully allow you the enjoy it as much as my friends and I have.

they are some things that need to be address first not all people are equal not sure of the cheating but i believe its there.

this should go free to play soon its fine for now but if it was FTP we would see more players and the wait time would not be so long.

finally for new players this is for you i suggest bloodbath to test builds and training room to tune your movement cause if i see you in BR or any high rated player for that matter its dead no mercy.

Combat? GREAT
Ninjas? GREAT

A really fun game that relies heavily on player skill and quick thinking. A little bit difficult to learn, but very rewarding when you do.

Great game to play with your friends and the better you get at the game, the more it shows in really big ways.

Couple of beginner tips:
-Luck stat isn't worth it, don't waste your tae investing. Go for Grapple distance instead.
-Go into free training and test out the default weapon combos
-Don't commit to ranged weapons
-Embrace countering
-Stun locking is very common, some ults and abilities can prevent it until you learn how to avoid it entirely",1640914966,1640914966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
