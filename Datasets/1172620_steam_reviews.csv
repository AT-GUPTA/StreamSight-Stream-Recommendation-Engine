Pros:
+ fun gameplay, chill with friends
+ lots of different PvE content
+ PvP can be fun

Cons:
- absolutely horrendous, non-existent ACCESSIBILITY options: no adjustable FoV over 90, no turning off head bobbing or motion blur. 
There's tons of posts all over the internet of people getting motion sick from SoT. Games with First Person perspective should do better nowadays!!
- mandatory PvP opens you up to griefers
- oh, the whole ""mandatory pvp""-part? yeah, not only can't you avoid pvp, the game is also almost always a mess of game breaking bugs, so better pray, that if you get attacked and anchored, you won't get the bug, where your anchor suddenly can't be interacted with any more. 
IF YOU WANT US TO GIT GUD AND SHIT, maybe you start with an even playing field? but that's just the LOGICAL suggestion, i don't think anyone at rare is particularly fond of logic. 
- Tutorial is relatively useless
- if you give a damn about your Avg. Game Completion Rate, this game is a nightmare. 217 mostly grindy achievements at the time of this review. For reference, I'm about 100 hours into the game and have an Achievement Completion of 30%.",1687260360,1708846924,False,3,0,0.549745082855224609,0,True,False,False

Honestly trying to create a character in this game that you like is more painful than grabbing your potato peeler from your kitchen and proceeding to skin yourself alive. In fact skinning yourself alive would probably be faster.

This games customisation is infuriating to say the least.

Now to say that I've only played the tutorial twice (yes, that's right, you can't skip it after deleting your char and then making a new one) it forces you to play it all over again.

Either way, from what I've saw of the tutorial so far, the game shows some promise, I'm hoping once I've finally settled on a character that I'm happy with, I'll then finally get to try the proper game and leave a more productive review.

However because the character creation is so bad, and I'm going to have to do the tutorial for a 3rd time in a row, I'm going to give this game a thumbs down for the time being.

Update..

Now that I've managed to play the game a little more, I will say this, despite it not having a very good customisation system, the game it's self can be a lot of fun. I personally wouldn't recommend playing this game solo, that's not to say it can't be done, in fact my partner clearly enjoys playing this game, solo or with her friends.

I personally found that this game is best only played with friends, when I played this game with my partner and her good friend Dani, I'm not going to lie I really enjoyed myself. This is something I honestly didn't think would have be the case, as normally I find playing in a groups with multiple people, it can somehow leave you feeling a little socially burnt out, well at least for myself it tends to do this.

However there was just something different about this game, somehow the team work just felt really fun, my partner would helm the ship whilst me and her good friend would man the cannons.

When the ship started to take damage I would then drop below deck and bail the water with the tidy wee bucket that the game supplies you with. There was just something oddly fun about getting water into a bucket and running up the stairs with it and pouring it over the side of the boat. I don't know maybe I'm just a little odd.

Then there is the repairing aspect of the ship, there is just something oddly satisfying about putting planks of wood over big gaping holes and watching the water slowly trickle to a stop.

So between the firing of the cannons, the bailing of the water, and the running back and forth like a headless chicken whist trying to repair the ship and hoping for it to not sink, the game feels strangely entertaining, and a lot of fun.

There is also fishing in this game, which is actually done really well, its basically a mini fishing game built into a pirate, ship welding, sea exploring, treasure hunting, adventure, pvp, ship destroying, gun firing, sword swinging, hand jerking, tit shaking (oh wait, them last two parts might be from a different type of game) My bad, but you get the idea.

Well anyway, I think the game as a whole is a lot of fun, however I have noticed sometimes there are cheaters on the server when I've been watching my partner play, luckily I haven't had to experience that for myself just yet.

Hopefully this is something the developers are working on and will fix in time.

Oh and I forgot to mention the fireworks in this game are actually really well done. (they are very realistic) for a cartoon style game.

So, with that all said, would I recommend getting this game? I would say Yes if you plan to play it  with friends, and No if you are planning to just play it on your own.

I think until they add an anti cheat and maybe change the customisation options of creating your character then I'm going to leave this still as thumbs down.

This game is by no means bad, quite the opposite really. It just needs a few improvements and it could be a masterpiece.

EDIT / update... So the more you play this game, the more you start to love it, so for that reason, I will now give this game a thumbs up.",1705987706,1708843330,True,0,0,0.476457118988037109,0,True,False,False

I want every person who said that it's ""an ocean wide and an inch deep"" to stick a tankard of Grog where the sun don't shine. Its lack of a main story slightly alarmed me at first, but the many charming tall tales make up for it tenfold. There is so much to do in this game, so much for leveling, and yet, it never becomes unfair. There is no level where you get a better cutlass, ship, or gun. You can even earn the game's purchase-based currency. Just when you think you've run out of things to do on the Sea of Thieves, there is more. Playing with friends makes for a top-tier comedic pirating experience,  with mechanics like locking people in the Brig, damaging teammates with Blunderbombs, playing music, and eating leeches. Playing solo is just as fun, leveling up the many trading companies' reputations to unlock more missions. The fact that there are negative reviews for this game astounds me. My only regret is not buying it sooner.

Instructions
Please use my step-by-step photos below this written out recipe as a guide to making the pizza. For best results and ease of mind, read through the recipe completely before beginning. You will need two deep dish 9×2-inch round cake pans if you are making both pizzas at the same time. You can also use 9-inch springform pans.
For the crust: Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. If you do not have a stand mixer, use your hand mixer and a very very large bowl. If you do not have any mixer, you will do this all by hand. Again, use a very large bowl. Give those ingredients a quick toss with your mixer on low or with a large wooden spoon. Add the warm water and 1/4 cup of melted butter. The warm water should be around 90°F (32°C). Make sure it is not very, very hot or it will kill the yeast. Likewise, make sure the butter isn’t boiling hot. If you melt it in the microwave, let it sit for 5 minutes before adding. On low speed, beat (or stir) the dough ingredients until everything begins to be moistened. Continuing on low speed (or remove from the bowl and knead by hand if you do not own a mixer), beat the dough until it is soft and supple and gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl and falls off of the dough hook- about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is too hard (it will be textured from the cornmeal), but if it feels too tough, beat in 1 teaspoon of warm water. Alternatively, if it feels too soft, beat in 1 Tablespoon of flour.
Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a ball. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning it around so that all sides of the dough are coated in the oil. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rise in a warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size.
Once the dough is ready, lightly flour a large work surface. Remove dough from the bowl, set the bowl and aluminum foil aside (to use later). Gently punch down the dough to remove any air bubbles and roll the dough into a large 15×12-inch rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup of softened butter on top of the dough. Roll it up lengthwise per the photos below. Cut the dough log in half. Form the two pieces of dough into balls and place back into your greased bowl. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rise in the refrigerator (not in a warm place) for 1 hour until they are puffy as you make the sauce.
For the sauce: Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and allow it to melt. Once melted, add the grated onion, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Once the onion has slightly browned after about 5 minutes, add the garlic, tomatoes, and sugar. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow it to simmer until it’s hearty, fragrant, and thick- about 30 minutes. You’ll have about 2 and 1/2 cups of sauce at this point. If you have more than that, keep simmering until the amount has reduced. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to be used. You may store the sauce in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days if planning to make the pizza another day. You may freeze this sauce for up to 2 months as well.
Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).
Assemble the pizzas: After the dough balls have risen in the refrigerator, they should be puffy. Keep one ball of dough in the refrigerator as you work with the first one. Roll it out on a lightly floured work surface, working it into a 12-inch circle. Using your rolling pin as a guide (see photos below), place over a 9×2-inch deep dish cake pan. Using your fingers, press the dough into the cake pan. Make sure it is nice and tight fitting inside the pan. Trim any excess dough off the edges with a small knife. Repeat with 2nd dough. Brush the top edges of the dough with a little olive oil, which gives the crust a beautiful sheen. Fill each pizza with 1/2 of the cheese (about 2 cups/8 oz per pizza), then the pepperoni and bacon or your desired toppings. Pour about 1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) of sauce evenly on top of each. If you do not like that much sauce, you can reduce to 3/4 cup (180ml) per pizza and have leftover sauce. Sprinkle each with 1/4 cup (22g) of grated parmesan cheese.
Place the cake pans on top of a large baking sheet, which will catch anything potentially spilling over the sides of the pans. (Nothing usually does.) Bake for 20-28 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Feel free to loosely cover the pizzas with aluminum foil after the 15 minute mark to prevent any heavy browning and uneven baking. Remove the pizzas from the oven and allow to cool in the pans placed on a wire rack for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, slice, serve, and enjoy. Place any leftover pizza in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days.  Reheat leftovers in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 15-20 minutes or until hot.
Notes
Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Dough may be prepared through step 4. In the last part of this step, the dough needs to rise in the refrigerator for 1 hour. You may leave it in the refrigerator for up to 1 full day, making sure to punch it down to remove any air bubbles before rolling out as directed in step 7. You may freeze the pizza doughs after preparing them through step 4, and instead of allowing to rise in the refrigerator, simply freeze for up to 2 months. Then, allow the doughs to thaw overnight in the refrigerator and allow to rise at room temperature for 1 hour before continuing with step 7. Make-ahead and freezing instructions for the sauce are written in step 5.
Special Tools (affiliate links): 9×2-inch Round Cake Pans or 9-inch Springform Pans | Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Glass Mixing Bowl | Wooden Spoon | Rolling Pin | Saucepan | Box Grater
Yeast: Platinum Yeast from Red Star is an instant yeast. You can use any quick rise or instant yeast in this recipe. You can also use active dry yeast in this recipe with zero changes. The rise time may be slightly longer if using active dry yeast.
Onion & Tomatoes: Please see notes below the recipe in the step-by-step photos for details about the grated onion and the can of crushed tomatoes.
Cheese: You can use sliced mozzarella or shredded mozzarella cheese.
Toppings: Feel free to swap the pepperoni and bacon with cooked and crumbled sausage, thinly sliced green peppers and/or onions, sliced mushrooms, etc. Add enough toppings to suit your tastes.

Step foot onto the weathered planks of your ship, where the salty tang of the sea mingles with the intoxicating scent of adventure, and embark upon a voyage that transcends mere mortal imagination, beckoning daring souls to chart their own course amidst the shifting tides of fate.

In this vast and intricate world, every ripple upon the water tells a story, each gust of wind carries whispers of distant lands waiting to be explored, and the horizon stretches out before you like a blank page upon which the epic saga of your adventures will be written. From the sun-drenched shores of tropical paradises, where palm-fringed beaches beckon with promises of buried treasure and sunken wrecks hide secrets of untold riches, to the mist-shrouded isles haunted by the echoes of ancient legends, where the spirits of long-lost pirates roam and the very air crackles with arcane energy, the Sea of Thieves is a realm steeped in mystery and intrigue, where secrets lie buried beneath the sands of time, waiting to be unearthed by those bold enough to seek them out.

But beware, for the waters are not without their perils, and danger lurks in the shadows, unseen and unfathomable. Sail beneath the towering silhouette of a kraken, its tentacles thrashing in a primal dance, or lock swords with the skeletal crew of a cursed vessel, bound to the ocean's depths by a vengeful curse that knows no mercy. Yet, with each challenge overcome, with every obstacle surmounted, the bonds of camaraderie between you and your crewmates grow stronger, forged in the crucible of adversity and tempered by the fires of shared triumphs and trials.

And it is not only the thrill of battle that calls out to intrepid sailors, but the promise of discovery and adventure that lies beyond the horizon. Traverse labyrinthine caves and forgotten ruins, solve ancient riddles and decipher cryptic maps, as you uncover the lost relics of a bygone era and unlock the secrets of the fabled Pirate's Code, written in blood and bound in legend. But amidst the clamor of cannons and the clash of cutlasses, there are moments of tranquility and reflection, as you and your crewmates gather around a crackling campfire beneath a star-strewn sky, swapping tales of daring escapades and shared victories, and forging memories that will endure for eternity.

So hoist the sails, unfurl the flags, and set forth upon the open sea, for the world of Sea of Thieves awaits, a realm of boundless wonder and limitless possibility where the next great adventure lies just beyond the horizon. And as you chart your course amidst the ebb and flow of fortune, may the winds of fate carry you ever onward, to new lands and untold treasures, and may the spirit of adventure guide you on your journey, now and forevermore, for in the world of Sea of Thieves, the only limit is your imagination, and the next great adventure is always just over the horizon, beckoning you with its siren song of promise and peril, glory and greed. So my overall thoughts of this game is that its ok i guess 👍",1708754325,1708754325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They do all this shit, and the PS5 is still outselling the Xbox Series X/S by over a 2:1 margin. Plus the game has bloated to a massive 100GB+ install size. Xbox fans, I am so sorry you are all treated as third-class citizens. My original review can be found below.

As a pre-alpha player, with thousands of hours logged across the Xbox One, Windows 10, and now Steam versions of this game, the PotC update was the final kick in the teeth for old school fans like myself. Rare would rather cater to Disney fans than fix hit registration or rewarding pirate legends with more than just a few fireworks or cosmetics we will never use.

All I need is the Midnight Blunderbuss and I can officially put this game down forever. Unless they add more slots to customize and more Black Dog, Ebon, Onyx, Obsidian, and Midnight items to match. In that case, I'll have to crawl back to complete the collection once again.

The dev's flat out LIE. They say ""we made a sandbox, so you can play however you want."" However you CANNOT just play the PVE experience without massive penalties and a sub-par game experience. They absolutely DO NOT let people play however they want. They try to force everyone into playing the toxic grief farm that they conceived, thinking it's a good game model. 

They just announced this will be releasing for PS5.... most likely because they cannot keep a player base due to their trash game mechanics, of this whole game being based on griefing other players.
Nothing says crap mechanics like grinding for 2-4 hours, just to have a group of assclowns, that outnumber you by 3-4 swoop in and take your shit. 

Aside from the graphics, physics (ship, waves, etc) this game is garbage. They took a great foundation, and made the worst possible game loop they could on top of that foundation. This game could have been special. Instead it's the place to go if you want to see what the worst of humanity has to offer.

1st, you are LOCKED into 1ST PERSON ONLY!!!  I much prefer 3rd person games.  I want to actually be able to see my character.  1st person works fine for shooters, like DOOM or Halo, where you're playing a specific named character who is fully covered in a generic suit of body armour, BUT in a game that ostensibly allows you to have a ""custom character,"" it really sucks not being able to see that character (especially if you end up spending a bunch of money on cosmetics).  I will NEVER spend real money on cosmetics in this game, I can promise you that.  Why have cosmetics at all if you can't even see them?  I don't care what other players think of my character's looks.  

2nd, the ""character creation"" screen is really irritating.  This RANDOM ROLL is silly.  It takes forever to find a character that you find cool or interesting, and you can't make any personal changes to the randomly rolled model.  Not a fan of this system.  

This game, like all fantasy games, should have both 1st and 3rd person modes, that you can switch between on the fly, and a decent character creation screen.  Skyrim is a perfect example of this.  Same with Fallout 4.  Heck, even other MMO style games, like the much older SWTOR, or even ESO, allow it.  Otherwise, the game comes across as nothing more than a pirate-themed shooter, and that's not what it was advertised as.

Now that I've had a chance to play the game with some friends, I will say that the game is a lot of fun, IF you have a group of friends to play with.  Solo, the game is not much fun.  If my friends didn't play this game, I would never play it again.  The artwork is bright, colourful, and cartoonish, and can be downright beautiful, especially the weather and wave effects!

I stand by what I've already said.  Let me also add another few annoyances.  Being ganked by campers, who the game allows to literally disguise themselves as barrels, is ridiculous.  What kind of jabroni gets his kicks by hiding on someone's ship for sometimes HOURS?  Nothing better to do, huh?  And a lot of these folks are the type who will call you ""gay"" or other lame ""insults"" when they've killed you via cowardly sneakery; only thing missing is the juvenile ""tea-bagging.""  

So, as you can tell, I don't enjoy PvP games.  It's partly because (admittedly) I really suck at PvP, BUT its also because I don't like a-holes and PvP games almost always attract that sort... the most juvenile and childish of gamers (and I'm not talking about literal children). 
 
They added the ""safer seas"" option to the game, so that folks can PvE in peace... but they've made that a hassle, too, by not allowing you to use your own purchased ships in PvE, as well as making handing in treasure much more of a hassle in PvE.  Why?  Just let people have fun with this cartoonish game, whether they prefer PvP OR PvE!

Finally, the item wheel is one of the strangest and least intuitive that I've ever been forced to use in a game.  Seriously, designers... what were you thinking?!  Have you ever played a video game before?",1618102119,1708645412,False,3,1,0.312434226274490356,0,True,False,False

Example: Being chased by reapers (players who hunt other players) with friends. We sail past a group of other players who aren't on their boat at an outpost. Me and one other friend canon out and commandeer their ship, proceed to fight against the reapers and LOSE. But in doing so, our ship piloted by other friends gets out safely. 
If you're the owner of the brig wondering what happened to your ship, there it is. Sorry not sorry.

Edit: This WAS a positive review. But this is just frustrating. Either this is a PvE game, in which we need ""safe servers"" which is ridiculous for a pirate game. Or this is a PvP Game in which Rare NEEDS to fix both hit registration and cheaters. Tired of having a firing squad for a single person and they do not die.

also the new update has turned the game into a buggy mess ive tried all the fix instructions they have sent me it still crashes all the time and some times wont even open!
aside from all that the game play is perfect, they just need to fix loading screens at the start especially when you leave a game (don't send me all the way back to the main menu).

Since its launch, Sea of Thieves has undergone significant updates and expansions, continuously evolving to offer new content and experiences to its dedicated player base. In this extensive review, we'll delve deep into the world of Sea of Thieves, exploring its gameplay mechanics, immersive world, community-driven elements, and overall experience.

Gameplay:
At the heart of Sea of Thieves lies its unique and immersive gameplay mechanics, which seamlessly blend exploration, naval combat, and cooperative multiplayer elements. Players begin their journey as aspiring pirates, starting with a humble ship and a map full of unexplored islands and treacherous waters. The core gameplay loop involves sailing the open seas, searching for buried treasure, battling fearsome creatures, and engaging in encounters with other players or AI-controlled ships.

What sets Sea of Thieves apart is its emphasis on player-driven experiences and emergent gameplay. Every voyage feels like a new adventure, with no two sessions playing out the same. The dynamic weather system, unpredictable encounters with other players, and the ever-present threat of the kraken or megalodon ensure that players are constantly kept on their toes.

The cooperative multiplayer aspect of Sea of Thieves is where the game truly shines. Crews of players must work together to navigate their ship, manage sails and cannons, and communicate effectively to overcome challenges. Whether engaging in intense ship-to-ship combat, solving riddles to uncover buried treasure, or simply enjoying the camaraderie of sailing with friends, Sea of Thieves fosters memorable moments and shared experiences like few other games.

Graphics and Sound:
Visually, Sea of Thieves boasts a stunning and vibrant art style that perfectly captures the spirit of a whimsical pirate adventure. From the shimmering turquoise waters and lush tropical islands to the detailed ship designs and dynamic lighting effects, every aspect of the game's visuals contributes to its immersive world.

The sound design further enhances the atmosphere, with the creaking of wooden ships, the roar of cannon fire, and the haunting melodies of the sea shanties creating an auditory experience that pulls players deeper into the game's world.

World and Exploration:
One of the greatest strengths of Sea of Thieves is its expansive and beautifully crafted world, comprised of a vast ocean dotted with islands of varying sizes and biomes. Each island offers its own unique challenges and rewards, from hidden caves filled with treasure to ancient ruins teeming with danger.

Exploration is a core element of the Sea of Thieves experience, with players encouraged to venture off the beaten path in search of adventure. The game's world is filled with secrets to discover, including hidden underwater caves, sunken shipwrecks, and elusive mythical creatures.

Community and Social Interaction:
Sea of Thieves places a strong emphasis on community and social interaction, with multiplayer being a central focus of the gameplay experience. Whether teaming up with friends or joining a crew of strangers, players must work together to navigate the treacherous waters and overcome the myriad challenges that await them.

The game's community-driven events and activities further foster a sense of camaraderie among players, with regular updates and content drops keeping the experience fresh and engaging over time. From large-scale server-wide events to smaller-scale player-run gatherings, Sea of Thieves offers a variety of ways for players to connect and interact with one another.

Progression and Customization:
While Sea of Thieves prioritizes player skill and cooperation over traditional progression systems, the game does offer a variety of ways for players to customize their pirate and ship. Players can unlock new cosmetics, such as clothing, weapons, and ship decorations, through in-game achievements and events, allowing them to personalize their characters and vessels to reflect their individual style.

Additionally, the game's reputation system tracks players' progress across various factions, rewarding them with unique rewards and titles as they complete missions and objectives. This system provides a sense of long-term progression and achievement, incentivizing players to continue exploring the game's world and engaging with its content.

Overall Experience:

With its regular updates and expansions, the game continues to evolve and grow, ensuring that there's always something new to discover on the horizon.

The worst part is that the community is so toxic that merely suggesting that accessibility options that most games contain by now should be a standard will get you banned in discussions and forums for ""promoting cheating"". I do not want to cheat, I simply want to play the game comfortably without making myself sick. 

This review will remain negative until the patch that blocks client-side edits is removed, or the developers finally increase the in-game FoV slider to reach at least the advertised 90 degrees for real.

EDIT - 2 years later and this still remains true, even though PVP is no longer enforced, destroying that argument. Now the only reason not to include higher FOV is laziness on part of the developer and a distinct lack of care for accessibility or inclusivity.

NOTE: Sea of Thieves new update where solo players can embark on their own and sail the seas to waste your time for no reason at all! Some quests are available but and progression will be forced pvp (not Optional). If you really would like to progress and gain rewards join the cutting edge pvp mode but there is a warning! for if your solo they will stomp you into the group because they are on discord working as an actual team to ass hand you and your ship! Fun for the whole family as you sink to the depths of Davey Jones locker and lose all your loot!

NOTE FOR DEVS: You want more players? make a full non pvp mode for solo players, PvP mode for PvPers and teams with the respected PvP line of rewards only for this mode.

It looks gorgeous, it has tons of little quirks and features that you won't pick up on initially that require time spent to figure out, and it has a ton of content to explore.

EDIT: Looks like the devs finally caved and added a ""safer seas"" mode, albeit they capped the rewards on it pretty hard. While the effort to appeal to a wider player base is appreciated, I feel like it is too little too late. I briefly tried it but honestly I've kind of lost interest in Seas at this point as has pretty much everyone else I game with. 

***Original criticisms***:

That being said, this game has a real problem with PvP in the sense that there are a group of people out there just trying to grind out gold/reputation/complete adventures and then there are a group of people that just want to fuck with other players and IMO, the 2 shouldn't be forced to mix and the fact that this game does not have a PVE only mode is a real shame and makes it very difficult to introduce the game to new players. It's at the point where there are enough players out there who have 500hrs+ in this game that are playing on a totally different level than new players that they may as well be playing a totally different game because you don't stand a chance against them. And if you're a new player or someone trying to bring a new player into the game, it's really hard to convince them they should play this game when you lose a ship full of hard work to some sweat lord in 5 min. Hell, it makes just playing as a solo sloop obnoxious if all you're trying to do is grind out some rep. I've also encountered some incredibly toxic players in this game, it's probably been one of the worst communities I've experienced taking 2nd only to MOBA players. 

I don't know if the game intentionally lacks matchmaking or if there just aren't enough players to balance a server but the number of times new players get rolled in with people who have been playing for way too long just feels broken.  Whatever the case is, I can't really recommend this game to anyone unless all you're looking for is another straight up PVP game until Rare ever decides to add some PVE only mode. 

And the thing is, this would be *super* easy to do, add a checkbox at the lobby, up the spawn rate of ghost ships to force more ship encounters, make the rep/gold rewards lower to encourage people to play PVP if they want max rewards, etc. I'm sure at this point, it's a matter of choice, not technical challenge. Either that, or don't throw people who have been playing this game for 2 hrs in the same server as people who have been playing this game for 2000 hrs because it just isn't fun, and if you're first experience with a game is ""wow, that was a fucking waste of time"", then what's the point?",1663877500,1708445819,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

That being said: Safer Seas feels, in a word, fantastic. I wouldn't mind AI reaper ships that actively hunt you even to give a little bit of that 'watch your back' sense that the High Seas has. 
As for complaints, Rareware has a beast of a game hindered by itself. It is ruthless, with having less players being an absolute disadvantage with really no recourse and a extremely toxic player base. Not to say that isn't necessarily in the spirit of the game, but it is a game all the same.
And being a game, while it gimps your progress significantly I think safer seas is a great direction that provides an out for Rare from being stuck between a rock and a hard place. That being a live service game that needs more players and a player base that actively chases away would-be players. 
I do think the largest thing handicapping Safer Seas is the Live Service. Not it directly, but if you bust cash to look great in PvP, Safer Seas does take away from that. Aside from that, an offline mode cannot be provided as that would be a great in for hacking and currency duping. (I am sure there are also technical issues and back end problems as well).

In a gaming landscape filled with hyper-realistic graphics and complex mechanics, sometimes it's refreshing to set sail on a different kind of adventure. Rare's ""Sea of Thieves"" offers players just that—an immersive world of pirates, treasure, and boundless exploration. As someone who has spent countless hours navigating its vast oceans, I can attest to the sheer joy and excitement that this game brings.

One of the most captivating aspects of ""Sea of Thieves"" is its emphasis on player-driven experiences. Unlike traditional single-player games with linear storylines, ""Sea of Thieves"" encourages collaboration and creativity among crews of players. Whether you're embarking on a daring treasure hunt, engaging in epic naval battles, or simply enjoying the serenity of sailing under a starlit sky, every moment in the game feels uniquely yours.

One of my fondest memories in ""Sea of Thieves"" was the time my crew and I stumbled upon a sunken shipwreck laden with treasure. As we eagerly plundered its depths, we suddenly found ourselves under attack by a rival crew. What ensued was a thrilling battle for survival, complete with sword fights, cannon volleys, and daring escapes. In the end, our perseverance paid off, and we emerged victorious, our pockets overflowing with loot and our hearts pounding with adrenaline.

But beyond its exhilarating gameplay, ""Sea of Thieves"" also offers moments of quiet reflection and camaraderie. Whether you're sharing stories with fellow pirates around a campfire, playing a shanty on the deck of your ship, or simply watching the sunset from the crow's nest, the game fosters a sense of community and friendship that is truly special.

Of course, ""Sea of Thieves"" is not without its challenges and frustrations. From treacherous storms to relentless skeleton hordes, the game throws plenty of obstacles in your path. But it's the overcoming of these obstacles, together with your crewmates, that makes the experience so rewarding.

In the end, ""Sea of Thieves"" is more than just a game—it's a voyage of discovery, a testament to the power of imagination, and a celebration of the joy of play. So if you ever find yourself yearning for adventure on the high seas, I highly recommend hoisting the anchor, raising the sails, and setting course for the shimmering waters of ""Sea of Thieves.""

Its definitely a fun game that is worth a try. Honestly there really isn't any other game like it. The Sea Of Thieves community is for the most part a friendly community. Yes there is toxicity but I would put roughly 1/4 of the community into that category. Getting started can be rough as a new player, specifically trying to learn the dynamics of the game; as well as learning what to do and not to do so your ship does not sink. 

The game is basically a large sandbox, you have a map with islands and outposts darted around the map that you can explore; with something called ""world events"" that pop up randomly on the servers that you can go complete. World events are a good and fun way to get treasure to sell; which is ultimately the main goal of free roaming in the game. Selling treasure is the main way to make gold in the game, which will give you the ability to buy cosmetics and ships. There is no pay to win in the game, its only cosmetics which I can appreciate from a competitive standpoint. World events are PVE events but can quickly be contested by other pirates roaming the sea and then it can quickly turn into a PVP/PVE event, which is probably one of my favorite parts of the game. The PVP can be really fun and exciting, and is what I usually have the most fun doing now that I have completed all of the things there is to do in the game. 

However; if PVP is not your thing, you can stay doing PVE related things such as Tall Tales ((Quests)), aswell as staying on the PVE servers. You could literally just roam the seas and trying to catch all of the fish in the game and complete achievements/commendations. 

There is a skill gap in the game which is unfortunate. For the most part while in adventure mode you will run into pirates who are either really new at the game or extremely good at the game. Its seems rare for me to run into a pirate that is a perfectly good match in a fight. 

The community is fun because its diverse; I have ran into every type of person imaginable in the sea of thieves and think that's a cool aspect of open crew / looking for group posts. Its a game that both adults and kids can enjoy.

Game seems to be designed for consoles as the control scheme is really bad. Game won't let you map keys like ""TAB"". Navigating menus is clunky and awkward. Steam integration is awkward and finding a match or joining a game is unintuitive. Microtransactions really do make it feel like a free to play game. Voice acting on most guild representatives seems amateurish or just non-existent. There is not really any depth to guild quests. You can't be a peaceful merchant or a mercenary - just go-to-an-island-and-bring-back-the-chest sort of quests. For a game about seas, I wish it wasn't as shallow.

This game is basically a first person pirate simulator MMO with an astounding amount of content.  So much content that this game requires 100+ gigabytes to play.  It is amazing how the 2018 launch day game has evolved into one of the most content filled game to ever exist, with updates that completely change the game and a really interesting story.  Right now its way easier to become pirate legend in 2024 than it has ever been before.  You can do pretty much anything you want, because you are a free pirate.  There are issues with the game though.  And that is the funny RNG mechanic most SOT players call ""Getting Rare'd.""  You could be going back to a port to get some loot and then whoops! Gregg Mayles slipped his fingers.  Here comes a Meg.  Oh, that's not good enough?  How about a kraken and a skelly ship?  I feel that these RNG moments should be toned down a bit.  But there is one glaring issue with one of the new updates.  And that is ""Safer Seas.""  This infernal update allows you to basically turn SOT into a coop game.  Sounds good right? Oh wait, you get less loot and rep, and I don't like that.  So I want to play normal SOT on the high seas.  But EVERYBODY on the high seas thinks that ""Oh, since theres a safer seas mode, we can kill anybody because they were 'asking for it' by being on this mode.""  High seas have become a battlefield with the illusion of a normal gamemode.  Safer seas kind of ruined default SOT and now I can't enjoy a normal game with ships on my ass who don't even run reapers flag going after my ship.  If the devs read this, please do something about making high seas a bit safer for people who want to play SOT normally.",1660525935,1708367392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's almost not worth playing, even with safer seas, as the game removes captained ships which means you can't sell to Sovereigns at the port, you have to run each piece of loot half a mile to sell it which makes this game tedious beyond imagination.

[h3]Why would you play SoT?[/h3]
The immersion is striking in my opinion.  
[i]You are the pirate.[/i] You set sails, control the steering wheel, aim the cannons, repair the ship. No crosshair aiding you in aim, no pop-up UI telling you you're ship is sinking, no NPCs aboard your ship doing things. Nothing happens by itself on your ship, everything must be done by players. The immersion is just great. That's why, from time to time you boot the game up again and slowly start realizing again

[h3]why you shouldn't play SoT.[/h3] 
• Servers have all crew sizes. They try to balance it, It's just one 4 people crew per server for example but, especially considering the following, more people is just better and thus being alone or with just a friend is simply unfun.
• When you sink an enemy they respawn. On the same server. Even on a nearby island. I think it speaks for itself why this is a fundamental flaw. The ship you sank in combat that maybe took over an hour and drained many of your ressources (cannonballs, planks, food) spawns on a nearby island, not rarely within sight on the horizon and it respawns with new supplies. They are at the battlefield again before you even had time to hook up all their loot and if you left the battle victorious but without cannonballs, to bad, now you have to flee. And this has no limit. You can sink the enemy a hundred times but as long as they are willing to chase you there's nothing you can do about it except sailing away and winning again, further draining your ressources.
• Most of the quests (I'd argue all that are actually worth it) rely on you leaving your ship for an extended amount of time for extremely repetetive tasks that are deliberately made so you spend as much time on an island as possible. For example riddles with successively unveiling tasks are ""1) at the north coast... 2) at the wreck on the south coast... 3) at the bonfire on the northern hill..."" You just spend time running back and forth leaving your ship and the horizon unmonitored. Bigger cre? no worries, you just can leave one behind on the lookout setting sails in an emergency, the crew can just teleport back to the ship. Alone or just a crew of 2? Pray no one sees your ship.
• The cosmetics are insanely expensive. This game is about customizing your ship, you can't buy anything that would give you an advantage in combat which by itself is awesome. Also there are [i] lots of [/i] different cosmetics which is also great. In my 160h I got about 10 million coins and I'd say that's pretty average. I didn't sail for the riskiest missions every time but also didn't do low risk low rewards missions either. Yet there are many cosmetics I still can't afford which just lowers the fun you get out of the game. Instead of having a realistic chance to collect all the cosmetics there are in lets say 1000h you have to grind sooo long for just a single set that endorphine spikes are rare.
• The story is, and I am serious, the worst story of any game I have ever played. People arguing ""it's about the journey and the adventures on the way"" just have no idea what good gameplay is. You can make a story about the journey and the adventures throughout it while still making it rewarding. The way it is is just a massive waste of time. Don't play the ""Tall Tales"". Or at least research beforehand what you get into. I was massively disappointed.",1708358469,1708358469,False,3,0,0.505494534969329834,0,True,False,False

--A few caveats to anyone buying--
play it with your friends, it sucks solo.
there are cheaters
there are a lot toxic people
the game can be frustrating
some of the mechanics (like collecting loot) are clunky
You will be bullied by older players, be ready to invest time to git gud

--why buy?--
There is nothing like this out there
Treasure, everyone loves treasure especially other peoples treasure
Combat is simple but nuanced and will take a long time to master
sometimes you find really nice people who make the game special
the game feels very rewarding to play

However, out of the many times I have set sail, the trolls have been few and far between (especially nowadays) and most of my time has been spent having an absolute blast.

I'll start with the positives, and the reasons I kept trying to give the game a chance. The environments were charming. I enjoyed the fact I could care for my own ship, and the ability to jump off into the water where I wanted was great. The character movement was smooth and I liked the dynamic elements to sailing, such a weather and other obstacles. That is, however where the love stops.

I will expand on the gripes I had with this game that were enough that I ultimately quit after roughly 3 hours. Something I didn't anticipate doing as I really wanted to love this game.

First, I can appreciate unique art design in a game. As an illustrator myself, I love quirky characters in games like the Wind Waker. However, some of the SoT player character templates look like something out of a creepy pasta lore. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the design is bad, but it became a slight when it came to character creation.

Or should I say, lack of. 

I get the whole idea of the endless pirate generators, but here's the problem with it--it's almost impossible to get a look that is anything even remotely specific. I spent probably about 400 rolls on this thing to try and get SOMETHING that was half recognizable as a decent looking character. I'm not talking good-looking, I'm talking skyrim default character. The amount of bad results were astounding, because of one fatal flaw--zero filters. Can't even start with gender preference. Simply having a gender option would decrease the time by half (or more) for the player in selecting something they are satisfied with. And I got to thinking...what if I wanted a female, who had a medium build, with one of the shoulder length hairstyles, and black hair. Yeah, sorry kid, but here's a Gollum. 

It added insult to injury that more niche options were thrown into the mix for randomization at the same rate as the other options. For example, the old woman features. I am sure there are a small handful of people who like playing elderly looking characters, but most probably don't. And having elderly looking faces make up half the randomization alone just made it feel like an impossible probability. I either had to have grandmother face, or look like Shrek with the hair color I wanted.

And I may have not even remarked at this if it was a free game. But it's not. And initially, while put off by the fact a paid game wouldn't include some basic character customization, I shrugged it off and continued.

But it got worse.

After exploring briefly, I ran into the Pirate Emporium NPC--my first real content for the game. Well, turned out to be the cash shop, so I thought, might as well browse while I'm here. And then I saw it--a change appearance item. And just like that my gripe was solved. 

The item was $2.09. A strange amount. But it became clear once I was given an option to purchase coins. Their lowest package of premium coins is $1.99, just short of the needed $2.09, which forces the player to purchase the next tier up, with is $5.99.

This is a predatory practice, and I was really disappointed, because I grew up with games by Rare, some of my favorites that I had beaten dozens of times.  

But the nail in the coffin--was when I actually tried to use the appearance change item. Nothing could have prepared me for this. The character change cash shop item--only brings you back to random pirate generator. That's right. You do not actually modify the appearance of your current character. In fact, if you spent forever TRYING to get at least a few features you wanted for your character with merry-go-round of ugly, you will in fact lose ALL features you liked and have to start right back at the bottom.  

This was the last straw for me. I just wasn't interested anymore. You see, when I invest in a game long term, I have no problem with dishing out hundreds over the course of my time playing. But when a studio uses rancid marketing practices without a modicum of respect for the players, I can't support it.",1708317651,1708317651,False,6,1,0.519816398620605469,0,True,False,False

if you are a PvE person who doesnt like pvp in games then turn away, Rare has done NOTHING to cater for PvE players and because of that the only players in this game left are hyper competitive, PvP griefer godsweats and that is just not fun, playing the game and having any and all sense of progress ruined because of another player.

A single voyage that would only take 20 mins could suddenly take HOURS because someone wants to mess with you. its not fun, its boring, frustrating and a real turn off for many people myself included, The ""Safer seas"" mode is an insult that caps you and forces you to engage with the toxic playerbase rife with griefers. you can have fun with Sea of thieves but if you are a PvE player that wants to engage in the PvE content then you will not have fun when your enjoyment is dictated by other players.

Rare has already put in so many features for PvP players including a whole second mode to the game and for PvE players we get what? new content? Too bad i wont get to play it because its gatekept behind a crew of sweats for eternity.

I played a little when this game was about 30 Gb, now the store says it's 50 Gb. It's actually [b]103.3 Gb[/b], more than [b]300% its original size[/b] when I bought it, with mostly cosmetics and some game modes/ history added. Mostly cosmetics. No major changes in gameplay, no radical new mechanics introduced: graphical updates mostly. 60 Gb worth of graphical updates and barely any lore, in an open world exploration game focused on player interaction. No bigger maps, no extra mechanics, ships, or otherwise gameplay oriented modifications to improve the open world feel; just graphics and a little lore.[b]About 60 Gb worth of that[/b]. Yay.

I write this more as a warning than a genuine dislike for the game. I actually like this game. I just can no longer play it unless I want to uninstall about 5 or 6 other games that haven't done anything wrong, are quality games and I enjoy playing. So this one? I don't know when I'll play it or if I'll play it again, to be honest.

Don't buy it if you're not ready to have practically 100 Gb of space occupied by a game. Or if you think 60 Gb of graphics is a bit much for a game, and maybe gameplay should be the focus. I know I would definitely not have bought this game had I known that this is the road the developers had planned for it. To me this is a cheap way to get players to engage with a game that is no longer developing.  ",1696498550,1708266686,False,3,0,0.494089871644973755,0,True,False,False

At the end of 2022 a pvp on demand mode was added to the game (after the previous one was removed because the devs didn't properly maintain it through updates). 

This was a good change that allowed the pvp community to experience combat without the hassle of finding players in the open world. Returning after 7 months of playing I decided to derust by playing this mode. 
I played 7 matches and in each I experienced at least 1 game breaking bug. 6 occurred where I encountered something called ""mast bug"" where the opponents mast can not be seen moving and the state of repair it is in can not be seen. This can make choosing when to attack difficult. 
2 occurred where ""anchor bug"" happened meaning you can not lower the anchor of the opponents ship. 
1 match even had a respawn bug that makes it so you can't leave the death screen until you fully time out of it, something that completely disrupts the flow of combat and lead to me losing my advantage and sinking before I could even get to the ferry. 
Many of the bugs have been in the game for a month now and the respawn bug has been in since 2022.

The devs are too heavily focused on monetisation never missing a monthly item shop update yet failing to meet their own seasonal schedule often extending seasons by months to add content updates that contain less than old monthly updates, or to patch bugs that have been in the game since launch.

As of writing this the game has no anticheat and hasn't had one for 5 years, despite one being announced 18 months ago. Cheaters can keep their accounts for literal months but ban evaders are banned within days sometimes hours.

Racism and homophobia is common in the game and despite being against TOS many people receive temp bans for repeat offences. You can even get banned for spawn camping and behaving ""toxic"" to these people.

This game is genuinely one of the best things I've ever played when no bugs occur but every update for the past 2-3 years has implemented bug upon bug with fixes still managing to break other parts of the game. If you enjoy pve fixes are more common but still take a while and for pvp players some major bugs from launch such as the funny launch still haven't been attempted to be fixed.

If you can look past the glitches to a degree then go for it, you'll easily reach long play times with how unique each interaction has the potential to be. If you can't, keep an eye on the game until major changes happen, if they do it is well worth trying.",1708231359,1708231359,False,4,0,0.491069525480270386,0,True,False,False

First, its combat can be really fast - Boom!! You've been hit, your mast is down, and you're sinking! What do you do? Well, Sea of Thieves is a hard game and I've found out that working together as a team helps so much and can help you against your first battle. Even if you have two friends who aren't that good at the game, they can still help a lot by bucketing stray water out of the ship, steering the ship, and controlling the main combat. These are all vital roles that are hard for just one person to do, and it gets really hard when you meet a sweat with or without his friends. I would just say that for one, if you don't think you will be good at super-fast complicated combat, then you should have a few friends to help you loot the mighty fine islands and underwater dungeons of the Sea of Thieves.
Second of all, looting and getting treasure takes forever. Getting treasure takes forever, especially when you first start, and that's because you have to do quests that require you to do things like, ""Go to this island, defeat these hordes of enemies and the final skeleton boss, and now dig up the treasure and bring it back to me for a little bit of gold."" and you would have to do this over, and over, and over again until you die. No, no I'm just kidding, but you have to inevitably put 21 hours of your life into the game just doing that to even do anything with the gold. Now trust me Sea of Thieves is a great game, but only when you play it with friends, because when you do these quests alone you feel miserable, depressed, and bored, and therefore can only do a few of these horrible quests before wanting to get off, BUT if you add friends you are now not alone and you feel contented, cheerful, and entertained!! Believe me when I say that Sea of Thieves is 17.82 times BETTER WITH FRIENDS THAN WITHOUT HAVING FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH.
Third of all, Sea of Thieves is a great game so don't get scared. Sea of Thieves is a game of challenge, a game of dedication, you can't just run off when scared that you're going to work so hard and lose all of your treasure, but instead, you have to play and play like it's your first time and thought that it was a PvE game and proceeded to loot everything in your way, but then sank and was looted by some sweats (Except exclude that part where YOU were sunken and replace that with the word THEM and proceed to cash in tons of loot). You should know, that Sea of Thieves is about losing some and winning more so there is no reason to get scared that you will lose some loot!! just come back better,! not only as a better fighter but a better captain, a better bounty hunter, a better booty seeker, and a better pirate. 
Overall, if you have 1-3 friends who will be willing to play with you mostly when you are ready to play the game, have a good computer that can run the game with decent graphics while still running the game fine. You have some experience in PvP (It's not required because you can learn the game, but if you do have experience in PvP then you should play the game) you should get Sea of Thieves because it changed my life, so I think that it can change yours...

actor. You may know me from roles such as: Gangster Granny (I was casted as Raj)
and I played that one bloke in the Avengers movie who ran away awkwardly.
Oh yeah, I was also captain America's stunt double. Anyways, it might shock you
that me, a 79 year old lady would love this great wondrous adventure game but
I started playing it as my late husband Ronny was an experienced gamer himself.
Not only did he gamble our life savings away whilst playing poker, but old Ronny
loved playing that one pirate game at the arcade. This inspired me to be a brutal,
pillaging savage on the sea of theives.

I really enjoy playing this game. There are many ways to play but I like to boss
fort of the damned. I set sail in my grand sloop and I love adventuring the seas.
It feels so majestic. It does get towards my head sometimes because every now and
then I have a craving to pull out my walking stick and chef up my daughter like
I am a pirate with a mighty cutlass.

Part of the reason I do love SoT is because of how exquisite the world feels. This game has a lot of charm and character, and this is partially due to how great it all looks. Map regions feel unique and distinct and islands feel handcrafted and not as copy paste as they could have been. Everything in the world feels like a lot of care, love, and talent went into it. This is a mature game (as in fully baked) developed by a mature company that (generally) knows what they are doing. 

Why do I say generally? Well... SoT is probably my favorite online game, but it comes with a giant asterisk that says ""beautiful but flawed."" I've watched this game grow since it's public release on Game Pass in 2018 from something with very little to do, to so much that it's almost overwhelming. As the game has grown, it has been polished and refined over time and now (currently season 11) the game seems like it's in a very great spot and has a lot to offer for new players and veterans alike. That being said, the game has some ummm... quirks. There are bugs that have been present since the beginning that have only gotten slightly improved - namely hit registration. This game has the potential to be very sweaty in the multiplayer mode (high seas) and wins and losses can be determined by flukes, accidents, and the servers just absolutely crapping themselves mid fight. There is a TON of math going on at any given time in the game, which makes things like location updates for objects, players, and bullets take a toll on the servers as it tries to work out what's happening every millisecond. This means that sometimes fights can come down to pure dumb luck, even when you and your opponent are playing at their best.

I've concluded that this game was originally intended to be a lot more casual than it became and that something in the early engine was not prepared for everything that eventually got stacked on top of it and now a decade since rare started development on SoT (2014) the proverbial house of cards is stacked too high to move one of the ones at the bottom. That's my speculation as an amateur game developer / programmer and I can't prove that for sure. Other quirks include long, arduous voyages / quests bugging out and not being able to finish them. Loot getting stuck in the ship or bugged out. Key voyage items glitching out, getting lost, not working properly. I've seen Rare fix a ton of bugs for this game, so I know they are doing good work and care about the game, but some of the ones that still plague the game are just beyond absurd. For example, lost shipments came out almost 3 years ago and it can still sometimes bug out and not give the manifest after hours of venturing with your friends. I just don't think this game was ever meant to be this big or sweaty and I don't think the engine / servers can handle what Rare are throwing at it. It concerns me that they are considering going back to 6 crews on a server instead of 5 given that it can barely handle the 5 we have at present. 

A new gripe is that ""Safer Seas"" aren't. While this has been seen by many as an extended tutorial for new or returning players, this game can still throw a lot at you even in PvE. I can regularly sink skeleton ships and kill megalodons solo and even then the game feels like the deck is stacked against me and the house always wins. I had an experience today where I accidentally stumbled upon a world event ship, a skeleton ship, and a megalodon all at the same time. I ended up sinking the skeleton ship and megalodon but died to the galleon. I eventually went back to the same spot and sank it and get the loot but it's odd that these kind of things can happen where it just seems unfair. I'm not an expert at the game, but I have several hundred hours in the game between this and my time on Game Pass and I can't imagine a new player going into safer seas to learn the ropes and then stumbling into something like this. For some people, it could be enough to make them bounce off the game and quit. Others might laugh at how absurd it is, but it ultimately made the last four hours of my time spent in the game essentially worthless as even after I got the loot from sinking the galleon a ""Battle for the Sea of Thieves"" world event triggered and I ended up loosing all the loot in the end. It's already worthless since it was in Safer Seas which only gives 30% treasure value (was experimenting with different voyages and going after events), but loosing the time was the more painful aspect of the experience. I can't imagine someone getting off of work and playing this and consistently enjoying every minute of their time and feeling like it's always worth playing or always a rewarding experience. Often it isn't, even on the High Seas. 

Speaking of. PvPvE. I've already mentioned how buggy the game can be at times and how this interferes with PvP. Polished high tic rate Counter Strike this game is not, but I won't beat that horse anymore. This game truly offers the highest of highs and the absolutely most agonizing gut wrenching lows of any game I've ever played. In real life I am usually an extremely calm and neutral person, to the point where it's likely a problem for others that interact with me expecting more... expressive forms communication. Most days I'm lake fucking placid, but SoT breaks me. I almost jump out of my seat when things go right and something finally works in our favor and goes as planned. I NEVER rage in games, but SoT sometimes makes me want to hurl my controller through my monitor, heart beating 100 miles and hour, sweaty as hell, fighting for my life. These kind of extremes are a bit much for me, as I pride myself in my ability to remain calm and rational in intense or unpleasant situations. I can only imagine what this game does to people that aren't like me and that are more prone to rage. This game has ZERO respect for your time and it doesn't mind reminding you of that fact with every major loss. The salt and the rage and the tears that this game brings out is real, and it sucks to loose even in a fair fight which brings me to my next point...

CHEATING! A problem that has constantly plagued the game, like the quirks and bugs, is the cheating. Probably my number one complaint is that it seems like nothing is being done, even as developer updates say otherwise. I have seen the most absurd shit happen in games where a player has been hit point blank over and over again and they won't die, ships stopping on a dime and rotating in mid air and hovering above the ocean and zooming across the map, cannons not damaging the ship or being comically inaccurate (even in perfect conditions and default cannon skin). It's hard to tell what's cheating and what's the game bugging out at times, and sometimes it can be hard to tell if you got out played or if someone is using cheats, exploits, etc.. to gain an unfair advantage in a fight. Some of the cheats are so subtle they could just be coincidence, sometimes fights just feel... wrong... or there is something off about them. Some of the cheats are extremely obvious. I've even heard rumor of a cheat that shows all the map circles and/or ship locations. And then sometimes players are just really fucking good at the game. And as the game is prone to being buggy / glitchy it makes it very hard to tell the two apart. I'm confident that while cheating is rampant in SoT (as they don't currently have a good anti-cheat and have commented on this problem) I'm sure half of the reports are just the game being weird or someone playing at a very high level. But my point is that the fact that it's so hard to tell the difference between good play and good cheats is not a good thing. If Rare can fix this, I think the SoT will be much better.",1594359135,1708116068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Solo gets boring really fast, i became pretty damn good at pvp even being able to occasionally beat gally crews on my own but the missions themselves got extremely samesy after the first few dozen and the charm of the open seas and the panic of being attacked by krakens and megs wears off the instant you understand how to fight them. For a casual experience with friends its a great game but if you get even remotely good at the game or get to max level in any of the factions it just gets boring and the only progression being cosmetic means that theres really no point to playing the game once you’ve experienced everything. Theres a lot of “content” but most of it is just rehashed versions of the same thing, go here dig up thing, go here kill this thing, go to different island and repeat, deliver back to outpost or lose it on the way. Rinse repeat. Not to mention Rare has made some questionable decisions and a lot of the higher tier players have abandoned the game. 
TLDR: Lack of fresh feeling content, charm wears off fast, getting good makes the game boring and no real progression to make the game feel fresh after a few dozen hours or so

Edit: Forgot to mention that in the later stages of the game any progress will take weeks of nonstop play and perhaps even months if you dont have a lot of time to play, for instance some basic money sink cosmetics cost over 5 million gold for a single item which is fine and all but you need to enjoy the game for long enough to get there. The big one for me was the skeleton curse from the reapers pvp mode faction, i spent a solid week grinding and barely made any progress even with a 60+% win rate, and the grind just wasnt fun because most pvp players just cheese or play scared spending most of the fight running away turning it from a fun mode based around fighting to a slow boring mode based around who runs out of supplies first. Unfortunately when you get to the point where the only cosmetics (which are the only progression in this game at all) require weeks or even months of grinding for a single item and the grind itself isnt fun due to boring and repetitive design it saps any enjoyment from the game",1708096549,1708097139,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before you buy this, I wanna have it said that the game goes on Sale frequently, so you do not have to pay full price if you wait a while.

Definitly a recommended game if you do not mind grinding in Videogames. There is a buttload of content to farm and the community has good guides for new players. It is alot more fun with friends, but beware that they might not stick around as long as you do (or vice versa).

My recommendation for new players: Just go in, try to find out what the ""Order of Souls"", ""Merchant Alliance"" and ""Gold Hoarders"" are about and drive around doing what you want. If you know an experienced player, just let them drag you along quests and maybe have them explain the gameplay a bit while you're dragged along.

Your crew has to actually take care of the many functions of the ship, repairing masts, hull, adjusting sails, anchor, helm, bailing water. It also has enough respect for the player to trust you to look at a map yourself, find treasure, etc. and not just slap an obnoxious objective marker on-screen. All that does mean there's a learning curve, but that only improves the satisfaction of each success. You'll celebrate everything from your first fish reeled in, to the most massive pirate ship battle won, and everything in between.

Most importantly the pirate ship battles are everything you'd hope for: Your crew scrambling to steer, repair, attack, defend, lookout, all at once in a hectic battle; even leaping aboard an enemy ship for some satisfying swashbuckling action as the cannon balls fly! What kind of land-lubber scalawag wouldn't jump at that chance. You can even perform a battle sea shanty to strike fear into the hearts of rival crews as you approach.

In this game, it's possible to: [spoiler]load yourself into a cannon, have your crew mate fire you onto an enemy ship from a distance where you distract their crew with direct combat. Meanwhile your crew mates maintain the cannon barrage, harpoon treasure off the enemy ship, and then harpoon you back onto your own ship before they enemy crew can get the upper hand![/spoiler]

Sounds perfect? Not quite. It does require an XBox account, sigh, and the online service can be fairly flaky to get connected; some friends and I have needed to restart/relaunch or even reboot to actually get into the game. But once you can actually get in the game, chef's kiss! The one improvement this game could make, is allowing you to play your musical instrument while seated on the side of the ship, just to add to the intimidation factor.

Good game. Mesmerizing ocean fluid simulation, wonderful color palette and HDR implementation, large open-world sea to sail, good and fast matchmaking system, long list of quests and interesting riddles to solve, melee combat is good, ship to ship combat is fantastic, and the giant sea monsters and boss fights are super fun!

Cons:
Every time I take a break from this game, then come back and reinstall it, 'Games for Windows' pops up a login inside a partially hidden window and cannot be clicked, so I cant play the game. Their support says ""change your windows desktop to default DPI scaling"", but my desktop IS AT DEFAULT SCALING for 4k on a 32"" screen and this same issue has been happening for over 2 years! The fix is usually to reduce scaling below default, click the damn Games for Windows page, then fix the desktop scaling, but I cant be bothered after this long. Uninstalled. Fix the damn scaling problem!
 
Player base. I have definitely seen WORSE communities, but in this game about 2 out of 5 crews go south. You have children who are too young signing in from consoles, super angry, toxic esports pros shouting at everyone like this is their angry RP fantasy and we are here to run their boats for them, random trolls who just stand in the boat and do nothing, people who try to steer the ship into rocks on purpose, etc. So far most crews have been good, but my very first crew was with some toxic fuq who did not care that I was brand new, and ""expected me to know how to sail a ship, its like sailing a real ship."" (as if everyone is an effing sailor)

Other than community and the scaling issue, this game is a blast, its fairly easy to get into a crew, & most people will play and have fun with you. Compared to some communities, where almost every group is toxic, SoT aint bad.",1651789377,1707934528,True,1,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,False

Edit:Lowered graphic settings and resolution(to 80%),much better game play :|
Somedays its full sweaty gallions and sloops,sometimes not a single ship in sight for the whole voyage.
Getting good at pvp makes the game 100% better :)
Edit 2:My internet connection was bad,Now I can play with highest settings without the lag :)

Its stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and ever-expanding world make it a standout title in the multiplayer genre. While it may not appeal to everyone, those willing to embrace the pirate's life will find endless hours of excitement and camaraderie on the high seas. 

Nice game, funny to play party with friend if solo to be harder u can instant lose if meet galleon or brigatine ship, need update for adventure, more tall tale, new map, features to make it easier to sell like a bag or stretcher, when my single player was really struggling to sell it. Better i request a custom lobby or more crew, my friend is more than 4 and we play sea of thieves together but we not shall sail together. add 6 crew ship please so need it. Add Emisarry for Hunter Call i want to be fisherman, Add more fish type, best spot for fishing, sell grade.

However - if you are looking for a immersive and exciting game with lots of multiplayer content and progression you will be disappointed. The creators focus mostly on cosmetics, emotes and amazing scenary, which might be funny for a while but leaves a lot to be desired. If you are below 15 or have young kids you want to play together with it might be perfect.

There is no progression and no real pvp-element which makes it worthwhile. The server max population is also too small to make incredible events occur. Mostly you are drifting around alone in a vast sea of loneliness - like a solitary comet between two galaxies - destined to spend an eternity alone.

They should add two servers, one for PVE's and one for PVP's (with vastly different configurations)

Got a couple of kids you want to be a pirate with and enjoy a fun family adventure? Called horrific names and spawn camped by other players.
Want to play a LITERAL DISNEY themed story based on a popular Disney film franchise? Called horrific names and spawn camped by other players.
Want to enjoy a relaxing night after work with your spouse fishing in a virtual world that has rewards just for fishing in said virtual world? Called horrific names and spawn camped by other players.

Then, wait... 5 years later... PVE servers? A private server you can do all the above without other players calling you horrific names and spawn camping you?
Lmao, sure. Except this time it's the dev's killing all your fun. Rewards are cut to an abysmal 30%. Half the features are missing, including features DESIGNED for PVE experiences, and then you're told ""This game is not for you, go play something else"" because I want to enjoy this amazing world you created? I jump onto the forums to see what people are saying and it's 100 different usernames pleading for rare to knock it off and 3 usernames defending the obviously INSANE decision to require PVP in order to play the full game, and not nicely either, actually by... calling you names and trolling your posts.

Toxic community. Toxic ideology that purposely excludes people, and only for the reason that 3 out of every 100 people keep pointing back to Rare's ""Original plan for the game"" as reason to not make changes to be more inclusive to non-sweatlord gamers. What a joke. Give me full game and I give you wallet. Easy.

10/10 game otherwise. Give the PVP folks a big bonus for being big **** sweaty GaMErZ and let us 30yo chill folks enjoy the full game with our friends and family the way we want. Why limit it? It makes NO SENSE! I'm ready to buy my kids all the dogs and cats and birds and Banjo Kazooie ship cosmetics... but for 30% rewards and 30% features? LOL get real.

Edit: 02/24 - Several Months have gone by and the only things changing are Player count is dropping drastically (67% on steam DB, no access to Xbox numbers) and RARE has disabled comments on all it's Sea of Thieves social platforms, including steam.

If you want to know what crippling paranoia feels like, play alone.
If you want to know what crippling failure feels like, play a Brig/Galleon with friends.

Final Review:
Fuck this game
It'll force you to play like an asshole or run away from every battle.
I'm sick to death of pretending there's a positive side to this game other that losing everything you had because someone got lucky.
And that's just it, LUCK. Doesn't matter how much skill you have, if someone gets good waves or their ping is better, they'll outgun you or out run you.
Don't play this game unless you like fucking blenders.

Play it on Safer Sea's if you want to just enjoy the story and get the curse.",1669412281,1707737490,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

but this game is way better with friends and sometimes really frustrating when you get sunk by players. Yes there is a non-PVP server, but the progress gets major cuts there. Plus meeting nice crews is definitly a huge highlight.
At the moment I play this to chill after stressful days, so for that I think it is great, however I also think the game might get boring fast for other people, especially when playing alone. Though, you can grind a lot in this game, if you feel like that. 
Another plus is that each player always starts with the same equipment and ships. Progress is just cosmetic and new missionss, so fights are actually always fair and very much skill based.
Finally, there are a lot of small mechanicss and details I like, the fishing minigame as an example. It is not complicated, but feels a lot like actual fishing.
All in all, i love it at the moment and highly recommend it if you have a friend to sail with or a lot of patience. :)

In Sea of Thieves, it is never certain what you will encounter in a play session. The quests set your first intent in the game and can influence the experience you will have throughout a few hours, but it is never exact. The chaotic human factor can result in you being in scenarios you couldn't even imagine. [b]Sea of Thieves is a well-executed unique game considering the possibilities it provides for each player and their play sessions.[/b]

The game's main progression is through various factions. Although each of these factions prioritizes acquiring treasure and delivering it safely, each faction focuses on a few quest types. These quests influence you to search and dig up for treasure, transfer commodities, fight skeletons or even ghost ships, and get rewarded for each of them. [b]Sea of Thieves is a game that rewards you handsomely for the effort you put into the game.[/b]

Apart from the factions, there are world events in the game. These events are always visible to other people on your server as well, so they can become pretty competitive. Random world events consist of ghost ship battles, on-foot boss fights, raids that have special conditions and waves of enemies, and even more. During my team in the game, [b]I liked the competitive aspect of the world events, and they added greatly to my experience.[/b]

When it comes to combat, the game has a great variety of tools too. There are a total of four unique weapons for combat on foot, and then you have the sea combat where things get even more complicated. During fights with other ships, you can utilize a great number of cannonball types for your cannons, and you can even board your enemies' ship to lower their anchor or defeat them onboard. I haven't put many hours into fighting other pirates on the seas, but [b]I can assure you that Sea of Thieves is a game that is easy to get into, but pretty hard to master.[/b]

The best thing about the game is that you sail on the seas with a few more other crews, which adds to the overall experience. You never know what kind of crew you would encounter during your play sessions. This chaotic nature of the game is what makes it so replayable and fun to play. [b]In Sea of Thieves, each play session is unique due to the game's online aspect.[/b]

In short, Sea of Thieves gives you the feeling that you go on an adventure, a true one. Its chaotic nature and simple but varying systems render the game a great deal of fun to play. [b]I would suggest Sea of Thieves to everyone. No matter what your age or game preferences are, I believe you can enjoy this game.[/b]",1707692832,1707692832,True,16,1,0.680467367172241211,0,True,False,False

It turns out that 9/10 players you meet are trolls, griefers and modders that only care about ruining your day. I don't mind the fetch quests on multiple islands but it takes time, so if a bully player finds you in the middle of your quest, you've basically lost an hours play time in an instant.

I really enjoyed playing this game when it first came out a handful of years back with some of the pvp battles but the game became toxic very quick. I came back to try the safer seas experience and I do think they are on the right track with that.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he joined a game with me. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

This game is honestly great and I regret not jumping on the bandwagon sooner. I was scared that it would be a miserable time alone. It surprisingly isn't. There's a lot you can do alone. So if you're a loner like me, this isn't one of those games that hard punishes playing alone. There are some PvP stuff you'll struggle with, but if you're a loner you probably aren't down with PvP all that much anyway.

The game honestly looks amazing too. I was surprised at how beautiful the ocean looks. Sometimes I just sail around aimlessly having fun with the sailing mechanic and enjoying the views. Shooting some sharks and kraken every now and then.

The only thing that may be a negative is, a lot of activities are time consuming. This isn't really a game where you play for an hour and feel like you got a lot done. Even with the new diving function. It helps, no doubt. But I didn't feel like even with that, that I got a lot done and made a lot of money.",1707517920,1707517920,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Globally across all platforms I have over 3,500 hours logged on this game. It is incalculable exactly how much of an impact this game has had on my life. No, while the story is fun and entertaining, it is neither life changing nor the reason I praise this game so highly. The reason for what makes this game so incredible is the experiences forged while playing. With friends or even by yourself, Sea of Thieves is a completely unique and beautifully immersive experience, complemented and held up by its beautiful ambiance, score, audio design, visuals, unique stylization, and many more contributing factors. SoT succeeds flawlessly at creating the perfect, pirating experience.

Despite its flaws, which i'll mention in a bit, Sea of Thieves is easily one of the best ""pirate game"" experiences in the market right now. At its core, this game is like a PvPvE sandbox, very rich in content to do on your own or with other players. Although there isn't a specific goal to ""beat"" the game, there are many tall tales (what you could refer to as ""campaigns"") with puzzles and fun stories to explore by yourself or with friends. They recently added a ""Safer Seas"" mode where you essentially get put on a server with no other players who can ruin whatever you're doing (some late game content is unavailable on this mode, and you get reduced rewards.)

As for its problems, the servers simply aren't the best and you may experience a laggy experience when there are many players around. Personally, this has only been a small annoyance and it never made the game unplayable, but that's mainly because I have a decent Internet connection. I will say, however, that Sea of Thieves is not extremely welcoming to new players. The game kind of guides you through the first, basic steps of the game, but there's plenty of important stuff to learn that you are never told in any way. The main complaints, however, come from the PvP aspect of the game. I've seen many players quit Sea of Thieves because some other ship stole their loot they had spent hours on collecting, or something along those lines. This is definitely the roughest part of SoT and part of the learning process, but PvP and interaction between players are very big aspects that really make the game fun once you take time to learn. The only progress you can make is directed towards cosmetics, so you aren't even missing out on anything important other than gold to buy clothing, weapon skins and whatnot.

Sea Of Thieves has grown a lot over the years and is such a wonderful pirate experience. You choose how you play, you steal other players loot on the High Seas game mode which is playing on the seas with other players but what I love most when I've played on the High Seas, I have never stolen a thing unless someone comes and tries to sink me and my crew, then I sell that loot. You can also come across the nicest people on the High Seas which is extremely rare. I've noticed players complaining about hackers on the High Seas so I hope that Rare does an Anti-Cheat real soon. I play since the update, I play on the Safer Seas game mode where it's just you and your crew on a PRIVATE sea, or you can do it solo as well, however...there are restrictions which I find quite unfair and unbalanced for the PVE players, this game really only caters for the PVP players, so...if you want to become Pirate Legend, sadly you have to go on the High Seas and play against random players. When you first play, I recommend playing on the Safer Seas to learn the game then consider the High Seas later on. 

Now, where to start gosh, game is so big now and large with content. Every trading company as far as I believe are now all prestige level 100, Gold Hoarders, Order Of Souls, Merchant Alliance, Reapers Bones, Athenas Fortune, Hunters Call, I think it is so correct me if I'm wrong in a comment Rare devs. The game is ENDLESS now, play the game however you want, this game is popular for a reason and I highly recommend it. One of or even the best game I have ever played. You get voyages, tall tales which are like story modes you do, forts to raid, plenty of stuff to do and it does not stop there, Rare constantly keeps updating the game with more content after each Season Pass ends. I could go on and on about the content in this game from someone who has played Sea Of Thieves for years now, I want you to discover what this game has to offer when or if you consider getting this. A solid 10/10 and 5/5 stars. Please though Rare, please consider removing the restrictions in Safer Seas so everyone can have a fun and fair experience in Sea Of Thieves. Think of it this way, more money, the game becomes even more popular and this game will grow to be a solid masterpiece as it already is for the PVP players. Please consider it, over and out.

Back then, it got a lot of criticism (and rightly so) about it's repetitiveness and how once you get past the brevity of being a pirate for a couple of hours, there wasn't much else deeper than that.

Fast forward to 6 years later (I feel old) and the game is in a much better state. I've sunk over a 100 hours in the past two seasons alone and I'm not even a skilled player. There is so much more to do, better cosmetics and events that you can essentially fast travel to with the new dive mechanic. The Plunder Pass didn't feel like a massive grind and was well worth the credit rewards. I haven't even tried the Tall Tale solo content yet and with some of my friends being big fans of Monkey Island and Pirates of the Caribbean, it's inevitable that we'll sink a few hours into that soon, too.

The ship ownership and Guilds side, in my opinion, has thrust the game up a level and I can't wait to see how that side evolves in future. It feels great to see that your ship has a name, customisation, and a banner that appears for all players. It's half the fun when you spot new players now, to see who they are, what they're called, and what they're running.

I think £35 still feels quite steep in this climate, it hasn't come down in price at all in six years, though you'll absolutely find it for 50% off on Steam multiple times a year. In an ideal world, making Safer Seas (Private servers) give a little more than 30% reward would help get this game a much bigger and newer audience. I think 50% reward is fair, especially as the High Seas servers are hardly dying out.

Overall would recommend, thought it would be good to come back after a long time to show that the game has improved. Time will tell now whether it holds it's place as the best pirate game now that Ubisoft and others are trying to enter the market!",1707142885,1707142885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Probably one of the most abyssal games integrated into PC I've seen, even compared to games from 2006. This game isn't actually running on steam nor does it have proper PC functionality but instead runs using the Windows Xbox app, which causes it to be a horrible PC experience as it forces you to emulate an Xbox while intentionally removing any sensible PC game settings. 

1. The Entire game is integrated into ""Microsoft Game Tab"" and ""Windows Xbox App"", the game does not, in any way have multiplayer functionality through steam or the game itself. You have to use these secondary applications WITH AN ACCOUNT for the game to be playable with other people. The applications themselves are really trashy and unpleasant to use on PC.

2. There are NO audio device settings for this game. I mean it. The game has no ability to select which device is used for input and output; instead it automatically chooses devices that are enabled on your computer. This wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't choose to select devices that are disabled on your computer. Which has made this games audio completely broken since its release if you are using a Bluetooth headset, since it ALWAYS uses a Bluetooth headset-mic simultaneously even if that microphone is disabled on your computer and an external microphone is plugged in. 
It's ability and choice to do so seem to even supersede any computer settings you have. I personally, disabled the games access to all sound devices, disabled and removed the microphone component from my devices and IT STILL CONNECTED TO MY MICROPHONE which lead to loud popping blowing out my headset. 
You cannot disable having a live microphone in-game and in fact you cannot disable voice chat at all, thus their horrible decision to remove all game options for audio devices will always make the game unplayable. 
(it also resets some of the more heavy handed ways of getting it to use the right device each time you restart your computer forcing you to repeat the process every time you want to play the game, just as an added bonus.)

3. Both of the above problems are caused by 1 core issue; this game is not made compatible for PC and it isn't actually integrated into steam or as an independent PC launch; it is an XBOX game running from the XBOX app. It's settings are some horrible amalgamation of the XBOX settings menu and Windows audio menus (is also is using windows 10 audio menus not windows 11 for extra fun, which allows it to circumvent some settings.) 
Issues  from being completely unable to play with other people to having your headphones implode not only exist, but has existed consistently and been reproducible since the games release with no intention of fixing it.

The issues themselves are only half the problem, the real annoyance is the fact it is borderline intentional by the developers and Xbox studios to have the game run this way despite it causing audio issues with any Bluetooth audio device and making the multiplayer user experience horrid. 

This has genuinely not only made me dislike this game but also made me decide to never get involved with a game published by Xbox on PC again.

No, I cannot recommend this game if you, like me are a casual player. I get that it is called Sea of Thieves and is a game that heavily pushes PvP. That in itself is not an issue and is a feature of the game - The problem arises, now that most of the casual and friendly player base that used to be in the game has left for greener pastures.

I originally played this game when it came out, when it was new and fresh, and everyone was still learning. There were of course people yearning for PvP, it is nothing new, they have always been there. Now, however, they are the only ones left truly playing this game. In practice, this means that now, every time you log in and attempt to get a bit of progress in, running into another ship is an instant death sentence, unless you are incredibly good at the game already.

This game does not and will not respect your time. The only way you can enjoy this game, is if you are okay with hours of hard work disappearing in the blink of an eye, because that will happen to you, especially if you are new to the game and still learning.

I came back because I heard they had finally caved and made a safer seas mode, only to learn that this mode was completely and utterly useless for me. I don't mind that you only get 30% rewards in safer seas, it makes sense that you get much less reward when there is little to no risk - However, gating reputation levels past level 40 and making you unable to use the ships you have purchased in this game mode is what kills it completely for me.

I would have been fine just spending a few hours of my time here and there, slowly chipping away at the reputations with the reduced rewards while sailing on my own ship - But no, I am not allowed to do that, because in order to enjoy this game casually, you are forced to deal with the worst this game has to offer as well.

TL:DR: This game is not for people like me, who likes to play the game for a casual adventure with friends. This is a game for hardcore players, ready and willing to dedicate hours of their lives to become true pirate legends and reap the rewards of dunking on much less experienced players.

Edit: Hey folks. I've read through your comments and I have a few notes. Yes, I did go back and play a little more after this, pretty much only to do some tall-tales with my friends to at least get a little out of my purchase.

It's like Ark, but a pirate game, and the hit registration is terrible. Cheating is also a major issue in the game, worse than GTA 5. You can see cheaters every day in every other fight. If the developers make the game better, I will change my review, but for now, it's pretty bad. Even streamers who play the game for a living agree that the game is bad. It makes no sense that the developers listen to the PVE players when the PVP players are the ones who play the game more. The bugs in the game are numerous, such as not being able to interact with anything, everything on other players' ships being invisible, and sometimes even your ship's sail not going down when you chain it. You can't see water in other players' ships and sometimes there are double gun glitches. Sometimes you buy supplies and don't receive them or the game freezes. This list of bugs can go on for at least 80 more. The developers need to stop adding new stuff and fix the issues they have right now. The current player base can adapt to the changes, but the game is still bad. I wish the best for anyone who spends their money on this game right now because after grinding for 8 hours and collecting loot, a cheater can spawn a keg on your ship, kill you, and take everything. You get nothing but a fresh start at the outpost. I want to say one more time, do not buy this game right now as it's a waste of money. It's not a skill issue because I have over 400 hours in both AHG and RHG. The game is just very bad. Please fix the game, developers, or you will lose a great game because you are too lazy to fix the issues.""",1707090275,1707090275,False,11,0,0.589878380298614502,0,True,False,False

a lot more strategic than its played out to be, and has a lot of social aspects
as for the map and gameplay loop, there is a seemingly endless amount of stuff to do. you can dig up treasure, solve riddles, fight ghost and skeleton ships, fight other players, team up with other players (although you get backstabbed frequently lol) and you can even transport valuable goods across the sea
TONS of cosmetics, more than you can think of. 
overall very cool game, minor bugs, some hackers and trolls here and there, but nothing major to detract from the gameplay experience.

I have played for a little over 350 hours. Which is nothing if you want to be good at the game.  I think this game is awesome at times and is amazing to play with friends, but I can't bring myself to recommend this game.

Rare does not listen to it's community and the game can be very janky. Hackers have become more frequent by the week, and there no third party software detection. As I continue to play it I lose more and more of what used to make it fun. 

I recommend this game to people who want to be a pirate for 100-200 hours. It is a great game and very pretty. 

However it is a game that is continuing to go in the wrong direction and keeps getting increasingly frustrating to play as rare's servers are pretty bad, rare does not listen to it's community, and rare continues to ignore the hacking problem and pretend it is not as big of a deal as it is. 

To exemplify how bad the hacking is this is a triple A game, the only Triple A game I know about (besides GTA) that has speed hacks, teleportation hacks, aim bot, the ability to spawn items, flying ships, basically all the hacking under the sun. 
Rare seems to have no intention of fixing this soon. Basically fun game, nice to play with friends, but has a company backing it that seems to really not care.

I can simplify the game for you. Do you have 3 or more people you can always bring with you? If yes game is balanced for you specifically, vs. players and PVE. If not? You will get run over. Benefits to having a small boat? None. Can you go faster than the big boats? No. Do you have any type of strategic advantage you can use with sheer skill to fight an equally skilled crew of more than your 1 or 2 members? No. You will be out-guned, and sunk in a matter in minutes. Or chased until you run out of wood, because the small boats are almost twice as slow as the others.

Bugs: idk they can be Funny but extreme annoying

Events: 10/10 well there are Ghost Ships and skulls also called Forts then there are Seaforts and other extreme cool things

Story 7/10: Tall Tales are cool but they can be Boring they give you 8,000 Gold for Completing and when you do all the Quests of the Tall Tale you get cosmetics

Each character has personality and very different past bosses. The unlockable characters have an obvious skill cap and much higher risk/reward. Granted, when you play the game as much as I did, it slowly loses something, but as with all of these pirate-like sea explo games, they only keep the repeatability for so long. There comes a point when you know every item, every combo, every boss pattern and every enemy.

I am increasingly lost in large scale live service games like Sea of Thieves. I think the mechanics and how to properly interact with the game world or catch up on the many lost seasons of story development hamper my ability to enjoy games like this (or others like Destiny),

During our play throughs, my friends and I struggled for a while to find something outside the normal process of go pick up a quest, go to an island filled with Skeletons, bring back whatever loot we found there, drag it back to a port, sell it to a vendor, and then repeat. That got boring quickly. If we had researched more, we may have come across Tall Tales sooner. However, after completing 3 of these tall tales, we were still disenchanted. 

These tales often meant going to an area, swimming around a lot, taking in some scenery, fighting the same groups of enemies in arenas over and over, then returning to a port to try and do the same again. Each one of these last hours and the reward felt... empty.

The final straw was our last play-through. After completing a tall tale where we were rewarded with one chest that flooded our ship if it was not bailed out, we were set upon by NPC pirates and a Megladon at the same time. Our ship inevitably sank, but I managed to drag the chest to nearby island. After waiting 25 minutes for my friends to sail to collect me, we were attacked by another group of players - our loot stolen after being killed. 30 minutes after that, we had sailed back and collected our loot, before dragging it to a port.

That felt on one hand, vindicating. On the other, hollow. We spent hours to obtain that chest, for a miserable set of circumstances to be set upon us, which meant we lost an hour just to complete what should be a simpler objective.

Yes, it is a game about piracy, and there are settings to prevent PVP. But I think back to that quote by Gabe Newell that a fun isn't about realism, its about reinforcement. And in my time playing this game, I did not feel like an amazing pirate, or sharpshooter or whatever. I felt like I was faffing in a game that is un-intuitive, made by those who focused on making it being more pirate-y or having realistic sailing mechanics than making it fun to play with friends.",1706927796,1706927796,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly, as a solo player... it does get boring rather quick. This game is incredibly nice and fun with the friends though for sure. Something I do honestly miss.

But overall, by far best ocean mechanics in any game. Amazing customization ships and cosmetics for both ship and your character, as well as weapons. LOT of stuff to do and achieve, unlock, work towards, etc... And this game only keeps improving. I personally like the devs as well, by far the best and one's who ACTUALLY listen to their community and why this game is succeeding to this day. It is NOT pay to win like most games and for an UE4, this game surpasses even the most UE5 ones in my opinion.

Of course I am truly not a fan of the massive reward nerf for safer seas and pve based players. Though in my recent times playing, I have hardly experienced any pvp players and tend to be left alone.

The developers do nothing to discourage game abuse, they don't actively encourage it, but they don't employ any game mechanics to discourage it. That and only until recently certain ship types finally blocked bullets, when they didn't before, further there was no server-side hit registration at all, it was all client side guess work, who play tested that and thought it was ok?

They're slowly realising that this is potentially killing their player-base after 2 years of game release, that and the £35 price tag.

The game's now available on the XBox Game Pass, which if you can trial it for £1 is totally worth it to see if the game's for you. However, this is also why Rare have introduced a 'plunder pass', like other games which have 'passes' such as Rocket League, Dead by Daylight and Destiny 2, it's mostly for cosmetic items only that don't affect the game in any meaningful way. Which is perfectly fine.

For £35 if you're a single player, the game isn't quite worth it. As a single player you can join other crews at random, but your experience with this will be a mixed bag. You'll encounter young children who simply want to troll, joke around and not make a decent 'crew'. They'll run around, disconnect, and simply play music.

However you'll find a few who'll help introduce you to the game and take you on quests.

The game isn't forgiving to a new player, there's no real introduction to how to play the game aside from the 'maiden voyage' which you can start, that tells you how to setup and sail your ship - spend some time here and look around the island for a bit more of an introduction, but it still does a poor job at telling you about the factions in the game (Reapers, Gold Hoarders, Order of Souls, Bilge Rats, Merchants and Hunters and of course, Athena).

This has recently improved with 'safer seas', basically you and up to 3 of your friends can sail a Sloop, Brig or Galleon without any other players. Which is total bliss, you can enjoy missions, tall tales and sail the seas - except that Rare have decided that you're not allowed to earn the entire worth of your gold, only 30% worth, and you're not allowed to level up the emissary ranks past 40, and you're not allowed to unlock the Athena missions. It's understandable that you cannot unlock Reaper of Souls since that is the ""PvP"" faction. Those who are against PvE will say it's a very ""cut down"" experience, but frankly it's closer to how the game was at release and has good core gameplay.

There's PvP in the game, and even though Reapers are the 'PvP' faction that're made to make everyone else's life worse, people use this as an excuse to be an ass. There's no honour among thieves, and there's none among Pirates - that I am fine with. However Reapers are meant to go after other 'emissary' (read: faction) flag flying ships for their points, but instead players simply slaughter and spawn camp, mercilessly. Abusing weapon switching to skip animations and sinking you for the sake of it, not even taking your loot.

PvP can be exciting, and enjoyable and stressful, in the right ways, a typical tactic is another player ship will shoot a player of their crew over to you, pretending to be friendly... while he sabotages your ship and then you're full of cannon balls. An inexperienced captain would rack up to an outpost with anchor down, only to find themselves stuck and full of holes by another Pirate coming along to take their loot.

The PvP can be as balanced and enjoyable as the PvE content in this game, but if you're going into this game with the expectation that you're often going to live out your unimpeded pirate fantasy, expect to be disappointed, regularly.

It's not all too often you end up making backstabby piratey friend chums in an alliance or that you enjoy going on missions to have a bit of a tete a tete, you'll be pushed up against with the old ""git gud"" and ""just scuttle your ship"" but none of this is satisfying when you've been abused and forced to submit your hard worked loot by simply... drowning your ship, which would've happened anyway to those who're manipulating and abusing the game.

The tall tales almost save this game, the old pirate shanties and joining other crews on the deck as you purposefully burn your own ship at the end of a long voyage. The 'pirates life' update with the Disney content is really nice, for the Disney portions, and if you've been on the ride you'll love the little tip-offs, and there's a small part for if you're a Secret of Monkey Island fan.

It can be highly satisfying when you've had a rough day of fighting skeleton ships, raiding a vault, and then running away from or fighting other players on the server instance and trying to avoid the Reaper ship, and then being sunk by them and building it up again. It's part of the experience, it's part of the tale, it's finally allying with another crew and getting 50% of their bounty, or choosing to betray them and getting 150%.

They need to balance out the abuse and encourage the good work while putting in active discouragement for the abuse, instead of letting it play out.

Youll also never be able to play with friends on other ships,not without luckily instancing on the same servers as them. Any friends you make in game will be fleeting at best, as the only way youll play together again will be on the same ship if you add each other as a friend, theres currently no hope for being able to sail any friendly alliances you made on a server again with the same people.

With how many times I've seen people frustrated with this, I can't recommend it. Not unless it's hit a price point you can justify and you can tolerate the problems, but don't believe all the advertising. You can enjoy playing solely on 'safer seas' though, and you're put on this by default when you start, but the next time you play you'll have to know to choose, the game doesn't explicitly tell you that you start in 'safer seas' though. Rare don't want you on there, they want PvP fodder.

I have a feeling this game is going to go free to play within a few years, with the season pass and other functionality coming in.

The recent season 8 with the PvP versus mode is also pretty awful. After waiting to queue up with others, you'll then be victim not to the person you're fighting against, but the sheer lag of the ship. You'll try to repair with a plank only to discover that it didn't apply, you'll try to interact with your cannons, or the sail, to find you have to hammer the button to interact with it, all the while you're trying to save time and your ship. It will get frustrating as the cannon fire lays into you and you're struggling to fight with actually navigating your own ship, and lose not to your own skill or lack of, but to the game physics and mechanics against you.

The recent season 11 with Safer Seas though is great. Finally you can play the pirate game that you always wanted, almost, it's nearly there if they would simply reward players that want PvE rather than PvP.",1612907144,1706918331,False,6,1,0.548358798027038574,0,True,False,False

Would be cool to have PvE servers but if you suggest this the PvP folks will tell you that you're wrong because they like it and that's all that matters

This game is top of the line, up there with Minecraft and Red Dead Redemtion 2.
The open world is fantastic and inspiring, anything a pirate could think of is here in the sea of thieves.
The ship physics are top tier; manual steering, manual sail adjustment, manual anchor management.
Everything about the customization is perfect, the fact that everything in this game is cosmetic makes the game feel more even and fair, it's all about skill and practice.
Playing this game with friends is a true experience to behold, I recommend this game to anyone who has some patience and is ready for some fun; go looking for long lost treasures, explore the expansive openworld, take down enemy skeleton fortresses, take down fellow players' ships and take their loot for yourself! well ahoy, its time for me to find a new adventure in the Sea of Thieves.

1. The moderation team doesn't Hardware or IP ban people, so cheaters literally only need to log out of one account and into another, which takes all of 3-5 minutes.

2. buying the game on steam guarantees you a free infinite supply of alt accounts, as the moderators don't monitor steam IDs linked to xbox gamertags.

Stack that on top of servers that run like complete TRASH 90% of the time (I'm talking averaging 80 ping in your own region's servers, with lag spikes approximately every 5 minutes),

Rare has truly crafted a masterpiece that stands out for its unique blend of exploration, camaraderie, and heart-pounding naval battles.

From the moment you step foot onto your trusty ship, the freedom to chart your own course is exhilarating. The open-world design encourages exploration, and the attention to detail in the stunning landscapes makes each island feel like a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle add an immersive layer to the game, creating an ever-changing and captivating environment.

One of the standout features of Sea of Thieves is the cooperative gameplay. Whether sailing with a crew of friends or forming alliances with other players on the high seas, the camaraderie is at the heart of the experience. The coordination required to navigate a ship, manage sails, and engage in thrilling ship-to-ship combat creates a sense of teamwork that is both challenging and immensely rewarding.",1666302345,1706726470,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

There is plenty of PvE content. And they keep adding more of it. And it's fun. But if you spend any decent amount of time doing PvE, you [i]will[/i] have to protect your hoard in PvP. Which is fine, ""it's a pirate game"" as the barking seals often remind me. But 99% of the time you encounter someone who wants to pick a fight it's some fresh spawn with no loot who will attempt to steal your hard work with no risk to themselves. Your options are: 
1) Run. You can't really get away unless they let you get away, but if you spend half an hour on nothing but helm and sails you might wear out their patience. Or they might literally follow you around the map forever. Not fun in the slightest. 
2) Fight. The ship side of naval combat is actually pretty good, except that chainshot is utterly broken against sloops and I have no friends, but that's just me. The other side of naval combat is crews using overly-forgiving respawn mechanics to kamikaze their players onto your ship (using throwables, dropping your anchor, stealing your supplies, respawn camping, or just swimming across with a gunpowder barrel...). This ""boarding"" can be done from great distances by firing people out of cannons, at no risk beyond a small wait to respawn. 
And once they're on your ship, pirate-on-pirate combat [i]SUCKS[/i]. It's janky, clumsy, and the hitreg is awful. When I imagine pirates boarding ships and fighting each other, a single fat man with a blunderbuss jumping up and down/side to side to avoid bullets while shouting racial slurs is not the first thing that comes to mind. 

So let's say you avoid the raining toxic pirates and actually win this hypothetical fight. What do you get? Nothing. Nothing at all. There is no reward, other than continued existence and the salty tears of your enemies. Whenever someone attacks you you're risking everything, while they probably risk nothing at all. 

Nowhere is safe. You cannot avoid other players. Even if you seem to make friends and form an alliance to give them free loot (they get an extra 50% of your sell value, for no effort), it takes literal seconds for them to sink your ship and take everything (because 100% is better than 50%). And they will, because people in this game have no concept of honour. ""It's a pirate game"", after all. And in my playtime I've had what I would consider a successful alliance exactly once. 

And this doesn't even include people who are assholes just for the sake of it. You could be fishing/doing tall tales on a solo sloop with a huge neon sign saying ""no loot here"" and you will still get attacked 50% of the time you see another player. But ""it's a pirate game""- no. Pirates steal for profit. If you do this you're just a terrible person who somehow derives pleasure from other people's pain, and you seriously need to see a psychologist. Edit - after Safer Seas the example doesn't work so well, but my point still stands. 

There is no downside to being a toxic asshole, in fact it is usually beneficial. So instead of tense alliances where crews work together for a short time towards a shared goal and then either part ways or bring out the guns, it's always better to just shoot first and ask questions never. There is never a reason for teamwork, because everything is possible solo if you throw enough respawns at it. The only reason to have a ceasefire is to get in a better position to start shooting. 

So what needs to change? 
1) Rewards for killing antagonistic pirates. If I spend time defending my loot I should get something out of it, otherwise every sail I see on the horizon is just another waste of my time. There needs to be some kind of bounty system where if someone else shoots first and I successfully defeat them, I get paid. It makes absolutely no sense that I have to continually risk my hours of work levelling emissary against people who just spawned, and they're the only ones who can get anything out of the encounter. 

2) IMO there needs to be a better Parley/ceasefire system than the current alliances. It shouldn't [i]stop[/i] people from shooting each other, but in a kind of Pirate Code way severely disincentivise it. Maybe tie it into the bounty system from point 1 where if you break Parley other pirates get rewards for killing you. That way you end up with a risk/reward situation where betrayal is still possible, but you have to decide if the cost is worth it. 

3) Never going to happen because too many people would cry about it, but pirate combat needs an overhaul. More punishing respawns to stop the endless suicide missions, especially for larger crews. Less one-shot-one-kill so that shooting first isn't the [i]only[/i] viable option when you see another player (looking at you, blunderbuss). When a ship is sunk there should be an immediate server migration, otherwise you get angry players hunting you from beyond the grave and you just have to keep killing them over and over for no reward, until they finally get lucky and kill you. 

4) There needs to be a reason for ships to work together, whether willingly or with a finger on the trigger the whole time. Alliances are vestigial because there is never a need for them, and 100% > 50%. The game needs PvE content that's actually hard enough that you may need more than one ship. (And no, ""you need 5 people to summon the megalodon"" doesn't count. Look up “artificial difficulty” if you have trouble understanding why)

[strike]5) There needs to be a way to play the overly-grindy Tall Tales with no PvP at all (and possibly throw some Hunters Call stuff in as well). Earning gold would be disabled. I hate that spotting another player often adds half an hour or more to the repetitive ""storyline"". Especially when the achievements make you play through it [i]FIVE TIMES[/i] for some reason. Alternatively, make them worth my while with actual rewards that might be worth fighting for.[/strike]  - Edited after Safer Seas update. I probably would have preferred other PvM stuff be disabled to keep PvP player counts up, but it's definitely better than nothing. 

I want [i]good[/i] PvP, not this janky torrent of expendable pirates. I want tense, briefly-lived alliances where nobody trusts each other but still has to work together, not meaningless loot increases. I want to win fights by knowing I out-fought my opponent, not because my crew was more expendable or because I got the first shot off and things went downhill from there. 

The game supposedly thrives on tension, but it also completely removes any reason to ever trust other players. All trust does is open you up for betrayal. In turn, the only meaningful interaction with other players is as obstacles. The best way to survive is to run or to murder on sight. Instead of the ocean of player interaction that [i]should[/i] be possible, the only tension is that of wondering whether I'll have to run off the map to finally make my pursuers give up, which by comparison is just plain boring.",1650201412,1706607811,False,132,21,0.693528056144714355,0,True,False,False

In my almost 300 Hours now, my Friends and I have encountered many PVP battles with other crews and we have noticed that many players act toxic towards you, regardless of which side they belong to (Winner or Loser), they usually react in a Toxic way.
Now I can only talk from my experience but from what I have also noticed, I've encountered TWO different crews who appreciated the fair battle. Thus signaling it with a simple ""GG"" via Voicechat or Textchat. I've also encountered many crews who yelled or swore through Voice chat.

You could go into the ""PVE""-sea, but this isn't an option if you wish to progress inside the game due to many locked features.

Would I still recommend this game?
Yes, but only if you can tolerate pubescent teenagers who have nothing on their mind but abuse features like ""Reaper Hopping"" and sweating their way through the server.


Fair-Warning (from personal experience);
if you see a captained ship with a Russian-sounding name, stay very far away from it unless you are up to the challenge of battling the most ruthless crews in the entire Sea of Thieves. lol",1670183472,1706554699,True,2,0,0.504022002220153809,0,True,False,False

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just busy on internet. So I decided to open the old Steam account my son don't use anymore now and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. My son hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had left us. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

There is a couple things I think they should change. When there is loot in the water, I think you should be able to just drive the boat right over the loot and it's automatically on board the ship. Sitting there for 5 minutes trying to harpoon or jump in and bring every little thing on board is time consuming and annoying. If you sink 3 ships in an area then have a player jump you, by the time you get done battling the loot is long gone from trying to avoid the player. There are cheats for this game, ESP, Aimbot, and an aim indicator for cannons that show where to shoot to guarantee a hit. Pretty lame. The game is mostly just sailing around and collecting treasure chests and skulls, then bringing them back to a port to sell them for gold. Other than that, it's pvp. If you are on at a populated time, there is a ton of people just looking to sink you without remorse. If you want to farm, play later at night. I really wish they had a ship boost though, like every 2 minutes 10-15 seconds of increased speed. It can take 10-15 minutes to sale to a location and it just gets tiring. I've met some cool people, had some good battles and adventures. Really liked the underwater cave missions. Pretty good graphics for a cartoon looking game. Make sure if you get this, that you get some friends that know how to play and will guide you. It really helps. Better to have a crew who knows what they're doing than randos who either just sit there catatonic when a battle breaks out, or who panic and don't focus on what needs to be done.

There are mountains of things to learn, see and do-- Between my Game Pass hours and Steam hours, I'm about just shy of 200 hours in this game and am just now making decent headway into cosmetic grinds and commendations.

This of course can be a daunting ask of any player that chooses to be "" casual "", and the debate of this game's validity towards "" casual "" and "" hardcore "" players alike has been pretty harshly discussed. As of season 11, though, I feel very confident in Rare's ability to create meaningful progression for new and veteran players alike. 

That said, it's a pirate game. You are a pirate, and others are pirates. What you and others choose to do with that fact is not only the core principal of the game, but what makes it distinct. If you don't like that air of uncertainty, then the game legit is just not for you. I would suggest Safer Seas, but even I'll admit it's a misstep on Rare's attempt at a newcomer-friendly playstyle.

And for the r/gaming crowd, yes, it has microtransactions.

RIP TDM

Größtes Drecksgame südlich vom Nordpol, kannste knicken, würde ich nicht mal meinen schlimmsten Feinden zumuten dieses Stück an Datenmüll zu spielen.

First of all, everyone who is whining about other players didn't quite understand the game.
PVP is an important aspect in a pirate game, and it's just part of the gameplay.

[u]pro's:[/u]

- successful, lively graphics
- it's a lot of fun with friends
- different game modes
- many possibilities
- many quests and missions
- approx. 25-30 hours of story (Tall Tales)
- only skins can be purchased with real money and no in-game advantages
- mostly lots of good stuff in free Battlepass (skins/real-money currency)
- long-term motivation through many achievements and awards

[u]con´s:[/u]

- 90% of the players run 3 times around the whole map with their gold collector 2 flags in order not to sink with their two chests
- the content is missing for a long time
- terrible hit registration in PVP
- the tutorial (maiden voyage) only deals with a few points, things like factions etc. are completely left out
- servers shit at every major event, Rare doesn't really care either
- please nerf the sword, needs little or no skill and it's just completely broken in terms of range and stun",1613255187,1706478333,False,3,0,0.538461506366729736,1,True,False,False

Oh yeah and they implemented the anti-cheat few times already, the game is still full of them. 
I'd say, if you wanna have some fun with friends in PvP try the Open Seas, but if you are in it just to chill and do some adventures then try the Safer seas, its less frustrating even though it closes a big chunk of content, which of course means you would have big target on your back doing these.",1706464979,1706464979,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The central element of being on a boat with friends is fun, but everything around it is paper thin. I appreciate the game for creating a good sailing mechanic, it takes real coordination with your crew to maintain both maneuverability and firepower when fighting other players. 

However, any NPC encounters are a slog, especially the redundant skeleton massacres on those fort islands. Everything on the safe islands is boring, mostly amounting to ferrying boxes from your boat to merchants for ten minutes. Makes one feel like an amazon delivery driver, not a pirate. The only way to have fun in the game is with a crew of friends, not worth a try if you are going at it alone. Keep the boat mechanics, and change the content around it, and a great game could be made! (By someone else)

PLUSES:
1) The sound design is of the Bafta-award level 
2) Graphics are quite perfect and timeless, will stay relevant for many years
3) One of the main protagonists is the Seas, and the interaction with it is most amazing - just sailing through the seas is pure pleasure
4) SOT was recently updated to be much friendlier to players, and the devs do already have roadmap for the upcoming 5 years
MINUSES:
1) It's not friendly to starting players - the menu is convoluted - after the initial tutorial it's not easy to understand what to do because 90% of functionality is locked (tip: you have to find the 2nd interactive tutorial)
2) It's a co-op game by design. You can play solo (like I do) but your performance is limited - for instance, you can steer your ship and operate the cannons at the same time on your own.
3) Your progress will get you mostly cosmetics, and for a non-fashionista like myself it's not motivating
NEUTRAL:
1) Sessions are quite lengthy, and each mission feels like a short pirate story
2) It's a seriously challenging game
3) Even in MP mode it doesn't feel like MP because you hardly meet someone (but when you will meet, you will be out-skilled)",1706306025,1706454158,True,0,0,0.485799700021743774,0,True,False,False

And PVPers seem to catch up even quicker tan ever so cheaters are more still as prevalent or the game is taking the Chinese route to make it more grindey than ever, all done in open seas which is normally fuller of hackers and a$*holes anyway.  How do you make this worse?
Update- Even after all this time, the game is still got its fair share of hackers you just don't see them as much with the new season because of the multitude of returnees, here's to hoping the new safer seas actually gives a place for people who are sick and tired of dealing with these cheaters to actually go a few sessions without encountering at least one.

I love this game, Rare has done amazing job of creating it with the feeling of the ships, process of progression and even the pvp when it's not against obvious hackers is fun but when the hackers are so prevalent and can take multiple blunderbuss shots to the head you know they have more going on in the background, I would play this more if there were PVE servers and yes I know the theory RARE is going with where if there was PVE only people would not have to spend real money to purchase things as much or often but due to the abundance cheaters and constant PVP harassment I feel they are missing out on so many other players that would play, perhaps if they made it Premium currency can only be earn't on PVP servers or earn't in the small amounts it is on PVP servers and bought with real money it would give more players a chance and reason to play and enjoy and would both make players happy with options and make them more money in the long run but alas if has not happened and will probably never happen so I have to give this a negative rating on that alone. Otherwise well put together, graphically pleasing and fun game. * Adding to this review, we are at season 9 and multiple times now I have seen the game claim my internet connection has been lost when my crew had a full boat of loot to a level 5 flag, never lost connection to discord but lost all loot and no recourse to sell and get money for it, to be this far into the game and still having these game breaking issues is nothing short of dissatisfying, when the game makes it hard enough to get loot back with hackers and you finally get a good server to have this happen makes me wonder if they have done anything to make the game stable at all.......",1682681637,1706450583,False,3,0,0.528795838356018066,0,True,False,False

as of the time of editing, i still stand by my original statement. this game is pretty and has a lot of fun mechanics when it comes to naval adventuring! but honestly sea of thieves surpasses league of legends in terms of how incredibly toxic the community is. this is not a healthy playerbase in the slightest. take a look at the forums if you want evidence to that, for some reason the entire concept of pve is contentious to both the developers and a broad amount of those that still play this game...to the point where any given discussion is privy to turn into a ""pve vs pvp"" """"""""debate"""""""" with very loose and thinly veiled passive aggression. the bad blood between players in this game is thicker than oatmeal.

other than all of that though, the game is fun. i just kind of wish they wouldnt be so insistent on making it a live service game",1697296382,1706436421,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

-Graphics are stunning for the most part, especially the sea. Characters do look goofy but thats not a bad thing.

-Pve is fun at first 100-200 hours or so but gets repetitive after a while.

-Gold system is just stupid. I've bought everything in the game and still have millions of gold and thousands of dubloons just sitting there with nothing to spend them on. They need to balance it more. either add more stuff to buy, make it more expensive or decrease the loot you gain.

-To basically summarize the pve, there are 7 emmissary companies in this game. They will give you quests and bonuses on the items you sell if you're sailing with their emmisary flag.

EMMISARIES

Gold Hoarders.
They give you treasure hunt quests where you gotta dig up stuff from random islands. That's all they used to do until they introduced the vaults in a recent update. Vaults are a lot more fun. You gotta put together the map for a key then go to a specific island where the key will unlock a cave. You will see a lot of gold and chests laying around in there but those are just a distraction. Your main goal will be to get the Chest of Tributes by collecting madallions and entering the correct sequence to open sesame as it were.
They only give you bonus for treasure chests and small collectibles like chalices and ornate cups and whatnot.

Merchants.
Most boring emmisary of all. Just delivering cargos from one place to another. They give you bonus for selling cargo items like sugar, tea etc.

Order of Souls.
Basically a skeleton killing faction. They give you bounties to kill some skeleton captains and they will give you a bonus for selling them their skull. There's also ghost fleets which are much more fun and giving bigger rewards.
They only give you bonus for selling skulls.

Reapers.
The ''pvp'' faction of adventure mode. I just call them garbage collectors of this game because they will give you bonus for literally everything. Anything you got you thought was worthless, they will buy it. They buy everything. They dont give you any quests. There are a couple items that you can only sell to them. Reapers Chest and Reapers Bounty but beware these chests are cursed and their positions are revealed on the map. So other players may see you. If you're flying reaper emissary flag they will see you. BUT, if you reach level 5 emmisary you will be able to see other emmisaries on the map to hunt them down. You get really good money for selling broken emmisary flags of those people you sank.

The reason I said ''pvp'' faction is because a lot of reaper players are known to just run soon as they see you. Yes. It's supposed mean ''hey guys, you can see us on the map, we're up for some pvp, come get us'' but they raise it to get more money from the items they sell and just keep doing pve.

Don't raise reaper if you're gonna run from the first ship you see. If you get sunk, they will be toxic to you naturally and you will deserve it because you made them waste an hour chasing you down.

Hunters.
Fishermen. You can fish in this game and sell your fish to these guys at any seapost. Best way to level up on hunters is to save your gems to sell it to them only(you can sell gems to everyone pretty much). It's a lot more xp and gold than fishin.

Athena.
The emmisary you unlock by reaching pirate legend. Pretty boring voyages and overrated rewards. I was disappointed. It was supposed to be some big endgame company where it'd be fun stuff but its meh.


WORLD EVENTS

These are where you enjoy some of the best of pve this game can offer. Rewards are pretty huge compared to regular emmisary voyages.


Ashen Winds.
Boss on an island. Decent rewards, you also get a unique cool flamethrower skull that you can sell for 10k. Not bad.

Skeleton Fleet.
Probably the most challanging pve i'd say. Especially if you're in a small ship. But the loot haul is pretty big. Fastest way to level up your emmisary flag because of the high quantity of items you'll get.

Active Forts.
Skeleton waves and then a boss. You get decent loot.

Fort of the Damned.
Biggest loot haul you can get from this game. But beware, people will try to steal it from you. This is the number 1 event every server hopper can dream of. It's the main attraction for pvp. Really the most fun thing to do/steal in adventure mode.

-------------------------

PVP.

Now for the best part of this game, PVP. It gives you a pleasure that other pvp games can't. It's just a really unique experience battling it out as pirates. I don't even do any pve anymore it's all about pvp.

I'll see if I can summarize the key parts of it, but oh boy it's beautifully complicated.

-There's the naval part where you have to out-manuever your enemy. You have to stay out of their broadside while try to get them in your broadside while they're doing the same thing. It's not just a spinning battle where both ships constantly fire at eachother like in the Caribbean movies. There's unique moves you can pull off with harpoon turning, anchor turning, adjusting sails to surprise your enemy. Having a good captain will make all the difference between winning or losing a battle.

-Cannons. Different types of cannonballs for different purposes, regular cannons to put some holes in, cursed balls with million different (and very useful) purposes, firebombs to put their ship ablaze, blunderbombs to damage players knock them back from repairing. and in my opinion the best type is the chainshots to knock their mast down. Because soon as you're unable to move, you're done. You will just be sitting ducks for the volley of cannonfire soon to follow. Having a good gunner who hits their shots in good sequence will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.

-Repairing. Every crew needs a good bilge rat who makes sure that the ship is in top shape. You can't just ignore the holes in your ship to do anything else like boarding or shooting. Not sinking yourself is the priority. Worry about sinking your enemy later. A good bilge rat in your crew will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.

-Boarding. Without a doubt the most fun thing to do in this game. Boarding other people and killing them. 1 boarder who can put the enemy's anchor down and keep them busy just for a little while is usually good enough to win a battle. You dont even have to really kill them usually. Because as they are busy with the boarder, the other crew member will continue putting the pressure with cannonfire and putting more holes. They won't be able to really focus on repair while they have an active boarder.

On the other hand, as fun as it is, too much boarding can be the downfall of a bad crew. Disorganized, if you send too many boarders and they either miss the target or die without doing significant damage, you will be severely undermanned in your own ship to survive the enemy's cannonfire or boarders. I've seen people just all abandoning their ship with holes in it to board ours, we just kill them and theres nobody left to repair them. Come on people. Take care of your ship. Your ship must come first.

There's so much more to it than I can fit in this review. Really a rich game with a vast world. It's well worth buying at full price. A must buy if you're really into pirate's life. One thing I must say though, you gotta play it with friends. x10 more fun. Solo sailing can be painful and usually gets boring really fast.",1706434109,1706434421,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However, after coming across the community forums and seeing the behaviour of the mods (very BAD behaviour to see from a community ""moderator"" who can't moderate their own personal feelings) and how it ""aligns"" with the thoughts of feelings of those on the development team, We were all ABSOLUTELY disgusted.. 

It was the first time any of us had checked the community threads, to find that mods and those from the development team were of the mind that ""Although we've begrudgingly given you a PVE mode, that we never wanted to give you, and claimed as our own because ""no one"" has asked for it"".. and ""If you don't like playing PVP, just get good at the game or play something else!"".. I'm not even exaggerating, they're blatantly said those kind of things.. and belittled their community members and customers.. 

We are NOT AT ALL interested in playing SoT anymore after seeing this disgusting behaviour, and do NOT AT ALL recommend Sea Of Thieves, save your money instead! Otherwise it will support this kind of toxic and absolutely disgusting behaviour from these mods and development teams, they had stickied a thread with an ultimatum (honestly, more like a threat) in the community threads that is NO LONGER THERE, big surprise there, after having a plethora of the community coming out with positive ways they could better the community forums and interact with members and customers alike, pointing out specific comments and behaviours from moderators and how they could have better continued discussions etc, creating a more positive space and limiting the trolls and negative themes as best as possible while finding a nice middle ground.

The thread was basically along the lines of ""If you (the community) doesn't change your behaviour and stop abusing our mods, we are going to close the community board completely and you'll have to use OUR forum where we can continue to remove your posts because it doesn't align with our vision or arguments (they did this on the steam discussion threads to 'control' the narrative and stop anyone from having an opinion that didn't align with theirs), OR we will simply remove ourselves and leave the moderation up to steam moderators, so fuck y'all!"" (the later seeming to be what they've done).. Whereas it was THEIR  moderators that were closing perfectly fine threads asking questions and abusing their moderation powers on the community boards, so that people couldn't actually have discussions or ask questions, or question why decisions were made, these ""moderators"" couldn't keep their own emotions out of their responses and came across snarky, arrogant, conceited to name a few.. choosing instead to abuse, insult and belittle their own community.. It's an absolute shit show.

TLDR; DON'T BUY THE GAME, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT TOXIC AS FUCK DEVELOPERS LIKE THOSE FROM RARE WHO INSULT, MANIPULATE AND BLATANTLY THREATEN THEIR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND CUSTOMERS WHO PLAY THEIR GAMES, THEY DON'T CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE PLAYING THE GAME, OR ABOUT YOU OR ANYONE ELSE, THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY.

With over 1,000 hours sailing the high seas, this captain has a few things to tell ye poor landlubbers about yer inquiry into whether ye have the grit and gumption to become a pirate lord and legend.. or just an unheard of washed up turd, upon the banks of Chicken Isle.

One thing ye must learn and ye must learn quickly my young pirate protege.. is that ye must never hold on to yer treasure too tightly. Now.. don't get me wrong, ye want to defend yer booty with every ounce of courage and battle brave bravado ye can muster.. lest yer booty be plundered by some drooling dollard licking their lips as they parade their piratey hands upon it! But be forewarned.. Many a cowardly cohort with tail tucked between legs has gone awash in the glow of galleon fire and become cannon fodder not only on the sea, but in the ocean of their mind!

Ye must understand that to win a battle is something that is hard won with time, practice and patience. Ye don't go becoming a pirate legend in a day lad! And sometimes the battle of the mind is the fiercest one with what ye must contend! The sea rewards those who spend time with her, learning her ways.. just like the ways of yer vessel.. not to mention the ways of combat and cunning, of which you'll need both! But sometimes winning is realizing when you've lost.. and to carry on.. head held high, knowing next time.. you'll get those greedy and grimey gobshite grabbers that took yer loot with a fierce and fiery vengeance and nothing to lose!

The only advantage an old pirate has in this world besides some fancy threads or livery is understanding. With time comes knowledge, and with knowledge.. understanding.. understanding when to make friend and when to make holes! Ye may wonder when trying to make friends as a young captain, why so many seem to run away in sheer terror at yer seemingly friendly advances.. Well all I can say is that you'll learn young sailor. My advice is to meet adversity head on and with a calm and keen head on yer shoulders, to meet those that would be hailed as advocates with an open heart.. but a watchful eye! After all.. this is the Sea of Thieves, not Sea of Friends!

And last of all, the adventures that await ye both in terms of what the sea and islands have to offer, as well as the encounters ye may or may not have seeing other pirate players on any given voyage.. will shape the game in unknown and unexpected ways almost every time. Ye must be ready for anything! or.. not much at all.

One final noteworthy mention.. it's much better to sail with a crew, even if that crew must be chosen over time from yer maiden voyages.. sailing with random slobbering rum drinking drivel until ye find a trustworthy first mate and quartermaster. Sailing the seas alone is a nasty business, although some lone and desperate souls may prefer it. Regardless, I wish ye all fair winds and following seas my hopeful pirate pals!",1706413284,1706413284,True,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

This piscatorial challenge, which seemed almost impossible at first, turned into a thrilling journey that left me both frustrated and exhilarated.

The quest for this mysterious fish began like any other – casting my line into the vast, shimmering sea and patiently waiting for a bite. Little did I know that I was about to face a piscine adversary that would push me to the limits of my angling prowess.

Hours turned into days as I navigated the treacherous waters, chasing rumors and tales of the mythical fish that had eluded many seasoned pirates before me. The excitement and frustration mounted with every missed catch, each fleeting glimpse of a shimmering tail leaving me more determined to succeed.

The turning point came when I stumbled upon a secret fishing spot, hidden in the uncharted corners of the Sea of Thieves. The atmosphere changed, the air charged with anticipation as I cast my line into the depths. The reel whirred as the line tugged violently – I was locked in a fierce battle with the legendary fish.

The struggle was intense, as the elusive creature danced beneath the waves, testing the strength of my rod and the endurance of my patience. It was a game of skill and strategy, a dance between hunter and hunted that played out against the backdrop of the vast, open sea.

As the battle raged on, I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins. The sea spray, the creaking of my ship, and the distant calls of seagulls all faded into the background as my focus narrowed on the challenge at hand. Time seemed to stretch as I fought with unwavering determination.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the legendary fish emerged from the depths. It was a sight to behold – a magnificent, otherworldly creature that glistened in the sunlight. My heart raced as I carefully reeled it in, savoring the sweet taste of victory.

Conquering this seemingly impossible fish in Sea of Thieves was a defining moment in my pirate's journey. The thrill of the chase, the heart-stopping battles, and the ultimate triumph made it an experience worth every ounce of effort. The elusive fish may have been a formidable foe, but the satisfaction of adding its glorious trophy to my collection was unparalleled. In the world of Sea of Thieves, where the seas are teeming with challenges and hidden treasures, this elusive fish stands as a symbol of perseverance and the sweet taste of victory for those bold enough to seek it out.",1706404353,1706404353,True,4,0,0.534418582916259766,0,True,False,False

Back to the grind.

*Leaving the review all the same, but just know it's a recommend now with PvE.*

Game is utter garbage- just the fact that so many players hack the shit out of the fucking game and never get banned, on top of the fact that there is so much grief from people in this game just being complete fucking pieces of shit,

*JUST A FEW THINGS PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO ME WHILE ME BEING UTTER FRIENDLY TRYING TO MAKE ALLIANCES*
""Fuck your mom.""
""I'll kill your family.""
""I know where you live and can come kill you.""

Yeah, I had a fucking full sloop of 3 Captain's Chests, 2 Skeleton Captain's Chests, 7 Sapphires, 3 Emeralds, 1 Ruby and a few other trace things inside treasure chests and 1 Seafarers's Chest, and SOMEHOW, while I am HIDING COMPLETELY BEHIND Thief's Haven (SO IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO EVEN HAVE KNOWN I WAS THERE) a fucking Galleon (or whatever the biggest ship is called) full of people naming off MORE THAN HALF of my fucking loot and chests onboard my ship, all while laughing like they were from an insane asylum, ""WE'RE COMING TO GET YOU!!!"", not only IMPOSSIBLY CATCH UP TO ME WHILE THEY'RE AGAINST THE WIND, but are able to shoot me with PERFECT AIM from their own ship.

UNLESS THEY FIX THIS WITH SOME KIND OF PRIVATE SERVER OR EVEN CREDIT ME MY FUCKING GOLD FOR ALL MY LOOT I LOST IN THE MOST BULLSHIT, IMPOSSIBLE WAY IMAGINABLE, THIS GAME IS GARBAGE. Utter garbage.

You want to get good at pvp before season 11: u would work your ass off constantly getting sunk trying to learn how to quick swap and double gun knowing when u finally do get it, its both satisfying and it feels u have won the fight and that u deserve the rewards and loot.

Now its beyond boring and not to mention none of the curses or becoming a pirate legend mean anything anymore when alliance servers exist constantly with 0 work on the devs side to prevent toxic alliance servers bulling players into leaving the seas but will ban people who try prevent the alliance servers and take them down.

I want to feel like a pirate when playing this game not someone sailing the empty sees only to see ships duck and dive away from combat using teleport to island objectives rather than playing the game. if u wanna do stuff where u don't wanna get sunk play safer sees.

You're forced into your Xbox gamer tag and as a result I've been:

1. stream sniped while streaming this game
2. called repeatedly while being chased by the same people calling me repeatedly
3. searched in other places and harassed

When I complained to Microsoft/Xbox support about this when I changed my gamertag to hide my identity because of this game I was just told to stop streaming it or accept the risk of being harassed in and out of the platform. The Sea of Thieves and Rare LTD Twitter accounts blocked me for some pre-emptive reason I never knew why.

The developers at some point were talking about more peaceful or PvE servers that they never actually implemented and basically showed a middle finger to anyone, who actually awaited for private servers and the more casual fun of this game. Truth is there's no real casual fun in it to have and even PvP players get bored fast. Servers are emptying fast and you get constantly bounced into another one so you can't even enjoy a simple solo time on a server without trolls.

The only think this game has going for me is some of the fun game mechanics and graphics and that's about it. I'm not aversed on PvP or toxic ""team mates"", but if I spend hours on end at once to a game I don't want them in my game.

Trying to do the tall tales that they put in there is almost impossible due to the amount of people who just don't care and continue to troll you. 

For the casual player its not a good game. But if you have a constant group of friends it might be alright. Don't expect to make any money if you can't get around the PVP aspect. Don't expect to do any of the story without constantly being harassed. 

The gameplay itself is amazing. The graphics are very good and what content I could play is awesome. (The pirates chapter 1 and the maiden voyage are PVE only). I will continue to try  but no I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore until they put in PvE servers or they implement some way to stop people from constantly sinking you (like a PvE shield).

Not everything is perfect, of course. Hit registration can be wonky as hell, and about 50% of the game is sailing across open seas to actually get to the treasure. However, overall, the amount of pride and hard work that has been put into this game shine through. If you don't like dealing with people, you can even play on private servers now. As with most always online games, the experience is going to vary based on who you encounter. As I said already though, the game is good and keeps getting better every update.

Rare has truly created a masterpiece that goes beyond being just a game – it's an adventure, a playground, and a canvas for unforgettable moments.

The vast open world is a sight to behold, with its stunning visuals and dynamic weather system that adds a layer of immersion rarely seen in other titles. From the moment you set sail, you'll find yourself entranced by the beauty of the seas, the lush islands, and the thrill of discovering hidden treasures. The attention to detail is simply awe-inspiring.

What sets Sea of Thieves apart is its emphasis on player interaction. Whether you're sailing solo or with a crew of friends, the game fosters a sense of camaraderie and shared excitement. The collaborative nature of ship navigation, treasure hunting, and battling other pirates creates a dynamic and ever-changing environment. I've made lasting memories from epic naval battles to impromptu dance parties on the deck – it's the unpredictability that keeps me coming back for more.

The progression system is well-balanced, allowing players to unlock cosmetics and upgrades without compromising the level playing field. It ensures that even new players can enjoy the full scope of the game without feeling overwhelmed. The regular updates from the developers, introducing new content, events, and challenges, demonstrate Rare's commitment to keeping the Sea of Thieves experience fresh and engaging.

Moreover, the community is one of the friendliest I've encountered in an online game. Whether you're seeking allies for a mighty fleet or looking for rivals in a daring duel, you're bound to find like-minded pirates eager to share the seas with you. The developers have successfully fostered a positive and inclusive environment that encourages cooperation and friendly competition.

In conclusion, Sea of Thieves is a triumph in the world of multiplayer gaming. Its combination of breathtaking visuals, engaging gameplay, and a vibrant community make it a must-play for anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable gaming experience. So, hoist the anchor, set sail, and embark on an adventure that will leave you with stories to tell for years to come!",1706281412,1706281412,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

They’ve added story based quests known as tall tales and recently have started a second story in the tall tales. There is also exstensive lore.  You can fish or hunt animals, kill krakens, fight skeleton ships, or kill megalodons. You can explore regions such as the shores of plenty a carribean like place, the wilds a more stormy and darker version of the shores of plenty, the ancient isles a old region of the map with exstensive lore and huge islands, the devil’s roar- a fiery tempered place full of volcanoes and earthquakes, and finally if you do the last tall tale you can have access to the lucrative shores of gold the biggest island in the game with huge chunks of lore and a lush environment filled with deadly traps, a skeleton lore known as the GOLD HOARDER a wicked skeleton held together by gold and lust for riches, and as the mighty pirate lore would say A GREAT BIG PILE OF TREASURE! There are also pets in the game but those cost money or if you play the game for a while skeletons might show up that carry this elusive currency known as ancient coins which buy you pets. If pvp is what you want head over to the arena where you and other ships compete for treasure and get into constant battles. They’ve also added a tutorial known as maiden voyage for new players which (if the search hard enough and do some challenges) can give you some gold doubloons(used to buy from the bilge rats) and some ship cosmetics. There are also fun challenges in the game givin by the bilge rats who are wild and carefree like sit in thrones made of bones, shoot skeletons carrying gunpowder, find Easter eggs, and carry chests of rage.

I was aware that there is only 30% reward, but you can only level up to level 40, then it stops. Most items are not available in the safe sea, and many options are not available. Many misssons are simply blocked. I can accept that PVP players should get some sort of reward and trophy, BUT to exclude PVE so much is not ok, the safer sea mode just feels like a mode they introduced just so they can say ""we did something"" ""wait, you don't want to farm for hours and then get killed?"". Too bad for you. 
The mode makes you feel like you're worth less as a player (not as a human), like ""You don't have time for the awesome PVP mode we have or you're just not interested in it? Then just play with the leftovers in the dirt"" As I said, I can live with fewer rewards BUT as the Safer Sea mode is at the moment (26.01.2024), it is not recommended.Rar probably saw that they weren't getting any new players and were targeting the PVE faction and so they quickly slapped something together without effort and as unsatisfactorily as possible.by the time you realise all this, you probably can't return the game and they have your money.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Mouds disappears again soon because it's ""underused"".  A rogue who thinks evil. 
Maybe 4 more years have to go by before the mode feels fully-fledged and fun. Now technical things I don't like. The aiming system, why don't the weapons have sights? It's not like it would destroy the game world and atmosphere of the game. Sights have been around as long as firearms themselves. The next point is navigation, why can't I have a map on my deck when I'm at the helm? That you have to set the course at the table is fine, but can't I just have a board with the markings on it?  It should be my choice if that spoils the atmosphere or not, even Skyrim and many other medieval games have that. The next thing that bothers me is the thing with digging up chests on islands. You sometimes search for ages to find the chest, couldn't they just introduce a sound when you get close to it? It gets louder the closer you are and quieter the further away you are. For all those who want to play here in peace and quiet, the game as it is at the moment is unfortunately still nothing.  Very Disapointing

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
+ Great with Friends (Total of 4 crew members on the largest ship, including yourself).
+ Plenty to do (Quests, Treasure Maps for that Looty Booty, Fishing, PVE Plundering).
+ PVE is actually rather entertaining and rewarding.
+ Large map. Plenty of islands, outposts & secrets to find and explore.
+ Safer Seas so you could go into a private session to do Tall Tales or get to know the game mechanics.
+ Guilds. Allows 24 players to join & work together to gain additional rewards. Also allows ship sharing.
+ A few different ships for different crew sizes.
+ Variety of tools, weapons & ammo types to utilise.
+ Customisation options for both the ship & player. 
+ Pets (Dogs, Cats, Foxes, Parrots, Monkeys). Plus, if you can afford to spare the ancient coins, outfits for the pets.
+ Sea Shanties. Need I say more?

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- PVP in all areas. I've been attacked at sea, spawn camped on my own boat, ambushed at an outpost where I was trying to sell my haul of loot & tricked with the ""Alliance"" System. There is no passive zones, or passive mode upon spawn with a ""x"" amount of time before you start taking damage again, which is rather annoying.
- Sea of Thieves has a rather crappy community, some people will avoid you or be nice to you, but most will try to kill you just for sport & the slim chance of loot. I've spent 30mins in a session, just fishing & chilling, winding down after a busy day & people have literally killed me for fish. Fish for crying out loud, which can barely get you 1K gold!
- Useless reporting system. Can't report racism, griefing or any type of harassment without a video of it happening. Most reports without that get ignored.
- Less enjoyable by your lonesome. It's not terrible, it's just better with friends.
- Safer Seas (Private Sessions) have a slight waiting time to them & aren't as rewarding as normal sessions. (Gold gains are reduced significantly, no emissaries & level gains are capped).
- Guilds are a thing, but being able to set sail with multiple crewed ships on the same server from one guild, from my knowledge, hasn't been implemented. 
If you have more than 3 friends that you want to play Sea of Thieves with, in the same server, be prepared to do 20Mins+ of Server Hopping.
- Requires a XBOX / Microsoft Account.

[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]
Generally, I do believe this game is pretty awesome, as for 6 months I've come back continuously to sink time into it. But while communities can often make games, in the case of Sea of Thieves, it can also break them. I've played solo & with friends, I've joined random people via the official discord & met some really cool people on the high seas. However, these cool people are far & few between.
Rare makes it more rewarding for people to be douches towards each other & that for me is quite annoying because I often play to chill out, not compete with others for loot that I've already worked hard for.

So all in all, if you're reading this review, I'd say this game is worth buying, but only if you've got friends to play with & whilst it's on a 33% Discount or more.",1688537379,1706266620,True,99,0,0.739584863185882568,0,True,False,False

When 'safer seas' was released, I hoped it would be enjoyable as a solo player, to explore and relax, sailing and discovering. 
Some people do enjoy the game solo, PvP being an aspect that is fun for them. 

However, I am not able to think and move fast enough to survive in PVP - and unfortunately most encounters I've had sailing and exploring are not relaxing. 
Not all modes are playable for me due to other players who think it is enjoyable to destroy your ship and kill you / steal for fun.

If an offline single player mode was available, I would enjoy the game.
I followed this game from launch and waited to see if the developers would provide an option to sail and explore in singleplayer.
As an alternative, an option to be able to host a local private server would also be welcomed.

The progress speed for completing the available 'safer seas' aspects are massively restricted - by a 70% reduction in rewards.
If in the future a true offline singleplayer option is offered, and/or a private/offline/local server becomes available, then I may revisit this game.

Great potential, looks to be fun for those people who 'grief' others, but not enjoyable for me.

Firstly I would suggest when you start playing this game for the first time play with friend it will make the game way more fun and you can learn the easier then solo. The reason why I say that is because it is hard to play solo (Depending what you are doing but most of the time it is hard). I would like to also add that if you are buying this game and have no friends to play with or friends that don't have the game you can still have fun again it might be harder but there is a story mode which is fun to play. 

Which brings me to the second thing I would like to put in this review. The story mode is good i mean its not like crazy to me but my friends did really enjoy it if you are a big Pirates of the Caribbean fan like my friends i'm sure you will love it.

Thirdly the game it self is super fun open world game. You collect gold and kill ghosts and shit for rewards and you level up and unlock new crazy shit (warning you will have to grind for some things

PLEASE READ: Lastly is that some.... most of the negative reviews I feel like are just people who are bitches. I get the people talking about the hacks that is a problem and if they put a negative review because of hacks I'm fine with that. But if you are getting mad over being sunk, I'm sorry but your just a bitch who is getting mad over the player not the game. There is no reason to write a negative review because you died by a player that's not the games fault.

There is nothing for the veterans to do but hunt down the poor new players, so combat is extremely uneven.

However, the game is entirely session based so all the supplies and treasures you gather are gone as soon as you leave the game unless you manage to sell or deliver them. Only purchased cosmetics are really saved for the next session. The game is mostly just sailing from point A to point B then back to point A. Rinse and repeat. The events and quests are repetitive and more generic than following all the random maps and solving riddles on the side. Also add in the fact that you are not allowed to enjoy just sailing and looking for buried treasures because everything is PVP. 

No joke, the first time I played, I couldn't sail from one island to another without being attacked and sunk. People camp and demolish you before you can even get going. Doesn't matter if you have anything on board or that you fly peaceful flags or that you openly announce that you are not interested in fighting. They sink you and you have to try again. I spent almost my entire game time killing other players in self defense or being killed. 

The only time I enjoyed myself was when the server was empty except for one or two other players. It was the one and only time I've experienced a session where all agreed we just wanted to be left alone to sail, hunt treasures and explore the map. I didn't even know there were more NPC enemies or bosses until then since I had never gotten far with all the homicidal campers around. Sadly, the game does not like empty servers. Too few players and you are automatically kicked to a server with more players. Which means back to running, fighting and not really accomplishing anything. The only sure way to make worthwhile progress is to play with several other people and form a large crew. A fact of the game I and many others do not agree with.

I know it will never happen because the developers of this game don't want to make it possible but, this game would be so much better if there were setting options to play offline or host private servers. Until that happens, this game gets a thumbs down and is going in the garbage.

UPDATE

So, now you can avoid the horrid pvp and solo. This is great and I tried it out for several hours. Props to the devs for finally listening to the fan base. However, I'm sorry to say that I will never play this game again. Why? On my first voyage to dig up a single treasure chest a measly one island over from port, I had: a skeleton ship pop up; a megalodon rise from the depths; 2 of those clam faced brutes that spew toxins; 5 normal skeletons; 3 ghosts; 2 regular sharks; 1 of those electric eel zombie pirate things; 3 red named skeleton captains; and there were cobras scattered all over the island. 

What. The. F#@%! 

I couldn't get the freaking treasure chest back to my ship without running a nightmare gauntlet and everything kept re-spawning! And, as if that weren't enough, a huge, 3 mast skeleton ship comes sailing around the corner to say, ""Waz up!"" just as I raise anchor to get the hell outta dodge! 

Great, we can solo to learn the mechanics and explore the actual game but seriously. There's really no limit on what type, how many or what level enemies are that can spawn around you? Even when you're only on your first quest after the tutorials? Also, it's not a matter of skill or anything. I survived and completed the quest so it's not as if I couldn't do it. The thing is, the entire experience was [u]not fun.[/u] Sorry, I love the idea of soloing a pirate game but this is ridiculous and not worth it. Back in the garbage you go Sea of Thieves and good riddance.",1631831876,1706170951,False,2,0,0.481873095035552979,0,True,False,False

personal - not recomend (i am pve player and solo)
overall - mixed
if you like doing pvp and some pve between battles or are playing with crew then i recommend
if you are playing solo or just want to pve/quest and don't want to be dogpiled on then i better hope you quickly learn how to evade/run away secesfully from every player ship that appears on horison
[edit after playing pve]
well, it better on all things i previously wrote, well, actualy previous things are irelevant in private sesion. 
new review since pve sesions:
personal - recomended
overal - recomend
if you like doing pvp and and pve on same sesion (crew is recomended) -  high seas
if you like doing pve and quests without random people interfearing - safer seas

The Safer Seas update that made PvE servers a thing has completely reshaped the game. I can finally fish in peace??? WTF????

Either you play on the High Seas and get PVP’d to death after spending hours trying to make a little money (and many times, getting killed with no treasure on you at all - just griefers) or you play the Safer Seas and your rewards are nerfed to hell. Either way, your time isn’t respected.

I’m not a bad player, I played back on Xbox when this game was for insiders only years ago. But I’m not an expert either. Sometimes you just want to log in and play for a few hours here and there with people, casually. Well, this game isn’t for that in my opinion.

An example - last night I was playing with 2 people. We got the Key of Siren Song, then went and got the treasure chest for it. Then got killed immediately when 2 ships showed up. They killed us (us 3 vs 7 or 8) and circled the chest repeatedly until we left. They didn’t even want the treasure, they just didn’t want us to have it. Very toxic.

And that’s just one instance of many over my years of playing this. The Safer Seas is cool, I guess, but it’s not the best option. There should be an option, like in GTA Online, where you’re still in the same lobby as everyone else, but you’re unable to attack/be attacked. You can still watch others battle, still encounter people, just can’t be griefed. That’s what I would have implemented.

A whole separate lobby by yourself with nothing going on and little reward seems overkill. We still want to encounter people and take part in events, we’d just like to do it more peacefully. If that can be achieved in a game as toxic as GTA Online, there’s no reason it can’t work here.",1706100376,1706100511,False,23,1,0.573326945304870605,0,True,False,False

So why am I downvoting it? Mainly because absolute sub-human scumbags play this game and there's no real way to escape them. If you're not in a crew with trustworthy people, you need to constantly be on the lookout while on land. And at sea, but that's another matter entirely, point is that if you're in the middle of doing something, especially a world event or Mermaid Shrine, people can and absolutely will destroy your ship while you're busy or wait for you to do all the hard work before doing so, ensuring they don't have to work for it while your efforts amount to absolutely nothing.

Yes, I know it's called 'Sea of Thieves', but it's no excuse for screwing people over just because you can. There are countless ways to get loot, making other people suffer because you're lazy is inexcusable.

SOT has changed a lot since then both in the good, the bad, and the ugly. seasons 1-7: great, Seasons 8 and 9: meh, season 10: made me not want to play the game anymore. Like I get it that not all players need the anxiety, and stress-inducing, players/reapers hounding them for hours (especially if you are a noob.). This game used to be fun and full of all walks of life. Now it's a hollow shell of what the game used to be. I have met a lot of cool and fun people who turned into great lifelong friendships. ( like from the glitter beard Easter egg).  I wish SOT and Rare would actually take the time to ask the community for input for the next update (besides the insider's program). This game used to be an absolute BLAST of a game. Now fresh players don't get the experience we the elder players had right out of the CANNON. the safer seas were a great idea on paper but not in reality. I know I will get some hate from new players, but this recent update has made me and my entire crew stop playing SOT altogether.  It's still a great game, it's just not as exciting as it once was. I will still recommend this game to friends and other people that I meet but I would give them a precaution.  I have SUNK hours into this game, but as of this review date, I have not played this game at all since the new update came out. SOT is still one of my top-tier games. Like I said above. I met a lot of cool people who all shared one thing in common,""let's have some fun!"". At least the new players get a better grasp of what the game is all about(mechanic-wise), they can then venture into the real world for some harder action than what the safer seas offer. I want to play this game but as of recently non of my cremates want to play, as my option is fairly similar to theirs, "" Screw the new update it made the game full of sweats!"" My buddy Esany

Raids have zero respect for the time spent both unlocking them to begin with and then actually completing whatever challenge you chose. You will get about 5 pieces of loot regardless of the challenge or time investment, and it won't be particularly valuable loot either, just the bare minimum of whatever company you dove for. 

Voyages and random events seem mostly the same with only a few getting touch ups to not be totally worthless, though much of the 'rare' loot said to appear in these updated ones is rare enough that it's not really any more worthwhile to do them.

The Fleet of Fortune is just... a normal skelly fleet, with a chest of fortune. No other special loot to incentivize players to get it.

The update is mindbogglingly buggy and my Reputation will constantly drop and shoot back up at random, radials will often break, and several issues with captaincy commendations and milestones are still present after several updates.

If I had my way I'd suggest that players pay up some gold/doubloons to spawn world events and the loot of the event then changes based on whatever Emissary happens to finish the event, actually encouraging people to fight over them to get the most profit possible by having their team 'win' by completing the event, and not just waiting to ambush the person who does. But alas, that is not the reality we live in.

This 'overhaul' of the voyage system, events, and trading companies has been a serious letdown and I'd be shocked if player counts don't drop back down to whatever they were prior to the update, or even lower. Not without some serious changes on Rare's behalf at least, as currently this speaks of Devs with either not enough resources, community understanding, or care to make something that actually grips players beyond shiny new cosmetics.

PvEers who want to guild and farm Athena, and the toxic PvPing Reapers that infest High Seas and are proven to be more toxic than League of Legends, Dead by Daylight, or Dota 2 players. Let that sink in for a moment.

Safer Seas could have been the haven for PvE guilders, but no. The devs capped gold gain to 30%, rep to level 40 in any company, and disabled progress for capitancy, disabling having capitained ships at all, and you can't grind Athena at all even though it is literally designed for a PvE Guilded environment with how long it takes to level and farm emmisary for. It's basically just for chilling, commendation farming, and grinding gold since you can't earn any in High Seas anyway unless you want to deal with what is essentially people playing unofficial Ranked 24/7. Also, it still has an AFK timeout, because that was totally necessary in a solo experience. Now that the next season is viewable, you also can't grind for the prestige levels in here. Again, missed opportunity in favor of meatgrinding people for the PvPers. Garbage.

High Seas has everything enabled and at 100%, but you won't get any progress in anything because this is where the scumbag instasinkers/griefers/campers/returners (returning to where they died/sank to continue to hunt you until they win, it's annoying) hunt everyone (even other Reapers) down endlessly, and they've only gotten more and more toxic and kill-on-sight with every passing season. 

Thus, about like 75% of the content of the game is actually playable in Safer Seas (aka AT ALL), and all the fun bells and whistles are getting given to the most toxic part of the playerbase that doesn't care about them. Even the ""Adventures"" are in High Seas, and the PvEers are forced to grind EVEN MORE with the safer seas gold reduction, it's... all just so very dumb. 5/10 because only half the intended experience actually remains in Safer Seas.",1611105994,1706030822,False,0,0,0.47763901948928833,0,True,False,False

The seas, once teemin' with life and excitement, now be feelin' the chill of a ghostly wind, as the developers have made decisions that would make even the fiercest pirate scratch their head.

In their pursuit of shiny coins from the Pirate Emporium, the devs have cast a shadow over the once-glorious seas. Fast travel now be a curse upon the waves, robbin' us of the thrill of a long sail. Aye, they've given in to the temptations of convenience, allowin' any scallywag to whisk themselves away to their quests with a mere snap of their fingers. The very essence of piracy – the sea breeze in yer hair, the creakin' of the ship, and the anticipation of the horizon – be vanishing like a ghost ship into the fog.

But that be not the end of the tale, me hearties. The Pirate Emporium be overflowin' with trinkets and baubles, enticin' newcomers with promises of grandeur while neglectin' the seasoned sailors who've weathered the storms. And mark me words, the seas be feelin' emptier than a deserted isle, for these newfangled fast travel shenanigans be temptin' pirates to abandon ship, leavin' their loot behind and seekin' refuge in a different server.

The PvP heart of Sea of Thieves, the very essence of the Pirate's life, be sufferin'. Events be poppin' up like mushrooms after a storm, and the once-thriving PvP Reaper's Alliance be feelin' the brunt of this change. The social fabric of the seas be torn, and the joy of meetin' fellow pirates in the vast expanse be replaced with a grindin' monotony.

And as if a ship without a compass, the game's performance be takin' a hit, with hit registration as reliable as a drunken sailor tryin' to walk a plank. The developers be fixated on stockin' the Emporium with trinkets to lure in fresh blood, while old hands be left with naught but the bitter taste of disappointment.

Sea of Thieves, once a beacon of promise on the gaming horizon, be now a ship adrift in turbulent waters. Rare, oh Rare, ye be leadin' us down a treacherous path, where the thrill of adventure be replaced with the drudgery of a never-endin' grind.

The community was alienated for so long, with no valid updates for over a year, they let the gameplay get boring. Even after a whole new season with updates, all they did was split the players into two separate versions- ""safer seas"", where you're the only crew on the server, and the regular mode. 

When your player count is this low, being able to turn off cross-platform will alienate your players, having a separate PVP mode where you literally leave the map will alienate your players, private servers will alienate your players. When you have more people WATCHING Sea of Thieves on a BoxyFresh stream than actually PLAYING it on Steam, there's a huge issue. 

The problem is that we all love the game, but you can't figure out how to keep your players to PLAY, and even less, keep them engaged. The game is incredibly good, but it relies on other players playing with you to do so.

Outside of that, ships steer like the real-deal, drift in high wind, and stay away from squalls!  Weapon choices are very basic but each fun.  Sword (default) and flintlock pistol, blunderbuss, or rifle (eye of reach) are the basics you choose from, can switch on boat or at weapon smith.  You can sail around fighting to get drop quests, take on quests from the different people (gold hoarders, merchants, etc...) or even go around just in PVP mode.  Ship battles are quite fun but take time, if you have never shot a real weapon, as you have to lead your target with cannons.  Depending on what ammo you are using, it may be slower flight path so you have to wait way ahead all while your ship is bobbing up & down too.

Resource gathering really isn't that big of an issue, things auto-replenish on islands or can be found easy enough.  Quests start out easy enough and get progressively harder but the rewards scale up on each as well.  Don't spend your money outright on silly things, they're just cosmetic, does not change accuracy, or anything like that.  You'll want to save up to 250k coins to buy a Sloop (cheapest) boat so you have a named + captained boat vs. having to charter one.

Take wide berths on parking/dropping anchor at islands or you'll be repairing and bucketing a lot.  Also, when it rains, you'll need to to go bucket as well.  You'll know when it is time, your ship will slow down even in full sail.

• Stunning seascapes: The world of Sea of Thieves is a visual feast. Sun-kissed islands, treacherous reefs, and mesmerizing sunsets will draw you in and keep you captivated.
• good combat: From sword-clanging duels to cannon barrages, combat is visceral and thrilling. Coordinating with your crew to sail, fight, and mend the ship makes for some truly epic moments.
• Evolving content: Rare hasn't been sitting idle. New Tall Tales, world events.
• storytelling: The best stories in Sea of Thieves aren't scripted, they're forged in the fires of player interaction. A tense standoff with another crew, a daring heist, or a shared voyage filled with laughter - these are the memories that truly stick.



Cons:
• Repetitive core gameplay: While the world is vast, the core activities like fetching skulls or digging up chests can get repetitive after a while.
• Solo sailing struggles: While doable, Sea of Thieves truly shines with a crew. Solo players can feel stranded and vulnerable, especially against coordinated galleons.
• Grindy progression: Reaching Pirate Legend, the ultimate goal, takes a hefty investment of time. The lack of meaningful skill or power unlocks can feel demotivating for some.
• PvP: While player interaction adds spice, toxic encounters with griefers can sour the experience, especially for new players",1703018252,1705933291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world is expansive. There is enough content for me to play for hundreds of hours and still have things I haven't seen or explored. I enjoyed the combat system, though as someone who plays on a laptop, it can be difficult to compete with more experienced players when I encounter a host of microstutters. The story mode (Tall Tales) is also quite fun! You travel to places inaccessible in the normal game, and the crossover with Pirates of the Caribbean was fantastic! Especially for someone who splits my time fairly evenly between playing by myself and playing with friends, having something I could do that didn't put me at risk of getting stomped by a larger crew was a refreshing option. 

With that being said, as has been reiterated in many reviews, don't play this game entirely solo. It is, put simply, not nearly as fun or engaging when you aren't chatting in VC, cracking jokes and having a good time. There is a heavy focus on activities that are best done with a crew, and you'll feel far more immersed in the game when you have a few friends at your side! This is also not a game for people who can't pick themselves back up after getting griefed. You WILL lose your loot, get spawn-killed, outclassed, etc. If you find yourself getting very angry or frustrated when your hard-won loot gets stolen, you will likely find this game difficult to get into. Lastly, I want to highlight performance. This game does RUN on lower-end PCs/laptops, but the difference in performance between those and higher-end setups is MASSIVE. I've had plenty of experience playing games at low FPS, so this doesn't particularly bother me, but if you play on a relatively poor gaming setup, this game will likely be difficult to enjoy, from lag spikes to a lack of optimization when it comes to massive items counts, etc. There are also some bugs that have seemingly been ignored by the development team, such as your vessel flipping over randomly and sinking. 

Overall, I've enjoyed the game a lot, but I recognize that it isn't for everyone, and that it has its flaws. I would still recommend it, but there are a few caveats. Solid 8/10!",1705881689,1705881689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rare (Developer) has made some poor choices in my opinion with the games infrastructure like allowing all levels to join to safer seas, I understand the concept for newer players being able to learn the game, but being able to grind Gold curse without dealing with reapers and other idiots just looking to sink someone without anything takes away from the difficulty of spending 40+ hours needed for the curse. I would be more in favour if they balanced safer seas more.

On a more positive side the game will always be my go to. From being able to change what your doing every match to grinding out levels the game offers so much, and even at 400 hours at the moment I'm still learning so much everyday. be open to learning new things/skills within the game. Pirate legend is easily accomplished with 2 months of casual play. Looking back even when I hit Pirate legend I still see a noob, with minimal knowledge of the game. 

Sometimes, the game will drive you nuts, like seeing a Shrouded ghost for the first time, all just for it instantly disappear and never see one again since.

Long-session pirate sandbox with (often high-stakes) PvP, steep learning curve and a high skill ceiling.
On paper, that sounds like a disaster to me, but somehow I keep coming back - and I'm still loving it. There's a lot of fun to be had in the PvE content.

The PvP [strike]Arena mode[/strike] (RIP) matchmaking via the faction hourglass is pretty average, just one ship against another with the sole goal of sinking the opposing vessel, doesn't match the scrapped Arena mode for me but the devs have explained this shift.

Emergent PvP in Adventure mode is a mixed bag - its mere presence adds a bit of thrill to many parts of the game and smashing other crews who thought they'd sink you is a great time. On the other hand, it can be rough for new players to keep getting demolished while learning the ropes, and even for seasoned players it can be a nuisance when some rube chases you while you're just trying to complete voyages and sell loot.
Most of my PvP experiences while solo just consist of sailing away from my pursuer, selling my loot and scooting off to another server (unless they ragequit and sink mid-chase because they can't catch me, that's a good chuckle).
Still, as I've seen others remark, I can't deny it's often worth the possibility of PvP for the tension it adds - it very quickly gets dull grinding with ease on alliance servers.

Speaking of grind, that's an aspect that occasionally detracts from the game - there's so much community focus on hitting the game's codified quantitative milestones that it all starts to feel like piracy by the numbers when you talk to some players, not about the enjoyment of the game itself.
I find some of my favourite moments in SoT are the least grind-focused; I personally find a lot of joy in meeting other players on the sea who aren't trying to sink me. It's not just a relief to find out that they're not aggressive, it's fun just to hang out for a minute - playing instruments, launching fireworks, swilling grog (and then playing instruments again but so much worse), sharing supplies and treasure, even forming an alliance so everyone gets bonus profits.

All up, despite the issues, Sea of Thieves is still the quintessential pirate fantasy experience.

That being said, I can't post a review in good conscience without putting emphasis on how absolutely heartless other players can sometimes be; something about Sea of Thieves attracts the most atrocious people, some of whom will hunt you no matter how little gold or fun they get out of it (the tone in the verbal abuse over voice chat is more than enough to tell you they're not even enjoying it themselves). So, word of warning - be prepared to face some of the most rotten individuals that the gaming community has to offer (and I say this as someone with a few hundred hours in DotA2).
Maybe the fact that you'll encounter horrible people in this game will add to the pirate-y feel of the world for some, but I find it's usually just tedious.",1620212581,1705622060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But Rare has slowly but surely strangled the life out of this game, short-sighted update by mismanaged update.

Inch by Inch, Rare has removed every single aspect that made this a great game. Loot bloat has never stopped, adding more and more useless rewards that heap gold upon you, allowing you to purchase cosmetics that have long since stopped meaning anything. The grind is gone, and what was once a sense of satisfaction of hours of raiding other players and scouring the seas for every last gold to buy a new cosmetic, is now shallow and left behind.

The addition of Safer Seas, or private PvE exclusive servers, has ruined the game more thoroughly than any other update possible. Sea of Thieves is a PvP game, built and born, designed to support that gameplay from day 1. It's why every single player has the exact same gear and weapons, the only thing that ever separated a fresh install from a max level Reaper was skill, and skill alone. It has always been a game about piracy, a game about stealing loot from other players, and emergent gameplay from players ambushing you at the worst possible time to steal your hard earned loot. Even the possibility of PvE servers ruins this aspect. If even one person can opt out of this, the house of cards starts to crumble as people choose the path of least resistance.

With Season 11 now on the horizon, what gameplay is left has been compromised to an extent I'm surprised there's a game left. Being able to dive to skip directly to world events destroys the manual teamwork gameplay and exploration that made SoT what it is. Seeing other ships sailing across the open seas far away reminded you that this world was real, that they had a story and a journey of their own. Why spend so much development time to make sailing fun, then allow us to skip it all together, when all it does is help us stack more meaningless loot, for even more worthless cosmetics?

With a price tag of 40 dollars still, there is no way I could ever willingly recommend anyone play the withered husk of this game anymore. From a cheater epidemic that Rare still has yet to even give more than lip service to, to ever janky and unresponsive hit registration, to a dead and forgotten story that still hasn't even seen an update with the results of a community vote made almost three years ago now. Rare has lost the plot, and lost what made them great. 

I'll always cherish the memories of this game I have with my closest friends, the fun of sailing the open seas, and the battles we fought in against so many different players, to even a time we tried to run a pirate alliance with public ships that spoke different languages. This game was my favorite game ever made, and still holds a fond place in my heart, but I cannot ever recommend anyone else play it. That Sea of Thieves I fell in love with is gone.

If they added actual content it might make a difference, however it seems with each update, they just sit around the whiteboard and come up with 3 bullet points for the update.

In conclusion this needs a lot of fixes and actually needs major updates like fuck season 11 and rings or fast travelling to world events beacuse think about it someone like me who had enough with pve content will not care about the loot and complete every world event in the map and will destroy the loot. What will the unexperienced players will do about it :D?

Sea of Thieves used to emphasize natural interactions between players in a sandbox, PvPvE environment. You could forge alliances (and risk betrayal, or betray), fight over map events, rob others for loot, etc. As of S11, Safer Seas and PvP Hourglass have moved in a direction that strongly separates the community. The new S11 'feature' to teleport players to their objectives further streamlines the game such that natural player interactions continue to be minimized. This game is now catering to the ADHD crowd who doesn't want to have to spend more than 20-30 minutes playing at a time. The game no longer honors the spirit with which it was designed and sold to me.

Rare's golden goose of new players has led to a stigma and prioritization of PVE and its content. Not a bad thing, but when PVE is clearly prioritized on one side for monetization, rather than split 50/50 with PVP, issues tend to arise from neglect. Hourglass is perfect content for the PVP niche, but, following 5 years, no real anti-cheat, or anything has been developed to combat cheaters. Cheater's have been on the rise, and Rare has done nothing. They went as far as to release a reporting system to where you can report offensive names, but not the main problem of cheating; a big F-U to players.

Either way, stigma's within the community following Rare's lack of initiative arose, and PVE players simply, to this day, ignore the problem as why would they? Cheater's aren't a problem in PVE SOT, but PVP, Cheater's are abundant and with PVP being such a low niche in the game, there's no real way to fairly represent a quater of the player base, not when most of well known, respected, and knowledgeable people have been banned either unfairly, or for the use of 120 FOV, which is considered cheating because of its third party application to the game's set FOV of 90.

Even past the glaring issues of Rare's golden goose's and Rare's lack of updates on cheater's, Sea of Thieves is built on an old, outdated engine, which refuses to be upgraded because of SOT's partnership with Xbox. This of course causes problems such as D-sync, poor performance in some areas, laggy terrain and sea's, and the most apparent, Hit-Reg; something that has plagued the game for years, and still remains a constant issue. If it's not symbolic or representative enough, their attempts to fix it for those attempts to then be in vein only represents the incompetence on the management side of Rare, but also the underlying issue of the engine of the game.

It fairly steadily receives updates, doesn't have a whole lot of bugs for being a large MMO, and looks absolutely beautiful in its own high-def cartoon-y aesthetic which I think is a really good look for a video game.

As for cons of the game, there is a decent amount of meta-gaming/sweaty tactics you run into in some combat situations. They're usually able to be beat while playing for fun but sometimes the PvP can be frustrating. Overall I've found it to be enjoyable.

Last of all, this game is great to play with friends. One problem with multiplayer is that, say you and Friend A are logged on, sailing in a 2-player sloop, and then Friend B comes online, you would have to wrap up everything you're doing to log back in as a 3-player brigantine to add Friend B to the party. There's no real way to fix this with the game except for maybe under-staffing a larger ship if you're expecting someone to want to join you.

I usually play with friends and 9/10 of our fights are us spawn camping on a sloop until it sinks. It's not fun for us doing it, and it's not fun for the people we're doing it to. If they could arrange things in such a way that there is less emphasis on boarding ships, I'd really like that. As it stands, actual ship v ship combat really isn't the meta. Boarding the enemy's ship is, and it's usually very one sided and boring. It's really unfortunate since crewing a ship is what makes this game so novel and interesting. 

Also, solo slooping should probably not be allowed. I don't know why so much of this player base likes playing alone, grinding for cosmetics, and crying when they get dogpiled.

It's also a social game, I probably wouldn't have near as many hours if I had to play solo or join random crews of players I don't know in real life.I can definitely say the game is constantly evolving and has changed a great deal from when it was first released. They just released a Safe Seas mode for those afraid of PvP, but you'll wont make any decent gold in that mode so thankfully you can only buy cosmetics and nothing that gives you power ups or the like. But if safer Seas is what it takes you to enjoy the game go right ahead and experience this gem.

I pretty much only play Sea of Thieves on Xbox, I love the game, but Its installed here for emergencies and to support Rare. There does seem to be an issue with achievements syncing over, it did about half the achievements I had unlocked on Xbox the first time and occasionally when I load up the game every few months a few more will sync. Anything unlocked on Xbox can't be redone to unlock on steam, so if you get the eat a banana achieve on Xbox and it doesn't unlock on steam, you cannot just eat another banana on steam to unlock that achieve, you have to wait until it decides to unlock finally on it's own.  Just be weary of that if you plan to switch between Xbox and steam a bit.

TL;DR looks like a fun open world game similar to GTA or RDR2, but it a bunch of people who are interested only in killing players and not doing anything else have the developers' full support and ruin the fun for everyone


Sea of Thieves has a wonderful looking open world, fun to use sailing mechanics as well as a very interesting setting with historical pirates and a bit of fantasy like skeletons and ghosts. Overall I thought this was a very promising game, that it might even be on a level with GTA. But this game really isn't what it appears to be.
    What I love about other open world games is that they offer you lots of freedom. You can make your own character, your own playstyle, your own story. The problem about SoT is that it is [b]heavily[/b] PvP focused. There are two game modes. [i]Arena[/i], obviously where players constantly fight each other and [i]Adventure[/i], where players basicly just have to first find others to kill but the community views these two modes equally. Every player behaves the same way; they'll attack on sight. There is no freedom in playstyle because everyone who does not constantly fight others will just be killed by other players or be forced to constantly run away. [u][b]Anyone interested in PvE or anything else other than constant PvP has no place in Sea of Thieves[/b][/u] is a message most of the community and the developers alike convey in forums and discussions. If the community's majority does not like PvE, fine. But it's not like nobody there would like some ability to avoid PvP and I greatly disapprove of this utter shunning of ideas and requests with wonderful phrases such as [i]""Don't tell the developers how you want the game to be""[/i] or [i]""There is nothing wrong with spawnkilling. People who say there is are just venting""[/i] and the occasional [i]""git gud, noob""[/i]. It just doesn't offer any variety and exactly destroys the open world freedom of being able to do anything you want, because you can [b]try[/b] anything you want just to [b]always[/b] end up in a fight. Also goes without saying that even those who do like it will become bored rather quickly as attacks by player also only have so much room for staying thrilling.
    There are PvE styled Trading Companies with which players can make money. People say it was the thrill of always being vulnerable when moving cargo and so on that grasps them, but honestly it's just pure stress and frustration, it makes me wonder how masochistic people have to be to enjoy always being forced to do it this way. If you could optionally expose yourself to gain extra rewards and achievements or something, so it wasn't mandatory I'd kinda understand but as it as it's far from fun.

Another major issue SoT has is progression. There is virtually none. Pertinent to its arena like style in activities, also progression in Sea of Thieves is more similar to League of Legends than GTA. [u]For the most part[/u] the only things you can attain are non-gameplay-relevant cosmetics. All use your gold has to buy a new shirt, apply a skin to your gun or change visuals of your ship. Somewhat unfortunate as there is not even an outfit system meaning as soon as your character has a single set clothing which you think looks good (which is a basic part of creating a character and should not be a long term thing) you are either passionate for fashion and will keep creating outfits anyway or you will likely never change your colthing and subsequently lose one of not exactly many things on which to spend your self-annihiatlngly hard earned gold.
    The aforementioned Trading Companies sell Voyages to players, allowing them to look for treasure or kill skeletons among other activities (or at least attempt it until another player blows up your ship). There is a certain sense of progression here, however in a nutshell, you earn reputation to increase your rank, which allows you to buy promotions, which allows you to buy more cosmetics and it increases the length and cost of Voyages. Another annoyance is as you don't get to choose price and length of the Voyage. At first ALL your Voyages are short & cheap (even free at first) and once you're promoted ALL Voyages are expensive & expansive. There is also the Pirate Legend status, which to the best of my knowledge only unlocks one thing: an exclusive Trading Company, called Athena's Fortune. To reach that you need a certain reputation in a certain number of Trading Companies and I heard you need to buy all their promotion cosmetics. I don't know AF's exact offers or what makes it so special but I assume a feature that less than 3% of the players CAN (which doesn't automatically mean they do) access can't make such a great difference and it's probably hardly even interesting.

Having said a lot about what is not good about this game and why I would not recommend the game to the average gamer in its current state, I also think this game did and still sort of does have some potential. I love the way sailing and navigating work. It's not one of these Battlefield-ish one guy drives aN MBT, rotates and fires its main gun, loads it and somehow manages to look the behind all at the same time. In SoT sailing is very realistic and immersive. And still it's somehow balanced, one guy can easily drive a small ship without major trouble, but when driving a bigger ship everyone still has their role to fulfill. Also the game uses very little UI, actually just some HUD, which adds to the realism and immersion meaning you actually have to look at the ship's map to figure out where you are and if that isle you're sailing to was east or actually weast.
I've yet to actually play any of with a crew, as I mostly play solo, but the game does have some exciting looking world events, like fighting an armada of ghost ships, and something of a story mode with interesting and perilous dungeons to brave. Also the ship combat seems somewhat unique (seriously if you know a different game that offers this type combat please tell me) and could be fun if you willingly engage in a fight.

Ever since the introduction of safer seas in December of 2023, the player base seems to feel less horrible.  There are still the odd ones here and there, but they seem to have become less common than they were a year ago.  The QoL changes to the game have been fantastic, the game feels fun and solid with engaging game play and tense PvP.  Sometimes the PvP still feels a bit unbalanced, but, safer seas has given folks a place to better practice the basics so the fights are getting more balanced, but there's some ways to go.  I'm looking forward to what the devs are gonna introduce in the future as it seems they are trying to make the game more accessible for new players and engaging for veterans at the same time.",1697780296,1705186437,True,0,0,0.616006970405578613,0,True,False,False

Something about this game just triggers something in my monkey brain the doesn't let me stop playing. This is one of the few games i have played for multiple all-nighters. There is quite a lot of content but it is quite repetitive despite this i find something very satisfying about getting and selling my plunder. Also there is a cosmetic only shop with a premium currency that can be earned in game (it is very very hard/rare i have about 400 hours on the microsoft store and have max in almost all 3 of the trading company but have only made 200 of the currency ) allowing you to buy cool pets like a shiba inu or a parrot.

You're all out there complaining that there's no new players and there's only sweats to fight, but so many players BM and toxically crush newbs to the game anyway.

In SoT, nobody wins, we all lose.

The game just becomes super boring after that and the only form of entertainment is hoping new players join your server, so you can make their day terrible. This game has caused me severe brain damage and my back hurts from sweating on the broken PvP (which doesn't exist anymore). I shoot some fat guy 4 times in the face with a blunderbuss and twice with a sniper and he kills me with his crusty ass rusty ass dirty ass sword. At this point even Ships3D is a better game. If you're thinking about buying this game, you're better off investing in the Mongolian stock market. At least you'll have a slight chance of pleasure. Something that doesn't exist in this game. And what does 2023 edition mean? It was a doodoo game before 2023, it was a doodoo game in 2023 and it's a doodoo game in 2024. Fix all of your bugs you lazybeards. This game pushed my limits and caused me to become utterly insane. I usually like killing myself in video games when I'm bored. This is the only game that took my suicidal thoughts outside of the game and genuinely made me rethink my life choices.This makes me feel retardement, retardation and nuclear radiation. My veins are injected with my daily dose of ketamine so I can play it and have fun for exactly 24 minutes and 36 seconds, before the effects fade away and I have to suffer the consequences of my chronic depression. If you plan on having more than a 100 hours on this game, I do not recommend. If you have the attention span of a 5 year old or you're a 5 year old, this game is for you. I'll still give it a thumbs up tho, because it has unlimited potential.",1612072752,1705138792,True,2,3,0.524016976356506348,0,True,False,False

My impression is if you don't have friends you're pretty much screwed in this game.   Lots of social engineering going on to lure you into thinking you found a great friend just to have them turn on you and take everything for a good laugh.   Or you're rolled up on by a veteran just to sink your pety ship and kill you over and over.    Game is not newbie friendly and very harsh for solo playing.   
I would compare the mechanics to that of Mortal Online, or Rust.   

Right now the game is having major performance issues.    Not sure what was screwed up but i've watched hourglass sessions on stream go from smooth to actually seeing the FR's in the waves of the water.

Visually, it's nice, it has its own style and it forms a wacky coherent world that just works. Also the waves are gorgeous.

Gameplay feels a little heavy? But not like ""this character is too slow"" heavy, more like ""yeah there's weight to these actions, it feel right this way"". I really love that we play in 1st person view and that we get to pilot our ships ourselves, instead of just ""instructing"" it to go to places like in the games aforementioned. It feels rewarding but also dramatically increases the immersion. I love the combat (PVE and PVP) and the naval battles can be absolutely thrilling. I do wish there was big sea creatures to hunt, other than the megalodon that has barely any interesting rewards.
The best part of the gameplay in my opinion is the moment-based spontaneous structure of the game. One minute you're cruising at sea, going somewhere, nobody in sight and you're alone with the wind, and the next minute you have something attacking you and you gotta make decisions about it, whether it's an enemy crew, a bunch of skeletons, a kraken, or a fort.
Also navigating in itself is satisfying. Figuring out which island is your destination, finding it's direction, and manning your ship while keeping course feels amazing.

The addition of Safer Seas, while clumsily marketed as an extended tutorial, is a great environment to work on Commendations and Tall Tales without having people interfering even though you're the smallest fish in the pond while doing these activities. 

Music is trying very very hard to be Pirates of the Carribean, which I don't mind, I'm a fan of the trilogy myself.

It runs better than I thought it would so I'm happy about that.

I'm a bit icky about the microtransaction/massive in-game shop/plunder pass that capitalizes on FOMO, but then again, in this game the only thing that separates noobs from experts at first glance is the cosmetics since there are no actual progression systems in the game. So really this is kind of expected and Sea of Thieves isn't one of the worst offenders in this category anyway.

Who whith a sober mind though that NOT adding the option to save a game AND istead adding an option to get kicked for afking ON A FKN OUTPOST (a place where you spawn and cannot be harmed). I have just came back from a big trip. i probably had over 30k cash out of that, but i had to go for 5 FUCKING MINUTES and when i came back i saw i got kicked. idk is this supposed to be some FUCKING JOKE or did they fucking forget to add an option to save your loot in some way. So just like that i lost 3 hours of grinding because xbox is too fucking autistic too make a good game.
So if you somehow have no social life and dont have to eat food you can play this game without getting a stroke from everything xbox fucked up. The game is pretty nice but it could be a lot better if xbox didnt make it look like its the first game theyve ever done. I mean how fucking braindead would you have to be to make great map with lots of islands and things to explore BUT NOT addd more that THREE FUCKING SHIPS FOR THE WHOLE GAME AND THO TYPES OF AMMO which one of them is pretty much useless. make lots of different enemies BUT MAKE COMBAT SYSTEM LOOK LIKE FKN IF MINECRAFT WAS IN THE 19 TH CENTURY. Appart from that the game has a lot of buggs, there pretty much arent more than 5 ships on a server (wich compared to the size of map is pretty fucking hard to find somebody) and then they turn out to be some fucked up sweats who have a two times larger crew and will destroy your ship in seconds.
Oh and i forgot to mention that because of how poorly the combat was made and how few ships and ammo types are there, the only power you have is the sive of your crew. there are no fucking upgrades, no new ammos. its like Xbox game dev is fucking retarded. 
You can buy or rent a ship but there is no accual point in buying a ship. Oh wait i forgot. If you buy a ship you can CUSTOMIZE it for money, wait... oh fucking forgot it again the only way you spend your money here is by buying skins to your equipment and buying pieces of clothes XDDDDD. like wtf?! this negates a point to do anything in this game, because how much money you have you will still get banged by a two times larger crew XDDD.
Oh and i forgot there are lots of cheaters
The graphics are nice but they couldnt stand to make aingle detail like every tree and every stone looks like its about to render but it does not. I even checked it on youtube to see if the textures will render or are they just so undetailed. SPOILER ALERT, THEY FUCKING ARE.
Overally there definetly is a lot to do in this game but the system that does not change a bit makes everything really fucking boring. This game definetly isnt worth the money so wait for the sales when its half the original price. I still will play this game because i didnt pay that money to get fucked but if you arent sure if you want to buy this game DONT DO THIS.

Since launch, I've always had a differing opinion on the PVP community that surrounds this game, I enjoy how spontaneous it can be where someone can team up with you for one hell of a night, or you get the unfortunate luck of running into players that do play the game the way it was intended, but sure act like it's a reason to throw off slurs and insults because they killed you.

With Safer Seas launching, I still see a lot of people saying this effectively splits the community in half, and only caters to people that dont want to deal with PVP because they're ""soft"". I would have loved a mode like Safer Seas all the way back in 2018, even if it was more limited than it is today. I'm fine with the cut in profits and some content only being available in high seas if it means i can spend an hour not having to worry about a 4 team galleon wrecking a sloop that has nothing on it.

BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SOLO PLAYERS

This is the ultimate ""sandbox"" pirate game. With the right group of friends, and the right group of strangers (both friendly or unfriendly) - This can be insanely fun. The experience you have and the tale you will be able to tell about your adventures (and misadventures) is magical. It is, after all, the literal entire point of the game. Hour 1 plays the same as Hour 1000. The loot is only for cosmetics, ""leveling up"" is only for cosmetics, and the entire game map is unlocked as soon as you start (not including Tall Tale locations, which are essentially main quest story missions). You play to gain nothing except meaningless cosmetics, so you ultimately play to just play and have fun with friends. It's all about the journey with each voyage, not the destination. It's all about your crew interactions, and other ship interactions, the teamwork or betrayal. I love it.

But sometimes the ""sandbox"" on the playground has bullies in it that don't want to play with the sand, they just want to kick your sandcastle down and throw dry poop in your face, while screaming into their mic's. They aren't here for the voyages, or even for your stored treasures on board. With the desired intention of simple grief, these toxic players can make this game truly unplayable and frustrating.

I do think it might be related to post-game boredom for some players. After hundreds of hours, you finally hit ""Pirate Legend"" and what is there to do? Not much. So you can either choose to be a friendly mentor to new players or terrorize them.

Do I want a PvE mode, though? Not really. I totally understand the argument to allow PvE for kid players and their parents. But otherwise - The combat is... fine. The voyages are... fine. Tall Tales are... fine. Sailing is a highlight and fun. I'm just not sure the core of this game is strong enough to make a PvE experience compelling. It's the wildcard element with strangers that make this game special (and sometimes a nightmare).",1615147943,1704917855,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So this hurts to write Pretty much at this Point,
SoT was and is a Great Game without any Contestants in its field of beeing a Sandbox Pirate game.

In its basics it is enjoyable and a fun time to steal , work out Plööans to get treasure and all in all Fight or Ambush others or even go full Fight in the Hourglass mode.
Prior to Season 8 i wouldve given the Game without a second thought nothing less then a 8/10 rating.

I found friends in this game , Enemies , People that can share a laugh , Roleplayers , Furrys , TF2 Enjoyers , Crackheads , Single Mothers with 3 Children and Dads that went for Milk 20y ago. or for short , a beutiful game with endless Potential

THE SAD STATE OF THE GAME 2024:

-The Seas are pretty empty so far, seasoned Players are dropping the game since the Content for older Players is Dwindling by now.
- There is a nasty amount of Hacking Pirates and Cheaters , and the Process of actualy banning them needs you to have a recording setup on your PC with either Shadowplay OBS or recording Software of your Choice and then open a Ticket , not from the Game but from the Official SoT website
-Major Bugs start happening with even the most Minor of Updates im taljkin about  excessively long blackscreens for Respawnig / Shooting thyself out of cannons not working & Hitregistration functionality etc. and more....
-A Company that doesnt Care about their Playerbase anymore.",1691691793,1704887063,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Personally I've had so many incredible moments and fun experiences with friends on the seas! one highlight for me is meeting The Longest Johns while they were streaming for the Yogscast jingle jam stream in 2021.

2023: I've met and fought BehavingBeardly, LadyHaradaNiwa, EBacon and had the pleasure of sailing with ToxieSinclaire too. I've even some developers such as Andrew Preston the lead designer & Stephen Frost! I saved them with my friend while they were getting attacked by a Reaper in Hourglass we sank their enemy and they gave us plenty of their time we took screenshots together and were given a crate of ""Rare Fireworks"" which contain two hundred fireworks, Ten of which were fireworks of the Rare LTD logo. I think what makes this game special are the experiences you have and sometimes the mystery and unknown element of the game.

22/11/2023: Since writing this review I have clocked in an additional 2066 hours into this game and I will say despite the reputation it has I love playing Sea of Thieves 2023 has been a difficult year for the game but all in all they've added a variety of promising and content. Most recently they added the Skull of Siren Song quest which aims to have players race across the map to dig up a chest and key and battle to be the victor and hand in the SOSS (Skull of Siren Song).

They also added Monkey Island Tall Tales which add some fun adventures to an already exciting game! In these Tall Tales, you'll be visiting Monkey Island & Melee Island, locations filled with plenty of puzzles to solve. Stay away from the negative views on twitter this game is great! despite some of the lows it faced it's future is really promising.",1610198613,1704883895,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good as New Player
- Vast Exploration. As of 2024 The world is rich and diverse with plenty to do catering to all play styles. If you avoid all PVP  combat then it'll get boring after 60hrs. 
- Endless Sailing. 
- Pirate and Ship Customisation. Dress your pirate how you want and decorate your ship to reflect your pirate style
- Meeting New People. There is in game chat via text or with your microphone. All kinds of folk from different walks of life 
   who've had there own pirating stories to tell or just to bond with.
- Tall Tales. Story driven quests that will take you all over the sea of thieves. 

Bad
- Gameplay. It's a clunky mess. The Devs made changes to player animation to prevent players from quick switching 
  weapons to make the skill floor more balanced which I'm all for. However the implementation of it has created a lack of fluidity in movement.
- Hourglass (on demand PVP) has created this strange toxicity. Rarely do I see positive interactions during or after fights. There are also swathes of cheaters now. Keg spawns on your ship, Teleporting enemies, Invisibility, Cannon Aim assist, ESP, Item generation. It's no fun.
- Server Instability. Along with the clunky mechanics are server side stuttering, teleportation, un-registered key presses.
- Season Cosmetics. They made Season cosmetics purchasable in shop stores for doubloons. Things that were said to be 'Time Limited' are not. 

So in conclusion. It was a great game. But not anymore. 
Devs;
The key decision makers at Rare need to focus on fixing this game before adding more content and creating further instability. Otherwise player retention will fall and the life and soul of this game will diminish.

- So if you LOVE PvP then this is the game for YOU as it has ZERO pay to win features.
- Don't be fooled by the Safer Seas Coop game mode as it has everything locked behind a PvP game wall.

MAIN REVIEW:
Yes there is a story but you will not get to experience it much as your ship will be sunk by the time you get back from doing any of those Tall Tales.
The company Rare has broken the Tall Tales story quests into smaller chunks to give you a chance but unless you have a rare group of other players that just want to trade and sail you will not enjoy it.  As long time players know where the tales quest points are and camp them often.

New 'A Pirates Life' content is PvE on a seperate shard for you and your coop crew to enjoy... great... just 10 hours long. Can't grumble too much.. it was free DLC to those that have the game.

Even newer - 'Safer Seas.'
Now you can play the main game in Coop with your crew of friends... ah.. no you can't play the main game. Lots of content is locked behind a 'Come and play this in PvP High Seas PLEASE' game wall.

You get very little gold from doing quests.
You can't advance your reputation with anyone.
You can't unlock special chests as the quest to get the keys is behind PvP wall.
You can't buy a ship to decorate.
It is just a token taster to tempt some people, in hopes they then step over to play the PvP ganking side of the game.

With so many Coop pirate games coming over the horizon in 2025 I would have thought they would at least try and get a PvE fan base going before they loose most players and end up with the PvP lot grumbling at no easy kills. (as the PvP lot don't tend to attack each other that much) Hopefully they will see that they can make money from the PvE Coop crowd and unlock more features in the Safer Seas. Because as it stands there is very little reason for a player to spend money on in-game cosmetics if they can not equipment it on a ship.

Main game is great for those that want the Pirate Life and to be constantly looking over your shoulder as you do map quests and gather loot. There are players that are not interested in any of that and just want to sink any player they come across but don't wish to take on the PvE enemy.

At the end of your game session you will have nothing. As there is NO level system. NO special ships or weapons. You will have gold to buy a cosmetic for your ship and your character.
When you next log in your will start from zero again and have to re-equip your ship and apply that paint job you bought. All before another player comes along and probably sinks you in port. 

Giving it a thumbs down as I am reviewing from my point of view.
That point of view is - 

This game gives you no reason to come back. 

You gain nothing from it other than the knowledge that you possibly made someone else miserable by ruining their last hour or more of gameplay as they tried to follow the maps and gain gold.

I can't stand griefers and gankers, as life is short and people who get a kick out of making others unhappy have something wrong in their head.

Conclusion :

Great PvPvE (Player Vs Player Vs Everything) As that is what you will face.. EVERYTHING.

Great that it has not evolved into a Pay to Win model.

Safer Seas has potential but it is early days.

Avoid if you don't like being ganked by people that just want to make your gaming experience that evening a wasted one.",1626240722,1704774391,False,8,3,0.530157744884490967,0,True,False,False

You get reduced rewards when you aren't being f'ed over by people with 6k hours playtime, think that is ok, then get f'ed over by chests randomly disappearing, events spawning on you after a couple hours collecting, all to get gold to spend on things you cannot buy playing solo. Literally what is the point of the game? Grind hours to do nothing with what you got from it if you play solo. Play multi and take anything of value you die almost instantly. This game is over 100GB, why when this is such a garbage game? Not a big world, not wonderful graphics, very simplistic game play, how is this game that big? Multiple other games close to that size are great, GTA 5, Starfield(debatable game, but very complex vs Sea of Thieves), even games no where near the size like 7 days to die at 15GB but is so much bigger. This is one of the few games where I just regret the purchase, I don't feel like the dollars spent equaled enjoyment. I may leave a negative review on games but got my moneys worth because of play, this isn't one of them. This is garbage no matter what mode they add, I even regret re-downloading this piece of garbage, that was 100GB not worth it. 

Cant really recommend game, it is extremely clunky and just feels thrown together. Fight sequences are a joke, two clicks that is it for sword fighting. Just the same thing over and over and over again. If you prefer to play alone you will get attacked and lose anything you worked for.

A new player would start playing this game, only to find a galleon of 10 year olds and be annihilated. Sucks as well, that there is no real incentive to kill said galleon, since they are most likely not carrying any loot at all. Where as there is all the incentive ever, for that galleon to kill you, since you most likely are hulling some loot.

They have since added the ""Safer Seas"" option, which does hinder your loot by quite a bit since its a private area with no PVP. But, it enables people to enjoy the exploration experience, without having to deal with the extremely toxic community that this game allows.

The devs consistently push out updates in the form of ""seasons"" which provide additional content as well as a different progression system (battle pass). 

There are many different ways to earn money in Sea of Thieves, whether that being sailing to different islands defeating infamous skeleton captains in hand-to-hand combat and claiming their bounty to fighting off fleets of phantom ships and claiming the ghostly treasures aboard. There are different factions like the Gold Hoarders or Order of Souls that you can rank up in to become a Pirate Legend and gain access to a secret faction called Athena's Fortune, which offers more difficult quests for greater rewards. The progression mainly boils down to unlocking new cosmetics, as every type of weapon (cutlass, flintlock, sniper, blunderbuss) is available the second you start your journey. This doesn't take away from the game at all as there is a large variety of different unlockable cosmetics and it ensures fair fights between players.

The game isn't without its flaws. Sailing alone can get quite boring or frustrating, as if anyone with a multi-player crew decides to target you, you'll be sunk before you can say ""shiver me timbers"". There is an alternative game mode called Safer Seas which means you're the only ship in the server, fixing the issue of player griefing, but it has limited features and ways to make money as well as only gaining 30% of the base gamemode. Some people who are just looking for some fun without the stress of other players may prefer this, so if you think that's you, I fully recommend it. 

All in all, I 100% recommend this game despite its flaws. Grab a friend or two if you can, it makes the whole experience much more enjoyable. Happy plundering!",1704673764,1704673764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The PvP, while admittedly having a fairly steep learning curve, is an even playing field as every item is cosmetic and players will improve with time; Cannon shots will be more accurate, game sense to know when to repair, fire back or board will heighten and sailing will improve as you figure out when and where to raise/turn sails and the ship itself to maintain good angles. 
It is fairly easy to just avoid players if you want to avoid PvP all together if you check the horizon and map and keep in mind Galleons are fastest with wind and Sloops are fastest against. GL to the brigs though.

- The 'Lack of content' is something I've seen mentioned in several reviews and many more Youtube videos and this is one I think confuses me the most; For players that have been on this since day 1 I can understand how they may have this view as content has come and gone over the years and this last year was less content focused and more focused on back end stability and QoL updates as acknowledged by the developers but for any new players this point is a complete lie; I've got 150 hours as I write this and barely feel I've scratched the surface of what this game is offering so keep in mind the 3000 hr playtime of those complaining about this.

- ""Safer seas sucks"". Yeah I won't disagree on this, despite being a feature people seem to have been asking for since day 1 it has only just been put in the game and with considerable restrictions such as 30% cap on gold and xp making it fairly useless. I do however feel this is the right decision; If there were no restrictions to playing on safer seas and no incentives to play higher seas everyone would be on their own server removing all player interactions which add so much to the game and now instead of 5 crews in 1 server you have 5 crews on 5 servers and server stability is already something that could be regarded as a real problem for the game so making that worse in order to make the servers feel emptier would be plain stupid.
If you're expecting to just sail around peacefully fishing and digging up treasure with zero consequences on the aptly named ""Sea of THIEVES"" then you have made a big miscalculation and the game should not be blamed.

Now this game is far from perfect and there are issues that should be noted for people considering buying this game

- Server stability as mentioned can be problematic, this causes a variety of minor issues that can cause quite alot of frustration such as hit reg issues, teleporting, items not swapping/item wheel not working and the pain of crashing your ship because you were turning when servers merged. All these will put a dampener on your play session for sure but none are frequent enough to ruin the whole game.

-Playtime required; This is a big barrier for many people, trying to play this game in 1-2 hour increments will be a brutal grind; It is best to have a good few hours open at least so you can level up an emissary flag and get some use from it, generally the longer the play session the better (obvious really but the difference session length makes in this game is vast). If you don't have several consecutive hours to put in the game nor any friends who could keep the crew going while you're between sessions then expect any grind to be multiplied for you.

- Customisation. There's plenty of unique and well designed clothing, weapons and ship customisation with much more in the real money cash shop, The Emporium. With the free unlockable items being among the most prestigious and sought after bits content and the emporium being this games cash cow it's clear that players love this so it makes me wonder why there's still some obvious things that cannot be changed like the ships harpoons, lanterns, side ladders, map table, wheel compass and barrels. This is personally my biggest gripe with the game which should go quite far in telling you how impactful the negative issues mentioned actually are to the overall experience.

Sea of Thieves has a little of everything for everyone with work arounds for the bits you don't like and ways to enhance the bits you do but is definitely best played with friends and even though it might take a few sessions before you find your footing it's well worth it so grab a few buddies and I'm sure you'll have a good time, I would highly recommend it!

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

Sea of Thieves promised a captivating pirate adventure, but after spending countless hours navigating its turbulent waters, I can't help but feel like I've been sold a leaky vessel rather than a seaworthy ship.

First and foremost, the lackluster progression system left me feeling adrift in a sea of monotony. The repetitive fetch quests and unimaginative objectives failed to offer any real sense of accomplishment or meaningful rewards. Instead of a dynamic and evolving experience, I found myself stuck in a tedious cycle of rinse and repeat, with little motivation to continue.

The game's much-touted multiplayer aspect turned out to be more of a mirage than a treasure chest of excitement. Teaming up with friends should have been a highlight, but the shallow gameplay mechanics and uninspired combat encounters left us all yearning for a more engaging and challenging experience. The absence of any real consequences for failure made even the most intense encounters feel inconsequential.

Technical issues further marred the experience, with frequent server problems, bugs, and glitches that made me question the game's readiness for release. The constant need for updates and patches only underscored the developers' inability to deliver a polished product, leaving players to navigate a sea of frustration.

The lack of a compelling narrative or meaningful lore made the game world feel like an empty expanse rather than a rich, immersive environment. A dearth of storytelling left me with no emotional connection to the characters or the world, making the entire journey feel like a soulless endeavor.

In the end, Sea of Thieves is a shipwreck of missed opportunities and unfulfilled promises. The initial allure of a pirate's life quickly fades, leaving players stranded on a deserted island of disappointment. Save your doubloons and set sail for more promising horizons; Sea of Thieves is a sinking ship not worth boarding.",1704649725,1704649725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Grind to 40 in rep in private, then look for Alliance servers to hit Pirate Legend.

Bad community, great with friends, but I'd rather spend an afternoon hitting myself with hammers than dealing with sweaty gamers. Devs don't care or don't notice how bad the playerbase is, and would rather stick their heads in the sand than just let players have private/PvE servers to play on without worrying that someone with 60789275986 hours is going to roll up, call them a slur, and completely undo hours of progress.

Yeah, yeah. ""It's Sea of Thieves, not Sea of Friends! This is how REAL pirates are!"" Actual historical pirates took baths, and were usually the very subject of the slurs you use (minorities, women, disabled, LGBT+, etc.), my guys.

Edit: Now the game is actually fun AND playable with solo sessions! Lowered rewards and SLIGHTLY less stuff to do is a little annoying, but honestly, I play the game to play with friends and pretend to be a hee hee funney pirate and dig up buried treasure, or Tall Tales. Not to get stalked for hours by someone with nothing else to do with their time for the simple crime of existing. 

Cry harder, sweatlords. I am soooo sorry that the way other people choose how to experience the product they bought hurts you personally and now y'all actually have to try at PVP against other sweatlords instead of screwing over folks who just want to hang with their friends or do Tall Tales.

There is so much different things you can do in this game, to the point were if you get bored of one thing, you can just switch to something else. One way to prevent grinding is just to do a voyage(quest) or two, then hop off. Don't forget the beautiful visuals this game provides. It is incredibly fun solo, and multiplayer id even more enjoyable. Anything form a single voyage of nothing special, to sinking another ship and finding tons of loot, is the experience you are getting within this game. The final reason of why this game is incredible is the navigation is fun like nothing I've ever seen; raising the anchor, lowering the sails, and getting your ship to were it needs to go is some of the best traveling mechanics in a game ever.

Over 100GB installs have become painfully familiar in recent years, but few games demand so much space while offering so little playable content. I'd wager the vast majority of that install size is 4K textures for the many paid cosmetic items that constitute most of this game's excitement. There is a half-decent concept buried under that weight, but the brief moments of progression you might feel at each stop on the few narrative questlines are severely undercut by the game then asking you to sail to a spot, interact with an object, and then rinse and repeat. You might get to kill one of about six different enemy types with the 4 functionality different weapons this game offers somewhere in there too.

Wind Waker figured out how to make sailing fun 20 years ago. Black Flag figured it out again a decade ago.

Every game critic and popular voice that tried the game failed to see it for what it was, which was a sandbox PvP game with the side goals of acquiring cosmetics, making coins, and enjoying the experience of discovery and sailing. The game has been beautiful since it was initially released on Xbox, I have played it since it first released on Gamepass in 2018. Many complained that the gameplay was tedious and repetitive and did not like the ship mechanics of angling sails, repairing holes, and having to constantly maintain compass bearing to reach destinations timely. These have always been necessary elements to force awareness into players about combat mechanics of cannon angles, wind speed and direction, ship maintenance, etc. There was never a time where I or most people I played with on Xbox saw this game as a PvE experience. Almost everyone flocked to skull forts to fight over them, one skull fort would typically take 2-4 hours to complete in the early days due to constant combat with everyone in the server. Over time, the devs produced content that ambitiously expanded the PvE experience, and the PvP foundations of the game went unchanged. Arena was released to mitigate the disparity between the divisive player base, because many players became upset when they lost hours of virtual gold circles to someone sinking them mid-grind. This was always the intended format for the game to be played in, and devs should have sought to balance the scale to make PvP and PvE worthwhile. What ended up occurring instead is that Arena gave PvP-oriented players a place to drastically increase their skills and test strategies and bugs in premade lobbies. No PvP player was ever going to compete in Arena and be satisfied with the game mode when they can return to the actual game (story mode) and destroy people much easier than before due to having hours of explicit PvP practice. PvE oriented players who had no interest in combat never learned how to properly defend themselves from better players, nor did they learn how to kite ships, run away or make creative plays to avoid confrontations they didnt want. Having played for years, I have experienced every dynamic of the game, having sought direct PvP, running from better players, making crafty escapes, tucking, stealthily sinking enemies, doing every quest and world event, etc. No matter what was happening to me, it was fun and entertaining and was part of the dynamic of the game. Anything could ruin an entire days grind of PvE, and I could just the same ruin someone elses day and not have any grudges or want to go rant on reddit about toxicity when I lost. Its part of the game and always has been.

The devs began to cater toward PvE players, openly allowing alliance servers to flourish, banning entire groups of PvP veterans from the game due to leaked discord messages that didn't have anything to do with the game, and they started to attempt to crack down on toxicity by reducing the ability of players to disrupt PvE quests. Exploiters and bug abusers have rampantly and openly ruined the game for many, and there are free downloads for unpatched cheats that work right now just one google search away. Hacked clients are cheap and easy subscription services and the game has no functional anti-cheat which has stopped this from happening. Almost everyone in the past 2 years has been playing with ESP, with the most popular free ESP having millions of downloads in its lifetime. The cross-platforming was quickly an issue due to the advantages PC players have over Xbox players. Double gunning was toxic and had no counterplay. Hitreg is still in the game 6 years after release and the promises to fix it. It's actually gotten worse because hitreg now happens with the sword as well. You can evade bans and avoid chat filter just by adding an extra letter to any slur of your choice, perma bans are issued for disrupting alliance server discords if you raid their server through discord. It is not fair to allow players free progression through organized discord groups that rig lobbies and bully independent players out of the lobby. These alliance servers will enter a lobby from a discord and team up on 1 or 2 ships with 4 or 5 of their own, and again, Rare will permanently ban your account if you start a rebellion from inside the discord. I have raided alliance servers with friends just to have them banned, even though I found the server myself in-game, we joined the discord to play along for a while and that apparently was a ToS violation. Arena was a dead game mode that only assisted in creating a larger skill disparity between PvP and PvE players, it was removed well past its expiration date. The introduction of private servers, PvE quests that cannot be disrupted, micro transactions which were promised never to occur at launch, and massive banwaves to PvP players completely tanked all of the fun this game had to offer.

Chain shots ruined an entire meta of ramming and boarding enemies. It is impossible to get near a ship when a player can just chain shot masts when you head directly toward them. The diversity for how you engaged in combat used to be fun, but now its devolved to long circling and hitting chain shots. The first chain shot hit typically determines the fight. You could always maneuver away from situations you didnt like, and you could still slow down enemies with cannons to the hull, because water in your hull slows you. The sword buffs and cc chaining you can do today are just as bad as double gunning, there is hardly counterplay if you try to engage in a swordfight and get hitreg to be stunlocked to death due to poor latency. Boarding ships is impossible because the sound cues or widespread ESPing give you away instantly. Ironically, had the developers never added chain shots, most PvE players would likely have nothing to complain about given they could run from any interaction they didnt like. Island camping someones dig spot has always been an intuitive strategy to steal treasure from PvE questers, and the people questing could just abandon it and do another quest, or bait with different ideas regarding treasure turn-in. Speaking of questing, unless you are grinding explicitly for commendations, quests are so inefficient compared to world events. World events have a power creep factor that makes quests obsolete for money generation. Which leads to my next point...

Server hopping has destroyed the integrity of servers and makes the game extremely unenjoyable. No matter if you are the one server hopping or the one running R5 world events that has to deal with constant hoppers trying to sink you, its annoying to have 0 interaction gameplay for an hour only to finally find a gem server worth staying on. Ask any experienced PvP player and they will tell you they have spent hours hopping daily just to find an abandoned FOTD, or an R5 that runs away and turns everything in the moment they see you raise emissary. The PvPers hopping to find something worth stealing or sinking just want interaction thats worth their time, because 90% of players running anything but world event reapers or fort stacking are doing some obscure commendations quest in the devils roar with merchant emi raised. These players will run on sight, likely on sloop and against wind, making it pointless. The devs attempted to solve this by creating hourglass, which is honestly the best update the game has had in years. If they had introduced hourglass in 2019 instead of arena, the community would likely have went a different direction with their disposition toward PvP players. The problem of server hopping still remains due to lack of steady world event content. Events should attract players and not feel like a burden, because every PvE player doing world events feels like they have a target on their back and are just waiting to be sank.

I have returned nearly 2 years later and in the last week I've stolen another guy's entire ship to offload his loot onto mine, I've had a 4-manned Galleon roll up and blast me to pieces with an hour's work of treasure in my hold, and I've boarded one enemy player ship, killed its captain, hopped on its cannons [i] and blasted a second enemy player ship as the first sunk beneath my feet. [/i]

I credit all this to the addition of the Safer Seas queue for children/casuals/dedicated PvE players. Everyone I've come across can actually put up a fight now, instead of all of us being separated out because our server slots are being taken up by a flotilla of sloops with white sails and no ability to defend themselves.

So pick it up if you're interested, because Rare has absolutely delivered the premise: big open world exploration with treasure around every corner and some of the best organic, if somewhat mechanically simple, world PvP I've ever played.",1689695402,1704469954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For a lot of us Safer Seas was a lifeline for this game. Many of us were holding onto the hope that we could finally enjoy the game but I haven't wanted to play SoT since Safer Seas released. With no real reward for grinding, not being able to use your own ships, not being able to co-op with other friendly pirates and being extremely limited on what you can and cant do ruins any fun aspects that the game had left. 

I only started playing at the beginning of season 10, I obsessed over this game until Safer Seas released only because I was counting on the fact Safer Seas would be better and more enjoyable gameplay for someone like myself. I can't even bring myself to log into the game anymore as it as tremendously boring. While I enjoyed my time on the high seas, pvp its not something that I want do all the time and I think players should be able to enjoy Sea of Thieves in both peaceful and pvp settings. Almost all other games have some form of PVE or Non-Friendly fire servers. 

I hope that as Safer Seas ages, changes are made to include the ""peaceful"" community.



Original Review: My younger sister has been playing SoT on and off for years now. She finally convinced me to purchase the game a few weeks ago. Since I've played for over 100 hours, reached Pirate Legend and have really enjoyed my voyages on the seas. The game is filled with content and things to do, beautiful places and in depth stories but actually enjoying the story and PVE aspects of SoT is almost impossible.

Not knowing the tricks and tips that the well versed community have access too as a new player can make the game seem impossible to play, I was shocked that the servers were not skill or level based match making. Because of this it is somewhat annoying that you cant have private servers or even just PVE servers.

While I understand where some of the concerns come from within the 'pro pvp' community of SoT, I do not see how adding a PVE side to the game would hurt SoT. If anything, I think it would make the PVP aspect better by filtering out the players who are sailing to enjoy the lore and don't want to involve themselves in the PVP aspect (which is totally valid and okay).

As a new player I really don't think I'd recommend getting this game to others. It is hard to get into without help, especially if many of the players sharing your servers do not respect the ""Pirate Code"", the toxicity that some of these seasoned players show is disheartening and unwelcoming to newcomers. While I have met a handful of fun and nice players over the last few weeks the bad experiences overshadow the good ones.

I hope that with Safer Seas being implemented we will see more changes for PVE players and in general a more enjoyable experience for everyone.",1698568519,1704420907,False,372,12,0.826204597949981689,33,True,False,False

1172620,155224811,76561198007994642,0,44,10,0,10,1704337452,"Like so many others I was given false hope when Rare announced the non pvp mode. What could have been the key feature to bring players (back) into this game, is instead almost an insult. 
 The limitations to safer seas are just frankly obnoxious and show what almost feels like contempt for pve/co-op players: Reduced rewards one can almost stomach (it's still the wrong way to do it. Carrot vs stick. Instead of punishing pve players, reward pvp players with pvp specific rewards like taunts, finishers etc, things that do not matter in pve anyway), but the caps, lack of features, not being able to use guilds, captained ships etc are not ok.

how it was all worded also makes it feel like these devs consider safer seas a ""training"" mode before moving on into the ""real"" game. The problem is that high seas isn't the fun risk/reward balance MS/Rare's PR tries to make it out to be. Where crews compete for loot, queue up for pvp battles, or take a well calculated risk grabbing that reaper's chest (You really should warn new players on what picking one of those does btw.) 

What you instead get is a near endless stream of pure trolls/griefers. Most of them do not give a toss about the loot, or if you have anything at all. All this type wants to do is kill, sink, troll, and grief others. Doesn't matter if it's a new player, an empty/freshly spawned ship, or someone hunting for pigs. More often than not any loot that was onboard is left behind to sink, and any living cargo is thrown into the sea to die. 
In the months I've played during my free included game pass time I ran into exactly 4 other players that didn't go out of their way to try and sink our ship for no reason. It was in fact so rare an occurrence we kept track.

The fact there is no mechanism to deal with this shows it is semi as intended. There is no realistic way to report another player/crew for just lousy behaviour apart from when they straight break xbox terms of service for abuse. There is no auto matchmaking that puts these types together. There is no real risk to being a troll/killer. There are no ai pirate hunters that come after you, and there are no *safe* zones either (Something even proto mmos from the 90's had.) There isn't even a single ""freeport"" newbie/low risk outpost with ai defenses and town guards. 

The balance is also borked: The smallest ship should allow up to 3 or 4 players, the medium up to 6, and the largest size 8 or even 10. Not having a 2nd battery of guns on the large ships is just as silly. The gun ports are visible, but not used. Even if you just moved two on each side down a level would already be something. If you want risk reward then make it so you have to manually open and close the gun ports, and sailing with ports open means you slowly take in water from waves just like when it rains. You cannot hire ai crew/defenses, nor does your ship come with any. So between the lack of real broadside advantage, and it being absurdly easy to just board another ship and blow it up, you're actually at a disadvantage in some ways for sailing the larger ships. 
There also isn't any real easy convoying, and there certainly isn't any option to have your own instance unless you're one of the special cases.

There is no sense of progression either: Sure, when you go into the actual pvp battles have players use fixed loadouts, but in the ""open"" part allow more freedom. Let players tinker with their ships, offer some variety in weapons, and get a non busted rifle scope etc. There are camps and forts, but you cannot do anything with these either. Guilds are also at present beyond basic: There are no special guild ship types, no guild bases, special weapons. They are just glorified pvp teams. 

So the short version is: As it is right now, don't bother buying this game unless you enjoy trolling or dealing with trolls. The question isn't ""if"", but ""when"" someone comes along to ruin your fun, every single time. Even then do yourself a favour and just disable all chat from the start, unless your idea of a good time is some profane 12 year old shrieking into your ears. 
 If you want to pvp with your mates, also avoid. There just isn't any easy way to set up a private instance to go at it together with multiple crews.
 If you like pve/co-op just avoid for now. Safer seas isn't what you'd hope for, and frankly there also isn't enough actual pve content to make it worth the price. If you want to check it out or do the tall tales just get a game pass trial. You'll be done before that trial runs out.",1704374173,1704375151,False,20,3,0.589626014232635498,0,True,False,False

If you enjoy PvP, this isn't your game. Their servers are so bad that very nearly every fight will be an infuriating lagfest where you are fighting the game more than the players. Rubberbanding, interactables not interacting, hits not registering, long loading screens where there shouldn't be... its bad. That doesn't tend to be as much of an issue when you aren't around other players, but...
If you enjoy PvE, this isn't your game. People in the PvP servers will randomly murder you for the fun of griefing you, and delete your progress. They just introduced a PvE only mode to the game, but arbitrarily limited it and capped the levels because they consider it more like an extended tutorial rather than a full-fledged game mode, and you are supposed to move over to their regular PvP servers once you have an idea of what you are doing. See above as to why you wouldn't want to do that.

Edit: I've spent another 3 days of my life in his game, trying to eek out some fun between the shit servers and toxic PvP and I'm just actually uninstalling it now. Maybe some day, but not today.

Check back in on this game around mid 2024 and see if they have uncapped the PvE game mode or made progress on making their servers actually functional. Until one or both of those things happen, I don't really recommend paying money for this game. It is a cool game, and it can be a lot of fun.

EDIT: I had about 10 hours logged when I first gave this review back in 2021. Captain Jack Sparrow had just hit the seas, we were introduced to Forts of Fortune and Sunken Treasuries/Shrines, and PVE just got a big update, along with many other things. As of now I currently have almost 300 hours into this game, and I can comfortably say that this is one of my favorite games to play of all time.

To put it simply, this game is very much based on the multiplayer aspect. That's why PVP servers exist; you're not guaranteed to have a nice experience every time you log on, which is upsetting, but there is no honor among thieves. The game has something for all levels of play to enjoy, and now with the addition of Safer Seas, those who wish to simply play the barebones of the game for what it's worth have the option to do so without getting spawnkilled or followed by opposing player ships, albeit that luxury comes with a price. 70% reduced gold overall is the main takeaway, as well as not being able to sail emissary ships, captained ships, and a number of other things.

If you are looking for a true pirate experience, for all that it is worth, INCLUDING all of the hard labor and the fear that comes with losing it, please give this game a try. Safer Seas is nice, but new players will often fall into the trap that the gamemodes are similar and that you will easily be able to transfer skills that you learn in Safer Seas over into High Seas. Learning the hard way how the game works, how people behave, and how to protect yourself is the best way that one can learn.

I recommend this game for all levels of play. There are times when I see some ship names or see behavior from other ships that I do not condone, namely some of the more hate-crime-esque stuff, but overall I can't say that I've uninstalled this game over anything.",1627919844,1704325407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hopefully Microsoft gets rid of the devs at Rare that were pushing against PVE so that new devs can make this game truly great.

As you can see by my hours, I tried my best to stay involved with this game for a very long time. Probably the one game I've ever poured the most time into ever, maybe the second highest. Joined servers, pursued creative projects, became attached to my character, tried my hand at every aspect of the game there was. Looking back after all this time, I'm really not sure why I did it. Gameplay is repetitive, grindy, and mostly unengaging. PvP is frustrating whether you win or lose. Community is constantly in conflict with itself. Devs are money-hungry and consistently fail to give the fans what they want, even if some of them are trying their hardest. No matter what you do, you don't win.

Is there anything left for me in this game? No. Is my view pessimistic? Yes. Did I play the game wrong? Probably.

Would be nice if we could maybe choose to be in a session with just other sloops or if we want bigger ships as well to have a balance choice for those who play solo, or maybe even a choice for lobby with just players who want to solo sloop.
I have played a fair bit more now and have finally had some better sessions with less aggressive players, now over 200h game play and have had a few non aggressive players and some fun and cool encounters to go with them.
Not many will even seem to bother with the alliance system in the game, after over 50h i didn't get to use it once, even with over 200h in game i manged to use the alliance system with a few crews but not many as still most crews play aggressive been a pirate game, i have managed to use the alliance system only 4 times, shame really as even the events were alliances benefit most like x2 gold and rep, almost all i have come across are aggressive and will just sink you.
Even worse when you find players who offer a alliance and you accept or for them to accept your alliance, just for them to back stab you as you pull up to the port to sell and they decide to attack and sink you while still in the alliance.

And for those who say but the hole point is been a pirate you loot each other, yes i agree and get that when on the sea, but you know ports should be a safer place you can sell especially when you sail too and dock up seeing no other ships are there, i was frustrated and annoyed to find out in a tip video that players can actually sink there own ships and stay in that area like wow, sinking your own ship and camping a port just to steal loot and troll players is just plain dirty and ruins the game and experience for a lot, i have had this happen a few times and when i say a few time i mean a fair few .... after about 24h game play in over about 2 weeks i had this happen 5 times, it was one of the other reasons i ended up quitting the game for over 2 year, at that point if i could have ask for a refund i would have gladly as most of my experience was ether frustration or annoyance with other players.
I hope something can be done about this, the Dev's should just make it so if you scuttle your ship near a port or at a port as soon as its re-spawned it should force re-spawn you to your ship if you are still near or still at a port.

Safer sea is now here and to be honest i was and am still disappointed with the outcome and hope some changes would still be made. Thankfully some changes have been made and maybe some more in the future as well. Even with safer sea's out i still sail more on the high seas but much happier now there is a way to learn stuff with out fear of other players. 
Some changes have been make like now even if your a pirate legend you can now buy voyages reduced to rank 40, This was a must and I am very happy they have fixed it.
The only thing safer seas seems to be good for is learning basics of the games and its mechanics, playing tall tails and most commendations uninterrupted by other players, i would still NOT recommend doing any voyages as a way of trying to earn gold in safer sea due to reductions and restrictions, you can not use the sovereigns as well so if you are solo, selling your loot can take a long time as you have to carry it from your ship around the island to each tent and is not really worth the time or effort because of reductions. I would Only recommend to do a voyage on safer seas if you do not know it and maybe want to learn it safely, or maybe just want commendations uninterrupted by other player.
The reduction IS STILL 70% leaving you just 30% gold and rep, it is way to steep especially as all gold is used for is some items that are still at 100% price cost NOT reduced for the 30%  reduction, like supplies and cosmetics, most seem to be so expensive, it would take days or weeks in safer seas to just get one of the cheaper sets especially a ship sets as the lower costing parts still cost around 70k each and up, making most ships sets cost almost 1mil gold, I think the 30% would be fine maybe if we could use the Sovereigns still but as we can not use them i disagree with the reduction.
Also they did not reduce the cost of supply's for ships or crates so a empty box alone still costs you 5000 gold, Most of the higher price loot is also removed and you also have to run around more just to sell your loot.
Removing the emissary boost seems fine to me and the other content like guilds content and the commodities supplies, but stopping the use of the sovereigns altogether just seems unfair, i know its our ship that allows us access to the sovereigns but i thought that the sovereigns were added to improve game play and the experience like a quality of life update, meaning you can spend a bit less time at a outpost doing a tedious task like selling loot and spend more time enjoying the game. Hopefully the Developers will allow us use of sovereigns at a later date, mainly just to be able to sell your loot to them is all that matters and its safer seas so why can we not use them, maybe allow us to use our ships so we can sell to them and disable the milestones and stuff still.

A lot of the player base wanted safer sea for a casual and stress free experience, or to learn the basics of the game as a lot you have to learn on your own like some of fighting mechanics, sailing plus more, some to play with family or friends.
I agree with a lot of the restriction on safer sea like all PVP related content been removed and guild related content, i also agree on the levels been reduced and capped.
I was also happy see how they left a lot of the open world event content in safer seas.

This was the result of a voyage i did when safer seas was reduced to 30%, sailing from one port to another and clearing some stuff on the way.
I sailed just over 2 hours on safer seas and kind of regret doing so, i did 1 fort, 1 sunken temple, 1 sunken treasury, killed 1 megladon, 1 skeleton sloop and 2 skeleton gallons, i agree it was a nice experience and enjoyed it until i reached the end of the voyage, reaching the port was fine but then finding out and noticing, with NOT been able to use the sovereigns it soon became hell i was super tiered from work and the voyage, and wasn't to happy as it took me around 30 mins to take all the loot off my ship and sell it, after all that work due to the reduction all i got was around 23000 gold, but I also lost 5000 gold by buying a empty supple box at the start for gathering supplies.
Without fully testing i can not say if hunters call will even be worth doing on safer seas due to the reductions, maybe for the commendations but for the rep probably not as you gain such low amount anyway in high seas, to reduce it to 30% would probably give you next to nothing still.",1699665858,1704161038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With over 1,000 hours sailing the high seas, this captain has a few things to tell ye poor landlubbers about yer inquiry into whether ye have the grit and gumption to become a pirate lord and legend.. or just an unheard of washed up turd, upon the banks of Chicken Isle. 

One thing ye must learn and ye must learn quickly my young pirate protege.. is that ye must never hold on to yer treasure too tightly. Now.. don't get me wrong,  ye want to defend yer booty with every ounce of courage and battle brave bravado ye can muster.. lest yer booty be plundered by some drooling dollard licking their lips as they parade their piratey hands upon it! But be forewarned.. Many a cowardly cohort with tail tucked between legs has gone awash in the glow of galleon fire and become cannon fodder not only on the sea, but in the ocean of their mind!

Ye must understand that to win a battle is something that is hard won with time, practice and patience. Ye don't go becoming a pirate legend in a day lad! And sometimes the battle of the mind is the fiercest one with what ye must contend! The sea rewards those who spend time with her, learning her ways.. just like the ways of yer vessel.. not to mention the ways of combat and cunning, of which you'll need both! But sometimes winning is realizing when you've lost.. and to carry on.. head held high, knowing next time.. you'll get those greedy and grimey gobshite grabbers that took yer loot with a fierce and fiery vengeance and nothing to lose! 

The only advantage an old pirate has in this world besides some fancy threads or livery is understanding. With time comes knowledge, and with knowledge.. understanding.. understanding when to make friend and when to make holes! Ye may wonder when trying to make friends as a young captain, why so many seem to run away in sheer terror at yer seemingly friendly advances.. Well all I can say is that you'll learn young sailor. My advice is to meet adversity head on and with a calm and keen head on yer shoulders, to meet those that would be hailed as  advocates with an open heart.. but a watchful eye! After all.. this is the Sea of Thieves, not Sea of Friends! 

And last of all, the adventures that await ye both in terms of what the sea and islands have to offer, as well as the encounters ye may or may not have seeing other pirate players on any given voyage.. will shape the game in unknown and unexpected ways almost every time. Ye must be ready for anything! or.. not much at all.

One final noteworthy mention.. it's much better to sail with a crew, even if that crew must be chosen over time from yer maiden voyages.. sailing with random slobbering rum drinking drivel until ye find a trustworthy first mate and quartermaster. Sailing the seas alone is a nasty business, although some lone and desperate souls may prefer it. Regardless, I wish ye all fair winds and following seas my hopeful pirate pals!

'Bout the most fearsome marauder
He was such a brute he’d nick all your loot

He’d take on all the merchant ships and bring 'em to their knees

Black hearted to the core
Grogg Mayles! Grogg Mayles!
The gold he did adore
With a hand on the wheel and the other on his sword
You'd gеt strung up if you glanced at his hoard
Yes he was propеrly 'ard as nails and they called him Grogg Mayles

[Verse 2]
Now I get the feelin you’re not hearing how frightening he would be
He could skin your chest right through your vest while he cutlassed off your knees
He’d plow his ship through storms and seas no other pirate dared
He'd plunder all the lubber's loot no treasure chest was spared

Black hearted to the core

I have at least 500-600 on Xbox where I played the game since day one until I got anxiety from thieves. Might sound funny, but you know when you work hard for hours at a time to get loot and the game gives you no recognition for it unless you deliver it to the proper destination of course you will shit your pants when you see the player ship on horizon. I can maneuver my sloop pretty good and escape faster ships against the wind, but running away can easily turn into a multi-hour anxiety-inducing horror gameplay. Keep that in mind. However, the sea without thieves that was introduced last month, 5 years after game release, might just give me an opportunity to catch all the fish I was never been able to while I was constantly watching over my shoulder.

To be completely honest, Sea of Thieves is PROBABLY my favorite video game of all times. I wholeheartedly recommend it!

If you are a new player and if you are into story content there is at least a 100-200 hours of stuff for you. Enter calm seas or whatever they call it now and start Sea of thieves lore first. It's a nine-chapter cool little saga that will introduce you to this world's characters.

Then go through Pirates of the Caribbean story and finally the Monkey Island story-line. For Caribbean I recommend playing co-op, but for Monkey Island I recommend puzzling solo.

Once you are done with all of it I recommend dipping your toes into actual Sea of Thieves. Test if you can handle other players and go from there. If not, it was a 40€ well worth it.

The game is also very unbalanced. Not even talking about the PvP. You can be fighting a skeleton ship and hit it 100 times with cannonballs and it will still be up. Meanwhile, they will be shooting cannonballs non stop so you waste all of your resources fighting an invincible ship. Don't waste your money on this game because you will sink hours into your quests and if you don't turn your treasure in immediately after finishing the quest, you will have basically just wasted those hours of your life because you get nothing out of it.

the reason for my thumps down is the game is just infested with cheaters and hackers, in the last year it has gotten to a point where I honestly can,t enjoy playing it anymore. 
I was hoping like many others that an anticheat would help in season 10 but at this point the cheating community is just to big and they just make account after account so unfortunatly it is no use. 
the unfortunate ripple effect of the cheaters is that now every interaction with other players becomes suspect and people in general are not very nice to eachother anymore.

Is not really a Sailing game as well, people shoot from cannon fly and land on your ship. The martial arts are bad in the game, 2-3 slashes and you are dead.

Safer Seas are introduced, which enables you to play in PvE environment, Without pledge your alignment to any guilds. Which means the maximum reward you can get is 20% of PvP content. which means you need 5 times more play to complete the season pass if you purchased.

Safer seas still your stuck getting murdered by skeleton ships with endless crews. Progression wise it doesn't seem you get anything out of it other than buying different looks. More expensive weapons and things from what I've seen gives no added bonuses other than looks so it almost makes you be like why do I want this to progress.

This game is hands down the most toxic fucking shit I've seen in a huge while. Kind of reminds me of League's community. ( LoL )
Advice for people interested in giving this game a spin. 
DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT play this hot pile of trash in ""High Seas"" mode, this is a mode where people camp the ""finish-line"" of any event that's ongoing, waiting for randoms to come over with a few hours of progress in order to get the end item to then gank you in front of the NPC that you need to turn the quest item in. How the fk does Rare LTD think this is emergent gameplay? or balanced? or fun?... 
100% play this in ""Safer Seas"", this will net you a -70% in any income you are trying to gain, however, I'll take this over nothing at all in ""High Seas"" because some sweaty little dickhead decided to gank me with his friends. ( btw, solo player here. )
Also, if you plan on doing ""High Seas"", only do this with a group, as solo is a complete time-waste.
Performance wise, the game runs fine, does have quite a few hiccups here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary or very frequent.

""Sea of Thieves"" is a captivating and unique multiplayer adventure that redefines the pirate experience in video games. Developed by Rare, this game is a masterful blend of exploration, combat, and teamwork, set in a breathtakingly beautiful and ever-changing world. It's not just a game; it's an invitation to embark on an unforgettable voyage filled with wonder, danger, and treasure.

The first thing that strikes you in ""Sea of Thieves"" is its stunning visual aesthetic. The game boasts a whimsical, stylized art style that's both charming and immersive. The ocean, a central character in its own right, is rendered with astonishing beauty – from calm, crystal-clear waters to raging, storm-tossed waves, it provides a dynamic backdrop to every adventure. The islands you explore are diverse and teeming with secrets, from lush jungles to desolate, treasure-laden shores.

Gameplay in ""Sea of Thieves"" is as varied as the seas themselves. Players can choose to follow treasure maps to hidden riches, hunt down fearsome skeleton captains, or engage in epic naval battles against other players. The ship-to-ship combat is thrilling, requiring coordination and skill as you manage your vessel's sails, cannons, and repairs. The thrill of outmaneuvering and outgunning an opposing crew is unmatched.

One of the game's greatest strengths is its emphasis on cooperative play. Sailing a ship requires teamwork, communication, and a shared sense of purpose. Whether you're navigating through a storm, fighting off sea monsters, or dividing the spoils of a hard-won treasure, the game fosters a sense of camaraderie that's rare in online gaming. It's a game that's best enjoyed with friends, where each session brings new stories and laughter.

The world of ""Sea of Thieves"" is also constantly evolving. Regular updates and seasonal content keep the game fresh and exciting, adding new features, quests, and challenges. The developer's commitment to the community and to the continuous improvement of the game is evident.

Moreover, ""Sea of Thieves"" isn't just about combat and treasure hunting. It's a playground for the imagination. Players can indulge in more peaceful pursuits like fishing, playing musical instruments, or simply enjoying a sunset on the open sea. The game's open-ended nature encourages players to create their own adventures and stories.

In conclusion, ""Sea of Thieves"" is a triumph of game design, art, and storytelling. It offers a unique blend of adventure, teamwork, and freedom that's both refreshing and deeply engaging. Whether you're a seasoned sailor or setting foot on a ship's deck for the first time, ""Sea of Thieves"" promises an adventure like no other, full of moments that will stay with you long after you've set anchor.",1642917748,1703974274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[strike] Probably going to get hate for this but after playing it for hours and loving it at first I finally have to admit that the game kind of sucks and really just isn't for me for the following reasons [/strike] (EDIT: I am enjoying the game again)

1: [Strike] I want to hunt sharks but there aren't any anymore. [/strike] (EDIT: Megs Spawn again, two in my most recent 7 hour run. Not as frequent as when I first started but certainly frequent enough to keep it interesting.)

2: [Strike] No way to opt out of PVP. [/strike]  (EDIT: You CAN opt out now. Best change IMO. Especially since you do still HAVE to do PvP to do ALL of the things, but you can just go sail around and chill if you want to now AND there's still very much a reason to still risk PvP. I STILL suck at PvP and it is STILL a very steep learning curve but thats fine because you can take a break from the PvP area now. )

I suck at PVP in this game so lets get that out of the way. I also only ever play solo because I just want to chill and sail my boat around fun and fancy free. I don't care to talk to people when I just want to sail my boat. I am always only a hapless victim and get murdered. Of the dozens of times Ive been ambushed I have won exactly zero fights and have improved only marginally, and that's to say nothing of the dozens of times I've come back to a wreck because someone burned down my ship and stole my shit while I was on an island doing a quest. I don't enjoy pvp in games like this. Losing a fight wastes the time I spend doing the parts of the game I actually enjoy and generally kills whatever good vibes I get / got from sailing my boat around.

Another problem I've encountred in my second week of gameplay : No lifers can re-attack you forever... no matter how many time you sink then, infinite respawn near location make the game impossible to play.
As long as the no-lifers have  time they can harrass you..... How's possible that Devs havn,t tought about any soulutiokn for years now...
It would be so simple to fix that..... Spawn nearest location when dead, then spawn on second nearest lacation when you die again, than third... so eventually player would not have time to re-attack you until you sell your loot and just leave this waste of time server.... (basically a 10-15 min cooldown respawn per island) and problem solved.

Most times people will find gameplay and other types of media depicting the game of their choice and see if they want it. Now that being said this game is extremely misleading as of late. 

Safe Seas was introduced to allow players to play the PvE aspect of the game, but removes Athena's Fortune, emissaries, captained ships, and guild ships. None of which are PVP content. It removes most the items that also allow to gain the more premium currency. Add onto all of that, your money gain gets kneecapped and drops down to 30%. So  a red mermaid gem, which sells for 2k on HS without emissary, 8k with emissary gets drops down to 600. So basically SS is there to waste your time and effort you put into farming if that is what you enjoy about the game.

High Seas on the other hand can be enjoyable, but not often. The community that has been built around this game is extremely toxic, to the point I have ended up deleting the game and I know for a fact I am not the only one. The PvP addicts are legitimate bullies when it comes down to it, with no repercussions to any of their actions. So they can load the game up, spawn in and chase someone down who's been playing for a few hours. Then if they lose that fight they spawn 2 islands over and head right back until either the other crew sinks or quits. Then besides all of that, there's an ""open crew"" setting to fill up your ship, but what they don't tell you is most times you have to worry about the trolls of the game who join ships just to sink them and waste all the resources one the ship. But here's the best part, if you call the toxic people out or happen to point out the fact that the game is PvEvP and not PvPvE they get upset and start name calling, insulting intelligence, assuming viewpoints, and attacking the person that disagrees with them. It's sad to see especially considering this game had a perfect example of what NOT to do from Destiny and proceeded to follow directly in it's footsteps anyways.

The cartoon-y art style of the game makes it feel cute and light-hearted without sacrificing the actual beauty of the tropical environment.

All of the mechanics FEEL great. Swimming feels refreshing, lowering the sails and hoisting the anchor makes it feel like I'm actually sailing this ship. The combat is bare-bones, but well executed. There's no mini-map, so navigating the seas and using your compass to traverse the island really do pay off when you hear that satisfying wooden *thunk* of a treasure chest beneath your shovel. Sea of Thieves gives you exactly the tools you need to operate in its world, and then steps back to allow you to play with them as you see fit.

For my 80's babies/90's kids (i.e., you played Banjo Kazooie), Rare's classic ""goofy"" style shines through as a love letter to the tropes of piracy.  Will you get robbed and rethink your hours spent?  If you play long enough almost certainly.  But on the other hand...can you drink grog until you pass out, and also play instruments while sailing on what is still a breathtaking environment?  Also yes.

If you don't like pirates, don't envision/dream about sailing; you won't like it, simple as that.

I have always wanted to experience this beautiful game, but I have no patience for being harassed and put into PVP that I am not actively consenting to while trying to enjoy an otherwise incredible game. Safer Seas is exactly what I wanted. There's still danger, there's still threats, and it is so much fun to be jumped by skeleton pirates or a massive shark while boating around and scooping up loot off of meticulously crafted islands.
The story of the Sea of Thieves, the history of Flameheart and Merrick, and all of the lore and faction stuff is actually pretty interesting, and I love uncovering it bit by bit. Which reminds me - Quest design. This game has the *best* quest design I have ever experienced. You will often be given the name of an island, sometimes not even that, and have to figure out riddles and keep a keen eye out for markers to guide you to the loot and the story. I have not looked up *anything*, even when I felt stuck, and with enough chin-scratching and experimentation, the game has provided so many Eureka! moments. No minimap, no HUD markers to guide you, just your map, your compass, the waves, and the wind.
I will never go back to the frustrations of PVP - I have found the seafaring life for me. Grab a matey or three, and see what you have been missing. Long Live Safer Seas!",1703786689,1703786689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core mechanics of sailing around looking for treasure, doing quests, playing a pirate story, etc. are all pretty well done. Still, after giving it solid try for about 50 hours, I can't recommend this game.

There are a few core play modes: Hourglass PvP, High Seas, Tall Tales, and the New Safer Seas.  Hourglass is the one I played least, and seemed filled with botters, exploits and toxicity. High Seas has the most potential, but is frequently ruined by the fact that its always PvP and lets vastly more experienced players ruin the fun for newer players; if you play the game for more than an hour or 2, you're likely to have someone kill you and take all your loot. If you play a short time, that might still happen, and even if it doesn't you'll get very little accomplished, since so many things in the game take a long play session to do. The Tall Tales are fine, but the ones I tried play very different from the regular game modes. I had a lot of hope for the new ""Safer Seas"" mode meant for solo or new players, but it is just not fun  for 2 reasons: First, significant portions of the game, such as emissary flags, are not available in this mode; the  treasure you find is worth the same value, but you will only get 30% of what you find. Picking up a bag of gold at a hard won ghost fort and getting 11 gold pieces is so discouraging,  that it made me question why I was even doing it. Second, while it doesn't seem to have been advertised much, this mode seems to come with AI opponents deliberately coded to wait till you have a decent amount of loot on your boat who will then spawn literally right next to you, are practically unsinkable using cannons, and who will chase you around the map even more than the sweatiest of actual humans, then camp over the loot you dropped when you sink. In other words, its seems that some AI was added to simulate (in SAFER SEAS) the worst toxicity of actual humans in the High Seas mode.

can't even just enjoy exploring the game with friends in PvE cause we can't even use our captained ship or any guild ships, along with many other punishments for wanting a relaxing game to just sail and do quests and random stuff. 

if I didn't have this many hours in this game I would have refunded it in a heartbeat, waste of 40€ at this point imo. devs better be taking notes. not everyone wants PvP, but just because we don't want it doesn't mean we don't wanna experience the damn game.

as of now I'll just uninstall it until the devs actually liten to the other half of the player base

side note: why not make safer seas a public server with a lot more AI ships spawning and disabling player - player (player ship - player ship) damage? then the PvE players can just chill together and not stress over losing all their shit after a stressful day that we have outside of the game. which a lot of players may not get but some of us have lives outside the game and just wanna hop in to relax and raid some skelly ships, do a few quests, raid strongholds and so on",1703774549,1703775456,False,2,0,0.502670109272003174,0,True,False,False

The game has no p2w or unlockable PVP advantages, if you get sunk in this game, that's probably because you didn't play as good as your enemies did (with very few exceptions such as if it's a 2v1 sloop fight), and if you loose your loot, it doesn't really matter, because all you can do with loot is buying cosmetics and leveling your factions (which only unlocks new voyages and cosmetics) so it doesn't even matter that much if you loose your loot. Also, not everyone you see on the seas is going to sink you on sight, majority of other crews are actually willing to cooperate with you if you just use your mic to talk to them about forming an alliance etc, if you don't communicate then what do you expect? You can play the game solo (I did my first 300 hours) and it works okay, but it's more fun if you do it with minimum one other person (There is open crew or discords for finding friends to play with).

That being said there are a few issues with the game, for example that it's very grindy to unlock certain cosmetics and that you can end up spending a lot of time traveling between points of interests

Overall a very good game, don't let the negative reviews about how toxic the community scare you too much, sure some people can be toxic, but it's not a rule of thumb. However if you come here in hopes of this being a big role play game with the iconic ""Are you the Spanish?"" interactions happening left and right then yeah, that's not too common in this game.",1703767873,1703767873,True,0,0,0.450942873954772949,0,True,False,False

Still fun without, but a lot harder, as you need to do lots of stuff on the ship alone.
While purely solo navigating is not a big deal, the problem starts if you get attacked, cus then you need to do losts of stuff at the same time like: shooting, loading cannons, fixing boat and ofc navigating.

There are various ships, but if you are solo, the only handy one will be the smallest one.

But what's also great about this game, it's cross-platform.

pros:
 -fun with friends and easy to make some
-extremely pretty graphics 
-lots of places to explore 
- exciting world events
-challenging bosses that are satisfiying to beat
-lots of roleplay ability if your into that stuff
-game's got lots of ship and character customization
-exciting pvp & pve (in my opinion)
-pretty waves

cons:

-some people can be toxic and offensive
-i guess if you have Thalassophobia this game might be a bit scary
-pvp/pve battles dont last that long (they usually end with 1 ship getting sunk really fast or the other ship fleeing)
- ancient coins are quite hard to get so you will probably end up buying some
-the pirate emporium is expensive
-game's got occasional bugs but they arent that bad
-sometimes crewmembers are a bit of a pill such as standing infront of you when steering the ship or wasting all the food or sabatoge your ship by setting it on fire. but dont worry youre crew can vote to lock them in the brig.

so far i would rate the game a 9.5/10

BE WARNED: some people on the game can be extremely rude and/or offensive as iv said before so if they are being rude dont take anything that they say to heart and ignore them.

Why take an amazing addition that would bring in new players and ruin it? If you're going to have separate features surely PvP content being missing is enough? Add more PvP rewards to the normal seas rather than punishing safer seas.

Sea of Thieves is the posterchild for beautiful ideas soured by dodgy execution. I first played on gamepass some years ago, and left because a vocal minority of the community was (and is to this day) the kind of edgy rude child you might expect to meet in a Call of Duty game.

I recently came back to see if things have improved. They haven't.

That ever-vocal minority has been foaming at the mouth over the introduction of a very limited PvP-free mode. On top of that, I continue to encounter bugs and QoL issues that should've been fixed YEARS ago. The nail in the coffin is that my keybindings simply will not save between sessions.

It's a huge shame, because Sea of Thieves has always had immense potential, and has always been kneecapped by Rare's mismanagement. The ship driving mechanics are genuinely engaging as hell, the cosmetics are appealing (and I would sure hope they are, given they're most of what you're rewarded with in this game-- despite not being able to save your ship's cosmetic loadout unless you ""earn"" that privilege with in-game money.)

Controls: Not to bad. At first it might be confusing but you get used to it

Story: Great story. Does not get in the middle of the rest of the gameplay but is great and casual

Gameplay: A great game if you like to be a pirate. It does not limit you to doing a few things. you can be a peaceful pirate, a violent one, or somewhere in between. From the Gold Horders, Merchant Alliance, to the Reapers, there is a ton of content to be discovered and flexibility for all types of players!

Difficulty: Not too difficult. Depends on what you do in the game. There is no designated ""difficulty settings"" or anything like that cause its multiplayer

Cross-Platform: Great. Not much else to say here

PvP: Amazing and very emersive.

Community: Very toxic, a rare occasion to find a friendly pirate on the seas, but when you do its an incredibly fun experience, even if you are fighting for riches.

Updates: Recently have been slacking, updates like Skull of Siren Song and Guilds have been great, though the game can feel stale once you have done everything

Conclusion: If you are interested in pirates, epic adventures, amazing and emersive gameplay, and amazing story, then this is the game for you!",1687826194,1703616376,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Recently when rare announced a pve mode I was excited because there are times id love to play this game but not have to deal with toxicity and rampant spawn camping from sweat players. I was shocked and annoyed to learn that the pve mode was gutted so much. If you buy this game wanting to play just pve I would strongly suggest finding a different game that involves pirates maybe try Assassins Creed Black Flag. Right now the pve game mode punishes you for even wanting a more chill experience by ONLY giving you 30% of the gold you would get if you were on high seas. Not only that but your reputation with factions is limited to lvl 40 not even letting you become a pirate legend on your own  if you wanted to. Oh and that really cool feature that lets you take your own ship into the game and customize it as its captain? Yeah that isnt available in safer seas either with no real good explanation other than Rare wanted to stick it to you that you would even want to play a pve mode. I don't hate PVP necessarily but I absolutely hate that I feel punished just because I want to play the game without other players chasing me down in their galleons and camping my island or outpost just to sink me repeatedly.,1703542582,1703542582,False,4,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Why still a thumbs down? Because the new PvE mode is needlessly castrated, almost making it pointless. There is no good reason to only grant 30% gold, there is no good reason to block various stories, modes and customization behind PvP.

To fight, or to make friends. If you've been around since the beginning, or your new to the sea of thieves. Its an amazing game for all kinds of people! And even if some pirates are not as nice as others, you can still pick yourself back up and go on an adventure! If your looking for a story on the seas, then you can try the amazing Tall Tales and fight Davy Jones with Jack Sparrow! Looking for an intense fight against other players? Go vote for the hourglass PVP battles and fight for Gold and Glory! (And some rather spiffy UNDEAD looks.) Are you a looking for a cool pirate game to dig up treasure with your friends and family on? Go to Safer Seas and grab a Gold Horder quest and follow a map or riddle to treasures untold without the fear of another player coming out of there hiding spot with a gunpowder keg and taking it all! Even the in-game currency you can buy with real money has a few ways of getting some without spending a dime! So it doesn't matter if your fighting a skeleton, sailing for new lands, or fighting other players to get your hands on rare loot! Even just logging on to look at some cool clothes you bought and forgot to try on last play session, you can always have a good time. I highly recommend this game game and can never get enough of it.

It WAS a fun game back in early release days because there was nothing like it at that time and well there still isn't anything remotely close to it to this day.

I will say the thought process of the game is really cool, playing with friends is a lot of fun and meeting new ones along your ""SoT"" journey is and will forever be memorable.

BUT The game is utter dog water, The mechanics DO NOT WORK, Hit registration is the worst it has EVER been. The development team constantly shoots themselves on the foot by not listening to its core community or their ""seasoned"" players and only listen to players who barely have any hours in the game. They keep ""fixing"" (if you can even call it that) stuff that don't need fixing and in the process of that cause more issues in the game. (for example the quick swap weapon patch caused the combat in the game to be more clunky) This game is NOT worth 40 dollars I'd wait for it to be on sale and even when it is on sale I still think it's too much to pay for. 

This game is great when you have friends to play with sure but a polished turd is still a turd. The game is just on its last legs don't play this, Go invest your time in another game that is worth playing, Just my two cents.",1701607222,1703528836,False,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

- If you have your eyes open at all times, you can pretty much avoid any pirates and especially the large ships by simply sailing against the wind when using the smallest ship.
Great for solo/duo players.

I only wish we had some more RPG elements aka levelling up perks, like faster digging etc. instead of only spending our money for cosmetics.

Pros
-

- Super fun with friends.
- Do whatever you want, completely avoid quests if that's your playstyle.
- Lots to do, your adventure can get completely torn off the rails.
- Tall tales (story quests) are pretty interesting.
- Beautiful graphics.
- Lots of different forms of combat and voyages to appeal to whatever playstyle you like.
- Random sea monster spawns and world events to spice up the environment.
- Can mute other crews and use text or mic.
- Safer Seas allows for a private server experience with an income reduction on what gold you earn.
- Hourglass PvP allows you to queue up for PvP without searching for it.

Cons
-

- Super fun with friends.
- Limited to three ship types with ONLY cosmetic customization options.
- Community is about as piratey as you expect pirates to be. Racial slurs are to be expected.
- PvP can get long and drawn out in naval battles, especially if both crews are loaded with supplies. Many folks run away, and depending on your ship it can be impossible to catch up. (Hourglass is always an option, though)
- Guilds are really hard to level up if it's just you and a couple friends.
- Lag spikes, crashes, and glitches are fairly common, regardless of what you play on. This has been getting a little better with each patch.


TL;DR - Better with friends, lots to do, never know what you're getting into when you log in.",1680467698,1703496673,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One way you would enjoy this game is if you had friends to play this thrilling, exciting, and adventurous video game.  By yourself the experience is very fun but sometimes it gets boring by yourself after playing for a while.  But with a friend or 2 or 3, the fun doesn't end! 

Another way you could enjoy this game is get like 3 friends and go in a huge ship and just blow up every single ship you see.  Which, in my opinion, can be very exciting.  You can also get good rewards because you can get very good treasures from blowing up these peoples ships.

A third way to enjoy this very fun and entertaining video game is by just playing it how you like to play it.  doing your own thing is the best thing you can do sometimes.  You can play the ways I just stated or you can enjoy playing it in whatever way you find fun.  Honestly, no one cares how you play this game.

In conclusion,  I have just said ways you could play this game and I have barely played this game or watched it, I haven't even played this game in a year because I deleted it after getting bored.",1703477559,1703477559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Loot has no value so there is no real fun in taking it from other players (games like rust give you a adrenaline rush if you get loot form others, here it is not the case). Would have been way more amazing if it was a survial game with base building or something to do other than boring pve missions. The weaponery and the combat system feels pretty bad, like mincraft but it has some depth to it at least. Especial melee combati is just awefull.

Here is what you do. You join a ship... the random instantly leaves once he sees you so you are solo or you wait/ join another ship till you find someone to play with. Then you do missions where you esentialy kill skeletons 5 shots a time, then you rush to the ammo crate to refill and you repeat this process 30 times. After defeating the boss you carry lootboxes for 10 minutes. You then drive to an outpost to sell them for gold, this allows you to buy skins. Thats about it.

The ship vs ship battels area mazing, very well made and a good mix of realism and simplification. Stearing a boat feels really good too. But there is zero progression, no guns to unlock, no ships to improve no characters to level in meaningfull ways.

Dont get mew worng the first 200 hours or so are funn, and playing it ocasionaly is funn too.
All in All: Great potential, but it is lacking substance. Probably a good game for a chilled round with the homies though.

The community of this game is obnoxiously toxic. You will find far more people who are going to trash talk you, chase you for more than 5 hours across the map, and find out where you spawned just to do it again for no good reason, than you will find relaxed players who just want to play some fun adventures and quests.

There are no options to only do PvE settings devoid of player combat. There are no options to avoid griefers. If you play this game, you will have to expect an experience like DayZ or Rust. You will have good experiences and meet friendly people, but they will be outnumbered by the extremely hostile players. Expect a similar social experience to something like Overwatch with the toxicity here.

Quite frankly, a game with such a toxic community is not something I can enjoy. I may love the game and how the ship sailing works, but it's far too toxic for me. It's supposed to be a cartoon pirate game, not a ""try to convince little Timmy to off himself"" game.

Come today 12/23/2023 I decided to see if High Seas is worth playing still. The last 3 times i have played this game, each session being over 3 hours long upwards of 6, has resulted me in getting nothing at the end of each session because when you try to do anything that isn't pvp, you get followed till the end of time even though you have nothing yet, AND if you do get onto an island where your quest takes you, you will be camped for when you bring the treasure back then they kill you, take your stuff and thats it. 

Yes, PvP is part of the game, and there is a time and a place for it. However, it is harder for you to play a tall tale than it is to PvP. I do not mind as there are commendations for PvP which will have its time and place, however, Safer Seas should not have a reduction or a restriction to what you can or can not do. You already have limited it to earning a max rep of 40, but now you don't allow for collections of items to be earned when PvP doesn't have anything to do with it. My point is the game now, because the player base has dropped so much is only PvP players, those who just want to relax and not stress about whether or not all their efforts are for nothing, has no place in this game. 

Remove the limitations on Safer Seas, and those who want to achievement hunt or like to have all commendations WILL come back to PvP. High Seas has become a land for just PvP as its quite literally impossible to do any of the tales without being chased for an hour. If you want to complain about players staying in Safer Seas and removing the fun out of the game because you can't kill people who don't want to die then just go play Team Death Match in COD, some people actually wanna have fun and play with their friends.",1703378247,1703378247,False,37,2,0.646711528301239014,0,True,False,False

I get having a level playing field for PvP, but PvE? Skeleton crew ships have already got holes in them, but are harder to sink than a player operated galleon. 

With the exception of Strongholds and Ports, the map feels empty. Many places that would be neat to plunder outside of events are just vacant when there is no mission or event, and half the time are very vacant even during missions. Missions aren't exactly simple or remotely easy to follow unless you have a veteran player on your crew. Simple tasks like finding sunken ships manifest can become an endless toil if you don't stop at every island along the way to search in painful detail for clues. The only solid way to make a decent haul is to plunder strongholds. Its so easy, a solo player can handle it. Just park your ship on the low corner, wait for the phantoms to charge down in front of you and spam cannonballs till each wave is dead. Doing this clears the stronghold in about 5 minutes, then it takes another 10-20 to search the whole base and load up all the loot. 30-45 minutes worth of work and a solo player can net 35k gold. But my point is, its not fun. It's not interesting. 

Merchant delivery missions. ITS A DELIVERY, not an ACQUISITION and DELIVERY, so why the hell am I being given empty crates to go gather supplies? Never in the history of shipping companies, especially the pirate era, did the merchant say to the privateer ""You're being paid to Deliver the macguffins, but I dont have them, you have to go to random desert islands and find them."" Like how hard is that really to screw that up RARE? Are you imbeciles? Because playing this makes me think your entire dev team is imbeciles. I actually believe nobody in the dev raised their hand and said ""But having no meaningful  progression is, like, insanely dumb."" 

Whats worse is the player base. I'm NOT talking about Reapers. I'm talking about every other player who sees a ship approaching with the alliance flag raised and says ""I don't need their help, I'll just kill them anyways"". How stupid are you. MMO's like this thrive on player cooperation. Can we throw a bone to the soloists? In 40 hours of play (10 on PC, 30+ on gamepass) I had so many random crewmates join, then when they wanted to do something other than the voyage I was already in the middle of, just bounced? You're still gonna gain from my voyage, so why cut out? And holy crap the No-Mic'ers. Its a game about communication and you got no Mic? Turtle Beach Xbox/PC compatible is like 25 gold at any big box store. You're whats wrong with the player base.

Fishing is fun.

Here's where the game gets it wrong:

Smaller ships have an advantage in combat against bigger ships. They're faster and they can be repaired by one person faster than a bigger ship can. A party of 4 of us lit up a little clipper that came to steal our loot, and not only was it not damaged at the end, but they sunk our ship. Our gigantic 4 person ship, sunk by basically a row boat. 

You spend half your time loading and unloading your boat.

The combat doesn't feel very satisfying.
The cosmetics are great but there's no progression.

The missions seem pretty soulless. In a game full of treasure, most missions feel like a mild payout. It's a grind.

High Seas: With over 150hours invested into High Seas, I feel I am in a good position to give an honest and fair review of High Seas, so, here it is - High Seas players for the most part are PvE players looking to enjoy friendly PvP encounters but want to focus on PvE content with maximum rewards gained for their valuable time and effort, HOWEVER; if the comments in these forums are anything to go off, those that would have you believe that the PvP community are lovely people are full of themselves! The PvP community in this game is by far the worst I have ever come across, even worse than DayZ (and that's saying something), they will constantly shun you, and purposefully try to bully you into believing their opinion is the right one and that you are not to be believed nor trusted with your experiences because they themselves have never had a bad one or have good ones every play through. This is far from the truth, if you load into High Seas, you can be rest assured that within your first few hours of playing the game, you will have some sweat-lord roll up on you and do what they do best, get toxic, verbally abusive to the point of telling you to ""End yourself"" and sink you while throwing slurs, and abuse your way (God only help you if you're a female player because you are going to get called a lot worse and really have some disgusting things said to you!), this is if they don't chase you across half the map first or you don't manage to run away and scuttle before they get to you. High Seas to the devs and PvP lords is a perfect game, couldn't be fixed, and must be played to their pleasure, not yours! I have spent many hours playing High Seas, and it has only gotten more toxic since Safer Seas has come out! Noting once again in these forums there are a few select people who get confused with PvEvP and PvPvE (the concept is simple, PvEvP = Player Vs ENVIRONMENT Vs Player = while PvP is a concept and component in the game, the core focus is PvE and the game SHOULD theoretically be played as such with the game mechanics facilitating this, with PvP elements to your PvE gameplay - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND as these people love to try to say this game is PvPvE - it is marketed, tagged and sold as a PvEvP) and unlike the very out of touch select group in these forums, having played my last HS session TODAY, I can tell you this entire statement is accurate having been minding my own business and rolled up on by a sweat lord, sworn at, called a coward, told to go ""End yourself""(Edited because the 3 letter acronym is banned text) - ""GO PLAY SS IF YOU DON'T WANT PVP LOSER!"" - this is the type of gameplay they will try to tell you doesn't exist or ""Rarely happens - you're just unlucky"" but the truth is, it happens more often than they will admit and if they say it doesn't - they're probably the ones instigating it, with their entire argument backed by ""Its called Sea Of Thieves"" or ""You got a PvPvE game - its what you paid for"" ( sad mentality), which these people seem to harbour so much saltiness towards the PvE player base for some unknown reason, but its very sad they are so driven to make the PvE player base leave by bullying them out or at the very least conform to their ideology - bringing me back to the whole PvEvP meaning and what the game is actually marketed as compared to how the game is actually played.

Safer Seas: Oh let's talk about this game mode, it was wrongly advertised and wrongly marketed as a place where people who enjoy the aforementioned PvEvP can go to really enjoy their experience of Player Vs Environment and not be punished for it. However, we have seen a couple of moderators and players tell us this game mode serves as a ""tutorial for HS"", and if that is the case, should have been marketed as one in the first place before people spent REAL MONEY on a game to play a game mode that failed to deliver in its initial concept/ marketed purpose. Since this game mode has come out, these forums have EXPLODED with MANY MANY players expressing their sincere displeasure with this mode and how it has been delivered, attempting to give honest, constructive, and genuine feedback to the Moderation team and (as stated in a statement from Rare, this team works DIRECTLY WITH THEM) the devs in the hope that they would listen to this feedback and act in the best interest of their player base and not their own selfish desires, however, this has been the case where we have now seen the admin team forming a single-minded agenda based response system, copying and pasting responses, shutting down threads that tell them they are doing a bad job, and, (like myself) banning people who speak out more harshly against this type of despicable behaviour. The feedback given should of been welcomed but instead, we have been told that unlike every other game on the market, the devs WILL NOT ADAPT to their player base and will instead stick their heads in the sand and wish it all went away by censoring and silencing people who speak out against it! Let's get this out there, while this game mode might be enjoyed by a small handful of PvE players who like to play with their families or may have special access needs, this game mode is not enjoyed by the majority of PvE players, for its simple yet obvious attempt at giving the PvE community the middle finger by cutting profits/ rewards, taking away captained ships, blocking voyages and MORE! The attempts to silence people and delete their comments only go to show that anyone who does not agree with the dev's FAILED VISION of a PvP-only game will be silenced!

Like many others, I have spent real-world money on this game and in the EPIC store buying skins, etc, helping to keep the community, the player base, and the game alive (Not to mention pay these devs/ mods bills). I am sincerely appalled at the moderators and the dev team for their actions in silencing people for having opposing views that may shine a light on their actions and calling them out for it. In an age where censorship is the only way to enforce your point - it is disturbing to see it happening here too. I have compiled and will continue to compile video evidence of the censorship taking place on these forums which may make a great video one day - who knows? ;).

All I know is, IF you have read this far, and are considering buying this game, I would carefully think about your valuable REAL WORLD COIN, because if you do and are hoping the game will be a welcome place where you can act like a Pirate but have fun in the game - you may want to think again! The support structure in place both in these forums, and at Rare will not support any grievance you have - PvP tickets raised for toxic behaviour go unaddressed, and you had better not have an opposing view to that of the game devs or stand from under because you're in for hell if you do!

IF the Devs truly cared about the game, and their ""Vision"" they would listen to their community and adapt accordingly, take Fortnite for example, it listens to its community and adapts to the times giving its players what they ask for, because of it, they make MILLIONS of dollars a week (Estimated 8Billion in 2023 from 6 Billion in 2022) and are one of the most successful games running for many years now. If the Devs want to look at successful game models, Fortnite is one, along with many others, and paying attention to what's working and what isn't FOR YOUR COMMUNITY is how you run a successful business/ game! It's really that simple!

I know that I will cop a lot of abuse from these select group of players in these forums against this post, however, I have said what needed to be said and am not afraid to stick up for what's right and wrong! I am no sheep!

(I know this comment/ post will probably be deleted and probably see me banned again, but I have other ways I can get this comment out if so!).",1703232986,1703232986,False,239,28,0.759079933166503906,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

For one, I can't scale the FOV and I end up getting motion sick from it - which is rare (get it?) for that to happen to me as usually I can stomach VR and a few other things, but I always adjust the FOV to my preferences.

For another, since I'm usually stuck playing alone which isn't really a problem, it limits a lot of what I can do and I'm not keen for jumping onto a ship with totally random players. This leaves me prey to much larger groups of players (Who can come off as overtly toxic in many situations)

But the game is a beautifully well done game. Polished well with a strong idea and interesting approach (albeit slow) for combat. I wish there were proper combo's with the sword fighting, timed parry/blocking mechanics which just aren't really there. But the game proves to have a lot of merit with friends - but again, the PvP in the game can ruin it as almost every PvP scenario I've been in has usually been with toxic groups of players much larger than my own friend group

Or those camping nearby settlements with a larger group then my own friend group.

So the game becomes more of a chore then anything else. Perhaps I am missing a key component of the gameplay, but I know (inherently by playing it) the gameplay IS solid, the game is near bugless from my experience, and the stories on the islands, the missions and characters are all lively. Then there is the art-style of the gameplay in itself which is quite well done.

It's nothing as Rare as Rares' original titles years ago, but it is still a good game none-the-less even with my own issues about it. Granted I barely touch the game as playing solo is... well... kinda hell.",1703133773,1703133773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After having gone through the adventure, I can securely say that any Monkey Island fan would love this game. How the Monkey Island tales are handled was extremely enjoyable, it follows much of the pathway taken in the first Monkey Island within an isolated arc of Sea of Thieves. The nostalgia is so spot on with considerable attention taken to make it meaningfully funny, the most important significance of this was in introducing pirate insult sword-fighting. Such a juxtaposition to the base game and such honest work put in to uplift the wittiness that made the point-and-click adventures so fun.

Game have very player unfriendly and very unintuitive set of concept of functions, in such way, that you have very hard to find any functions of game while inside of the game. For example, there is no indignation how you even do quests (or ""voyages"" as game call them). You need search from internet how these works. Often also in-game hints, for example where you sell this item you have in your hand, are misleading and not helpful. -""Go outpost"" -""Well, this is outpost. We both are in outpost"". Etc.

Content for ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Monkey Island"" are very lazily and poorly done, although latter one had at least some try. They felt more like poorly made ""ghost train"" in a theme park.

Game does not have any skill development nor items which have different stats, all items are just cosmetic. Of course this means, that it does very little matter if you die, since you cannot lose anything but your loot. But at least for me, it make the game more pointless. There is no progress. Ever.

Player base seems to be toxic. There is player groups who wait in certain points of map, where they know people more likely will come, just in order to kill them. For example final quest of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", groups wait that other players are in most vulnerable position, sink their ship, and kill those players who want experice the story. There is no loot, so there is no benefits from ruining other player's experience, except sadistic satisfaction. Developers made this all possible, and they do not care such things, they are very happy with toxicity on community.

Recently there been added ""Safer Seas"" mode, where you can play alone with your crew in private server. However, developers want punish people who do not want PvP and give only 30% of in-game-currencty if you play with this way, as well, as locking parts of game content away. Developers could chose actually make very interesting PvM servers, where all players would seen friendly and loot would be tied for crew who made the quest or event where it was got. And adding more spawns in areas where is more players, make world bit more dangerous, but manageable. But no. Developers do not want players to have fun. You can only play with sadists or alone.

This game is not made to be fun to play, but just to be money-maker by micro transactions with cosmetic items. Everything in it seems to be done as little effort as possible.

I played this game on game pass when it came out and around a year later. And maybe one more time again a year later.  I love this game's atmosphere and the visuals, how you control your ship, and the awesome voyages. Where the game doesn't hold your hand. You need to search for treasure and solve riddles. But i got irritated really fast about how you can't avoid PvP.
In the early times people were attacking each other simply for the loot. But with time and with the growing popularity amongs streamers who constantly invented and popularized new ways to grief and troll people, the community became more and more toxic.

So many people wanted to have PvE from the beginning. 

I promised myself, i will only buy this game when they add PvE.
And they did, and i kept myself to the promise.

Yeas there are restrictions in PvE. You earn only 30%f the gold you can earn in PvP. And a small number of endgame activities are not available. Yes i would love to see these restrictions go. But i don't care neither. I love sailing the seas without some random toxic person constantly ruining my enjoyment. 

Nice addition. Love it.

I'm finally able to make a review of this game, I hope it will help you decide if this game is worth it! I'll probably update this review the further I play. For now I'll be talkin about the [b]Adventure mode[/b] :)

Pros :
-Cool graphics and simulation of a pirate life.
-It's a game where you either get addicted or hate it in the first hours.
-Funnier with friends or randoms, but you'll learn so much faster in solo trust me.
-Satisfying sensation when you sink ennemies boats and grab their loot.
-Good game if you want to chill and kill time (but sometimes it can be stressful especially if you have a lot of loots and you're getting focused by a reaper or red flag emissaries).
-Active developer team (monthly updates, quick reactivity on problems in-game through their tweeter, so I would recommend to follow them there to not miss a thing and to always be aware of what's happening).
-A lot to experience, Stories, PVP, Fishing, Treasure Hunting, defeating Skeletons, world events, Seasonal events, Shipfight, collecting all achievements, and laugh with strangers :D

Cons:
-Intensive grind.
-Boring after a while.
-Lack of content eventhough it was way worse back when it came out in 2018.
-FPS optimization is a joke on islands (At full ultra I go from 120fps to 55 fps on big islands).
-PVP mechanic is old and boring (idk maybe they need to add some new guns or mechanics).
-Bugs after new updates are not even a surprise anymore.
-Servers issues is normal and the community is used to it (so an advice would be to never do an event the day it comes out because you probably won't receive your loot's coins, XP and achievements).
-Some events are only visible on their website and not in-game so sometimes you can miss them (Just stop it, we are lazy and hate to go through google to see our fck in-game event progression, just put it in game already ffs it's 2020).

Overall the game has a lot of problems but I still love the concept it does represent otherwise I wouldn't have reach one of the highest titles you can earn and I hope this game will continue to get the support it deserves. I haven't played such a great game in a while, so if you like intensive farming, bugs, coop and pvp but also the big map you're in the right place. We'll be waiting for you on the ocean :)

PS: If you're a veteran please help new players and don't bully them, that's what I do and I would have loved to be helped too when I started, so please do so they will always remember you, thanks fellow Legends.



[h1]Edit 1:[/h1]
So after 3 months, the game is still awesome, probably one of the best open world in multiplayer that I've played in a while. Nothing better but to fish with friends during late nights.



[h1]Edit 2:[/h1]
They finally added an Even tab in-game! Anyway I've been playing [b]Arena[/b], joined a competitive team and reached Legendary Sea Dog. So the Arena mode is way different from the actual game (adventure). It also have its pros and cons so here we go :

For the positive aspects :
- Helps you improve cannon shots
- Helps you improve your weapon accuracy
- TDM (Team deathmatch) is a lot of fun! It's like the endgame community event in the Arena
- You can make friends in this mode
- Since the last Arena patch, there's only one chest now and it's way better than before

Some negative aspects :
- Hitregs (When you hit players usually with weapons and you have the hitmarker but the server didn't register the damage, so sometimes you'll need to hit 3-4 time the player before he dies, and sometimes you may think they're cheater)
- Lobby waiting time : because the Arena mode is not the main mode, the playerbase is not that big here, so you might wait 10-30min in the worst case...
- Server region merge : Yeah well sometimes there's no server in EU (in my exemple) at certain hours and I usually get matched with NA players and I have an average of 200-250ms
- FPS optimization (Even on High-End PC you'll probably struggle to maintain a stable 144fps



[h1]Edit 3:[/h1]
They removed their own game mode called Arena. I don't know if it would now be an interesting game for pirate that love to pvp...
Quite a sad day for Sea of Thieves...



[h1]Edit 4:[/h1]
They added an alternative to the Arena inside of the Adventure mode!
Which means that you can now activate a totem on your boat which will transport you against another equivalent ship. Basically a great thing for the pvp community! Not tom mention you can customize your own ship, name it how you want, and even create or joind a Guild!

At the current state, I would seriously recommend this game to every gamers wanting to experience some adventure in the pirate world. In 2023 there is a lot of things to do, explore, farm, fight, collect and stories to experiences which are really amazing.

Sometimes there are small bugs or bigger ones that you laugh at with your friends, but overall it's very fun. Any gold you earn in this game is spent on cosmetics, more quests, and becoming a captains. Though I will say the amount you spend on quests is pretty much pocket change. It definitely takes a while to really learn the mechanics of the game, and learning with a friend is best. However, if you don't have a friend who has played this game before definitely check out the official Sea of Thieves discord. It's a hub for players to go to to find crews with the same goals or someone to teach you the ropes of the game. Everyone uses it.
It is worth noting that this game runs through Xbox and thus requires a Microsoft account to play. So, if you play on steam you'll mostly be inviting people with the game bar, also occasionally on steam the updates can be a tad glitched but entirely fixable. Would recommend.
I will also say it is in the nature of this game for their to be a lot of PVP and ship battle and stealing. It's a pirate game.

Edit: The end was a bit toxic so I deleted, but I want to address the PVP vs PVE people  in the reviews of this game. I honestly really enjoy playing both parts of the games and my ideal run of Sea of Thieves is when I have a fairly even amount of player fights and normal in-game missions or whatever. I understand the sentiment of players who really enjoy the PVE elements and don't want to be involved with PVP. I used to feel the same way when I was new to the game, but sometimes I feel like people fail to realize what this game is. It's about being pirates and stealing from each other and the world. I've realized the longer that I've played that's it's not really about winning the battles with players, it's about enjoying playing the game with them. I have sunk and been sunk by many different in the game, and I love it everytime. This game is honestly one of my favorites.

Note to struggling players: If you are struggling with getting levels and playing the game because you can't make progress let me help you out here.
1. A lot of PVP players will choose whether or not a ship has an emissary flag flying as the deciding factor for attacking you. If you have an emissary on you are a target, but also you should always be flying an emissary to get more xp.
2.If you are really struggling with PVP people I would highy recommend going to the discord and asking for help for a more veteran player. It really helps to be able to learn how to defend yourself better. Honestly, I was carried a lot before I could hold my own. If you don't want the help, server hop.
3.Avoid going solo unless you know what you're doing
4.PVP is a major part of this game and there is no avoiding it unless you want a massive cut in gold and reputation in the safer seas. I personally think the PVP is great, but please consider that if you do not like PVP you may not like this game as much.",1686964005,1703001295,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed exploring and doing quests etc. I had treasure and was omw back to port when i got attacked by  another player who proceeded to kill me and took everything. This game boils down to pvp and get full game with everything but you have a huge chance of getting killed over and over and lose it or play safer seas and get penalized hard across the board. Less treasure, alot of content not available. There are those of us who want to enjoy the FULL game with everything and NOT be forced into pvp. I do NOT enjoy pvp. I never have. Better idea would be release full pve version with dedicated pvp servers for those who do love pvp. This game could be awesome. In a full pve version  would be easy to put in a random encounter generator making pve random pirate attacks a thing. In that scenario the player would NOT be spawn camped etc. It can be done. Boils down to if the devs even care about their overall fan base or just the pvp fan base. Everyone does NOT like pvp. Until the game balances better i will not return. Their fan base could BE HUGE if a pve version was released. Make more in game purchases etc. I spent 20 years in upper retail management.

Now, you can sail with your crew and not have any other players on the map. The issue is... its shit. Ontop of the fact all rewards are accrued at a pathetically low 30% of the rate they are in the normal mode, you're also capped to level 40 in all trading companies. The reward reduction is actually even harsher than 30% since you can't play as an Emissary. Even if you're fine losing out on potential rewards, you also can't bring your own ship in, so say goodbye to that level of customization. Guilds are also flat-out impossible to level. If this update interested you, just know it sucks.

This game is a lot of fun... if you have exactly 3 friends willing to play it with you. In any other situation, I wouldn't recommend it. Its equally refreshing and baffling in its design. 
There's no permanent progression system, every time you boot up the game you essentially start fresh minus unlocking more content and cosmetics. That's very unique for this sort of game, but I wish you could at least carry SOME stuff over, like having a permanent inventory. It makes stuff like fishing feel kinda superfluous.
The meat of the game is looting treasure, hidden on islands and stolen from ghost ships. Finding treasure with maps and hints is really fun, the sailing is enjoyable, but the one thing that ruins the entire experience is other players. Essentially everyone you meet is going to try and grief you. If you're a solo player, prepare to have literal hours of work lost because another crew ganged up on you and stole all your treasure. If your ship is lost, you lose EVERYTHING you haven't sold. There's absolutely no way to prevent it from happening. You WILL eventually get snuck up on and lose your ship. Its just a gamble on if you survive long enough to sell.
If you can find a full crew, you stand a chance, but alone you're just fucked.",1696825035,1702952909,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've greatly enjoyed exploring, sailing, collecting skulls and finding treasure and finally able to pursue Tall Tales without player disruption. I personally don't mind the reduced rep and gold for voyages if it means I get to enjoy the game without forced PvP. Safer Seas is a great addition! 

The game is SUPER beautiful and the water and sailing were really amazing experiences.

Though if you are a working professional without a lot of time to play games and you really want to enjoy the time you DO get, don't get this game.  You'll be griefed by some 12 old year who watches Twich all day and just steals your stuff.  I understand the irony of getting your stuff pirated in a pirate game but I did not realize it was a forced PvP game and I thought I'd have the option to turn that off.

I fumbled my way through the first 4 hours of the game (which the game does a terrible job explaining what you actually need to do...) and found a few magic skulls and finally started getting the hang out of finding treasure.  Found my first chest and so I had my two skulls and my chest in my ship.  Was trying to find another chest when I see some player making off with one of my skulls.  I tried to sail away but he just blasted my ship to pieces before I could even get away... after he sunk me I lost all of my progress that I just made effectively wasting that 4 hours of game play.

I don't have the time or patience to deal with PvP nonesense.  Save that for the kidos who have the time to waste. Requesting a refund for this game until they add a PvE option for those of us who are older than 14.",1591422786,1702921669,True,0,0,0.483017116785049438,0,True,False,False

Acting like a pirate and sailing the sea is an experience I was missing out on in life.
I will warn that the story campaigns can bug out sometimes, for example I had to redo the mermaid story-line because the mermaids wouldn't spawn so I was unable to progress through the story and had to restart, luckily it worked fine the 2nd time around.
The puzzles in the game are SO MUCH FUN! I'm a sucker for finding clues and solving puzzles. I also really love taking a treasure map and finding the buried hidden goodies under the sand/dirt, it gives a rush of happiness when you find the right spot.
So the PvE aspect of this game is really enjoyable, especially when playing with friends. The PvP aspect can be a bit troublesome if you don't have friends to play with you that you can coordinate with, or a good team on your side in general, it can be pretty challenging and frustrating especially when the enemy ship players can yell curses and other inappropriate stuff at you with the proximity voice chat so if you're not a fan of the classic toxicity that comes along with PvP then I don't recommend playing PvP. I do believe there is an option to sail ""safe"" seas (or change the instance you're in to a different one) so that you don't have to worry about other players coming to attack you and steal the loot you worked hard for.
I will say the game can get kind of repetitive after a while and I feel like they should add more things to do, perhaps adding some mini-games of some kind on the city islands could be a real fun way to bring more of the community together. Because that's honestly another complaint of mine is that I don't run into people very often, unless they're chasing me to attack me or unless I'm chasing them to attack them. So I feel like there's a lack of PvE player interaction. I know you can just join random people's ships with the xbox group finder but honestly what is the fun in that? I would much rather naturally run into someone on an island trying to work together to play a mini-game or solve a puzzle together or something, I think that would be much more fun and immersive.
I also have to mention that if you get motion sickness easily then maybe don't play this game. You're spending A LOT of time out at sea and the swaying of the ship could mess with you. I played with a friend who has motion sickness and he couldn't play for very long because of it so just be cautious of that.
As far as everything else goes, I have a blast playing this game and especially recommend playing with friends because that's where the true fun happens when you are goofing around on the ship playing music or drinking until you barf or petting each other's pets or helping your crew blast an enemy ship down or solving puzzles together. It's overall a perfect game to play with friends! (you can fish too if you want a more chill activity)
And if you ARE a Pirates of the Caribbean fan, this game will be even more up your ally!

So I initially gave this game a positive review, but with the Safer Seas update, I can't recommend this to the general populous anymore. 

For those of you who are unaware, Safer Seas is Rare's poor attempt at a PvE mode. Basically, you make 30% what you normally would in PvP servers, have a very stringent level cap, can't be an emissary, can't use your own captained ship(s), can't participate in guilds, and can't even participate in quite a few missions.

This mode is a joke and a slap in the face to those who just want to chill out and go on adventures with friends, or just roleplay as a god damn pirate. 

This is especially insulting since there are a ton of toxic players who will shout slurs at you and hunt you down for several hours if you dare even slight them. And if you report them for being toxic, Rare is very unlikely to do anything about it. Keep in mind this is not even considering the fact that Rare won't do anything about the rampant cheater problem that has existed since the game came out in 2018.

I love this game to death and have sunk hundreds of hours into it across xbox and pc, but I cannot in good faith recommend this to people. 

Rare, for the love that all is holy, stop treating people who have full time jobs, people who are in school, and people who generally just have lives as second class citizens in this amazing world you have crafted, lest you lose even more respect than people already have in you.",1679036196,1702837521,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Your gold and reputation gains are much lower than in the pvp mode and you are capped at level 40 with many features straight up not beeing avaliable in this mode.

All this mode is is a way for rare to try and lure in some fresh blood for the diehard pvp players. Because eventually you will have to enter pvp mode if you want to experience all the game has to offer. Get ready to be trolled, griefed, spawn camped and called racial slurs. The community of this game is toxic and as a new player you don't stand a chance against the people playing this game for years now. Nothing is more frustrating than to loot some treasures and bring it to a harbor only to be killed by a bored veteran a couple of feet in front of the merchant, effectively deleting all your progress of the last hours. 

Also the controls and combat feel incredibly dated and clunky and everything about this game just screams ""I am a console game"". Even within the first few hours you will feel like you've done it all before, the missions are repetitiv and quite boring, there is nothing to unlock aside from cosmetics and nothing to change up your gameplay.

Avast, me hearties! Let me spin ye a yarn about the wondrous seas of Sea of Thieves, a realm where the salty air be filled with tales of plunder, perilous battles, and the allure of hidden treasures.

First and foremost, let's talk about the beauty of this vast expanse. The seas stretch out like a canvas painted by the Almighty himself, with sunsets that set the sky ablaze in a riot of colors. The waves, me mateys, they dance and frolic, a constant reminder that the sea be a fickle mistress. The islands, draped in verdant greenery and shadowy caves, be beckoning like sirens, tempting us to explore their secrets.

But what truly sets the heart pounding is the clash of steel and thunder on the treacherous battleground known as Hourglass. The roar of cannons, the splintering of wood, and the taste of sea spray in the air – it's the symphony of chaos that every true pirate lives for. Hourglass be a crucible where crews lock horns in ship-to-ship combat, and let me tell ye, there be no sweeter victory than sending a rival to Davy Jones' locker.

Picture this, me hearties: the wind howling through the rigging, the ships weaving and dodging like a dance of death. It be a spectacle that would make even the Flying Dutchman shiver in its ghostly timbers. The thrill of the fight be like a shot of the finest grog, warming the belly and quickening the pulse.

But a pirate's life ain't all cutlasses and cannonballs. Nay, there be moments of quiet reflection and camaraderie. Sailing the open seas with naught but the wind at yer back and the creak of the ship beneath yer boots – it be a balm for the soul. The freedom to chart yer own course, discover hidden coves, and dig up the spoils of buried treasure be the essence of the pirate's code.

And then there be the tales of Glitter Beard, a legend among legends. The encounters with this mysterious soul and others like him be the stuff of legend, passed down from one pirate to the next around the tavern fire. Ally or adversary, the unpredictability of these interactions be the true spice of the Sea of Thieves.

In the end, Sea of Thieves be more than a game; it be a saga of high seas adventure, where every ebb and flow, every battle won and treasure plundered, be etched into the annals of pirate lore. So, me hearties, hoist the Jolly Roger, set sail for the horizon, and let the Sea of Thieves weave its tale around ye!",1702764043,1702764043,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

(clearly I have almost 600 hours in just like 8 months) Occasionally the PVP gets to me and I rage-quit, but with a competent crew I was able to learn and get better. And I really love this game now. And I am more confident in my abilities than I was when I first bought the game.

And I am extremely happy that safer seas was added, because now (when my dad actually gets around to making his damn pc, bastard) I can introduce my dad to the normal PVE loop without the toxicity of the PVP community. (And eventually we would switch to the high seas, for more gold!) And for many other new or young players this is a great thing. I have seen many kids playing with their fathers on here, and in the same server I hear people screaming the N word at the top of their lungs, so having safer seas as an option, it is nice to avoid the toxicity of the community and just to learn the regular PVE loop! You can learn to aim cannons by fighting off skeleton ships, you can learn the sword to sword combat by doing tall tales or just going on islands, without the worry of some sweats chasing you out of the map. 

The biggest problem I have with the actual game is that they prioritize pay piggy content and not new actual good quests.

My Xbox yearly wrap-up revealed that I am among the top 5% of players in the world in number of hours played this year so I feel qualified to give my opinion. As a matter of fact, I don’t think I’ve ever put so many hours into a game previously and it quickly became one of my favorite titles. It’s a great game but not without its faults. It has one of the most toxic but also most incredibly awesome and friendly communities I have ever experienced in a game. My all-time favorite multiplayer memories come from this game. But there are a few things that you will need to be comfortable with in order to really enjoy it: 

-	It is a grind. There is no skill leveling other than naturally getting better at things through practice (more on that later) and very few items that you can unlock will give you a tactical advantage over other players. The items that DO provide a small advantage (which is mostly because of some small detail in the item’s artistic design that comes across as almost accidental) are slowly being nerfed. The number one way that veteran players have to demonstrate their skill and experience is through expensive in-game cosmetics and those cosmetics take a very very long time and often require repeating the same task hundreds or in some cases thousands of times (that’s not an exaggeration). If you do not like repetition this is not the game for you. This game will afford you few advantages beyond “getting good” through run of the mill practice and experience.

-	If you have anxiety in any form this game is probably not for you. It takes a long time to amass gold and it is incredibly easy to lose it. You will earn and lose fortunes in High Seas mode. It’s part of what makes the game fun (there is no reward without risk, after all) but the paranoia can be incredibly nerve wracking and overwhelming – particularly when you are starting out and don’t yet know the “systems” for earning large amounts of gold more efficiently in the game.

-	The game does not hold your hand and will not teach you anything. And, for the most part, neither will internet searches. You must learn from experience, observation, and anecdotes from more veteran players. Which really does make the game feel authentically old-timey and special. There is nothing like finding a crusty veteran player who is jaded as heck and befriending them to learn all the tricks. The best thing that you can do is find a mentor – just don’t be overly trusting because it is a pirate game and even the nicest players constantly have their guard up. After a while you will have amassed quite a few preferences and habits to improve your survival and make yourself more efficient. Some of these are the results of intentional design features but many of them are taking advantage of loopholes in the design principles. There are many of these that the devs purposefully leave in the game and encourage and others that they patch. They have gone on the record of saying “if Jack Sparrow could do it it’s fair game”. An example would be that fighting other ships on the left side of your Sloop decreases your chances of being sunk because there are two spots along the left bulkhead of your ship that lack hitboxes due to the placement of your ship’s grog barrel and bunk and therefore the left side cannot take the same number of holes as your right side can. The game is full of little “hacks” like this to learn on your own. I learn something new almost every time I play over six hundred hours later. 

-	The developers are currently more concerned with revenue in the form of their Plunder Pass, microtransactions, and real-world merchandise sales than anything else. I don’t blame them for this – they have to feed their families. And they do give out quite a few freebies through Twitch streams and in-game events if you monitor their social media channels and participate in events. But because of their focus on continuous revenue…

-	The game has a lot of bugs. This is a big frustration to game fans. The game lacks anti-cheat and the money that players spend seems to be funneled into new cosmetics to purchase with real money rather than anti-cheat, new content/events, or bug fixes. Oftentimes the bugs are Bethesda-level hilarious like flying ships but other times they are frustrating and game-breaking like a ship-sinking invisible rock that has been present in the center of the map for months. These can be particularly frustrating when they prevent you from turning in a large hoard of treasure that you have spent a few hours collecting. 

All of that being said, the game really is fun. There is nothing more exhilarating than fighting off a rival pirate crew attempting to steal your loot or joining forces with all of the rest of the server to maximize your gains together until one crew inevitably tries to betray the rest and make off with everything. I’ve made the best long-lasting sincere gamer friendships with strangers that I’ve met playing this game and have yet to grow tired of playing it. But I’ve also met players who made me question humanity and caused me to rage quit. Know what you’re getting into and evaluate whether or not you can handle the frustrations. It’s an incredibly beautiful and fun sandbox to make friends in and explore.

Honestly really good, except yk the community sometimes

so edit:
After having had played for a while i decided to stop playing this game for a very long time, specifically, over a year now. And the reason was that events, adventures, seasons and the like were passing by way to fast, in comparison to how long you need to play the game to actually complete them. Not everyone can just sit down and play the game for 5 hours a day, and if you only play an hour at a time, you're never gonna get anything done, because you start getting emmisary bonuses and other once you've invested enough in a session. My other gripe with this game how grindy and reppetitive it was. As a wannabe completionist I want to do all the achievements, unlock everything, do all the events, but I just started finding myself playing this game less and less, because it started feeling slower and slower while limited time things just kept going by faster and faster, if i didn't play for a week or two, i would be forever locked out of some cool sails or equipment just because i didn't play at that specific point in time. 
And the thing that killed me off finally was the removal of Arena mode. While i didn't play it much, I was still appreciative of it existing, because I knew that whenever I wanted something more fast paced I could have it, but they chose to remove it, not only was I mad that I couldn't play arena, but I was more mad that my arena related achievements and equipment could never be completed and unlocked again, leaving me in a completionist hellscape of half finished things.

Now I havent kept up with anything news related for this game while ive been away. Maybe they've improved the aspects i disliked, maybe they've brought back arena, who knows, I sure don't. I will possibly try it out again soon, but no promises.

And to wrap this up, I still reccomend the game, the time I had with it were some of my most enjoyable days and hangouts with friends and strangers, but I don't know how ready I am to come back to it. Peace.",1629179385,1702756823,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have the most fun in high seas with a group of four friends.

But I do not like playing single player high seas. It just feels like I waste hours of my time to try and do anything just to get smacked down. With friends, I don't mind so much because that moment feels shared with other people.

You could argue as a first argument, just get better at the game. In fact I may go so far as to say you may be right in that response.

But I have other games I like to play, and other things I like to invest my time in. Spending countless hours in sea of thieves getting better at combat just so I'm not grieved as much, I just simply do not want to do. Is that a me problem? Maybe. But I want to enjoy the game without that element.

So here's the part with safer seas. It exists. And it is not terrible. However the inability to enjoy many features that are present in high seas in one thing, however the amount of things limited in safer seas, and how little money is earned feels more like a punishment on players like me than enabling a different way to play for me. It just feels unfriendly.

I understand that Rare likely wants people to enjoy this game in a specific way. And that way may be the true multiplayer sandbox experience. However it has a large presence of what in my opinion, is toxic players, that I find very difficult to avoid. It is discouraging, and largely makes me feel that Sea of Thieves just might not be a game for me most times as a result.

Safer seas, I admit, I am happy has enabled me to be able to enjoy the beautiful world of Sea of Thieves without such toxicity. Despite it's glaring flaws, I still play it. The fact I can lose hours in it and feel nice afterward I think is a telltale sign that the game is clearly fun in some way, at least to me.

I like this game, I have for a long time and that has not changed. But I dread the idea that I may need to accept, still, that this game may not be for me for how Rare seems to want it played. That is fine, but I repeat -- the amount of time I feel I need to invest to properly enjoy how they prefer people play it, is just time I'd prefer to spend elsewhere.
Which is a tragedy, because this I find is the only modern game that has Rare character written all over it. And I wish I could enjoy it more outside of friend groups.",1702686533,1702686771,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Micortransaction cosmetics are better for ships than at launch (14.99 USD vs 42.00) but still very steep.

Best with friends, don't buy unless you can tolerate the 15 year olds""

Well they've finely given in and made those PvE server everyone and their grandmother's dog was asking for. There is an air of bitterness about it though, as the developers had sworn never to do PvE servers and actively tried to suppress the request on the forums. As a result they've taken some of their frustration out on you. They won't let you sail around the ship you named, or use some of the cosmetics you purchased, Make pirate legend, and a few other things.

I've tried many times in the past to play Sea of Thieves but while I was always minding my own business on my little sloop, there were always some irritable and toxic people who enjoyed ruining my enjoyment of the game. While I understand that the game was meant to be a pvpve, I stopped so many times because I simply wasn't having fun at all. Even my friends didn't wanted to play with me because of the pvp so I was stuck to play solo. Now with the Safer Seas mode, we all can finally enjoy the game I was hoping for to play since launch and do the campaigns we were waiting to do for a long time!

There are no skills, special abilities or tools/weapons outside of what you start the game with. It gets dry pretty quick. Although this game does have tons of locations and interesting missions, its plagued with griefers and dedicated PvP players. Although there is a Arena, most of the remaining player base is dedicated to attacking players in the open servers. If you have a group of exactly 4 friends than you can take a large ship and explore/loot in a somewhat quick and rewarding fashion, and easily take on the 1-3 player PvP groups that attack anything that moves regardless of its worth/faction. If your into PvP there is a faction dedicated to killing players and it rewards you with cosmetic items and in game currency that can be used to buy cosmetic items... its worthless to play PvP. At least with the non-PvP story missions you get some interesting quests to fight waves of enemies and ghosts along with traps and puzzles. Anyways if you get it on sale for $5 or less its worth the few hours of game-play and exploration with friends.

(Edit 60+hrs) Fishing in this game is good. worth checking out for like $5.00-10.00. At least there are private servers now..... BUT THE DEVELOPERS SAID 70% CUT FROM ALL PROFITS in private servers, and they removed some of the in game missions/content while in a private lobby... I guess Ill need to bounce between both lobbies now. Whats the point of ""balancing"" private lobbies when nothing has any value. All content in this game is cosmetic. nothing acquired in game affects the game-play SO WHY ARE THERE 70% CUTS!!!",1610593105,1702622743,False,8,0,0.519455075263977051,0,True,False,False

Great game. Sailing is fun, Combat is fun. Voyages are more fun by yourself, but world events and PVP is better with friends. But either way it is an amazing game to play with your friends. 8/10 Would recomend.

Review at 167.8 hours:

Amazing game. Compared to everything else, voyages are not very fun by yourself or with friends. However combat is still very fun. World events are fun to do by yourself or with friends. PVP is hard, annoying, and just not fun when you start playing. However when you accept the fact that PVP is an essential part of the game, it gets very fun and exciting. Hourglass PVP introduced in season 8 is a great way to get better at it. I'm by no means good at PVP but i have gotten way better at it and I no longer run from every ship I see. 

In short, great game. Buy it if you like pirates and playing with friends, you will have a lot of fun.

Review at 286.2 hours:

It's still a great game, which is why I still rate it 8.5/10, however, after unlocking the Skeleton Curse, and then unlocking Pirate Legend, the game has been pretty bland lately. Season 9 lasted about 7 months which was way too long for what it was; a QoL update. With that being said, Season 10 is not that special either. I also despise the decision to add PvE servers into the game come December 2023. I wish Rare would focus on making the game less buggy and fun instead of making pointless updates that completely go against the premise of the game. 
People don't understand that the constant risk of another pirate stealing the treasure you found is what makes the game fun. If you can't handle one of the core aspects of this game, it is not for you. 

Tldr: It's a skill issue if you can't handle PvP. Get good.
