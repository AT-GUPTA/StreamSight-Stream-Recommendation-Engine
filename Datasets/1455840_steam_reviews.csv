-Dorfromantik is a really peaceful, well designed management puzzler.  This game is great.  It has a really cool visual style, has a really tranquil soundtrack, and is super easy to learn but offers some strategic decision making w/ every choice you make.  While I do think there is a good amount of depth, my favorite part of this game is how easy it is to play while doing other things.  It's a great pallet cleanser after playing a really demanding game.  Having said that, some ppl are able to string together crazy high scores that I could only dream of, so clearly this is a skill based game w/ a decent learning curve.  

Consensus:
-Solid Game (Tier 3 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  I recently compared this game to Can't Live Without Electricity, and I think there is a good amount of overlap between the two.  I do prefer CLWE, but I think this game is really fun too.  I also think this is an easier game to learn, feels less chaotic, and has such a cool visual aesthetic.  I think the price point is spot on, but is really easy to recommend if there is any form of discount available.",1708714809,1708714853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Doing these actions gives you more tiles and if you run out then it's game over.

On a casual level, this game is great. I love seeing the world come slowly to life, along with the brain teasing conundrums you run into when you get low on tiles. There's also a creative mode so you can just build whatever you want. However, I personally think high level Dorfromantik is fundamentally flawed in a way that could only be fixed from redesigning the whole game from the ground up. You see, completing quests is not the only way for you to get tiles. If you create a ""perfect"" tile (aka all 6 of its sides are matching), you get an extra tile. This might not sound like much, but then you realize that in later parts of the game this means you get 1 tile for placing a tile plus the rewards from missions means you can effectively go infinite (and people have). The problem is that perfect tiles are so important that they make missions pretty much worthless- it is actively better to squander a mission and never close patches of tiles in favor of making more perfects. This also means that the pace of the game slows down exponentially as your board gets bigger, as you find yourself scanning for tens of minutes for just the right place to use your tile.

This wouldn't be a problem for most players since it's a ""casual"" game, but then paradoxically the game wants you to reach ridiculous scores to complete its meta-progression quests, which means inevitably you will stumble upon this truth if you want to get better. Some people may enjoy this style of gameplay, but I find that it clashes with the atmosphere of the game and building a little land of your own, as you're no longer thinking about how your tiles look placed down and more at the cold hard numbers.

All that being said, I'm sure for a lot of people this scratches that OCD itch, and more power to them. It's not like I'm immune to it either, I just would have liked it if the game incentivized you better when you become really skilled. I may not enjoy it much anymore, but I'm still giving it a positive review because I definitely got my money's worth of entertainment out of it before I began to have issues.",1707811150,1707811320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw it, I now knew what I had to do to get a higher and higher score.

YES - its a zen builder.

If you like getting happy little dopamine hits one after another in a cozy setting this is your game. You get tons of micro rewards every time you place a tile down, medium ones when you complete progress quests and after a while you can zoom out and admire the unique Dorfdom map you created for a big 'ol sense of achievement!

And all at the pace of your choosing with absolutely no negativity or stress. You literally can't lose - even when you run out of tiles you can choose to carry on in creative mode. Dorfromantik is:

Starting from one placed tile you begin the game with a stack of 40 randomized hex tiles with each tile being a set of different environments.

The game play mode offers a series of different tasks/quests to be unlocked through manipulation of the hex tiles, spinning them (or not in the case of one achievement) to get the best combinations to fulfill the objectives unlocking new tiles/achievement lines.  Through the finishing of these tasks you get additional tiles added to your queue and the game continues until you run out of tiles.

[b]Dorfromantik is a delightful and visually stunning city-building game that captivates players with its charm and engaging gameplay. While it might not be an entirely laid-back experience, it cleverly balances relaxation with strategic thinking, making it a thoroughly enjoyable journey.

One of the standout features is the variety of modes available. The ability to manually customize tile generation in different modes adds a layer of personalization, allowing players to tailor the game rules to their preferences. Monthly activities bring a competitive edge, offering a chance to compete with others and showcase your creativity.

The creative mode is a highlight, providing a blank canvas where you can generate any tile and construct your dream world. It's a testament to the game's versatility and the freedom it grants players to shape their unique landscapes.

Dorfromantik goes beyond the typical city-building experience by integrating Steam achievements seamlessly into the game. Completing in-game challenges not only unlocks in-game accomplishments but also mirrors as achievements on Steam. These tasks serve as dynamic objectives, prompting players to adapt their strategies‚Äîwhether it's creating expansive waterways, intricate railway networks, or dense forests.

I highly recommend Dorfromantik to anyone seeking a refreshing and engaging city-building game. Kudos to the developers for crafting such an enjoyable experience that seamlessly blends creativity with strategy.

For some reason I thought there would be levels, but it's just one main level where you try to beat your high score (plus a creative mode, too, which is nice).

There will be quests and requirements that get you thinking about tile placement and how to achieve better scores. You'll get better as you practice.

In the menu you will also see challenges you can work towards as you play the game. You can get new tiles/skins by completing them. They are linked in with the Steam achievements. There are base challenges such as ""place 250 tiles in total"" and ""gain a highscore of 10,000"". But the other challenges you need to unlock.

This is where I feel a bit iffy. To unlock a new challenge, a pre-placed tile will appear on the board, slightly further out. You then have to build up to that point to ""uncover"" that tile. It will have its own quest which you must fulfil to add the challenge to your menu.

These extra challenges will be things like ""score two perfect placements at once"" or ""build a forest with at least 250 trees"". In my opinion, these should already be unlocked from the get-go. It feels weird to have to obtain the challenge card first - especially if you've already done some of these requirements! I don't know, I just like getting achievements without stipulations...

That aside, it's a good puzzle game. It's pretty to look at and my favourite part is the different biome tiles which give you different colours across the board.

It's worth noting that I don't care for actual physical like table top puzzles, but I do kind of like this. The problem is you want it to be relaxing and mindless but can often find yourself just searching and searching and NOTHING working. At this review I've got about 20 hours in and the top score I've managed was 28k, 

I feel like i'm still missing a fundamental aspect of reaching a flow state where I know what to do to get a more continuous run, and it usually diverges into damage control. This means you have to place tiles you don't want too place, just to get perfects and keep yourself afloat as when you run out of tiles the game is over. (Perfects are when you place a tile that closes another tiles last edge and that tile has all 6 sides perfectly lined up. This gives you 1 tile back so you don't lose any tiles) but that is a slippery slope down hill if you don't get them very regularly and is not sustainable to use damage control. For things to work you have to get to a place where almost every tile you place is also reaching a perfect place.

So all in all I do like this, I just wish it was a little easier on the brain. Definitely worth the money though for some hours of experimentation!",1704491552,1704491552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Place tiles to create beautiful landscapes.
- Place a tile so that all 6 sides match to get a perfect placement bonus. 
- Complete missions (X number of Y tiles connected).

Everything else in the game is just a variation on this. Doing well is rewarded by more points and more tiles, meaning bigger landscapes. Doing poorly isn't punished at all.

I think the game has A LOT of flaws in terms of gameplay choices - it could have been much more fun!
But I don't feel like reviewing this game too much because I actually don't feel confident letting this game run on my system in the first place- it does not feel safe for my hardware - so instead of a review I'll just write up a WARNING! (?)

Now my mid to high level maxed out Lenovo P50 notebook might have aged a bit over the years, but I can still run some pretty good looking games with no problem whatsoever. Lately Alien:Isolation for instance - I was surprised how cool my PC stayed on medium settings. Dorfromantik however is a very different story. 
I cannot understand how a game like ""Dorfromantik"" makes me worried as to whether my pc survives another session - like the hardware gets alarmingly hot and the ventilation is running at max speed constantly, it's crazy!
I am by no means a computer expert so this is just an uninformed opinion but this game feels really really badly compiled and programmed - it feels like it wears your hardware down to a very unnecessary degree, something that in my opinion should not happen!

Edit Addition: normally with casual games I tend to fall off of them and stop playing but Dorfromantik has a very interesting pull.

There's more enjoyment in the moments where you finally get the perfect piece to fit on all six sides! The artwork is incredible, the soundtrack is simply delightful and I also appreciate all the updates the creators have done, I am a fan of the undo button as sometimes I make careless clicks trying to move around the map.

Essentially a tile-matching game, the nature of this game is that you have a limited number of tiles to play, yet if you can make a perfect match on every edge of a tile (which usually means on other tiles that you ""complete"" the edges for after playing more tiles), you get another tile.  There are also ""quests"" to make ""runs"" of a certain size, but before too long, those are for things like ""a river 120 tiles long"" or ""1,600 trees in a forest"", and you get 5 tiles for completing something it takes 120 tiles to make.  So basically, anything less than constant, relentless perfection is [b]FAILURE!![/b]  

Also, the achievements that are the only progress this game has require constant perfection.  As in, one of them I was given recently was ""place 250 tiles in a row that are perfect placements"" (another is that you aren't allowed to rotate tiles anymore), and somewhere around 230 perfect placements in a row, I apparently either placed a tile imperfectly [i]and didn't know it[/i] because the game's interface is [i]way[/i] too subtle about a faint red line (which can be occluded by quest markers or buildings) to actually see it every single time when playing sessions for hours.

So, again, play this game for the ""relaxing"" time of having felt like you were getting good at this - you're over a thousand tiles into a game, the map is huge, you have a score of nearly 100k, and 80 moves in the bank, and then you just keep getting railroad pieces you just can't match, and have to expand more out to the edges, and suddenly, without you [b]ever[/b] making a bad move, you're at less than 10 moves left and you're left with the inescapable feeling you just [i]ruined[/i] a run you spent the last week on in a single day and everything you did for the past week was an utter waste.  Due to the sheer randomness, even tiles that [i]should[/i] be common, like plains with two farms on opposite ends of the tile that I set up at hour 1 of my second game was a tile that [i]didn't come until 30 hours into the game, or several thousand tiles later[/i]!!  Due to the nature of how perfect tiles work, you've sunk 6 moves in the hole if you can't fill in a perfect match to a tile you've left as a hole, and you have breathing room of maybe 120 tiles, so you can afford to be waiting on as little as 20 tiles that are a ""hole"" when there are tens of thousands of permutations of tiles that might appear.  Even more insidiously, however, is that every single piece along the edge (where you keep your odds of leaving matches open by having less confirmed edges) is essentially a frozen drain of a tile until every edge is completed, making an expanding map an increasing debt you inevitably drown within. 
 Every single tile you have to skip and just hope you get a matching tile for it later as you advance forward is like a bleeding wound sucking at your nerves for [i]hours[/i] as you try to hold out until the match gets dealt to you by a merciless RNG that I [i]swear[/i] is [i]explicitly[/i] designed to hold out on pieces you need.  You know, ""relaxing"", like inescapably being cornered and drowned by debt.

But OK, it's horribly depressing and ruins your whole day that the game you looked forwards to playing after getting home was a total disaster through the game's own fault, but you can get back on the horse after taking a bit to recover from the crushing disappointment of your second game coming to a crashing end, right?  Well, haha, sucker, you still need to get nothing but perfect moves, and in the sixth tile of the game, you get handed a windmill with only farm edges and there hasn't been a [b]single[/b] farm edge yet.  RNG SAYS FUCK YOU, YOU LOSE!  START OVER, LOSER!  Oh, look, now you get an all-city tile before there's been any city edges to match it to!  YOU LOSE AGAIN, LOSER!  After playing my second game (for about 30 hours gametime,) it took about 15 tries to find a single game where it was even [i]possible[/i] to get established, and it quickly fell into a death spiral of no matching tiles after only another 4 hours trying to get my hopes up.  This game is just relentless kicks in the kidney by the RNG.  What [i]you[/i] can do about it doesn't matter, you just have to wait for the RNG to [i]let[/i] any strategy you might have start to matter.  Even if you have a perfect strategy based on looking up the game's probability chart to give yourself the best odds, it's still luck.  You're still watching the Sword of Damocles that is the tile counter swing down with every tile you don't get what you need, and [i]that isn't ""relaxing""!![/i] 

Speaking of strategy, this game even trains you to play it wrong.  Early on in the game, plains are much more common (presumably to make it ""easier""), but this just puts you into a mindset that the strategy is to leave edges that are plains open because early in the game, they're easier to match (ESPECIALLY tiles which have rails, where woods-edges are nearly non-existant), only for this to [i]very much not[/i] be the case later in the game when an invisible switch is flipped and it's time for nothing but tiles with two rail edges, two river edges, a woods edge, and a farm edge with no plains in sight.  All those edges you left hours ago with plains exposed when those were common are now massive liabilities because the game taught you on one set of rules [i]then changed the rules on you without telling![/i]  In short, the game is deliberately tricking you into failing.

Basically, there's a reason I never play games that are entirely determined by RNG.  Leaving your fate up to chance is always only going to end in bitterness and depression.

Yeah, sure, this game has a ""creative mode"" with no move limits or score where you can ""just enjoy making the scene you want"", but this game's output is to art what static from a radio on the wrong frequency is to music.  It's pure randomly-generated noise, best exemplified by the railroads, which tend to be a tangled knot of spaghetti that goes nowhere and has no trains on one giant track, but two trains on a single track that have to phase through each other to travel down the single linear path.  It's just endless blobs of the same random stuff mashed together for no reason because this game encourages playing to the mindless procedural generation method of generating content.  There is zero ability to enjoy placing random tiles down for no reason, it doesn't even qualify as a game.

Rails in particular are poison to the game, as rail tiles are [i]vastly[/i] rarer than most other tiles.  A recent event popup even has a challenge where the dev mentions that there are ""no rails to ruin your maps"" because in this game, rails are apparently a force of pure evil and chaos that just exist to ruin all of civilization.  When I had holes in my map that I just couldn't fill, they were almost always because I had to wait for a rail of a particular shape to fit the spaghetti mess of rail tiles I'd had excreted onto me by the game.",1703197809,1703400425,False,7,6,0.364885598421096802,0,True,False,False

I do not know whether it is deliberately bullying Chinese players and Chinese consumers, and I feel that this game company has committed the crime of forced trading by forced buying and selling.So I don't recommend buying this game because there's no way to try it out and get a refund.",1703388142,1703388142,False,1,1,0.426056325435638428,0,True,False,False

The game rewards you for building maps with as many perfect matches as possible while also fulfilling challenges such as X piece wanting to be apart of a 200+ house section, or a 400+ tree forest. I personally enjoy playing the game in the evenings or quiet weekend afternoons as a way to relax while having something to do (a lot of ADHD and ASD people struggle to actually relax or meditate, and for me this is really relaxing as it gives me dopamine for achievements, doesn't leave me alone with my thoughts, and provides flow-state). The music is pretty ambient, but there is no big sound cues other than those for achievements and perfect matches, so you can put on your own music of choice and not miss anything. The achievements are pretty in-depth and skill focused, so while the skill floor to play the game is low, it has a higher skill ceiling, which I like. On that note, there are creative modes, quick modes, harder modes, as well as a monthly mode with leader-board. Technically all the modes have leader-boards, but I find the monthly to be the most enjoyable and rewarding competitively as you are limited in space vs the hard mode which is just harder challenges. TLDR if you are looking for a cozy relaxing game, and enjoy the task of matching or sorting things for fun, doing puzzles, or other sorts of spacial strategy games, I would highly recommend this game.",1701330304,1701330304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art is absolutely lovely, with the different looks available from different ""biomes"" keeping things fresh.

Do not get fooled, this is a puzzle game, not a city builder. It seems very neat and relaxing, but if you want to succeed, you really have to give it your best effort and focus very hard. 

Pros:

+ Calming atmosphere
+ Beautiful style of art
+ Lovely music and sound effects
+ Challenging and motivating puzzle mechanic
+ Highly addictive

Cons:

- The tutorial is very basic and does not cover all of the elements of the game. Took me a while to figure everything out
- You get skins as reward for completing tasks (also achievements), which is nice. Unfortunately, you can only have three counters toward an achievement / skin active at the same time. This means, any progress you make towards achieving a skin which is not active is wasted. Therefore you have to grind for it, which I did not like.
- You have to match the edges of cards in order to score a lot of points. For some of the cards (windmill, mill, also water train station and lakes) it was not clear to me which kind of edge they would fit next to [UPDATE: the devs improved the mechanics - it is now more obvious which edges fit each other]

What I wasn't expecting was a deep strategy game. The core element of the game is the fact that if you get a perfect tile (6 matching sides), you get extra tiles to place. So while you're trying to complete objectives, you're also looking at perfect placements so you can keep upping your score.

Add to that the fact playing unlocks new tiles with new graphics that also affects the art style of the map, which is also lush.

I've put a good many hours into this while listening to podcasts and kind  of turning my brain off and it's great. Will say that it does support controller gameplay, but the best way imo is to use mouse and keyboard.

Possible spoilers(?) or gameplay information: [spoiler] For those wanting to play for score, there is a perfection mechanic that promotes getting perfect-sided tiles to boost score while also meeting requirements on certain tiles. Each requirement you get will give you more randomly generated tiles to play around with. So, it's kind of RNG but most of the time you can make it work out with what you have already played. [/spoiler]

I would highly recommend this for casual gamers who would like to do something relaxing before bed or find a time-waster game that appeals to one's perfectionist self. Will say it's very satisfying [spoiler] seeing the ""Perfect"" pop up when you fully place down 6 tiles around the center tile [/spoiler], which really makes you want to keep doing it throughout the board. You can also unlock additional textures for tiles while playing the game, so have fun with that.

Anyway, I hope this helps. [TL;DR] This is a fun, relaxing game to play for whenever you want to build a city without much of the taxes or paperwork that comes with mayor stuff :p",1699844905,1699844905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, the artwork and design in Dorfromantik are simply breathtaking. The hand-drawn landscapes are so charming and picturesque that you'll often find yourself just gazing at the scenery. The attention to detail and the vibrant, calming colors create a tranquil atmosphere that's perfect for unwinding.

The gameplay is easy to grasp, yet it offers a surprising depth of strategy. The concept of placing hexagonal tiles to build a pastoral landscape is both intuitive and creative. You'll quickly find yourself engrossed in the challenge of creating the most beautiful and harmonious world possible. The game strikes a perfect balance between being relaxing and engaging, making it suitable for both casual players and those who enjoy more in-depth, thought-provoking experiences.

The relaxing soundtrack complements the gameplay beautifully. It enhances the tranquil ambiance and is just a joy to listen to while you immerse yourself in the world of Dorfromantik. It's a game that encourages you to slow down, take your time, and appreciate the simple pleasures of life.

One of the most appealing aspects of Dorfromantik is its endless mode. There's no rush or time pressure, and you can play at your own pace, creating your dream landscape without limitations. This design choice allows for a highly personalized and meditative experience, making it the perfect game to unwind with after a long day.

Dorfromantik's replayability is impressive as well. Each new game offers a fresh opportunity to experiment with different tile placements, develop new strategies, and improve your high score. It's a game that you can return to time and time again without it ever feeling repetitive.

In a world filled with fast-paced, high-stress games, Dorfromantik is a breath of fresh air. It's a peaceful, engaging, and visually stunning experience that will soothe your soul and provide hours of enjoyment. If you're looking for a game that helps you relax and appreciate the simple beauty of creating your own idyllic world, Dorfromantik is a must-play.

The overwhelmingly positive reviews intrigued me, but I was not moved to purchase. One day a streamer on Twitch was playing it, but I didn't recognize it at first. ""Wow this game looks great! This is right up my alley! What's the name?"" ""Dorfromantik"". 

From that moment I've been hooked. I downloaded it that day, and have already sunk over 8 hours into it over the weekend. Even my partner loves it, and she never games. There is something so rewarding about placing the tiles - especially when they match up perfectly - getting points, and watching your beautiful map grow bigger and better, that hits all the right spots. Hidden behind the very simple mechanics and beautiful design is an incredible depth and loads of strategy. Sure you can have an amazing time tinkering around and creating a cute little countryside, but you can also spend minutes agonizing over each tile placement and thinking ahead to reach those high scores.

Between this depth of play, the ease to enter and exit a game, and the gorgeous graphics and sounds, you'll be hooked just like I was. Fans of the board game Carcassone will feel at home, and to a lesser extent Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride. Even if you don't game, and ignore the quests and points, just making a really cool map with all the beautiful and varied tiles is bound to bring enjoyment.

Dorfromantik will undoubtedly be at the top of my favourite games list for some time, which is crazy to think that I had slept on it so long. I encourage you to give it a go!

For the Devs: Possible future improvements - not that they're really needed - but perhaps a new tile or two that can be unlocked and are ultra rare could be a great addition to the ones already available! Also, perhaps a 'power up' system could be interesting, where you can bring in certain powers to a game (for example, the ability to 'hold' a piece until later, or randomize one, or to undo two tiles instead of just one, or the ability to ignore the first loss of the round). These could help players really play to their playstyle and add an extra element of control to games.",1699270293,1699270293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As I approached the end of the first level I just put tiles wherever, to finish quickly and get to the next level. [b]But there is no next level.[/b] It's the same one, over and over. There's some unlocks, but not enough to hold interest.

At this price point I expected a full game, but this feels like a basic tablet app, or the ""casual mode"" to a more fleshed-out game.

[h3]Potential[/h3]

Here's where this review gets long. I'm gonna talk about how much potential this game has, and share some ideas, because tbh that's what makes it so disappointing, how much more it could have been.

It could have:

- New levels with their own challenges, restrictions, reskinned tiles, and special tiles unique to that level or area. Eg, a city area with factory tiles instead of farm tiles and trams instead of trains; a beach biome with more water tiles and no farms; a fairy kingdom with oversized mushrooms and dragonfly flight routes instead of train tracks; a zoo world where you get bonus points for grouping birds/mammals/fish etc, or a theme park world where massive roller coasters replace train tracks... there's endless possibilities with this game's engine.

- More mechanics besides ""put tree next to tree"", eg. bonus points if you put a train station next to a village of >10 houses, or if you connect villages via railways. Atm you're incentivised to keep everything separate, [i]especially[/i] train tracks which heavily restrict their adjacent tiles.

- Having a choice between 2 tiles would be great. I actually enjoyed the game for a while when I was imagining how I would build the area, with its history and current culture -- but despite being simple, the system is too restrictive to give you any lasting sense of creative freedom. Having a choice of 2 tiles instead of 1 would give players a feeling of control and authorship, and let them steer the direction of their current world so each new one feels less repetitive, without disrupting the core score chasing mechanic too much. (Yes, there's a Creative Mode, but I need some restrictions and goals to keep me interested and motivated).

There's [i]just so much[/i] you could do with this game's concept, I could go on for ages with other ideas. I'm still gonna try another run, maybe try to unlock everything and see if my opinion changes, but as said, atm this feels like either an app store game or an early access build.",1682464809,1698419160,False,6,0,0.520084142684936523,0,True,False,False

The store page explains it quite well. You try to place down randomly-generated hexagonal tiles so that their borders match neighbouring tiles. For example a tile might have trees on three sides, houses on one side, and farm fields on two, and you'd want to place it so that the edges with trees are placed against the side of another placed tile that also has trees, while the side with houses is against the side of another tile with houses, etc.

Railways and rivers are a bit different as they have to be connected so that one railway track/river goes into another without ending at the edge of a tile.

You only have a limited number of tiles, but you can get more with ""quests"". A quest can be generated by a tile when you place it, or by special tiles that appear on the map, with the quest activating when you reach the tile. A quest is visible as a little speech bubble above a tile with a number indicating that you will be rewarded with more tiles if you connect that number of a specific feature to that tile. For example, it might say to connect 20 houses to that tile. Most tiles have multiple houses on them, so you won't need to connect 20 tiles with houses, but the connection needs to be continuous, with no other features like fields or water separating some houses from others, even on single tiles. It is the same with trees, water, etc.

You earn points every time the side of one tile is matched with a side of another with the same feature. You also earn an extra tile every time you get a perfect placement (a tile with all its sides matching the features on neighbouring tiles). Once you run out of tiles it's game over and you get your score.

Some things I would've liked to see are some sort of campaign and/or scenarios with unique challenges to keep things interesting, as the game is a little bare-bones, but the concept is good enough that it is still okay without. There are at least a few different modes to play around with: 
- classic (normal gameplay)
- quick play (awards fewer tiles so games don't last as long)
- hard mode (tiles have more difficult/varied feature combinations)
- creative mode (unlimited tiles and can place any you want)
- custom mode (allows you to specify some parameters like how often features appear on tiles, add a time limit, etc)
- monthly challenge (everyone is provided with an identical seed and a limited area to place tiles, you can look at leaderboards to see how your results compare to others)


Overall it is a recommend from me. Price is a little steep for a simple puzzle game but not too bad.

Although my first game went well (I placed 780 tiles with a score of 42k) it also revealed to me that there are some serious flaws with this game's design. In particular, I would highlight four principal design failures:

1. As the size of the map expands, it becomes increasingly difficult to remember the ever-expanding wishlist of specific tile arrangements you're waiting for. It also takes longer and longer to find the correct place to put a tile as the number of possible placements continually increases. The result of this is that the pace of the game drags and the game increasingly feels like a tedious administrative chore. This problem could be fixed by having a button you can click in order to highlight any particularly good locations for a tile (e.g. 3+ matching sides). 

2. The number of possible tile combinations is so high that the chances of getting the right tile combination become very slim, particularly once you have more than 3 sides to match. This leads to a sense of frustration which is at odds with the intended relaxing game experience. This problem could be fixed by including a new type of tile - a wildcard tile - which automatically morphs into the perfect tile once placed. This could be a special quest reward, for example, or perhaps could be awarded each time you achieve a certain number of natural perfect placements.

3. The mechanics of the river and railway tiles are fiddly and frustrating. The difficult of managing these pieces, combined with the ridiculous water station tile, means that the only viable tactic is to create an area just for them on one edge of the map. This leads to an unnatural and aesthetically displeasing map. These tiles should be removed as base tiles and instead should be overlay tiles that you place on top of existing tiles (as in Civilization V). This would not only alleviate issues 1 and 2 above, but could allow for more variety of quests (e.g. a quest to connect two closed town areas with a railway, a quest to create a railway which bridges over two different rivers or spans a large area of water, a quest to create a river which travels through three pure forest tiles, etc.).

4. The gameplay is fundamentally just not interesting enough. More thought needs to be put into how to make a game which has mechanics beyond tile rotation. This game needs things special base tiles which actually do something (as opposed to being purely cosmetic), overlay tiles that go on top of existing tiles to allow placement of rivers, railways and roads, a greater variety of quests, maybe even power-ups which could be won by closing an area (e.g. dynamite to destroy a previously placed tile, an axe to turn forest into plains, etc.), etc.

There is the foundation of a good game here, but it needs significantly more development to make it enjoyable to play.

Having to deal with some of the achievement based quests has helped me to better accept when things don't fit just right, but getting a perfect 7 tiles matching fuels my OCD and ADHD in a way where I feel relaxed and accomplished and can do anything (like play another game of Dorfromantik to try and beat my high score). 6.5/10",1695280394,1695280394,True,6,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It‚Äôs super easy to jump into, doesn‚Äôt bombard you with a million things to do, relaxed to the max ‚Äì but here‚Äôs the kicker: It‚Äôs surprisingly deep. I mean, it depends on what you‚Äôre expecting, but bear with me.

Dorfromantik doesn‚Äôt have fancy gimmicks or make use of confusing elements. Nope, it keeps it simple and sweet, hooking you with gameplay that‚Äôs consistently enjoyable. Just place your tiles on the board and try to score as many points as you can ‚Äì and here‚Äôs the deep part, I suppose: Points vary based on placement, like, what you placed it next to, how many of the same tiles are connected, how many of the tiles next to this one has matching corners. And on top of that, you got little mini-quests that need fulfilling in order to bring in more tiles for you to place, and more tiles = higher score. As a bonus, you unlock new types of tiles by finishing achievements.

But even with all that, it‚Äôs the kind of game that lets you genuinely relax ‚Äì from the relaxed gameplay loop, to the pretty visuals, and the soothing musical score. Honestly. While the game can be considerably more involved if you want to chase score, at no point does it force you to do this. It even helps you along with where to place tiles.  

Oh, yeah, the friggin‚Äô music! Let me tell you, it‚Äôs like the musical equivalent of, well, whatever truly satisfying thing you prefer. For me, a hot cup of instant coffee with a splash of milk and an episode of The Wire. What? I‚Äôm a simple man.

In the world of casual games, Dorfromantik is the one that shines the brightest. It‚Äôs got an undeniable charm. It‚Äôs a bit like Civilization, not in terms of gameplay, mind you, but in that ‚Äòjust one more turn‚Äô kind of way. You‚Äôll find yourself stuck in it for way longer than you intended. If you‚Äôre in the mood for a casual/puzzle game that‚Äôs the absolute chilliest something can be, do yourself a favour and dive into Dorfromantik.

Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret it.

You get points for completing these quests and for matching as many sides as possible up to all of them being a perfect placement. Also, to try to avoid running out of tiles by completing the little ""quests"". Which are to match up over a certain number of tiles e.g. connect 10 field tiles. Or, more difficultly, matching up an exact number of tiles you can't exceed.  Which tests your overall planning power! 

The aesthetic is a bit reminiscent of the Catan board game, very cutesy and simple bright colour palette. The ambient music is very peaceful and the sound effects when you click a tile down are very satisfying.

If you look up above at the most relevant tags you see ""City Builder"", ""Turn Based Strategy"" and ""Puzzle"". Of those three I'd say only puzzle is 100% relevant. Especially in terms of what you'd really expect from these tags traditionally. When you think ""City Builder"" you normally think of games like Tropico, Cities: Skylines or Simcity. Yes, you can build a very large town by connecting lots of house tiles that could constitute a city, but it's not what you think it is. Same goes for Turn-Based Strategy yeah, you lay down one tile at a time. So one could call that a turn. But it's not like Civilisation or Total War where there are clearly defined turns as such.

That being said, was this a delightful discovery? Absolutely! It's addictive, soothing and simply fun. This game is to me, a classic example of ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" and ""you should really give a wide net of games a go!"". While I do enjoy board games and this game very much feels like one, it certainly was not what I was expecting. And it turned out to be an incredibly pleasant surprise!

The graphics and feel of the game are all very lovely. My only criticism is the music. I think it's ok, but honestly, I think they could have been a bit more adventurous with it and gone with something a bit more melodic rather than something that feels like it would play in the background at a spa. Like I get what they were going for, they wanted something calming and inoffensive to try to appeal to as many people as possible, but I don't generally agree with this sort of thinking. Things designed by committee are rarely good. I think they should have let the composer be a bit more adventurous.

All in all. Very solid game that definitely deserves the overwhelmingly positive reviews it currently enjoys! Recommended!",1693061662,1693061747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And it could be played that way, if you didn't care about the score, unlocking additional challenges, or completing quests. If, however, you're the kind of person who does care about your score, unlocking additional challenges, or completing quests, it's a stress-filled RNG nightmare. You start with six quest types (or challenges) unlocked, and as you progress through the game you can reach preset tiles on the map and complete their quests to unlock a new quest type (or challenge).

For instance, you may encounter a preset tile with a bit of forest and a quest to connect 500+ trees to it, and if you succeed at the quest you can unlock one of the remaining challenges. It doesn't seem to matter what kind of quest tile you encounter when it comes to unlocking the next challenge, and no consideration of which quest tiles have been placed at map generation is made when the game rolls your starting tileset. This is where the problem comes in. You can run into a til that wants 40 or 50 more field tiles attached to it, but the rest of the game you get primarily water or forest tiles, or city tiles, or even meadows, and you can just never complete that quest. This can go on for game, after game, after game, with no end in sight.

Pure RNG like this just ruins games, and it's such an easy fix, that games like this wind up infuriating me, rather than providing enjoyment or relaxation. So if you care about the score, the leader boards, or you're a completionist, I'd advise steering clear of this one.",1692934638,1692934638,False,3,1,0.485516875982284546,0,True,False,False

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You have hexagonal tiles, used to create a countryside landscape, each side has a certain something on it, be it a house, some trees, a wheat field etc.

You get points for matching one of these sides with the ones from another tile, but what makes it so attention needy is the fact that you both have limited tiles and getting a tile that fully matches the surrounding ones nets you another tile.

The implicit objective of the game (and the one that unlocks achievements and other tile types) is going on for as long as possible, turning it form something calming to an exercise in patience, programming where each piece of the puzzle will fit.

This is one of the most relaxing games you can play without being mind-numbing like solitaire.  Everything is simple and not overstimulating. With multiple modes and a wide variety of different biomes.  Biome being one of the most complicated words used. It does not use a wide variety of colors to distract the player. At times, I'm totally engrossed that I'm sitting up in my chair and calculating every move. Other times, I've been able to sit back, play while watching TV or simply falling asleep.  I've even played this game while I'm sitting in the queue to go into a dungeon or raid while playing World of Warcraft (WOW). It's that simple to play or to get involved with. 

With a creative, easy, and hard mode, there is something for everyone. 

This game does not take a major computer to run. I have had this running at the same time several major other programs and WOW at the same time. This takes up so little CPU and requires there are really no GPU requirements, it will fit in on the most basic computer.

Teachers & Parents Will Find This Educational

This game requires some thought be given to the placement of tiles and the ability to assess your decision and count what the results are going to be. There is basic hints along the way with an undo ability built in for fixing a misplaced tile.  This is common sense for adults who have been through basic middle school. On the other hand students as young as kindergarten and who can count will find this game fun with the long run of being beneficial to their growth. 

With all math you need the ability to understand a mathematical equation, understand the order of operations and then work on the answer. From basic math to advanced balancing of chemical formulas its a matter of understanding what to do first and where your move one part of the answer to the next. 

This game does the same thing. With smaller numbers but it can teach a student to do fast thinking because the flags in the game tell you yes, no, or what your placement could calculate, to if you place the tile there. The same thing we teach students. We have children/students use pencils because they can erase the answer when they are wrong. Calculate your numbers really quickly before you give you final answer.  With a

It also teaches you to slow down. It is not a speed game, it is a matter of evaluating your options.  With a basic theme and no multiple scenarios i.e. water and transit for humans, it allows a younger player to learn and evaluate. 

It has the a 'Jackpot Pavlovian System' built in to allow for the student to be excited about what they have done and wanting to play more. It also has a scoring system which between siblings or students would encourage challenges and an eagerness to do better.  Younger children will only see they are being allowed to play a game, not as a chore. 

The game is on Steam. All younger children want to be like their parents and older siblings. Steam is considered the adult place to get games. Younger children will see it as a treat or reward, while adults will know they are learning something from games. 

This game could easily be placed in the educational category to increase audience size.  I would highly recommend the producers of the game to offer this to school districts for educational purposes.  As a professional sales person and account manager this game could easily be packaged and sold to school districts - parents would buy it for their children based on a recommendation from a school district.  

[b]PTA SUPPORT[/b] I spent eleven years for all my children's school PTAs. I served as a board member, auction chair, Ways and Means Vice President and finally as President. If any of the teachers or math departments from my schools had asked me to supplement their curriculum with this game, I would have easily put this to a motion and gotten approval. 

Thank you for producing such a wonderful game.

Don't expect getting high score always. If you do that you really hate RNG tiles although that's the core of the game. Should aim for an average score always.

Should use quest and perfect tile bonus, so there is no time to play the game mindlessly, always focus to play wisely. If you're looking for a relaxing game, this game is not and I would recommend Mini Motorways which is a well balanced relaxing and puzzle game that you can play mindlessly..

Most negative reviews were posted by people who always want to get a high score or don't care about the bonuses instead play the game mindlessly. Dorfromantik isn't the game for everybody and the average global achievement rate is pretty low regardless of the overwhelmingly positive game. If you didn't find how to enjoy the game by yourself in the first 2 hours consider taking the refund, other than that this game is a pretty fun puzzle game.",1688432953,1688433190,False,0,1,0.467479676008224487,0,True,False,False

I say this as someone who has scored 54,000+ points on a run, which places me above the top ~3% of players approximately, judging from the global achievement stats.

At first glance you may mistake Dorfromantik as some sort of chill city builder, but it actually is a very not-chill rogue-like jigsaw puzzler. The twist over a normal jigsaw is that you are allowed to ""misplace"" the pieces, e.g. the terrain depicted on an edge of the hex piece doesn't have to match the neighboring pieces. However, only ""perfect"" placements (where all 6 edges have a matching neighbor) grant you an extra piece to play with, and stave off your inevitable death.  

And therein lies my central complaint of the game: Poor UI when it comes to perfect placements. As you play and build out the puzzle, the number of gaps in it will steadily increase as your surrounding terrain restricts appropriate placements. A single hex hole will only have 1 perfect matching piece after all, and there tens of thousands of terrain combinations (albeit some are more common than others). It's up to you to keep a mental list of all the combinations you need, vs what's currently in your hand. 

Fine. What's frustrating is that you'll eventually forced to place a non-perfect tile to achieve a mission or just survive for another piece placement, and these ruined tiles are nearly indistinguishable from the perfect ones. You may think you have the exact piece for a given opening, only to find out you don't get as many perfect placements as you originally thought (or any at all). In my final run I was so fed up with this trial-and-error, that I eventually just slammed down my pieces to end the game, even though I could have spent more time finding more optimal placements to continue playing and get a higher score.

If there was a clearer indicator in the UI for marking non-perfect tiles, that would greatly relieve the montony and stress of filling in the gaps, as the barrier for finding a sufficient neighboring piece is greatly reduced.

Other thoughts:
[list]
[*]Matching terrain can sometimes be difficult to tell due to irregularity in the representation (related to the problem above). But at the very least matching edges light up white when you're testing piece placement.
[*]The unlocks and general progression could be more enticing. They're all just reskins, that's it. The biomes are pretty cool as they change the palette of a region via a gradient, but the rest are features that are so small that you're not really going to notice them on a large map. And they tend to be samey anyway.
[*]A ""session"" or run takes quite a long time. My 18 hours recorded was only from two sessions after the tutorial. If you play cautiously and optimally you'll live longer, but also the gameplay becomes a slog as you have infinitely-increasing choices of where to place tiles.

Before playing the game I watched a couple of reviews that criticised it for a perceived lack of direct goals and for the ""luck-of-the-draw"" element of the tile drawing. I'm glad I picked it up despite those reviews - those criticisms haven't been an issue for me. There are goals throughout and it's left up to the player how they want to approach them and which goals they want to pursue. And the game is no more ""lucky"" than any boardgame that features tile-drawing. And as with any of those other tile placement games, there are many ways to mitigate the luck (and rack up higher and higher scores).

Under this whole aesthetic of idyllic central European countryside there's a surprisingly deep game of matching tile edges, managing groups, closing off regions, fulfilling quests. You can, of course, ignore all of that and play creative mode exclusively, but I'd feel like this would be a waste of game.

There are two reasons to pay attention to these systems. One - score. That one might not seem that important, but it's fun to try to beat your own high score! Besides, it often leads to achievements, which in turn unlock new tiles and biomes. And two - it replenishes your tile pool. See, your pile of tiles is always limited - and once you run out, it's [strike]game over[/strike] session complete. So if you want to keep expanding your little world, you have to keep paying attention to these things.

The mixture of those systems and the incredibly chill aesthetic - both in terms of look and the soundscape - create a very unique and potent brew that just washes your worries away. And I think this is the main reason why the game is so beloved by many.

For example: this one time, I had a mental breakdown so severe, my entire concept of reality collapsed and even thoughts of suicide didn't bring any solace. I got out of it with the help of therapy, philosophy and some research, but what kept the mortifying existential dread at bay was this game. The chill feeling was strong enough to make me forget I spent too long gazing into the abyss, and undoubtedly made my recovery quicker.

With all that said, I wish the game had more object types on the tiles. There are only 3 common ones (there's more, but they're much less common): houses, trees, and fields. I get it, that's rural Europe for you, but we also have mountains! Meadows! Swamps! Admittedly, the devs are from Berlin (I think), and the state of Brandenburg is almost completely flat - so maybe that's what they were going for.

I wasn't sure if I'd like Dorfromantik, but it entered my life when I needed it, and returned some kind of peace to my soul. I won't claim it would do the same to you, but I'd say it's nice to place a few tiles every now and then.

While I've had quite a bit of fun playing the game, I couldn't stop thinking how this game could be better. I like its visual style, changing biomes, those little ships and trains cruising through the map. Dorfromantic has relaxing atmosphere and brings joy from looking at those unique lands you can build there. But also I was always a bit frustrated because I couldn't really find any special strategy that could help me survive longer in a game. At some point you just get not enough new tasks and start to slowly spend more tiles than you are awarded with. So often after each completed task you wait for new one to start and you waste tiles waiting for it to show up. So many times you have like 3 field tasks, 2 with water, and all the tiles with forrest/city/train tracks are just waste. New tiles are 100% randomized and you're never awarded with tiles that you need - which would be great idea - you can either get lucky (rarely, due to high number of possible combinations), wait for ages for 100% matching tile or simply use one that matches partially. It would be so cool to get a special tile as an award - one that can be placed in any place and will fit all surrounding tiles. Or if you could swap current tile with different one. No. Obviously carefully considering each move can prolong the game, but eventually you will run out of tiles anyway. And while this is intentioned - what I don't like is the fact that final result is mostly dependent on that random nature of the game. If you scored higher than usual - it's luck, not your newly invented strategy or smart decisions. So it quickly becomes boring, as I don't see any incentive to play again if it's just luck that can get me further than before. It's definately worth checking out, spending some time with it, but the novelty and discovery evaporate quite fast and you're left with a bit of disappointment.",1686295556,1686295556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The joy of this game comes from placing down a perfect piece in a perfect place to hear the pleasant ping of ""quest complete"", and paired with a great artstyle and relaxed mood, it makes one hell of a combo. In the very light and soft way, of course. 
The scoring incentives directly encourage you to create nice looking environments, there are plenty of gamemodes to suit your mood. I can't really complain about anything, but that's mainly because there isn't much here. 
Some more interesting scoring criteria could add a lot of flavor, but there just aren't any.

DorfRomantik is a special kind of 'Candy Crush', except, in place of geometrical shapes, you have landscape elements (fields, forests, trains, water, grassland, and houses). As advertised, the mood is peaceful, and the pace of the game allows for a relaxing experience, supported by a calm and soothing soundtrack.
However, the built-in randomness ensures every landscape you build will devolve into a monstrosity. What makes landscapes relaxing is their underlying 'humanity', so when your creation turns 'inhumane', relaxation *can* go out the window. Also, as long as the music sticks to saxophones parts reminiscent of a Christopher Cross song, no problem. But when you suddenly have machine-guns roaring in your head because the next piano track is oddly evocative of the intro to that horrendous 'Man of Steel' theme...
That said, I feel like DorfRomantik somehow met its goals. It [b]is[/b] peaceful, and it sucks you in like a Solitaire (seriously, watch the clock when you play), but in a richer, somewhat less repetitive environment. And there are now different options that really let you play it the way you want to, including a 'sandbox' builder. 
So, in the end, despite its drawbacks, DorfRomantik is a game that will fit nicely in your Library next to titles like ""Wingspan"" or ""Eastshade"".

It acts all friendly like it's some sort of relaxing chill hex game but it's just a visage to slowly grind away your sanity in what ultimately amounts to a massive waste of the minutes you have left in your life.

Oh, Dorf Romantik, you sly, deceiving little devil, luring me in with your adorable hand-painted graphics and soothing soundtrack. How could I ever resist? But just as I let my guard down, you unleash the hidden beast within.

You claim to be a ""relaxing building strategy and puzzle game,"" but what you really are is a tactical mastermind that feasts upon my feeble attempts at creating idyllic landscapes. Yes, I see through your ruse, Dorf Romantik. You're not fooling me any longer.

Sure, the game starts off easy enough, lulling me into a false sense of accomplishment as I place tiles, creating quaint little villages and serene forests. But then, out of nowhere, you hit me with these so-called ""quests"" ‚Äì the windmill that demands six grain fields or the deer that wants a 50-tree forest. Well, guess what, Dorf Romantik? I don't negotiate with terrorists.

And let's talk about those ""unlockable tiles and biomes,"" shall we? Oh, how exciting it must be to discover new lands, filled with new challenges! Except, you know what I don't need? More challenges. I have enough of those in my life already. If I wanted to feel the crushing weight of my own inadequacy, I'd just check my bank account or try to assemble IKEA furniture.

Oh, and don't even get me started on the high score system. You mean to tell me that not only do I have to suffer through this relentless hexagonal hellscape, but I also have to compete against others for the highest score? What kind of sick, twisted game are you playing, Dorf Romantik?

But perhaps the most egregious sin of all is the undo button and rotating the last tile to not lose. Yeah instead of losing my mind over the placement of a stupid lake tile, I could just enter creative mode but again there's the score I have to worry about.

In conclusion, Dorf Romantik is a heartless, diabolical game that masquerades as a calm, peaceful retreat from the chaos of life. But don't be fooled, my friends. It's a hex-shaped nightmare that will slowly, mercilessly grind your sanity into dust. You have been warned.",1683246071,1683246071,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is not a game you would play end to end in a sitting. It is one you would play it over multiple sessions when you just want to relax. 
Gameplay
In the beginning, you start with a stack of random tiles. The idea is to match as many as you can together to expand your playing field. You will be challenged to keep the groups together to reap the rewards of more tiles for you stack to keep you playing further. The challenge then is do you close out a group, or risk it for further rewards. Also occasionally in game play, you will extend you tiles outwards and a greyed out special tile will appear approx 10 tiles from the current edge of your tiled map.

You can pick it up just to relax and build a little Dorf (village) without worrying about perfection, or, when you're feeling analytical, strive to perfectly place every tile. There are a few different gameplay styles (encouraged by leveled achievements), and to truly master the game, you'll need to learn them all - or you'll run out of tiles and the game ends.

Perfection will result in lots of snaking connected fields, like farmlands or forests, while you hunt for the perfect tile to connect them. Placing those perfect pieces will earn additional tiles.

Caring less about perfection will have you focusing on completing quests, closing fields to get flags, and exploring to find bonus tiles. All will give you additional tiles.

Or, just play creative mode, where you have an endless supply of tiles, can skip tiles you don't like, and can generate perfect tiles to place in any spot.

Developed by Toukana Interactive, Dorfromantic offers an enchanting experience that will mesmerize players of all ages.

One of the first aspects that grabbed my attention in Dorfromantic is its charming and visually pleasing art style. The game presents a picturesque world filled with serene landscapes, quaint villages, lush forests, winding rivers, and rolling hills. The handcrafted tile-based graphics are beautifully designed, evoking a sense of tranquility and immersion. The attention to detail is exquisite, creating a mesmerizing atmosphere that invites players to lose themselves in the idyllic scenery.

The gameplay mechanics in Dorfromantic are refreshingly simple yet remarkably addictive. Players are tasked with strategically placing tiles featuring various landscape elements such as forests, meadows, rivers, and buildings to create a harmonious and interconnected environment. The goal is to maximize points by aligning and extending the landscapes in a way that forms cohesive patterns and completes specific objectives. The intuitive and easy-to-understand mechanics make the game accessible to both casual players and puzzle enthusiasts.

Dorfromantic offers a perfect balance between relaxation and strategic thinking. The game encourages thoughtful planning and foresight as players must carefully consider the placement of each tile to maximize their score and create an aesthetically pleasing landscape. This aspect adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, making it engrossing and satisfying without ever feeling overly challenging or stressful.

The progression system in Dorfromantic is seamless and rewarding. As players continue to expand their landscapes and fulfill objectives, they unlock additional tiles and features that add more variety and complexity to the game. The sense of achievement and discovery as new elements are introduced keeps players engaged and motivated to explore further and create even more stunning landscapes.

One of the standout features of Dorfromantic is its relaxing and immersive soundtrack. The soothing melodies and ambient sounds perfectly complement the tranquil visuals, creating a peaceful and meditative experience. The combination of the calming music, gentle gameplay, and captivating visuals makes Dorfromantic a perfect choice for players seeking a moment of respite from the hectic pace of everyday life.

The developers of Dorfromantic have shown remarkable dedication to their community.

You start with a fixed number of hexagonal tiles. Each tile can have some combination of grass, field, trees, houses, water or train track. You proceed to fit them together one-by-one, creating a landscape in the process. The size of your stack of tiles dictates how big a landscape you can build. Initially, not that big it would seem. However, you are given 'quests' as you proceed (build a forest with this many tress, a town with this many houses, a river this long etc), and as you complete these quests, you will gain more score and new tiles will be added to your stack allowing you to extend your landscape further. And this is really it. Once the stack is empty, it is over and you are left with a wonderful landscape and a high-score to chase. 

Simple but with just the right amount of engagement to make it fun but not so much to ever make it stressful. The art style is wonderful, the animations are relaxing, the music is chill. Runs can last from 30 mins to a couple of hours depending on well you are doing (but you can suspend at anytime and resume later). Also works wonderfully on Steamdeck.

Tiles have 6 sides and a handful of things that can go on a tile (as far as I can tell they're randomly generated) so it's up to you to find the best spot for whichever tile you're served until you're out. Two kinds of quests pop up as you play, either prompting you to link a certain amount of stuff together (like, link 10 trees together as an example), or having you close off what you've already made with the proper tile type. Completing quests gets you more tiles, more tiles gets you more points, and that's the loop.

My high score after 14 hours was about 14,000 - which felt like a herculean task and an impossible feat (I told my wife about it at dinner knowing she wouldn't care but I was THAT excited) - however I've seen numbers much higher and I'm actually quite low on the leader board.

There are quests and points, but ultimately they don't matter.  The object of the game is to create a landscape however you want with the tiles that you're given.  Sure you can produce your own goals like try to play as long as possible by earning more tiles, or scoring the most points possible, or try to unlock all the tiles that the game has to offer, but at its core this game is a creative endeavor to do the best you can with what you have. 

I can see the appeal of the game if you want something just to pass the time with.  The game is pretty, and the music is soothing.  But ultimately, for me, the payoffs of the game just aren't enough for me to want to keep playing.  Honestly it does feel like a .99 game you might find on an app store under ""relaxing sim/puzzler"" but sim and puzzler is used rather loosely here.  There is no real simulation of people, no economy, no resource gathering beyond tiles.... It's a terrain generation game.  

 There are goals and quests....  Each tile is hexagonal, and each side has a ""biome.""  You can line up biomes together to make larger villages.  Some terrains have hard rules like railroads restrict the end of the tile to only railroads.  Some tiles come with quests where you might need to connect 100 forest together in a continuous chain/blob, others ask that you get precisely X houses no more or less.  Sometimes there is a tile in the distance that is highlighted that you're supposed to build and connect to.  You get extra points for placing a tile that perfectly matches the biome to its 6 neighbors. The tiles, as far as I can tell are randomly generated, so you have to work with what you have if you want to maximize your score.  Some events like getting a perfect match gives you more tiles, but you start off with 100 tiles.  When you run out of tiles, the game is over, and you start over, with anything you've unlocked from the previous playthroughs.  There really isn't any penalty for not matching biomes up well, nor failing to complete quest objectives.  

There are also a creative mode which lets you generate/change the tiles to whatever you want so you can paint the map to how you like, stripping all of the loose game mechanics entirely from the game.  So if it frustrates you that the game ""ends"" you can turn that off.  

I can see how this game can appeal to a certain kind of game player in a certain mood, but ultimately, this game is not for me.",1681914919,1681914919,False,12,0,0.613138675689697266,0,True,False,False

If you need something to quickly pick up and waste some time, Dorfromantik is a good choice for that. There are various modes (Classic, Quick, or Hard) that count towards achievement goals, but there are also Creative mode and Custom mode, which are just for fun.

The gameplay is rather simple at first glance but has some more depth once you try to get higher scores. The more different types of tiles there are, the more difficult the game gets, but that's not all, tiles can also have mixed types, so they become dead ends of sequentially placed types.

The nicest thing about Dorfromantik is its art style and how they dynamically change depending on the biome they are in or what other tile is next to it. Sounds are alright and the gamepad layout takes some time to get used to.",1669725973,1681259051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Challenges can also be found as well as quick matches. The game gets Frequent Updates (if you count weekly to monthly updates as frequent)As of 2023 April. 

The game also rewards you with new tiles for reaching certain goals like a city with this many houses or placing a certain amount of tiles in one run. New biomes like a Autumn (Fjord) Theme. These are randomly set throughout the map.

It's a puzzle game where you attempt to match up tiles with towns, fields, forests, rivers, and railroads in order to up your score. As you fulfill certain quests (like x amount of forest tiles strung together) you acquire more tiles. Line up a tile on all sides with the corresponding tiles? You get another tile. Eventually you WILL run out of tiles but the objective is to rack up your score while simultaneously keeping as many tiles as you can coming back to your stockpile therefore keeping you in the game longer and further increasing that overall score.

It's an easy-to-grasp (and jump into) premise but addictive and thoroughly enjoyable with endearing graphics, audio, and musical score. I highly recommend for those who like puzzle games at all and need something to relax to!",1680386029,1680386029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But soon I realised that the game didn't really have the depth to achieve any of the goals I wanted from it.

As a relaxing game it fails because your continent soon grows too big to manage effectively and then you'll find your game ending sooner than you'd like because you ran out of pieces. You have the ability to port your game over to sandbox mode, which is nice, but by default it automatically borks up the colours and alienates your world from you. And by removing all the quests and connection bonuses alongside the introduction of the tool that'll make pieces, it instantly gives you a sense of pointlessness. What I really wanted was to just have the regular game continue. Let me go into piece 'debt' and continue playing because I want to accomplish all those quests. Or just give me 10 extra pieces and a slap on the wrist and say I didn't get the gold medal. Whatever, at least I still have a reason to keep playing...

As an engaging puzzle game it also dropped off for me because I realised I was just doing a computer's job. It's not very difficult to constantly scan the exterior of your board and compare the next piece to all the available slots. I made myself a document containing data on all of the available placements on my board and what each side required. Then when I got a new piece I could just look at my spreadsheet and it'd tell me if this piece fills any of the holes I needed it to. If you could communicate the game data to an AI, it could play this game. Which means it's not really a game, nor a puzzle. It's just work.

I mean look, I have 20 hours on the game, the game's $20 aud when not on sale. It's not the worst purchase you'll make but idk. Just left a sour taste in my mouth.",1680084126,1680084126,False,2,0,0.474761545658111572,0,True,False,False

Some of the things that I personally think need added/ changed however. 


1. In custom mode, It would be nice to be able to open up a pallet of tiles for each biome and their respected catagrories example forest, town, etc. instead of having to change settings to generate which ever tile catagory, to avoid the infinit scroll of seeking out that one rare tile piece you need < like a plain tile that has one piece of forest attached nothing more, 

2. in custom mode, a toggle key to copy the tile you have currently selected, granted you can hold ctrl for the dropper tool to copy what ever tile you have on the board but sometimes i just wanna spam click the same tile over and over to make a dense forest or a large lake and having to eye dropper every time can be annoying. 

3.  add a paint feature in custom so that i don't have to rely on randomly generating the right color at times.

This seemingly simple puzzle game will surprise you with its intricate gameplay mechanics and vast array of randomized tiles. As you dive deeper into the game, you'll find yourself creating sprawling landscapes with interconnected systems of railroads, tiny villages, and giant forests. 

The ""secret"" tiles you unlock through in-game quests only add to the depth of the game. While the cute cardboard art style may deceive you, this game is a true menace of complexity that will keep your brain tickled for hours on end.

I really wanted to love this game- the art is so pretty and cute, and the tile placement thing seemed like such a neat twist on city builders, which I *love*. Before We Leave had a similar hex-based aesthetic, which I thought worked really well.

However, the game is extremely rigid, lacking even the flexibility of solitaire: you can't reshuffle your tiles or use anything other than your top tile. And you can only place tiles directly adjacent to other tiles, making it basically impossible to plan routes for things like rivers and railroads.

Overall, while I liked the aesthetic, I realized after about an hour and a half it was tedious and frustrating more than fun and relaxing.

The music fits the vibe really well and the controls are easy enough to pick up, and I'd give it a pass for how the different land types do not blend well at all, but the gameplay just isn't enjoyable.

I love RTSs and city builders, I have since the early days of Sim City and Warcraft II. I always wanted that sort of gameplay, but without the upkeep/conflict.

This is a relaxing, soothing game.  It's not here to measure your epeen, it's not here to prove how much better you are than the computer/ai/opponent. This is a game to play when the day has been too much and you need to UNWIND.

Remember unwinding?  Remember playing games for fun instead of endless challenge? Remember games as an escape from the horrors of reality? Dorfromantik does.

The gameplay is very similar to a hexagonal Carcassonne, where the challenge is in the tile laying not the upkeep and maintenance, but without Carcassonne's ridiculous point counting system.

I think even full price is well worth the enjoyment you can get from this.

5/5 ""A good balance between challenging and relaxing""

Bought this game because i see it on the Steam Award, didn't hesitate because the game itself is straight to the point, and easy to understand. Once you know the how to, then the game is a relax machine. However if you somehow think this is like a city building game, it is not. Though the visuals did give me some kind of city building.

In conclusions this game works perfectly for me who spent hours mostly doing work. It is very calming and reduce my stress from work. Definitely works like a charm.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
(+) Relaxing, and very chill game. Grab your coffee, snacks and play.

(+) Satisfying visuals and this game can't get ugly.

(+) Music is very calming and soothing.

(+) There are couple of gamemodes to try.

[h1] Cons [/h1]
(-) If you manage to build your landscape big enough, sooner or later you'll need to move the camera all around the place and it's kind of tedious at some point

(-) If you low on tiles and need to complete a task to gain more tiles, sometimes all you need is a rng.",1672495879,1675922114,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not really a big player of these types of games and mostly got it because my niece and nephew like this sort of game (it's good for younger kids) but even I still think it's pretty good for what it is. In addition to the standard , quick, and hard modes, there is also a custom mode and a monthly challenge mode. The custom modes have a seed which ensures the same sequence of tiles for anyone who uses the seed, thus multiple people can compete to see who can get the highest score with the same tile sequence and restrictions. There's also a ""creative"" mode that, while I wouldn't call it a ""true"" creative mode, lets you just freely place tiles and delete/discard them to see what sort of map you can draw.

The UI is also simple and well designed, so any kid old enough to use a mouse will probably be able to figure it out pretty much immediately.",1675824903,1675824903,True,3,0,0.536031603813171387,0,True,False,False

The game is painfully repetitive, and within two hours you've pretty much seen and done all there is to it. Yes, you might unlock a new tile that serves no purpose at some future point, or even an equally purposeless different colour scheme, but you can't work towards it because you have no idea what specific action beyond ""Complete a quest"" will do so.
Dorfromantic is essentially 6-sided dominoes with pictures instead of dots. It's easy enough for a 5 year old to pick up in 5 minutes, but the tactics and concentration can take MUCH longer to master.
The game's repetition is its greatest flaw, but much as I found it unimaginative to play, there's something beautiful and mesmerising about it. The gentle music and the cute little landscapes had me thinking about the game FAR more than I actually played it. They combine to create something truly blissful. That said, the concentration and tactics required to master it are not at all relaxing - in fact, it's more like a stressful exam. The game depends upon what appears to be random tiles, but that randomness can also be your downfall where, no matter how flawlessly you play, you may simply never receive the tiles you need to attain the high scores or unlock more cards or specials.
I would give this a 7 out of 10 if Steam had scores, and it's great to see Toukana continuing to enhance it. I WOULD buy this again, especially at just ¬£7.69, but it's all about the atmosphere, not the game play.",1675009753,1675009753,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

You can connect trees and a house, but that is only when you have no other options.
Place them so ideal as possible and make the country you are creating as big as possible.
Some pieces have tasks attached, for example grow a town as big as 500 houses.
When you complete these tasks you receive extra pieces to place.

You know, you get a tile per turn, you gotta place it in ways that would help you secure more points.

Also, no meeple placement either.

This one can be both seriously challenging if you feel like going for high scores, and at same time super comforting, allowing you to create endearingly comforting rural landscapes with towns, railways and rivers. There's some unlocking to do trough achievements too, adding new visual bits, and those may take time but aren't that super tough to actually secure, since the game is really gripping so it's a matter of time till you unlock everything.

I heard of it on 9gag and bought it shortly after. If your first association is with Carcassone - you're right! The core of the game is very similar - you are placing hexagon tiles next to each other so they can create large spaces of fields, forests, or towns. The biggest difference - your goal is to keep playing as long as you can. Placing perfectly matched tiles, doing challenges and tasks, and managing what's worth doing and what is not. 

Pros:
- So pretty. As the map grows it only gets more charming and more ""real"". The graphic style reminds me of Don't Starve (it's something about the trees)
- Simple yet challenging mechanics
- ""Another round"" syndrome hits hard
- Perfect as a short break

Those few tiny cons:
- Music get's monotonous
- Background colors sometimes flicker
- RNG is an arse sometimes but it's understandable.

I have been playing this since it was in Early Access, and i quickly fell in love with the game!

This game is for the player that enjoys a relaxing puzzle, with or without a challenge, sandbox mode and achievements. 
Many achievements are unlocked just by playing the game, and within a game session you have 3 goals that you can try and reach, this gives you something to try and build towards, as it can otherwise be overwhelming to have free hands, these goals changes (as far as i remember) when you reach one. Some of them have to be reached in one sitting, if these aren't reached, that goal changes so you can try out something else, others can be reached over multiple game sessions and will often stay until completed.

This tile puzzle game have a super cute and relaxing atmosphere, chill music and sounds, and i find myself exited to unlock the next ""bear in woods"" - skin or a new windmill skin. I challenge myself to try and mach most tiles or make a pretty river though the landscape. Its a game for people who wants to just chill out and relax with some cozy puzzling and if you need a pause from the big AAA games, this is a game i can see most people play to just do something different.

It was worth the money and i would even pay for it again on my switch, where i can see it as a great travel game!",1672442193,1672442193,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It looks like the Catan games; but now it is just a relaxed building mode. You have a stack of tiles. You need to connect the tiles with the same sides to score points and fulfil quests. If you are successful, you will be able to unlock new tiles, get more achievements and you are rewarded with more tiles so you can get a higher score. However, first and foremost is to chill and relax. It has helped me to get back on my feet after a challenging period in my life. It's nice to play for 30 minutes or so at a time when you want to wind down and the result is a lovely landscape all build by you. 

[H1]The good[/H1]
The art style is great; the music is relaxing and the little effects are cute. I really like it. Performance is great.

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
I suppose if I have to nit-pick: some of the achievements are hard to get. But then again if you are that good in the game that you can manage to get them you deserve full respect.

The achievements are not transparent in how to unlock them (you need to complete the ""Star mission"" in game before the Steam achievements will unlock).

TLDR: So peaceful, gentle, and relaxing. 

So I absolutely played Dorf Romantik incorrectly.
Now anyone who‚Äôs played a single minute of this game will be scratching their heads at that. ‚ÄúWhat? How did you manage that?!‚Äù I can hear them ask. 

Simply put: I played to win. That is not how the game is meant to be played, and DR did everything it could to show me that. Being the hard headed fool that I am, I didn‚Äôt listen until too late. 
Dorf Romantik is all about the journey. There is no winning, there is only going as far as you can, and trying to love what you‚Äôve built along the way. 
The game has you placing tiles to design a map. Rotate them, match sides, spread out, uncover secret tiles, and complete quests to earn more tiles to place. That‚Äôs it. There is no story, there are no enemies, and there isn‚Äôt a higher purpose. It just‚Ä¶ is. 

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
[list][*] Peaceful in a way that most games simply aren‚Äôt. If you allow yourself to get lost in the ambiance, focus on the puzzle aspect, and just let the world go, you can be comfortable for a while. 
[*] The music, ambient noises, and artwork are lovely. They‚Äôre fitting and relaxing. 
[*] This has a one more tile, one more game, or one more hour type of addictive play.
[/list]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
[list][*] The tile unlock system is tied into the achievement unlock system, which is tied itself to quests given by the mystery tiles. This is VERY poorly explained in game, and the moment I realised I needed to achieve to unlock more tiles I began hammering the achievements, only to find they weren‚Äôt unlocking because I had to unlock the achievements options by completing mystery quests‚Ä¶ this was so convoluted and unintuitive that I can only describe it as ‚Äòfrustrating‚Äô. 
[*] There is no way to turn off some of the unlocks. For example I really didn‚Äôt enjoy building in the ‚Äònight‚Äô zone. The grey made it hard to see, the tiles just weren‚Äôt as nice in my opinion, and I found the experience off-putting. That it keeps pushing itself into my game, forcing me to move away from promising developments or breaking my flow is not a pleasant experience. 
[*] This isn‚Äôt really a game, as I‚Äôve come to expect. No levels or real measurable progress. While I very much love it, I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs missing something. But that just feeds back into my opening statement, really. I‚Äôve come with the wrong mind-set. Nothing makes this clearer than every achievement complete, and no maps saved. 
[/list]

[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]
 [list][*] A title swapper. Allowing you to change out a rouge tile placed for necessity earlier with the perfect tile later (but not if it would undo a quest or take tiles away from you).
[*] A tile painter, allowing you to ‚Äòpaint‚Äô a terrain type on a tile edge. 
[*] More variety. New quests (link areas, functional settlements, rotations challenge), new tiles (bridges? train stations? harbours?), but also controls to turn on and off the unlocked content that we like. 
[/list]


[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]

If you‚Äôre a so-called ‚Äòtype A‚Äô person, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll enjoy this. An old web comic of a ‚Äòtype A‚Äô guy being told to calm down and smell the flowers taking it too far and winning a most flowers sniffed trophy comes to mind. This isn‚Äôt that sort of game. 
If you want structure and meaning, this also isn‚Äôt for you. 
If RNG hates you, then this game is going to be a slog. 
If you want stories or plot or high octane explosive fun, it‚Äôs got none‚Ä¶
But if you want peace? If you like puzzles and map builders, want something gentle, relaxing, and I guess sort of old school? Then you‚Äôre in luck. 
I played this game incorrectly. But I‚Äôd like to hope that when I want to chill out, it comes back into my mind, so that I play it the way it was intended in the future.",1672425414,1672425414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The worlds you build are beautiful, every game is different, and overtime you're going to learn which pieces ""should"" go together instinctively. The hardest part for me is always remembering to close off my missions to get more cards.

The point, very briefly explained, is to place six-sided tiles on the map and try to get them to match with the tiles you will place next to them. You get points based on how well you achieve this. The more you play and more points you earn, the more special tiles you unlock, keeping things interesting. You also get to decide the pace. You can spend hours and hours creating that perfect landscape in the creative mode or you can choose to go for the more challenging game modes (which, admittedly, can still take hours).

No city building concepts exist in this barebones time waster, and it's a barebones time waster that contradicts its own rules constantly. I was repeatedly able to extend my current game on the last piece available by randomly placing the piece until the game invisibly and nonsensically decided I should get more new pieces because I placed that piece there.

It doesn't have staying power and my rule of thumb is a game should be worth at least 1 hour of entertainment per dollar spent on it and this falls well short of that.",1670035810,1670715084,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for a game that is ""fun"" I don't think that this would fit the description for many people. It is a puzzle game that isn't really all that much of a puzzle. You have fields, farms, forests, and village tiles that will only give you points if you connect them to tiles the same type. Then you have rails and rivers, that can only be attached (at certain angles) to tiles of the same type.

That is it really. Connect them perfectly on all six sides and you will get extra bonus points and more tiles to keep building with. Honestly, combined with the in-game music, or your own soothing tunes, this can be a really calming experience.

I would recommend it, but again, only to a certain type of person who is looking for a very specific gaming, almost meditative, experience.",1670708582,1670708582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Best advice is play it, not on easy mode that will get boring fast. Match up all sides as you place them when you match all 6 sides you get a perfect and more to place. Tiles run out fast, so keep an eye on what you are doing speed placing is not the name of the game thinking ahead before placing will save you tons of time  and get you more tiles to place and higher scores.

Give the game a shot it gets very addicting and it is alot harder to play than it looks and a lot more fun tan most people who look at it and see a boring game.

Dorfromantik has been a joy to play this past year. 

The formula is perfect for whatever you want to get out of it. If you want a relaxing domino-style town builder, you've got it. If you want an intense, puzzle-forward game where you race for that highscore, you've got it. If you want a neat little tool to design settlements and experiment with making beautiful landscapes, you've got it. Toukana seriously thought of everything.

All of the biomes are stunning -- my favourites have to be the Enchanted and Sakura ones. The music never fails to blow me away, and the sound design is supremely satisfying. 

I have high hopes for Toukana going forward, and for this game with the Steam Awards coming soon. It deserves recognition for everything it has achieved. Definitely worth the purchase, at full price or otherwise",1634910350,1670005071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

How ""hard"" it is really just depends on how interested you are on getting a high score, and then how motivated you are in trying to beat your high scores.  

The ""deck"" of tiles are finite meaning your game ends when you run out, but you gain more by completing tasks (connecting a certain number of a type of tile, such as a railroad, a river, a forest, a town, or a meadow), but your score is multiplied by how many matching sides you create EG you may be focusing on completing your 15 tile railroad but each tile also has 6 sides, and so ideally you want to complete your railroad task only/mostly by placing railroad tiles that also match as the other sides - you'll be torn between perfection and efficiency. This means you have to use some foresight when placing tiles so that you set yourself up for success and don't accidentally lock yourself into an area such that you can't complete a task IE by overlapping tasks that then require very specific tiles to complete both.  You want to diversify your placement a bit so that you have options and get the best score with each tile, but you also want to complete tasks so you can get more tiles.  It becomes incredibly satisfying when you not only keep your score climbing but you see your sprawling city stretching into different biomes, forming interesting patterns and such.

Listen, you just dropped a tile on me that has four totally different landscapes. It doesn't fit anywhere on my map. Well I could put it by the city, but then I'd be setting myself up for failure as the empty space next to it would then need an equally complex tile to match up. Maybe I could use it to close off that forest and grab the flag quests I've been saving up but then I would be giving up several perfect tiles. So I guess It's just going to be jutting out off the edge of my map with no hope of ever making any kind of reasonable connection.

The graphics and peaceful music really appealled to me at first, but the ""classic"" puzzles are too hard. You start with 40 tiles in your stack; each one contains a mixture of different elements (houses, grass, grain fields, water, trees and train tracks). Once you run out of tiles you lose. To replenish your stack you have to complete one of two objectives:
1) Link a certain number of elements together (5 trees, 9 houses, 14 railway tracks etc)
2) Match every tile you lay down perfectly with its six neighbors. This only gives you one additional tile.
Sounds easy and fun, right? Wrong! You can only view the two top tiles in your stack, so you can't really plan ahead.

Get it, it's good.

[u]The What[/u]

It's a game where you place hexagonal tiles next to each other, unlocking more tiles as you complete objective tiles by connecting a certain number of tiles together.

The graphics are gorgeous, the soundtrack is incredibly chill and soothing and the game is pleasant and relaxing to play.

The game is structured around completing missions that are attached to hexagonal tiles you're issued, usually in the form of connecting a certain number of tiles of a given type together. When you complete a mission, you are given additional tiles, extending how long your game can run. As you get further along, the missions become harder, and so it becomes increasingly important to get perfect placements to earn more pieces instead. However, many of your runs will end waiting on the random number generator to give you the right tile to fill a space, and instead fighting to find a place for a complex railway intersection tile. Also, some details of the game that are important for having longer-running playthroughs are never told to you. For instance, you can only have so many active missions at once, and so in some cases, it's important to deliberately terminate missions that are too difficult to complete.

There are multiple game modes, including a custom game mode that lets you tailor the proportions of tile types for your playthrough to make it easier on yourself, or to create a challenge, which you can share with your friends. They also have a monthly mode, offering unique challenges to compete with others on.

Achievements are handled in a somewhat unique manner, in that you can only achieve them when they are one of your three assigned achievement missions for a playthrough, and you can't earn higher-ranked achievements at the same time as the lower-ranked ones. And don't expect to get them easily - towards the end, achievements require each to be your playthrough's central focus, and they can't be earned in the custom game mode. Each achievement you earn also unlocks a unique decorative tile that the game will sometimes issue instead of the basic version.

The music is pleasant, and doesn't really get old. The art is simple, but varied enough to make things interesting. Complaints are minimal. I highly recommend this game.",1669687916,1669687916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've only played about 10 hours, but it really feels like so much more, mainly because I play a little bit here and there and feel so relaxed after playing a round. It's a little like game therapy. Which is what the game designer's intention was, apparently. 

The graphics are clean and pretty, with an eye to detail when you zoom in, though it's not busy. There is some movement, windmills gently spinning, clouds drifting lazily, boats chugging in the water - this all adds to the peaceful ambiance. The color palette is warm and soothing.

The game play is fairly simple, reminding me of Carcassonne with some of its expansions added in. It is possible to really focus on strategy as far as where you place pieces. The level of commitment is entirely up to the player. Sometimes it's nice to place pieces just to make a cool design, but if one plays with an eye towards completing various goals that pop up with different pieces, the game begins to open up with unlockables that include new pieces and goals. Some of these goals include growing bigger forests, rivers or farmlands. There is a lot of luck involved in which pieces you'll draw from your pile next, which is sometimes frustrating if you are looking for a particular piece. For my play style, this isn't a big deal. I like completing the goals, but they are not my main focus, which is really just winding down from a hectic day.

This might not be the most played game in your library, but I guarantee it will chill you out, assuming that is what you're looking for. Of note, the developer is constantly updating the game with cool little additions. New tiles and themes have been released on a pretty steady basis. I find that whenever I fire it up, there are always new touches that surprise me and add to my enjoyment.

For me, a thumbs up is the perfect rating system. This is a 10/10 game, a 100/100, even! Shucks, I'd sell my middle child for this game. I think you'd have to be a monster to not enjoy this game on some level. Even a monster should enjoy it, methinks.",1666367858,1669674888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are limited on pieces, but you can earn more pieces by finishing goals and making multiple matches with a single piece, which could make the game go on endlessly.
The game has a lot of achievements, but you can't just go for them until you have unlocked being able to do them, which is randomly decided when connecting to a special piece. It gives the game a little bit of a challenge and a goal besides just going for the highest score.

As straightforward as it is - there's a great variety in which it can be played... achievement hunting, casual quest completing, fun 'exploration', high score, town/landscape sculpturing, etc. And the beautiful part is that you don't have to 'pick' a method/goal each time you go to play it. The goal is enjoying the game - and how you get to that destination is completely fluid, based on your mood and choices, and you can swap your strategy around several times within a single gameplay. It's really all about having a good time. 
My other comment is on the graphics and music... I can't say thank you enough to the devs for giving us such a peaceful, charming and pleasing environment. It's hard finding an honest to goodness 'relax and enjoy' kind of game (esp for a strategist) - but finding a game where the graphics are not painful or offensive is... breathtakingly refreshing. 
In a word, I have found Dorfromantik to be a sweet, simple, priceless gem of a game that is very endearing. God bless all the devs for providing the community with such a treasure!
P.S. I haven't' fiddled much yet with the 'creative' option (maybe only in early access as of this review) - but it looks like a really nice outlet for those unrequited needs to build and create! A definite plus for those with that inclination.
P.P.S. Despite my logged hours - I've played this game with family on a sibling's account for well over 100 hours! So I speak from the heart and some experience ;)

Also, it being such a visually focused game, I appreciate how beautiful the developers created the graphics. Staring at something akin to hideous to progress through a game I can find rather grating. In Dorf, I find myself sometimes sitting back and watching the train puff by in the lovely landscape I've just obliviously laid out. 

I also like that with Dorf, I don't have to set aside at least 1 hour to make any appreciable progress. It's really freeing to be able to simply hop in, knowing I'll only play for 15 minutes and it's still a rewarding experience. 

The quests, short term and especially challenge based, are a ingenious way to keep a repetitious game play brand new. With the particular focus of the 3 challenges per game, it can really change the viewpoint of that play-through, allowing you to discover different creative strategies you'd never used before! 

I've really enjoyed watching the development of the game. I've never been part of an 'early access' before, but this one certainly has been rewarding. The updates always add enhancements to the game and I feel like I just received a brand new bundle for free! (Especially the creation of a whole new bunch of tiles - that was an exciting update!) 

The music is also great. It's a very soothing background, with enough variety to not drive you crazy (especially if you are playing for hours at a time :D) I've done sound effects work professionally and theirs add a very nice touch of creating a gentle, easy-going environment. I was very impressed. 

Lastly, and mostly, I really like Dorf Romantik because it's such a genuine game. It doesn't have to compete and be cutting edge, mature themed, excessively mature themed, or horrifying. It treats people as people - and not an enhanced human of superiorly attuned reflexes with skills of a veteran soldier or an ex-zombie, thief, assassin, or prostitute. It's just a really simple game, that's peaceful with an attractive environment, that people can relax & enjoy being in (with a little bit of challenge) as we all struggle to navigate through our own day-to-day. I really appreciate what the devs at Dorf Romantik are doing in providing such a game and I wish there were more like this. I'm very, very grateful to them. Thanks so much!

Behind you, you hear a flurry of leaves and then you are struck in the back by a swinging tree branch. You tumble down down down down down down down down down into the abyss. Time passes while you fall, then more time. You lose track of the time that goes by. Is it months? Years? You ponder your life. Did you SIT BACK AND RELAX enough? Did you waste too much of it caring for others? Who was that clown at your eighth birthday party who you caught kissing your mom in the garage?

Early Access review below

Can't remember how I found the game but it appealed from the off, and despite in my 100+ hours at time of writing I've not managed more than 13K in score I am still very addicted to this game.
Some forum members are frustrated at the lack of decent tiles to continue your run going, but that's part of the unknown element I like, and still in development. Not had any game breaking bugs and only 1 crash.
If you buy and allow the beta version Free Play has been added and although I thought that would appeal I've not even tried it yet because I'm still pushing on to get unlock achievements and beat my high score.
I've bought it for my partner and she has more hours than me with a similar score. It's just our go to chill out game whilst listening to music or having a chat.

This might be my favourite game of all 2021/2022. Never have I seen such a nice Early Access phase. Now with full release it is my favourite puzzle game to just play, relaxe and forgett about everything else.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You place hexagonal pieces on a playing field. The adjacent sides should be identical (field to field, forest to forest, etc.). New pieces are unlocked by perfect placements (all six sides placed correctly) and completion of quests (create X amount of fields, trees, etc.). The game ends when the part table is used up.

[h1]Artstyle / Music[/h1]
It looks simple, but everything fits together perfectly. On special parts, which are unlocked through quests, three-dimensional animals (deer, foxes, swans, ...) also move around.
The music is very realxing and chill.

[h1]Bugs[/h1]
It probably sounds crazy, but despite my 100+ hours in Early Access, I hardly experienced any bugs. I have never lost game saves or the like.

[h1]On a special Note[/h1]
The developers do a really awesome job supporting the game. There is a community Discord Server for general conversation, questions and also reporting bugs.",1669501256,1669501256,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's really a game for all ages tbh and you can always sneak a few minutes in when you need a bit of time for yourself.

The challange scalles with the amound of time you play one game, which keeps your brain active.

PROs:
+ Really beautiful graphics
+ Quite simple concepts, yet difficult to master
+ Controls work well (rotate the tile or the map, zoom in/out, pan the map)
CONs:
- Random piece generator is... well... random (sometimes you can't find the missing tile)
- Adjacencies are sometimes less easy to spot
- Bonuses are sometimes less easy to understand, especially for new players
- Game options are REALLY limited. Why don't you allow custom games where I chose the starting number of tiles and the ""mission"" bonuses - even if these custom games do not count towards the global leaderboards?
- Wish for a few additional game mechanics (e.g. mountain regions or roads)
- Wish for some more action on the map - as of now it's a bit too static, which is sad

Would love to see some additional content and game modes, it definitely holds some additional potential!

A very nice and simple game, nice time killer and a relaxer in which you have to think a little. Simple mechanics make us catch the rules right away, an interesting idea for a board game, combining elements is fun, mini tasks and points are fun, nice music in the background and graphics pleasant to the eye, I hope for expansion and more elements in the future

Dorfromantik scratched a somewhere between 'Carcassonne' and 'The Islanders' itch for me. Simple and addictive to sprawl out your tiles out, but challenging to perfect and optimise your placements as you weigh the satisfaction of aesthetics vs. high score.
I've been onboard since early access, having never been disappointed in the additional content provided to the game. Any potential wants I had were addressed and added over these various updates (creative mode, solutions button, timed, monthly etc.). Glad to see they were able to expand to the Switch - as this is truly a wonderfully enjoyable experience with endless potential for tile puzzlers.

In high score mode, you earn tiles by completing missions (link over 30 houses together, create a forest with over 200 trees, close off a set of fields, etc). Your score depends on the placement of these tiles (10 points for each edge matched, for instance. There is no time limit so you can take it easy, placing the tiles until you eventually run out giving a score at the end. As you progress you also unlock more tile types to add variation the better you get.

Creative mode has unlimited tiles and you can change which ones are most likely to appear next. 

Both modes are relaxing, unless you get obsessed about beating your high score :D 

Personally, I play one game and quit, do something else then feel a desire to come back for another game. It's not a game I can play for hours in one sitting, but this isn't a criticism. It's one I just want to keep coming back to with a more adrenaline inducing game in between sessions.

That's the best elevator pitch I could give the game, it's a simple puzzle game of matching tiles for resource adjacency points. The longer you can keep going without running out of tiles, the more you'll unlock and farther you can look back on your progress.

I recently nominated it for this year's Steam Award for Best Game on the Go because this game can be started up and picked up anywhere and be played immediately for a few minutes or several hours. It's absolutely worth full price, a steal when you can find it on sale.

You basically get a new tile to place everytime and you have a fixed amount of tiles, which can be increased by completing some quests. This is the puzzle element in the game to make as big villages you can make without running out of tiles. You can actually make some really beautiful looking towns and countrysides! I really really like the art style and the multiple themes they have for every tile. One run im making a frozen winter-ish town and next game there is lush fields in pleasant spring. It's a very calming experience and something great that you want to play in between doing some other tasks or just stress relief. Whenever i play it i feel like im in some countryside just sitting on a ledge near a farm and watching the sunset, those feels....

The core gameplay is just placing hexagon tiles down which represent different terrain types. Matching up similar types will give you better score. You can also expand out and unlock new tiles.

Plainly, you cannot actually realise how challenging it can be unless you are playing. It is the perfect combination of beautiful, relaxing and interesting. The achievements are designed perfectly to aid you in getting the trickier parts of the game and help it remain interesting even if you have unlocked all tiles. Quests make you reevaluate the whole strategy you ve used to build your map so far. You get caught between your want to create something aesthetically perfect, and the need to keep completing tasks to have the tiles to do so.

All in all, 10/10 already and cant wait to see what it will look like coming out of early access.  And though the price tag might seem a bit high to some, it is well worth it if you re into this kind of game, and comes with the added pleasant feeling of supporting a very small but very talented team!!

TIP: shouldnt need to be clarified but if you re like me it does- PLAY THE TUTORIAL!!!

This was an early access game review previously but even after after released, I am still happy with this! Similar to Islanders, Dorfromantik is a fun and cheapo casual game with no specific end game except to keep placing/getting tiles or to challenge the scoreboard. A set of tiles will be given at first and you gotta do quests/tasks (and closing them) for more else the game ends once you are out. Would buy again but only during sales as there is nothing much to return for (at least for now).

Pros:
+The graphic is very simple yet detailed especially after you placed enough tiles to be surprised by what you have done. It is very enjoyable as the little boat/train go around your city/island.
+Surprisingly fun and addictive gameplay, you will wish for more tiles as you reach the end. Thankfully, you get the option to continue on creative mode (free build with no points counted). 
+I often spent couple of hours on a run for achievements without even realising it =X
+Early access game but build is quality and game is bug/crash-free so far (fingers crossed lol).

Cons:
-You won't just wish for tiles; you will wish they tell you to close borders of quests/tasks for the extra tiles. You will also wish that you can undo mistakes or drop crap tiles (looking at the damned combination of train and river tile). Very frustrating when you only need 1 or 2 more tiles to complete the awesome build. 
*Note: You can continue on creative mode but getting the points/achievements do float my boat thus don't mind me, thank you.
-Again, similar to Islanders, game is straight forward and you just place tiles given to complete quests/tasks. Other than that, nothing else for me except to chill and enjoy the view. Will go a few more rounds for higher scores (e.g. 30k) but after that, probably will not return till I need this itch scratched again =(",1645603821,1669219841,True,11,0,0.65814971923828125,0,True,False,False

Dorfromantik is a simple puzzle game, but it's in that simplicity where its beauty resides.

The game's simple enough ‚Äî you get a random tile (which is any combination of grass, woods, water, train tracks, fields and houses) which you then place on the game board. How you place it matters, as it scores points (and points mean prizes in the form of extras tiles, etc), and you get the most points by joining and linking areas of the same type. You also get missions to complete (e.g. 10 linked tiles of water) that net you even more points, or even a special tile.

Easy.

Except it isn't, because the challenge is how to deal with unfavourable tile draws without the game board spiralling out of control into unchecked sprawl of useless tile placements... Thing is, drawing a card you can't use is slightly mitigated by the fact you get a slight preview of what's coming, but still, if you're trying to close out a fields mission and all you're drawing are trees, water and houses... sigh...

Strangely, this game manages to avoid being stressful, despite RNG unfairness, mostly due to the zen peacefulness of the tile placement, which at core is a soothing, repetitious act, and this is the game's real niche ‚Äî it excels as a winding-down, de-stressing activity... But be careful when playing ‚Äî a ""quick half hour session"" can easily become an hour or more, simply because you become enrapt in the tile placement, creating your beautiful landscapes...

This game is definitely worth your time (if you like this sort of thing), and as a further inducement there's a sandbox mode where you can create ""perfect"" worlds (you still get random tiles, but you can skip ones you don't want, and clone ones you do)",1669198773,1669198773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not really a city builder, a strategy game, or a simulation, despite Steam's tags. What it is is a very chill game of placing tiles. Although you can run out of tiles in any given session, you never really lose, as each time you play you unlock even more tiles allowing for even more combinations of tile edges. 

And sometimes you simply won't care if a session ends; not every game needs to be about winning, or even beating your high score; Dorf Romantik is the perfect example of a game where the actual gameplay act, choosing where to put your tiles, can be just so relaxing that that's enough for you. It's certainly enough for me. This game is so good for just whittling away at your pent up work-stress.",1669193759,1669193759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One thing to note: if you are obsessed with getting all the achievements, this game will not let you scratch that itch. As far as I can tell, for each game you start you get assigned three random achievement categories, and no matter how awesome you do in that particular game, you can only unlock achievements in those categories (other than some broad ones like total points, etc).

For example, I know that I've built a village larger than 50 houses loads of times, and that I've built forests larger than 750 trees most games I've played, but since those two achievement categories were not active in those games, I have not yet earned those achievements.

The achievements bit is annoying to me, but considering how insanely difficult the top tier of achievements is in this game, I doubt I would ever 100% this game.

In a slower way: Dorfromantik is a single-player tile placing game where the objective is literally score attack but, in a broader sense, is about perfect tile placement. A game of Dorfromantik, like Carcassone, ends when the number of tiles remaining is zero but. unlike Carcassone, you can replenish your tiles by completing - and I use the word rather loosely here- challenges. This tile says it wants to be connected to 37 tiles of wheat/field, so you better connect EXACTLY AND NO MORE THAN 37 tiles of wheat/field but this railroad says ay buddy how you doing can I get uh at least 50 railroad tracks and you go sure I got a the train equivalent of a Jormungandr over here lemme just slap you in there.

And that gives you 5 more tiles.

I mentioned perfect tile placement. When you surround all six sides of a tile with a perfect match, which you'll know when its perfect because that side will glow white as opposed to red, you get bonus points as well as another tile back.

Truly.
The only negative I can produce, which is actually **** all to do with the game - is that I didn't buy it sooner.
For real. That one is on me >.< 
It's been popping up relentlessly for some time now, on my recommended lists...and I've always been like. Meh. Wanna shoot stuff...maybe some other day.
Roll forward to now, becoming quite ill, signed off work sick. Bored AF. Playing the 'waiting game' for answers and struggling to fill my days with anything that doesn't cause me any stress.
This little gem popped up again, read some reviews, fair pricing. Bought it. 
It's been 12 days. I can't stop... It's the BEST distraction from life, super chill, pair that with the True Crime Kent Podcasts I have running in the background and my days are just set.

The only reason I'm giving this a Down Vote is because of two things...

1. Four Excruciatingly painful Achievements to shoot for namely:

*Planner V
*Planner VI
*Puzzler V1
*Puzzler VII

2. RNG

These four Achievements, actually a lot of the Achievements for this game will require you to rely on a good Tile Roll because I've come really, really close to getting at least Puzzler VI with only five (tiles) remaining to complete the Achievement which is to plop down 200 consecutive tiles that do not have any incompatible edges, so that eant I've already plopped down 195 of said tiles with only thirty tiles on my stack remaining. ""You still have Thirty tiles to use, so what's the problem then that's plenty enough"", you might say. The problem is, this game's RNG loves to piss you off. In those thirty remaining tiles it'll most likely hand you four or less of what you actually need and the rest will be tiles that'll screw you over.

So yeah, fun and pretty chill game actually, until you try and shoot for the game's Achievements and the game's RNG decides to screw you over and be a huge pain.

I love this game. An exceptional casual game, Dorfromantik creates a peaceful world to dive into through its use of art-style, music, and the 'lively' world created as part of creating tiles. Its relaxed objective-based mode drives gameplay without being overbearing, and its achievements and unlocks reward the player for smart moves as they progress. By adding the small animations to tiles, it emphasizes the feeling of 'building' something, and helps bring the player into its serene realm.

Some tiles give you quests (i.e. link up 50 buildings to this hex) which give you 5 tiles when completed. Some quests also drop a flag when completed, which gives you 5 more tiles if you block off that quest type (i.e closing the forest region off). You also can get 1 tile if you place a hex perfectly (i.e. each side is touching another hexside with the same stuff in it).The goal of each game is to play until you run out of tiles. The game has objectives, some of which are always counting, some of which only count if it is one of the three objectives given at the start of each game. If you complete those objectives you unlock unique tiles (i.e. a windmill hex where all 6 sides are farmland). Each objective has multiple levels which grow in difficulty/time investment to complete. This is why the main gamemode is a puzzle game, not a city builder, you are trying to last as long as possible and get as many unlocks as you can in one run. There is a creative gamemode which gives you unlimited tiles and the ability to skip or delete tiles you don't want, but to get the unique tiles in the creative mode you must first unlock them in the base game. Overall, it is a very fun game, and can be pretty relaxing (so long as you aren't trying to complete one of the harder objectives, such as placing 200 tiles in a row without having any tile side touch a hex whose side is different).",1638334495,1666052487,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I have been playing the Beta version on both PC and Steam Deck which runs really well. On the Steam Deck it's a great game for on the go as you can stop and resume later as desired. It's also a nice, relaxing game to play overall.

At the start of the game you are given a a number of tiles. The aim of the game is to match the corresponding sides of randomised tiles to score points and complete objectives. Completing these objectives awards you more tiles. For example, you may get a city tile that requires +50 houses. If you connect enough tiles and sides to have that number of houses, then you complete the 'quest'. This also applies to trees, rivers, train tracks and fields. 

My placing more and more tiles you end up creating a randomised landscape that's different each time. The game's simple graphics and gentle soundtrack, accompanied by the occasional moo from a cow or choo from a passing train, make the game a joy to watch unfurl. There is also a creative mode if you don't want to bother chasing points. I would put this game in the same category as Townscaper or Islands, it's very simple  but you can lose yourself for hours.

I suspect this is how the game it designed and it's a reasonably priced game so I am generally positive on it, but please be aware: 
1) The game never meaningfully changes. All mechanics are presented as-is early on, and the only changes I found were cosmetic (new looks for tiles). If you aren't having fun early, you won't later.
2) It can be frustrating because the tiles you get are random and sometimes really hard to place intelligently

With those being said, the game is extremely accessible, and relaxing. Some of the results can be really nice  looking and it's fun creating pretty landscapes.

Yes it looks nice, yes the soundtrack is very good but after an hour or two you start to realise that that's it. The gameplay is in this weird limbo where you can't really make coherent landscapes because you are supposed to cluster certain tiles together to rack up points while certain tiles prevent others from being placed. It's a fairly boring puzzle game and it's definitely not a city builder. You always end up with a, granted, nice looking but wholly uninteresting patchwork of random tiles that you need to throw away to make a new patchwork of random tiles. The only form of long term motivation beyond 2h of gameplay is unlocking new tiles that don't do anything different than the other tiles and for some reason there is a highscore system that completely goes against the zen nature of the game but I guess you gotta make everything competitive these days...?",1663013408,1663143458,False,6,0,0.527495741844177246,0,True,False,False

It seems simple enough... matching tiles with different landscape types to make a pretty vista.  But there's some deeper gameplay here, and while you can just have a fun time slamming down tiles, you'll hit a wall until you unlearn some bad habits and assumptions.  Bigger isn't always better, and attempting to make every goal are two issues of mine that often led to me running out tiles early and prevented me from getting bigger scores.

I think if I had one main issue, it's that the need to connect the outlying quest tiles to unlock new goals and eventually tile types wasn't made very clear.  I kept wondering why I had clearly made a forest of 500+ trees on several occasions but didn't get the achievement until I re-read some stuff about the game.

As a person who doesn't pay attention to cost much, if I did, then this REALLY ain't it.

Very little content, very little reward from matching tiles correctly. Quests just make you play the way you'd already play, by keeping similar types together. When you complete a big one, there's little feeling of reward. Nothing really unlocks in later play, nothing to build towards (far off quest tiles do not feel like a reward)... the terrain just sprawls out so much that keeping tabs on which tiles you're looking for to complete a hole gets tiresome.

This game isn't 'horrible'. At first I felt an urge to build out the tile map. But after a couple quick games (including tutorial) I was already near my limit. I started a new game with the intent to focus on quests so my game time would last longer. Unfortunately, every game I played i got worse and worse tiles, including a significant number of related tiles in a row without any quests. When you got like 20 water tiles to place, the game suddenly begins to seem loaded. 

After my 3 or so games, I felt like there is no purpose to the game, it is very monotonous and boring, and I felt more aggrivated with my tile choices and irritated that planning seems to be intentionally sabatoged by the game. your chances of getting a tile that is good for a particular spot needing >3 sides is very slim, even if you had a number of them just prior to needing one for a particular spot. 

I cannot see why anyone says this game is relaxing, i found it the opposite of relaxing, boring, pointless, and am done with it within a couple hours or so.... and played the last game already in this state from the prior games.

Sure, you can figure out exactly how the game works, all the little details and try to get the highest score possible, but that, to me, is not the real strength of the game. 
The thing it does best is to challenge your mind just enough to keep you invested in the game, while also keeping it real simple. 
All you do is rotate tiles and fit them into ideal places to either satisfy your sense of asthetics or to earn higher points by combining alot of forest tiles for example (or housetiles, watertiles and so on). 
Combine that with relaxing music and overall great rural sounddesign and you have this game, which doesn't do a lot, but what it sets out to do it does very well. 

Pros:
+ Relaxing
+ great Soundtrack
+ easy to play, hard to master

Cons:
- may get repetitive

A game that doesn't want to do a lot and succeeds brilliantly in the little it does.

Although I use the term ""city builder,"" I feel like it needs clarification when describing this game.

The main attraction of city builders is the satisfaction one gets when creating something complex and/or beautiful. In most city builders, these creations are premeditated in that they stem from an idea of something you'd like to make. In Dorfromantik, your creations are almost entirely a byproduct of your pursuit for survival and high scores (unless you prefer Creative Mode). 

After finishing a long session in Dorfromantik, it's satisfying to look back at all you've done. Although you don't plan for the end result to look the way it does, there is a sort of natural beauty in the score/survival driven creation. There is a history to each board.

That being said, I think you'll be disappointed if you're not into high scores and your main motivation for buying this game is its city building and creation aspects. I like how the city building aspects manifest in this game, but I don't think they are all that engaging when separated from the scoring/survival aspects.

One more thing. It's easy to fall into a trance-like state while playing this game. That makes this game perfect for those moments when you want to engage your mind with little effort. If you've ever played a lot of Tetris, you know what I mean.

In short:
If you like Tetris & city builders, buy this game.
If you like Tetris & not city builders, buy this game anyway.

The player is given a supply of hex shaped tiles featuring houses, trees, rivers, lakes, wheat fields and train tracks, and you‚Äôll decide where to place them, ideally matching together tiles of the same type. Some rare tiles have tiny trains, boats, or animals, which will move around the map when placed.

In the classic game mode you have a limited number of tiles, but can earn more by completing quests which ask you to connect a number of the same tiles together, or by making perfect placements where all edges match. Your objective is to earn the highest score possible before you run out of tiles. 

Each run should take around 1-2 hours, but unfortunately the simple gameplay mechanics felt a bit repetitive after only a few runs. I also don‚Äôt like that the tile generation is completely randomised. I always seem to end up with some blank voids in my map that I can‚Äôt fill in because I just never get a tile that fits properly.

There‚Äôs also a creative game mode where you have unlimited tiles to expand endlessly without worrying about quests and high scores, although you‚Äôre still limited by the random generator and you can‚Äôt earn achievements.

Really disagree with most of the reviews here. I found the game frustrating, stressful, and honestly completely not the relaxing experience I hoped it would be.

I spend so much time checking tile placement, splitting out rails from rivers to reduce placement, and trying to dial in all the quests but despite my best efforts and plenty of skin unlocks I can't complete a single major challenge!
I'm going to keep attacking this game on the good faith assumption that I suck and don't have enough practice and that I got some bad luck thrown in the mix. I'll see if I can put another update in after a few more hours.

You grab a beer
Its time to relax
You want nothing to interfere

You turn on your PC
And want a calm game
Not a clickfest or gorestorm
But something to hone the brain

Perhaps a puzzler
That won't take all night
Something with pretty, quaint graphics
Something simple and bright

You click the play button
And start the first round
You shovel tiles and rotate them
And a landscape takes ground

You match farms to farms
And woods to woods
Your villages grow large
And there' trains to transport goods

The game goes on
But you hit your last tile
So you decide to restart
With a fresh, random pile

As the night goes on
You continue to play
Until you realise
The evening has drifted away

You wanted on one round
Maybe two at the most
But before you know it
You became too engrossed

That's Dorfromantik 
In a nutshell
Simple mechanics
But addictive as hell

A puzzle for adults
And one that you'll love

It's a very relaxing game, and the gorgeous soundtrack is a perfect complement - I just wish it was on Spotify so I could carry on listening to it after I'm done playing :D

The core of Dorfromantik is to place a series of hexagonal tiles next to each other on a large grid. Connect the same types of tiles together for a few bonus points, place a tile that matches on all 6 sides and you'll score a 'perfect' and get a bonus tile. Sometimes you get 'quest' tiles which need to be connected to a large, connected string of a certain type of tile in order to get a big bonus pile of tiles.

This all seems simple in its premise, but once you get into it you realise there's much more strategy than first meets the eye. Firstly, you're always running out of tiles with every tile you place. If you reach 0 tiles, the game ends. You can make a profit on tiles by completing quests, but what if you get a quest that needs a large forest and you've not got any forests large enough? Or any forests with open edges to carry on adding to? Some quests also need a specific number of items - e.g. be connected to exactly 36 houses - if you only have one megacity in the middle of the map that you add all house tiles to, you'll fail that mission instantly.

Strategising and keeping your map in a certain way to prepare for as many missions as possible is the heart of the game, but it's not as tedious as it might sound. Paired with the beautiful soundtrack, calming visuals and cute atmosphere effects (birds, animals etc. roaming around on the tiles), you watch your map slowly come to life as you try to survive as long as possible without running out of tiles.

In short; Dorfromantik is a relaxing and easily-replayable 'pick up' puzzle game. It's easy to play but also easy to lose, so once you've learnt the basics you can begin strategising to get the high scores needed to unlock more and more of the overall meta quests.",1659616087,1659616087,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's an experience very much like the last time I worked on a large jigsaw puzzle until I realized blearily it was 3am. My 15 hours was only 2 games, split into maybe 4 play sessions, as I can't help but search for the best place for every tile once I'm more than a hundred tiles in. If you have a hyper-focus problem like me, then consider yourself warned...

There's a fair bit of hidden depth to the gameplay beyond tile edge matching. You learn to pay attention to quests (which reward more tiles to your stack to continue playing if you, say, grow a forest enough or close off a set of fields), assess their relative attainability, and choose between incompatible options. And, after a couple of games, it's also become obvious that really getting to know the tile set's ins and outs would help - it's broad but not complete, so when you place that 3rd or 4th tile adjacent to an open hex, you might be creating a hole that is easy to fill or guaranteed to cost you points later. Some tiles with more than 2 types of terrain only have one handedness (clockwise or counter), for instance, and rivers and tracks in particular have pretty limited patterns of terrain on their other edges. Whether I actually want to spend the time to take notes (or study someone else's notes on the web) just to get better at this dangerous time suck of a game, I don't know yet :)

As useless as ""this game is like X"" comparisons often are, I'd put this somewhere around Mini Metro/Motorways; but instead of a minimalist aesthetic mimicking subway lines or road maps respectively, Dorfromantik goes for a very cozy art style that's easy on the eyes and really drives home the relaxing vibe the whole game has. The ambient audio and gentle music also contribute strongly to that feeling.

Really, I've got nothing to complain about, major or minor. It's a wonderful game that's an absolute time sink--there's been sessions where a single game has gone on for well over an hour and I haven't even felt the time pass.

If I had to describe it in one sentence, I‚Äôd say [i]Dorfromantik[/i] is essentially therapy bottled up and sold in a video game format. It‚Äôs fun and cozy, and I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone who‚Äôs a fan of city builders. Heck, I‚Äôd recommend it to Joe Blow down the street.

This is a low-stress game that I find myself thinking about even during periods when I‚Äôm not actively playing it (a testament to how unforgettable it is, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting), and a game I often itch to return to when I‚Äôm stressed out. If you‚Äôre looking for something pleasantly simple to escape to after a long day (or a long life), then this is the perfect candidate.

My only qualm is that it does get rather repetitive and somewhat boring after a few hours. The good thing is that it‚Äôs really easy to pick the game back up, even if you haven‚Äôt touched it in a few months.

All in all, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs absolutely worth buying ‚Äî the concept is great, and the quality is exceptional.

In the end, it becomes simply more frustrating than relaxing, and I wouldn't say that resulting landscapes look that good. Waters and forests are nice, railroads and cities are OK, but those yellow/purple fields are unbelievably ugly.

I do really love this game but for now I just think it needs to be fleshed out more. 
Hopefully someday it will blossom.

The game rewards patient and thinking, instead of spamming tiles. There is diversity in the two different categories of tiles, being water/train and house/tree/farm. The water train station is also a great piece. The game itself isn't bad, it just hasn't reached it fullest potential yet. 

What i mean by this is that there are plenty of additions the devs can make to the game. As of now there has not been a lot of updates. The big update with Quick Mode, Hard Mode, Creative Mode etc. was a great update adding a lot of new content. But that was mostly gamemodes and not features. I have some ideas I hope the devs will atleast take note of. 

1. Timelapse
A great way to showcase what you have accomplished after a you lose.

2. Different skins
Although I adore the style of this game, something they could add is different houses, different trains, etc. to make the world more customizable.

3. Hills
As I said before, the style of this game fits the premise, but it feels a bit flat. Whilst it doesnt need to be complicated, some hills would help out the feel of the world. The hills would also make for great for more diverse landscape, like if you were to have a water tile next to it, it would have a cliffside etc. 

4. More diversity
Although the houses work just fine. There are only a handful of different types of houses you get, the tower, watermill, windmill, and the other structure usually next to fields. What I would love to have is different buildings, for example a lighthouse if a full water-tile has one house on a side, or a trainstation where it would usually end, a lumberjacks house if a house is next to a large forest, a fishermans hut next to a little lake etc. This goes for boats and trains too, maybe have a slightly bigger boat, or a longer train. I truly think this would make the feel of this game even better. 

5. Scarecrow
Idk, the fields are kinda empty. just add some scarecrows

6. Boat and train view
I saw someone make a post on reddit of a mod they made where you could see the game from a boat or trains perspective. Personally i think this would be a fun way to take in what you have accomplished, kind of like the timelapse mode. 

I don't actually know if any devs are going to see this, but I truly hope so. I have loved playing the game ever since I got it, and will continue to play. But if any devs are reading this, please think about my suggestions.",1657837100,1657837100,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

But it's also a puzzle and a surprisingly satisfying one at that. There's the satisfaction of placing your tiles just right to get points and reach milestones, but it's also just a chill game about creating a beautiful world",1657429563,1657429563,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1455840,118551700,76561198150932132,0,7,531,0,531,1656477328,"Dorfromantik is a gorgeous and relaxing tile-placing game where you place tiles to build a map filled with plains, farmlands, forests, towns, rivers and railways. The music lulls you into a sense of timelessness, where nothing else really matters but placing the next tile. Do you want to complete challenges for extra points? Or create ‚Äòperfect‚Äô placements where all the edges match? Or just ignore all of that and go into creative mode to make /your/ perfect map?

Just looking at the waterfall of positive reviews on Steam is enough to encourage a try at this game. I personally found it well worth the investment of time and money, and still go back to it frequently. It‚Äôs not something I will play for hours every day, but that‚Äôs a good thing in my view - it scratches an itch that I didn‚Äôt realise was there, it lifts my mood, it sparks my creativity. At the same time, it lets me go and play other games and do other things, then come back and not suffer the annoying learning curve over and over. Once you know what you‚Äôre doing, then you know what you‚Äôre doing and can come and go as you please.

Admittedly, this  isn‚Äôt a game for everyone. I love it, my partner loves it, many people on Steam apparently love it. But this is not a city-builder, and I hesitate to call it a strategy game. As another Steam review commented, it‚Äôs more like hexagonal dominoes with a different skin. I find it incredibly relaxing and especially when I‚Äôm sick, this is a great game to just turn my brain off and focus on the pretties. When trying to get achievements or fulfill quests however, it can get annoying trying to make do with the random tiles you‚Äôre given. For some people, the annoyance can overrule the relaxation.

From a purely mechanical gameplay perspective, Dorfromantik is incredibly well made. I have yet to encounter any bugs, and Toukana Interactive are addressing those bugs which others have found. I have only played the PC version, not Switch, but I can see it being a really good portable game as it‚Äôs something you can pick up and put down as needed without worrying about losing out on anything. 

Toukana Interactive have yet to release other games onto Steam, but I for one am eagerly waiting for them to announce their next project.


Top 5 Pros
	- So relaxing
	- So pretty
	- Different challenge modes, or creative mode which lets you just build
	- Chill soundtrack to go along with it
	- Sensible pricing


Top 5 Cons
	- The randomness does mean that for some people it‚Äôs more frustrating than relaxing
	- See above for repetitiveness
	- Showing only one tile at a time does increase that frustration and lowers the ability to strategise
	- Having achievements locked behind quests gets very irritating
	- The quests themselves can get in the way of having a relaxing time

Would I recommend?
	I recommend reading a few reviews and deciding whether it‚Äôs the right game for you. It‚Äôs not for everyone. For those who it does fit, though, it‚Äôs a lovely game well worth the price. If you‚Äôre not sure, buy it on sale and give it a try.
