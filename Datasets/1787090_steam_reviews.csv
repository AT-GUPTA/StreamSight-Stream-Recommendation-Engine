OLD REVIEW: This was good but there's too much being ""fixed"" and added. It's become a bit of an unstable disaster and I believe moving it to Steam was a big mistake of the dev. There aren't many good alternatives out there but with every iteration, this becomes less stable and more buggy. I find myself creating scheduling tasks in Task Scheduler for Windows 11 to give it a fresh reboot at least twice a day and even that doesn't correct it's funkiness sometimes.

Believe me, I have tried just about every single alternative that exists that I could get my hands on over the years -- from RocketDock to heavily customized RainMeter themes -- MyDockFinder is hands down the most  fully-featured, comprehensive and best looking of the bunch.  If you're a super nerd like me (and let's face it, if you're reading this review, you probably are), then you'll totally love the extensive customization options available here, from changing the system tray icons and font face on the 'finder', to customizing the per-monitor (if you have a multi-monitor setup) behavior for showing/displaying the dock and/or finder, etc. you can really geek out on this and make it indistinguishable in it's appearance and mostly (about an 8/10) in it's functionality, to that of MacOS.

I'm sure there are people out there who are thinking to themselves, ""why not just get MacOS?"", which is a valid question -- unfortunately some of us are stuck on Windows due to workplace obligations or other necessities of life, and thus, this is the best we've got for recreating the elements of MacOS some of us love.

Don't hesitate to buy this, worth every penny.  BTW, the people who are posting comments/reviews saying that this is some kind of 'malware' or 'spyware' simply because a Chinese company had a part in developing it, are low IQ clowns and not worth listening to.

 - Very close to Mac OS

 - Probably the best Win10/11 Dock option I've tested

 - The Icons being built into Steam Workshop makes it super easy to find new icons rather than having to download packs

Cons
 - Occasionally crashes, not enough to be a huge bother though

 - Navigating through different windows seems to be a bit more tedious than vanilla windows, making it a bit more annoying while I am working with 50 things opened at once

 - Since the explorer task is always running in windows, you never know if you have a file explorer window open or not because the icon always displays as running. This is slightly annoying for me but not a huge deal

- I wish I could display the currently playing song right on the finder bar instead of having to click into the now playing button. Similar to how droptop 4 displays it would be a really nice feature for me personally.

 - This is a big one for me: PLEASE ADD THE WEATHER! I would love to have a weather temp readout in the finder.. I think droptop 4 is honestly a better finder than this but I decided to use this just to have all settings and appearances match.",1704396777,1704396777,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is another new alternative to using a dock similar to Mac Os X and Linux. It has good visual effects and good features. WinStep and MyDockFinder are the best modern versions at the moment, (compatibility).

-Simulation of mac effect when minimizing windows and other animations).
-option to add Finder bar (mac or linux style)
-Finder bar is great and has good features
-High compatibility and interaction with Windows system programs and applications (volume, microphone, etc)

NOTE: NOW HAVE DISCORD SERVER TO IMPROVE SOFTWARE SUPPORT, SOFTARE FEEDBACK AND MANY MORE.


Disadvantages: 
-Lack of proper troubleshooting support, no proper support for queries in western languages (English, etc)
-Dock and Finder customization not intuitive (user needs to know a bit about file structures, etc)
-No tutorial (western language) for users to make modifications and themes

The software is great, really great!  I recommend.",1677980309,1678443931,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

As for the app itself - very much a work in progress, but probably the best macOS UI replication available on Windows as of now. The dock behaves very much like Latte Dock in Linux.

Needed fixes:
1) Dock - Better multi-monitor-support: Minimize animations aren't applied correctly on my 2nd monitor (apps there are minimized to the Windows taskbar instead).
2) MyFinder (Global Menu) - Stability: This is very much alpha software, and crashes are frequent. As of now, I recommend you to disable this feature, if an uninterrupted workflow is your main concern. 
3) MyFinder - Features: The global menu seems to be using pre-coded presets for specific apps, such as Firefox and Windows Explorer. Less known/used apps lack this functionality, and simply fall back to displaying the app title and nothing else. Added support for user-generated ""app modules"" would go a long way to fix this, and would allow the community to add global menu support for third-party apps.

All in all - probably the best dock replicator available on Windows right now. It behaves very much like the real thing. MyFinder is still too early in development to be used in a serious work environment, but I look forward to further bugfixes and features.

(I would also like it if this app was available outside of Steam, perhaps in Microsoft Store. I very much like to separate gaming from my workflow, if possible - thanks).

Screenshot (Dock, MyFinder disabled - used with Start11 taskbar):

However, the app constantly crashes, sometimes even refusing to open. We're talking here at least 5 times during a normal day. It doesn't even prompt an error message and the error logs are non-existent.

Furthermore, it has no multiple monitor support. Technically it works but the GUI constantly switches from monitor to monitor whenever there is a focus change and there is no way to have it stick to one or all displays.  It has caused my computer to crash multiple times and it's a huge load on your graphics driver.

Don't buy this. Try using Cairo desktop interface. While it's not as streamlined as dockfinder and even tho it's doing more of it's own thing rather than ripping of gnome, It's a far more stable shell replacement that has all of the same features and then some.

The biggest issue I currently have is that when hovering over the menu items on Finder, the menus dont open on mouse over if one menu is already selected.

For example, when you hover over ""Finder"" the menu will pop up, but when you move your cursor over ""File"" the menu for ""Finder"" remains open. Whats worse is you then require a double click instead of a single click to open the next context menu which feels extremely slow and not satisfying whatsoever.

However, in its current state, I cannot recommend this to anyone I know because the developers need to improve this app's integration with games and for users like myself with multiple monitors. I use this app a lot and love its functionality, although I want to see them break boundaries and make further improvements/additions.

Here are some of the problems I face: when my game is in the borderless window mode, the finder and dock disappear. Hovering on the top and bottom edges won't work as neither the dock nor bar will appear.

When I make videos full-screen on my second monitor and go to focus on a window on my first monitor, the myfinder bar pops up on the second monitor, which is distracting and takes up space.

The auto-hide option for the myfinder bar only works on the primary monitor. If you try hovering your cursor at the top of any secondary monitor, the bar will not appear.

Regarding the first problem, I think the developers should find a way to let users access the myfinder bar or dock on the same monitor as a fullscreen game, and these facilities should auto-hide when not in use.

As per my second problem, I have a myfinder bar option enabled where it appears on all monitors. However, if I have a game or video set to fullscreen, I would prefer it where the myfinder bar or dock would appear when hovering my cursor at the edge of the screen.

Lastly, for the third problem, the auto-hide function for the myfinder bar should be in effect across all monitors. When the user hovers over the edge of any monitor, these bars should show up again and not just on the primary monitor.

If the developers were to fix all the problems above, I would change my recommendation from a no to a yes.",1659150907,1659150907,False,1,0,0.481675416231155396,0,True,False,False

the only drawback for me is this apps eat my CPU and RAM, 
and sometimes there are errors like conflicting with steam cloud, 
freeze some games for example valorant etc.

for the ""trojan"" my laptop didnt detect it.

Unlike every other app I've tried that ""tries"" to bring to some Mac look over to Windows, this blends seemlessly into Windows 11, like I've have no issues with the top bar, or the dock interfering with my games or programs, it has no impact on my PC's performance either. 


I also love the features the devs added, such as customization, so if you just like the MacOS style (ie top bar + dock) but DON'T want to have the icons that make it look like a bootleg Mac, then you don't, like I use a Win11 theme for it instead of a MacOS Monterey one for example. Or if you don't want the top bar, you don't need it if you don't want it, change the font to whatever you want, or set your own custom icons on the dock. 

The addition of the Launchpad is also a very welcomed one, I hate having a cluttered desktop, so I threw my most used icons onto the dock and other lesser used apps/games onto the launchpad and it's so much easier to find and makes the PC look cleaner. 

Overall, the devs did a fantastic job on this app, and I think it's probably the best app I've ever bought tbh.

The only thing that I would like the developer to implement is the ""Layering"" option with two options.

The two options are:

Always on Top - makes the dock always on top of any program you run (if you run, for example, Google Chrome, the dock will still be visible and will not go away).

&

Always on Bottom - puts the dock below every program (similar behavior to the taskbar, for example, run Google Chrome and the dock won't show itself even if I put my cursor on top of my screen).


I know many of you will probably say that this is already in the program, but my problem is that if I set the Dock Display Mode to ""Smart Hide"" or ""Auto Hide"", the dock will still show itself if I put my cursor on top/bottom of my screen, making the, for example, search bar unusable).

Incredibly well made, more customization then macOS itself and the developer said there's more on the way, including workshop support!
There are a few bugs to iron out and some translation issues however I'm sure those will be fixed.
I am geniunly very happy that this exists.",1637960006,1637960253,True,40,2,0.779118478298187256,0,True,False,False

1. I cant remove icons like App Library and trash. Along with that i cant really personalize anything.
2. I cant customize the calendar
I have the same issues for every icon, there should be an update where you can actually customize any icon in the dock because this is really frustrating.
I do recommend it but i'd just stick with the github version for now.

This is okay. workshop hasn't been open yet, so I don't know how it's used, but it's definitely amazing. It really looks like mac. If you don't like your window ui, I recommend it. Um... There are so many mistranslations in Korean and there are a lot of traces of using a translator. translation quality was not so good that I could understand only after watching the video several times and I had to change the language to English. rem usage rate is not as high as I thought. (Average 30.4mb) The price isn't bad either, so try it!

There's still lots of improvements that can be done but the functionality is all there. Thanks so much to the developer for making this 😍❤️,1637917973,1637917973,True,8,1,0.579293012619018555,0,True,False,False
