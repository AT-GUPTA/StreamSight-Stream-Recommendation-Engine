Get rudder pedals and if you can swing it, VR goggles. Took me a bit to get the graphics dialed in with the Occulus 3, but now it is so much easier to track opponents and get my shots on them. FYI, my second flight in VR I had not gotten the settings dialed in yet and the image would flutter a little which caused me to get motion sick lol. Ripped off the goggles and barely made it to the bathroom. But I still smoked the German convoy with bombs from the Mosquito!
Also, at first I played in game mode because the plane was easier to get off the ground but thats where the ease stopped. Couldnt manage my engine or maneuver well enough to shoot anyone down.

DCS World Steam Edition.
The definitive aerial combat flight sim for simmers looking to fly anything from WW2 prop planes to modern 4.5 gen fighters (the F-15E has, still waiting on the Typhoon now).
It also has a reputation as a moneysink, with full fidelity modules costing anywhere from $50 to $80 depending on the capabilities of the aircraft in question (I.E. WW2 prop planes cost less than the Mirage 2000, which costs less than the F/A-18C), not to mention how expensive peripherals can go for.
I've bought a lot of peripherals for this game and a few flight games before it, listed below in semi-chronological order/price order.
A Thrustmaster T.Flight HOTAS One for Ace Combat 7 and later War Thunder, $150.
A Logitech X52 HOTAS for Project Wingman and Arma 3, $150.
A pair of Thrustmaster T.Flight Rudder Pedals for Arma 3 and DCS, $130.
TrackIR 5 for Star Citizen and DCS, $150.
A pair of beautiful MFG Crosswind pedals for Star Citizen, Arma 3, and DCS, $330.
All of this culminating in the Winwing Orion 2 HOTAS combo F/A-18C Stick/Throttle, $600.
That's like $1500 on peripherals, and here I am sitting with 9 hours in DCS.
I really need to play this game. And sell off the old Thrustmaster gear and Logitech HOTAS.",1682355641,1698017734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But learning the 680 page manual, will only teach you about the aircraft's' limitations, envelope and functionality. That is before we even get to tactics.

DCS probably has the highest quality simulations of modern military aircraft available on the market. The cockpits are fully clickable, and the developers do their best to model the aircraft based on their real-world specifications. With that being said, the community sometimes refers to the game as ""Digital Cockpit Simulator"" for a reason. 

The actual gameplay can be lacking once you familiarize yourself with a plane (or three). The AI is practically non-existent and is implemented in its most basic form, and ground attack missions are little more than flying to a location and attacking a 3d model that has a basic health bar to ""simulate"" damage. More often than not, campaigns and missions are buggy or downright broken, and most of the enjoyment will come from learning and playing with others in multiplayer servers.

While the game is technically free, there is a relatively steep barrier to entry, and despite the marketing materials, a joystick or HOTAS is a must-have. The full fidelity aircraft come with a steep price tag which may put off newcomers, and Eagle Dynamics' monetization strategy for their WWII modules (where you need to buy a separate WWII asset pack, a WWII map, and a WWII plane just to participate) is so egregiously expensive you're better off using that money to buy IL2 if you want a WWII experience.

Pros:
+ Highest fidelity and quality military aircraft in the flight sim genre.
+ Beautiful graphics (just don't expect MSFS 2020).
+ More than enough content for people who like learning and flying planes for the sake of learning and flying planes.
+ One of the few flight simulators (if not the only one) where you get to shoot and bomb stuff in a realistically modeled aircraft.

Cons:
- Bare-bones, sometimes broken singleplayer experience.
- Gameplay mechanics are barebones beyond fly to target, kill target, rinse and repeat. Missions rely heavily on scripting and third-party mods to create a somewhat dynamic battlefield.
- Terrible AI.
- Expensive monetization model.",1642535821,1642535821,True,119,2,0.902646064758300781,0,True,False,False

The game has a learning curve that is akin to a learning cliff... thats on fire. its an intimidating game when you first start as you start with the hope of reenacting top gun but proceed to catch fire on the ground because you messed up getting your engine to start. the game is extremely complex and advanced but it grows with you which makes the experience tailored to the investment that you put in to it. 
this can be best described with a tangent to prove my point. 
-you just begin and after some time learn to set up and control the aircraft
- its very difficult to fly with mouse and keyboard (perfectly doable if you want), so you dust off your grandfather's old flight stick, and try using that. It goes much better and you're able to fly about with relative success. 
- as you get better you notice that the old joystick wont cut it anymore and you decide to upgrade to a basic HOTAS(hands on throttle and stick(like a joystick but with more buttaons and for both your hands)). with a growing setup and as the hours clock by, you are becoming a capable pilot and are finding what type of pilot you are. 
- you buy your first aircraft and join a community and play with other people.
- you bought a nice aircraft but you need something heavy for ground attacking like one of the A-10s, but you will also need a strong dog fighting aircraft like an F-16, but don't forget that the Russians have aircraft too, now you might as well get a helicopter and do you have a spitfire yet???
- when manipulating the cockpit its hard to keep looking with the mouse since your hands are full... time to get a head tracker 
- more buttons. get more buttons as you buy a nicer and better hotas once again
- one screen isn't enough so you get another monitor and you might as well get a pc or upgrade it if you have it because who wouldn't want to fly in 4K 200FPS
- two monitors becomes three and you find this world limiting. time to go VR 
- with VR you cant see the keyboard anymore. but you truly feel like youre flying
- you set up buttons and switches until you have built a 1 to 1 replica of your aircraft's cockpit irl that lets you truly experience immersion.
- the flesh is weak as you upload your consciousness to DCS. you already had to sell your can and stop buying food, might as well go full virtual.

that last bit is maybe unnecessary but wherever you are on this list, DCS will be extremely fun. 
one of its best features is the community who always like to help and given that most aircraft have manuals who's pages go well past the hundreds, it only makes sense to help one another out! 

recommended for:
- any computer specs. Even some potato computers work fine a low graphics
- good WIFI or better if you want to play online and with many people
- interest in aviation, flight, or warbirds, if you don't care much for flight then there are simpler flight games for you as the time investment is very heavy

Look, if you made it this far into the review then you're interested enough to download it, what can I say, its free! so nothing's lost if you decide its not for you. :) good luck and have fun!

EDIT: It's a long day at work. You spent the day working your ass off to get money for your aviation education. You sit in your chair and click the gray square shortcut that reads out ""DCS"".
You grab your extremely overpriced virtual reality headset on and watch your virtual cockpit 'boot up' and come to life. You're friend decides to join you on your aerial adventures. You decide to have a relaxing 'airshow' flight. You fly in cool looking formations, and get a lot of true to life pictures and moments from this beautiful simulator. Then you get into that perfect formation. You look up and see the belly of that blue angel F-18 just as they would in real life.

Then your friend drops their tailhook... kills your pilot and as he slumps over the controls the autopilot tries to level the plane, absolutely decking your friends ass and sending him into a spiral into the ocean, as a onlooker barrel rolls away from the carnage.

And then...I get asked to write a review of the game????????
Come on guys...you must be able to see I haven't actually played the game at all let alone access my downloadable content???
The help pages are a total waste of time and when you go the the support page they tell you right at the top ""Please do not post any problems about DCS World here""?????? There is nowhere else to ask a question that isn't covered under the FAQ section.
I really hope someone reads this and tells the support team I am in need of some major help!

Well, then please don't do like Mr. Grey, and try to put the blame on the costumer with excuses like:



""If we rush a system out that is not ready we get complaints, if we take our time and get it working correctly from day one we get complaints about taking to long.""


or


""If you don't want to participate in early access it is best to wait for full release.

It can be a long process, but work continues""


...when you know exactly why we're pissed about this whole F-16 scam.

We bought into those lies and you (ED) know. We knew it was early access, we knew it would take time, we knew there would be bugs. We didn't know that development would be stopped in to focus on the F-18. We're not complaining that it's taken too long,we are complaining that there hasn't been any progress at all for months.

Currently flying in VR with Valve Index.  No problems in VR with high settings.  The models looks great and the physics are really good.  The software does take some dedication to learn the systems/procedures; since DCS is constantly releasing new items, there is always something new to learn.  I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is looking for a basic flight sim, its a little more advanced than that.

I don't recommend DCS to anyone who expects an arcade type experience. This simulator is highly realistic and immersive and requires a decent computer to run it at nice settings. Two free aircraft are available however, they're not great. The DLC can be rather pricey often times over $50 or more. VR or Headtracking software is not required however, is HIGHLY recommended. Throttle and joystick combination or HOTAS is not required, but at a minimum you need a joystick with a throttle integrated. The DLC is done very well with almost every detail added. Overall just a very fun experience that keeps you coming back for more. Bottom line: DCS is not an arcade game. It's not Ace Combat.

So to start off, I do like this game just to be clear but it is VERY EXPENSIVE to get into. A good module is around $70 and maps are $50. A decent joystick and throttle start around the $100 mark and above. The game is really hard to play with a mouse to control the camera and interact with controls and handle the stick, etc at the same time. Only way to remedy this is to either get TrackIR or a VR Headset. TrackIR is worth around $150 and VR Headsets are around $500. You can see how this adds up very fast. So make sure you have some money in the bank before you think about even playing seriously. 

Now there is alot to learn in this game, this is both a good and bad thing depending who you are.
If you really into Simulator games and you love pouring your life into reading your favorite Jet's Manual then you will feel right at home with DCS. Now if you are an average gamer who play's Ace Combat then you might not enjoy the insanely massive learning curve and realism that this game comes with. Now just to be clear, All Jets and Helo's are different so you will have to learn everything from the ground up if switch from different Aircraft. Another thing to note is that there is a lot of set up involved to, because you will be busy binding controls and calibrating your TrackIR software so that it even works correctly for first few hours.

So If you have the money and time to burn and your an Avid Sim Fan then this game is for you.",1583635965,1584262269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Base game is free and comes with two flyable planes, the low-fidelity Su-25T Frogfoot and high-fidelity TF-51 Mustang. Low-fidelity doesn't have a clickable cockpit and are generally easier to fly. Full-fidelity modules are clickable and extensively simulated. The real gems are in purchasable modules; these, with the exception of Flaming Cliffs 3 (which contains F-15C, A-10A, Su-25, Su-27/33 and MiG-29A/G/S, all of which can be purchased separately), are all full-fidelity.
This game can be played with a standard mouse and keyboard, but a joystick is necessary for an optimal experience, and it's even better when you have a HOTAS joystick. TrackIR or its equivalent is also recommended, for ease of orientation and simpler controls. But beware, you may sink a lot of money into this beast of a sim.

Pros:
+ Great graphics
+ Large variety of modules
+ Large, detailed terrains (in some areas; Caucasus is the best of the bunch, since trees cover about 70% of the map)
+ Extensive simulation of every part and system of the aircraft in full-fidelity modules
+ Powerful mission editor
+ Native mod support (using the DCS World folder in Saved Games, but beware, updates often break modded meshes)

Cons:
- Poorly optimized
- Requires a very powerful PC to run without a hitch (I have a 3.9GHz processor and 21Gb of RAM and it freezes often on heavy missions, taking up 95-99% RAM and using roughly 75% CPU).
- If it's installed on a standard hard-disk, loading can be painfully slow (longest loading time I got was 15 minutes on Persian Gulf)
- Constant freezes on heavy missions if it's run on a weaker PC, which can be very frustrating
- Complicated controls setup
- Not for the impatient

Misc:
= Most of the modules have a steep learning curve
= Modules can be quite expensive, especially the newly released ones
= Out of the 350 hours I have in this sim, I have only flown for about 48. Most of the remaining time was spent on loading screens and the rest in mission editor.

I love this flight sim, despite its numerous and glaring faults. When it runs smoothly, it's an enchanting and beautiful experience. My favourite modules are F-14B, AV-8, Mi-8 and UH-1H. Best module? Probably the F-14B.
Happy flying!

I think most that complain about this game are your typical whiney I want it all now, no patience,  attitude gamers that have unfortunately infested the PC gaming community. I would never give any product a 10/10 because i believe perfection is impossible, and this game is certainly not perfect, But i think the dev's have ended up with an amazing product.

Is it worth the time and money involved? 100%- but if you are thinking that you can buy an aircraft module, hop in and start splashing bandits right away, you are mistaken. If you are wondering if DCS is for you, do yourself a favor and watch an hour or so of YouTubes on the game. I’ve found Growling Sidewinder’s YouTube channel to be the most informative without being overly technical. There are plenty of others making serviceable content as well, but on the whole I’ve found his channel to be the most helpful. Also I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out how extremely helpful the DCS World community is. If you get the game, do 2 things: 1) find and watch a YouTube channel from Growling Sidewinder or one of the other guys doing DCS videos. 2) join one of the many Discord servers and go into the chat interface and ask questions. Like I said, the DCS support community is second to none, and I wouldn’t find the game nearly as approachable nor enjoyable without the strong community backing and support.

Just buy it. Find an aircraft module that really excites you, and buy it. Put in the time to learn it, and don't expect anything near mastery right off the bat. Part of the fun is in learning, in incrementally getting better. It can take a lot of patience - especially with something like aerial refueling - but when a two hour combat mission all comes together and you bring your bird home safely, when everything clicks just right, there's almost nothing in gaming more satisfying. It's right up there with finishing a full race in a racing sim, or the heyday of Splinter Cell/Metal Gear Solid when you manage to get in and get out undetected (a lot of the fun is in the tension, like the moments leading up to weapons release or landing on a bucking carrier flight deck at night during a storm).

And right now, it's easily one of the prettiest games available - something that can't be said for most sims.

The DCS community has been nothing but helpful - the amount of resources available is absolutely staggering. Chuck's Guides on Mudspike, especially, provide a great bare bones way to dive into a new aircraft and get her flying, while the manuals, Eagle Dynamics forums, and plethora of YouTube tutorials will help you delve more deeply into any aspect of any aircraft in game.

3. The text will disappear and there's no listing of what to do if I didn't finish reading the text.

NOTE: Steam keys transfer onto the non steam version, but the non steam keys WILL NOT work on your Steam account. The reason is the store version of the game is in Beta 2.0 and the Steam version isn't..moving on.

The modules are great and the planes have a feel to them, you can play the game with keyboard and mouse (not recommended as it's a hassle). I would recommend atleast a low level joystick (Logitech Extreme 3D pro is a good choice) to be able to fly, there are planes where you can use keyboard commands to get it up and running to highly detailed very interactive cockpits where it becomes a study SIM. I like the flexibility and the patience that's required. A very good break from the run and gun flight games out there. This is the second game where I've had more fun then when I played IL-2 Sturmovik.

I would recommend shifting to the store version. You will keep any keys you bought from Steam if you shift and the store version has some pretty neat planes that are not available on the Steam version...yet. I've switched to the store version after I found out about more content being available there. But, I leave it to you, if you want to get into it slowly or play the game more often and want hands-on the new content on day one/pre-purchase. The store version has sales often with discounts upto 50% at times.

A few things first of all, based on other reviews I've read regarding DCS World and in-particular the F-15C.

1. ""The F-15C has crazy power in real life but loses it so fast when maneuvering in DCS"" 

        -  This is actually quite realistic, especially at the start of most flights when loaded with drop tanks, full fuel and 
            weapons. Pylons and munitions add quite a bit of resistance and at higher altitudes, even clean, performance 
            suffers. 

        -  If you rip the joystick hard you will bleed an excessive amount of speed, likely over-g the airframe and so on. You 
           have to be more gentle and smooth with your inputs, just like in real fighters. It's all about balance.

2. ""The F-15C can't go straight into the vertical after takeoff""

        -  Of course not. It can't do that in real life either. It needs to fly down the runway, gain speed and then pull into the 
            vertical. I challenge anyone to find a video of it going from wheels off the ground to vertical right away. Only plane 
            I've seen do that was the F-35 at the 2017 Paris airshow.

DCS is a very realistic simulator and the modules designed by Eagle Dynamics are stellar. If you're looking for a more arcade style feel I suggest a Jane's title or something like Hawx or another less realistic combat simulator. The F-15C module doesn't feature sophisticated cockpit interaction but it still has enough complexity to provide a challenge for newbies to more realistic system simulation such as manual radar array scanning and so on. 

It also performs very well, even at high graphic settings. 

So to summarize, if you're looking for more bare bones simulation this is certainly not for you. It's by no means insanely complex but it does offer a real challenge and should give you a new appreciation for the skill of the individuals who fly the real thing. 

It's very rewarding once you get a feel for it and if you like realism and a challenge on par with Falcon BMS, this is definitely worth a peek.",1514537338,1514928901,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The DCS 'world' is a small portion of Georgia (russian) caost. There are two other areas available for purchase, Nevada Test Range and WWII era area between England and France. There has been talk for a long time now of a new area in the Persian Gulf region. So don't for a second think 'World' coverage. If you want to get into an aircraft and fly somewhere this is not for you. The senery is also not real to life and extremely basic. This is not a look out the window for eye candy sim. This is a heads down in the cockpit sim using your electronic sensors to look for stuff to shoot. 

There are two very basic aircraft that come with this 'free' sim. Don't let the lack of detail on these aircraft sway you away from this sim. They are available to give you a taste of the area and what to expect in this sim. 'Some' of the aircraft 'add ons' for this sim are fantastic for a 'combat' simulator. All must be purchased seperately. 'Some' of the aircraft available for purchase go into a great amount of detail with the electronics and weapons systems. To date, I believe the  DCS A-10 is the best 'combat' aircraft symulator as far as attention to the detail of the aircraft combat systems. There are other simulators out there that have combat aircraft like the F-15 and F-18 that look stunning and are very fun to fly, however they do not have the same level of working systems that give that extra feel of reality for a combat aircraft.

I do give this a high recomend as a freebee. And also recomend buying at least the A-10 if you want to get a feel of what a real military combat pilot has to do.

This game is insanely heavy on controls/key bindings and the dlc is insanely expensive too.
I don't doubt it's a realistic flight simulator to the point of being virtually identical to the real thing, but you need to basically stop the rest of your life to learn everything. Even binding controls to your joystick still leaves semingly zillions of key strokes to somehow swat and learn. I would imagine it's probably less of a mental strain to fly the real thing!
If you like dedicating countless hours of your life just trying to remember what's next, then feel like you've achieved a miracle just by landing again, then this is for you. But aside from boasting about it on a forum you're not going to get much regonition compared to a real pilot!
For me when a game stops becoming fun and becomes a tedious chore to manage, then it's time to go elsewhere. I want to enjoy my down time, not be pressured like I'm in some exam! As an air cadet many years ago I flew DH Chipmunks - and that was really fun as it meant something.

Between the details and the amazing physics of the aircraft and flight. I will say if you want the full experience be sure to spend the money and get the Thrustmaster Warthog and MFG Crosswind pedals. I have paid for almost every aircraft available and I can say I do not regret a single one of them. The developers are always making it better and we will soon have the maps all in one version as well as the F18 and some much looked forward to WW2 aircraft, not that there isnt already enough of these amazing pieces of art but lets be honest there is no such thing as too many. Eagle Dynamics and all the aircraft developer companies have sucked me in and this is one of those games that you just wont regret. Everything was and is done right with this simulator. I keep calling it a game when in all honesty this is a pretty hardcore sim. Dont be scared when you hear hardcore though, you can make it whatever you want from relaxed to full on PVP combat. Many of these aircraft have all working buttons and knobs and require you to learn them inside and out which for many people is what we wanted in a sim this great. I have logged approx 45 hours in the A10C and have learned fully how to start it properly and taxi, how to trouble shoot problems and mitigate them in the air, How to drop bombs and use the weapons systems. Still much much more for me to learn and it will more than likely get hundreds of hours in the coming years alone. As for the mission editing it is fairly simple and with a few hours of learning you can make a very nice mission to your wants and needs.

Its an amazing simulation even without VR and after about 200 hours (on this and DCS 2) I still pretty much suck! Its just an amazing experience. Not only are you flying but using modern day computer systems to seek, lock onto, and destroy your enemy fromyway up above. Its terrifying to imagine being up against these beasts! At the moment they knew you were a dead man You wouldnt even know they were there, watching from above, as the missile they had just launched cut through the sky towards you.

Dont pay attention to the 'mixed' reviews this game gets trolled alot because its free. This means casual gamers load it up without knowing what it is, and end up getting butt hurt. But you probably already know that! This game may be free but as I already mentioned to really do it justice its probably the most expensive game you will ever buy! You dont have to buy everything I bought for it all at once but to get the most out of it at the very least you need a HOTAS and track IR.  

Its not a game you could possibly enjoy without actually learning how to fly (take off, and land) and understand the computer systems at your fingertips. With a good HOTAS combined with peddals the feeling of flight is incredible. Add in VR and its a damned near perfect experience! 

I feel immensely pleased that I decided to to take the plunge and teach myself some of this simulators modules. The one I enjoy the most has to be the black shark helicopter.  

The reward is that once you have mastered the sim itself you can start enjoying the game, and attempt some of the military missions the 'game' sets for you. In short you can start blowing stuff up! 

I think almost everyone would love this simulator, but not everybody is willing to sit down and learn. Things are easier these days though and there are loads of videos you can watch on you-tube. When you get into it you will also find, that learning to fly a plane, or helicopter is (of course) alot of fun and the more skilled you become the less like work it will seem.

I'm looking forward to more modules in the near future!

If I had to pick one issue I have with this game, I wish that ALL vehicles, (land or air), were clickable, not just a select few.

I LOVE THIS GAME!

The mission editor is more powerful than it once was, there's less glaring bugs, and now there's even a much wider variety of aircraft and countries that can be included in missions (not that you can play as literally every plane obviously, but still).

The only real bugs I have noticed are asthetic at best, and only noticeable when flying REALLY low altitude. We're talking skimming treetops.

The game otherwise handles very smoothly, even with large missions. Maybe that's because of my hardware, but it's never felt this stable with past editions. My only gripes are that there's only one map (currently), and it does not include Crimea, which was featured in the original Lock On game.

All in all the game is as fucking excellent as it has always been and I strongly advise everyone with a flight stick to get it. It's a must have for flight sim games. The best part is you can get your feet wet for free by downloading the game and flying the Su-25T.
