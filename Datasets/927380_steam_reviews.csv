Locations and characters are mostly the same, you explore Kamurocho and Sotenbori. If we talk about main supportive characters then I should mention Kaoru, I enjoyed her interacting with Kiryu, this is something that I didn't get in Kiwami 1, you can say that their interaction shows a little bit more of Kiryu gentle side. The engine shows better picture overall, not much to say. There is also a ""Majima Saga"" addon which gives you an 1-1.5 hour gameplay for Majima and tells what happened to him between Kiwami 1 and Kiwami 2, it also concludes one of the storylines that was started in Yakuza Zero, I really liked that.

Some things gave me mixed feelings though. Throughout the story there are moments that feel like being taken from Kiwami 1, sometimes they even occur in the same places they occured in Kiwami, it gives the feeling like the story repeats itself a little and I can't say this is good.

Now, the story in general, with the main and side missions, I believe this is the funniest yakuza game I've played, it's just that I'm not sure if all of it was on porpuse, wins the award for dumbest ending in the series hands down though. 

On the completionist side you have the two big side games that are the cabaret club which is always awesome, and Majima constructions side story which I love absolutely everything about it... with the exception of the actual minigame you have to play to complete it, the minigame is so tedious and boring, though I love it's story and the recruitment aspect of the minigame.

The completion list is the usual, I'm sincerely starting to believe that the batting cages and mahjong are the actual final bosses of these games but to that they added the whole Bouncer missions a whole more than 70 of them to complete, you get great rewards from them but I was just so DONE with them by the half way point.

Also I would feel bad because I brought it up on my yakuza 7 review... is the dragon engine what's messing up the UFO catcher? The games with that engine that I've played the UFO catcher feels AWFUL and of course there is a submission tied to it, heck, the camera doesn't change angle when you start moving the crane backwards in ONE location, which means that it's also probably glitched (and yes, the submission takes place on the venue where the camera doesn't move), I sincerely hope that the camera problem I had was something on my end and not on the game. 

Other than that, yeah, it's a good yakuza game and since almost nobody goes the 100% route in these games I can't judge it too harshly for something I brought on myself but yeah, it felt way more tedios than any other game on this series. 

A big shout out to Ryuji though, while I think the community overhyped him a tad for me, he IS the most efective antagonist on the series that I've seen so far, just for the fact that he was usually in the fray and he was a creadible threat in every sense of the word.",1708906268,1708906268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3] General Thoughts [/h3]
Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a great game overall. It has good combat, great story, and amazing visuals. Personally, it took me a while to get invested in the game, and at first it seemed quite bland compared to the immense content in Yakuza 0. However, once I got into the gist of things I started to really enjoy the dragon engine style gameplay a lot more.

[h3] The Story [/h3]
The story is essentially the same as the original Yakuza 2 with a few minor tweaks and adjustments. Kiryu Kazuma returns to the Tojo once more to aid in an upcoming war between the Tojo Clan and Omi Alliance and attempts to stop it before too much blood is shed, whilst also dealing with the Korean Jingweon Mafia. Although enjoyable to play through, the story is a lot less complex and dynamic than later games due to being one of the first entries into the franchise. However, this doesn't deduct from the quality of the story especially towards the end-game.

[h3] The Gameplay [/h3]
Yakuza Kiwami 2 was the first game where I experienced the dragon engine fighting style for Kiryu. Although not as dynamic or interactive as Yakuza 0's style system, each movement and attack felt very smooth and satisfying making combat almost addicting to play through, especially once you unlock abilities that allow you to slam through enemies easily. The upgrade system is also improved from Yakuza 6's and is probably one of the best in the series, appearing in later games such as Judgment. The usual mini-games are present, as well as the return of the cabaret club mini-game which I somehow found a lot more enjoyable than in Yakuza 0, though that's just personal preference.

[h3] The Graphics [/h3]
The graphics in Yakuza Kiwami 2 are phenomenal. In some cases, it looks very life-like. Seeing the neon lights in Kamurocho with the dragon engine is truly a sight to behold. However, for some reason RGG studios decided to add a greenish filter for the entirety of the game which is questionable and in some cases ruins the stunning graphics, but can easily be ignored or removed with modding if it bothers you too much.

[h3] Final Thoughts [/h3]
Overall, a very good retelling of the original Yakuza 2. Would definitely recommend if you're into the Yakuza series or beat em up games in general.",1606481071,1708812903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The [i]Yakuza / Like a Dragon[/i] franchise follows a very lock-tight formula with heavily reused assets and environments, and so in some sense reviewing any of the middle entries in the franchise is equivocal to reviewing any other middle entry in the franchise. However, there are some ups and downs when transitioning from [i]Kiwami[/i] to [i]Kiwami 2[/i], which merit discussion.

[h2]At a Glance[/h2]
[i]Yakuza Kiwami 2[/i] is, like its predecessors, a gradual iteration on the same action-adventure beat-em-up that [i]Yakuza 1[/i] was. This means that broad reviews of gameplay systems and tone are applicable to each game. Here was my own description of [i]Yakuza Kiwami[/i], which applies to [i]Kiwami 2[/i] as well:

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Two_Dimensional/recommended/834530/

[quote=TwoDee][i][Yakuza is] a battle of violently-clashing tones that makes absolutely no concession to the concept of thematic consistency. [...] A gripping crime drama of skull-crushing violence and heart-wrenching betrayal [...] is punctuated, constantly, by slapstick comedy routines and colorful, childish minigames. [...] It is not unlike if Goodfellas and Caddyshack were the same movie, or if the climax of The Usual Suspects featured Keyser Soze tearing off his shirt in one smooth motion and suplexing Detective Kujan through the interrogation-room table so hard that the building collapses. [...]

It feels strange to frame it this way, but Yakuza is one of the most ""video games"" video games in all of video games; it embodies all of the medium's most absurd and clashing excesses, but also its potential as a vehicle for entertainment all in one package.[/i][/quote]

However, on top of my general impressions of the entire franchise, I have two additional observations unique to this game, regarding the upgraded engine and the story compared to other [i]Yakuza[/i] titles.

[h2]The Dragon Engine[/h2]
[i]Kiwami 2[/i] uses the Dragon Engine, an improved version of the engine that has powered the franchise since the original [i]Yakuza 1[/i] and [i]Yakuza 2[/i], and which is in particular a noticeable jump up in graphics and performance from [i]Yakuza Zero[/i] and [i]Kiwami[/i], this title's immediate predecessors.  The neighborhoods of Kamurocho and Sotenbori have never looked nearly as good as they have in this game, and it's ironically a noticeable graphical step down going from this remake of the second game of the franchise to the ""later"" games chronologically. More than a remaster, [i]Kiwami 2[/i] is a total upgrade of the original [i]Yakuza 2[/i] to the standards of a modern AAA beat-em-up title, and it doesn't feel dated in the way that remasters of old titles normally do. Alongside the engine change come a lot of quality-of-life features like seamless interiors and very short load times, which are welcome improvements.

However, I felt that the combat of [i]Kiwami 2[/i], while extremely smooth and 'flowy,' was a noticeable step down from [i]Zero[/i] and [i]Kiwami [/i]. Where those games had extremely intentional, pixel-perfect, ""arcade game"" style hitboxes, as well as multiple combat styles and stances, [i]Kiwami 2[/i] is considerably more forgiving and loosy-goosey with interpreting the player's inputs, giving it a gamefeel that's halfway between [i]Yakuza[/i] and something like [i]Batman: Arkham Asylum[/i]. Kiryu likewise only has one moveset, so although combat is flashier and nicer to look at overall, there also isn't as much gameplay variety.

I'm not a huge fan of the trade-off. [i]Kiwami 2[/i] is still an excellent game in the way that all [i]Yakuza[/i] titles are, but given the choice between having the very precise and depthy combat of [i]Kiwami[/i] versus the gorgeous and spectacular combat of [i]Kiwami 2[/i], I'd prefer the former.

[h2]The Story[/h2]
I'd described the state-of-the-art Dragon Engine as making [i]Kiwami 2[/i]'s gameplay feel fresh and not dated, but the same cannot be said of the game's story, which is definitely feeling the nearly 20 years of age since the release of [i]Yakuza 2[/i]. [i]Yakuza 2[/i]'s story is uniquely tone-deaf and messy in a way that the story of [i]Yakuza 1[/i] and its remake [i]Kiwami[/i] isn't, because it represents the awkward growing step where a clean, self-contained game with a satisfying beginning, middle and end got greenlit for a sequel and became a franchise, requiring a massive and frequently slipshod increase in narrative scope and complexity. [i]Yakuza 2[/i]'s ""serious"" story is ridiculous and meandering in a way that the very slick standalone first game isn't, and it particularly suffers in comparison to [i]Zero[/i], a title with one of the most sprawling and epic crime stories in contemporary video games and which represents nearly 10 years of the writers maturing and growing since [i]Yakuza 2[/i].  However, because [i]Zero[/i] was a prequel and the Kiwami titles are remakes of the very earliest games, it feels extremely jarring to go from a brilliant narrative masterpiece in [i]Zero[/i], to a good-for-a-video-game story in [i]Kiwami[/i], to the comparative train wreck that is [i]Kiwami 2[/i].

Loosely, the plot centers around two connecting stories: one is the protagonist-adjacent Tojo Clan, still smarting from the plot of the first game, desperately attempting to sign a ceasefire with the more-antagonistic Omi Alliance, when this agreement is suddenly interrupted by a coup d'etat of the Omi Alliance by an up-and-coming new underboss. The other is about the rebirth of the Korean ""Jingweon"" Mafia, a foreign mafia who were so cruel and so debased that the Tojo Clan and the police once cooperated to slaughter them all like rabid animals, long before the events of even [i]Yakuza Zero[/i]. As the plot thickens, these two stories are revealed to be connected, with the coup d'etat intimately connected to the reappearance of these bloodthirsty, subhuman Korean savages.

You may be noticing that I'm using some very loaded terms to describe the Koreans, and that's because [i]Yakuza 2[/i], and thus [i]Kiwami 2[/i], is appallingly and often hilariously racist in ways that you frankly just don't see in video games anymore. The Jingweon's tendrils of evil corrupt every secondary and tertiary character with even a drop of Korean blood in them, and previously-established sympathetic characters from the first [i]Yakuza[/i] veer wildly into villainy because their innate Korean evil has been activated. At one point two plot points arise, one about how Koreans insidiously blend into Japanese society and could be anyone, and another about how two Korean characters are impossible to tell apart because Koreans look alike, and these are both presented entirely at face value as equally true. A corrupt cop discloses that he extra-judicially shoots Koreans to death on principle, and this is presented as a grim necessity rather than a war crime.

At the story's denouement, it falls apart into a contrived conga line of the Omi betraying the Koreans, who planned for this and betrayed the Omi, who planned for this and betrayed the Koreans, to such a convoluted extent that it feels more like an episode of [i]Death Note[/i] than a crime drama.

[h2]In Conclusion[/h2]
[i]Kiwami 2[/i] is a flawed [i]Yakuza[/i] title, although it's mostly flawed in ways that a remaster of the imperfect second game was always going to be.  It's still a very fun game, but it sometimes smarts as an ultramodern, bells-and-whistles remake of a not-particularly-great story that didn't necessarily deserve to be remade the way that the first game did.  As a stepping stone to engage with the rest of the [i]Yakuza[/i] franchise, it still excels, and at the end of the day it's still Fun, which should be the barometer on which all Yakuza games are judged.

Just keep an eye over your shoulder. You never know where a [i]Korean[/i] could be hiding...",1708300565,1708381420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kiwami 2 does little to change the formula previously establish in the series. Playing as former Yakuza and former Chairman of the Tojo Clan Kazuma Kiryu, you will take part in high stakes crime thriller drama, while also fighting vicious thugs in the streets, eating at various restaurants for health and exp, collecting toys from the claw machine, sinking money into rounds of Virtua Fighter 2, gambling games, batting cages, or the golf center, and managing a cabaret club with near identical mechanics to Yakuza 0's own Cabaret Club Czar minigame. You will also oversee large scale battles as the foreman of Goro Majima's new construction company as they develop a new high-rise setup while avoiding the project being taken over by rival companies.

The biggest two changes relate to clearing the seams of the open world. Kamurocho and Sotenbori look and feel the same as ever but no longer will you have to wait for a loading screen when entering buildings. Most shops, restaurants, and buildings are seemlessly integrated into the street level. Kiryu will open doors walking through them, some will slide open for him, and now he can use elevators and stairs to explore upper floors, office spaces, and even the rooftops of some buildings. The other aspect thats been made more seamless is combat, with bouts on the street beginning and ending with no loads or cuts, and physics have been upgraded to allow for objects to get hit and fly around and enemies have been given ragdolls.

Combat feels very different despite being built off the same ideas. most combos and the base idea of light attacks followed by a heavy finisher is preserved, but moves that were once Head Actions are now simple combo actions, collision and such feels less ""gamey"" (fewer invincible frames and more animation based hits), and charged attacks have been added. New frustrations include not dodging an attack you were supposed to because hit detection is much different, throw moves getting interrupted by walls and objects in the way, and less overall variety, as the combat is built off the Brawler style, with some mechanics from other styles mixed in.

A few missing features stand out however. the Pocket Circuit is nowhere to be found, as well as the various variations of pool/billiards. MeSuKing/Japan Catfight Club is also gone. 

Story is as solid as ever in terms of the players and logistics: Terada, the Omi Alliance Captain Kiryu installed as the Tojo Clan's Fifth Chairman is assassinated right as the Omi Alliance is seemingly on the precipice of taking over Kamurocho and Kiryo must travel to Sotenbori in Kansai to meet with the Omi alongside Daigo Dojima, the son of Sohei Dojima and last seen in a Yakuza 0 substory. Also involved is Ryuji Goda, Patriarch of the Go-Ryu clan and also was last seen in a hilarious Yakuza 0 substory where he steals people's bontan pants. Meanwhile, Detective Makoto Date, Kiryu's ally in the police force and main character in the last game has discovered something involving Kazuki, the owner of Club Stardust, a key figure and location from the previous game. Osakan Detective Kaoru Saeyama, the ""Yakuza Huntress"" attaches herself to Kiryu to dig deeper into what's happening in the underworld and what follows is dense and thrilling as each piece slowly fits into the larger picture. Towards the end, it fails to keep up the mystique of its early chapters and the chaotic but emotional energy of 0 and 1's later chapters. You do, however, get to punch a tiger.

Graphically, the upgrade from Kiwami 1 is subtle but substantial. For starters, your new default move speed is walking, meaning you will inherently just be looking closer at things, and when looking at these things, textures are all clearly upgraded, the streets are more crowded, more particle effects are in use, and lighting is starkly better, however, by default, an ugly depth of field effect is applied to the game that makes it look very smeared and blurry. Also, they must have JJ Abrams involved somehow because the amount of unnecessary lens flare is off the charts.

performance is mostly great but rather frequently, i have to alt-f4 out of it to restart it while just starting a session, as it handles lower than monitor resolutions less than flawlessly. if it boots to the SEGA logos as normal, its totally fine, but often it hangs on a black screen, with a qlitched steam overlay.",1705864026,1707776635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first, it's kind of like a breath of fresh air. It's simplified, no more combat styles, one smooth fluid combat system that just works. As you progress in the game, you find that fights are both too easy and are super annoying. It seems as you rapidly approach the last quarter of the game, a lot of fights are there simply to serve as a way to lose health. Nothing more, nothing less. Looking at you ""Man in Black"" and random three dudes with an RPG and sliver of health in the final chapter :/

The boss fights are another thing that stood out to me as horrendous. In 0, they felt far more grand and elaborate. In 2 it just lost it's charm. Heat moves take out gigantic portions of the bosses health, to the point where some fights took me under a minute to complete, feeling like Kiryu's  really is the strongest Yakuza to walk the earth (aside from the Man in Black who seemingly has no issue wiping out your health).

By far, this is the most beautiful and scenic game that I've played. Devs did some major overhauling on the physics engine, which is certainly debatable if that's a good thing or not (ragdoll physics are insane now). Regardless, it's lighting is beautiful with not much more leaving to be desired in terms of graphics. When I first loaded into Kamurocho, I was speechless. I'm still amazed at how this game looks.

With all that said, the story is fantastic with unexpected twists and turns, and even some bonus content featuring Majima. The Majima ep really yanked at the heart strings quite a bit, much more than I expected it to. I'm glad Ryu Ga Gotoku added this. One of the games really needed this and I'm glad this one had it. This game didn't cause me to spontaneously combust in tears like previous games, but it's still a great game in the franchise despite it's janky combat system.

You cannot play this game if you have not played 0 or at least Kiwami, so dont go into this game as your first one. The game does have a recap of the story from the first game. However, you will still be missing out on a lot of context clues if you haven't played the previous 2 mentioned titles because there are a lot of returning characters and plot points that are not discussed in the recap.

I enjoyed this game much more than I did the first game. As a sequel, it excels and outperforms the first game in every way. The Dragon Engine aids in that because it makes this game feel much more different gameplay-wise than its predecessor in a very good way. The engine changes certain aspects of the core gameplay. For example, they took out the different fighting styles but now you can learn different moves that basically include what you could say were the strongest aspects of the old 4 fighting styles, so think of it as if they combined all the different styles and just put them all in 1 move set instead of it being split into 4. You're not locked in arenas when fighting enemies either, now you can just run around anywhere and pick up almost anything you see that you think you can use as a weapon and my favorite part of it all is how you can now fight inside shops and destroy them while you fight off the groups of baddies which makes for some fun situations. 

The Story of this game is also incredibly well written and dramatic with a great ending to it all. I cant really say if its better than the first game because I feel like both stories are very well made, intertwine with each other, and are emotionally driven with similar yet different plot points and themes. The Sub stories are also very fun with so many different situations and variety to them. I also really enjoy how this game concludes stories from 0 and Kiwami in a very nice fashion with returning characters just so we can see what happened 20 years after 0.

If you played 0, then you will be familiar with the Cabaret Club but this game does add a new miniature game that is like a base defense style unit management gameplay. I enjoyed this activity but I do think it went on for too long and as enjoyable as it was I didn't like it as much as I thought I would and only really finished it to see how the sub story concluded [spoiler] I also found it extremely annoying when you think you're done and the game throws a plot twist (which seems to be the theme of this whole game) and goes ACTUALLY THIS IS THE REAL FINAL BATTLE, after already making you believe you had your final battle. [/spoiler] 

My issues with this game are the same as all the other games. After a specific amount of time, it starts to feel repetitive (I think I was able to pinpoint when it happens and it was around the 30-40 hour mark). I avoided Combat in the later part of the game just because fighting groups of enemies was getting annoying when I was just trying to do Sub Stories or activities for fun and it felt like the game was spawning them more often than usual with enemies that had more health as well. There is also I believe 2 instances where the game essentially forces you to do a side mission as a main mission for no purpose other than to just give you a little backstory on some not-so-important characters. Harukos request are also back but I just found it aggravating that to complete some of them you have to do extremely well at certain gambling activities which requires you to put a lot of time into them especially if you decide to do it without items that help you cheat to get the results you want. You don't get these items for every activity either and they are not common, which in turn just makes the whole thing into a luck base grind that you are not always guaranteed to win. Me personally I don't enjoy it because I never engaged with the activities that are about gambling since I don't find it fun to play those games in a video game where I can do more interesting things. I also had a few problems with the new combat system, it is much faster-paced but oftentimes I felt like I did not have many options even after unlocking almost all of the upgrades. Especially when certain characters make you fight with no heat actions, it was very bare bone and did not have a lot of depth or variety to warrant you being able to pull some crazy combos. The combat was never complex but in this game it felt a little more simple than usual [spoiler] (The Majima sub story suffered the most from this since you only have like 5 moves). [/spoiler] Maybe it was a skill issue on my end but I did try to see how I can do more with less and in those situations I was never able to figure out how. The last thing that bothered me was NO POCKET CIRCUIT RACE, -1 for that.

In the end, I enjoyed this game much more, I liked the updated Dragon engine and I feel like it spoiled me because having to go back to the previous engine for the next few games is going to be something that I will have to get used to since the dragon engine seems like such a great upgrade gameplay-wise. Out of the first 3 modern remakes/games (0, Kiwami, Kiwami 2) this was my favorite to play combat-wise and felt the best all around. 0 is still my favorite though because it has Pocket Circuit Race and I like the atmosphere of the city as well. Although, this game does have an official release of Virtual-On which is one of my favorite arcade games so I guess it gets +1 for that.",1707026569,1707044460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Majima construction is worth checking out for more Majima content, but it's not worth suffering through its frustrating micromanagement gameplay.",1706966131,1706966131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons:
- the fighting changed, due to the nature of the engine, every npc goes flying after a damn jump charged punch - hilarious though
- grabbing is OP and in a lot of situations; you can kill certain bosses with punch while grabbed; - easy to abuse 
- weapons are useful now, like too useful; they deal quite a lot of DMG and at the same time you find them everywhere. - shindo fell by spamming heavy attack with a katana for 20 times
- overall the engine upgrade makes the fighting more fluid to a point you can't just get used to it; feels like you bought a new car yet still crave your old daily driver;
- the plot is intricate yet forgettable; too many quickly introduced only to get discarded characters; this makes you not get attached to any; to add salt to injury you get thrown into plenty plot changes or updates over time in a quick succession;
- weird and poorly done facial expressions and at times lipsync - best example is the cabaret club intro mission;
- forgettable karaoke songs, kiwami 1 had the same issue;
- boss battles are too forgiving, so far only ryujin proved a challenge; 
- did i mention how exploitable are certain aspects to severely decrease the difficulty (playin on hard btw) ? looking at you, weapons with  over 20 charges scattered everywhere;
 - so far, no goromi :(
 - no intro theme song - wasted opportunity to get a guitar riff stuck in my head for a few days/weeks
 - for playing just the first cabaret club mission, feels like a downgrade from y0, but im not that harsh on it since y2 did not have cabaret club; 
 - they removed the fighting styles and now you have just brawler - wtf... no wonder im spamming triangle with weapons
 - you get a quick time event when the boss is at half of the last bar of HP, and instantly kill him - at this point i worked my ass off to scrape 5 bars, why bother at the end? - i didnt like the KIWAMI quick time event due to it appearing 3-7 times during a fight but the timing made sense;

pros:
- kiryu's sidekick is a nicely written character;
- the visuals are stunning; kamurocho never looked this good;
- you can enter stores without a loading screen :O
- the leveling up and spending the points in abilities system always gets changed and i appreciate that, the devs get to experiment; - fuck y0's system of having to be a trillionaire to have all the moves unlocked;
 - majima is still present
 - you get new minigames
 - more taxi locations
 - they kept certain sfx and songs from y0 in the cabaret club - i wanna be you giiirl
 - date-san is back
 - no more kiwami quick time event
- environment weapons, such as bicycles are less durable, forcing you to rely less on them;
 - fighting off npcs on the street is slightly more entertaining now, due to the goofiness of the engine with its ragdoll physics;


as of chapter 10, i do recommend the game but is WAY worse that the other two i've played - feels like a waste of time but compared to the state of gaming nowadays, it gets a pass;",1706932579,1706932928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Amazing story-line as always
+ The new combat (although takes times to get used to) is really fun to mess around with and feels very reactive/responsive to your in-game movements
+ The weapons are SO fun to use (you're seriously missing out if you're not trying out various weapons throughout the game)
+ Top notch graphic fidelity
+ Most side-content is worth engaging with (Yes, even mahjong)
+ The vending machine mechanics are AMAZING and genuinely very useful (Citrus Cyder can boost your attack by a LOT)

Cons:
- I didn't find the Majima Construction side-game very fun (although it's really fun to occasionally do a level or two sometimes)
- The new inventory system can enable the game to be really ""easy"" unless you set a rule for yourself to not use too many healing items

Dragon Engine is hilariously janky, causing people to ragdoll the fuck out and objects to randomly explode upon contact, but it's worth it in exchange for more seamless movement and less loading times. Combat isn't as fun as 0 in particular. Majima's story is pointless.

On the plus side, the main story is mostly quite good, Definite step up from K1 and doesn't pull it's punches as much as 0. Goda is a fun antagonist, the successive ending twists are stupid as hell but in a good way etc. Definitely feels like it was written by Japanese TV writers. Saying that, in hindsight, there are elements of the plot you could define as quite offensive towards Koreans. The idea of a massacre happening to the Jingweon that they absolutely must have revenge for at any costs is a bit... suspect, especially the implication that they deserved it. 

Minigames being VF2 and VO are great. First Yakuza game I ever played on hard, which actually made it more tedious than challenging until I beefed my stats up, at which point it was still a cakewalk. Still fun. Probably helps that it's been years since I played one. Wouldn't rate it on the whole as highly as Kiwami and certainly nowhere near 0s league, but not a bad game per se - a flawed one, sure, but worth it if you enjoyed those.",1706817225,1706817225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So cool to finally see the dragon engine in action after finishing two 40+ hour games in the series. Kamurocho and Sotenbori are a dazzling sight to behold in the new engine. So far on my Yakuza journey, I liked the combat and gameplay in this one the most, it also brings back the Cabaret minigame which I absolutely love (no pocket circuit racing though). 

My one criticism on Kiwami 2 is that of the games I've played in the series, this one had the weakest writing. While this game series has pulled off super complicated plots before, I felt like this one was overly complicated for the sake of complication. It had enough twists to make M Night Shyamalan embarrassed, to where it started reminding me of the SNL ""Dear Sister"" sketch. Don't even get me started on the heroification of a racist cop character. It still had epic moments and great masculine one liners, but overall it was meh.

You are here most likely because you finished the first game, which is incredibly bad. Yakuza 2 improved a lot of good things from 1 - the combat is better, Kiryu starts the game powerful, the skill system is pretty good, there's another ton of stuff to do

So why am I giving a negative review? At this point, I believe most people will only visit the older games for the story, cause they can access better versions of the extra content in later games. And the story is bad
The writer managed to put a plot twist in every single cutscene of the game, and I'm not even joking. If you've played Yakuza 0, you've seen how a well-done plot twist can make the story 100x times more interesting
But if you overdo it, you end up with a joke story

To finish this review, I just want to say that if you are here for the story, save your money and time, read a summary and move on

To start, Kiwami 2 has a way better story than Kiwami and that's all because it's nowhere near as messy. K2 is a good game but it it's not in one of the best because aside from Ryuji there isn't anything in this game that stands out enough. To me, this is because the story is almost exclusively there to make Ryuji's character more tragic, which works wonders for him, but is detrimental to the story. The story is fine but it doesn't have the emotion or action that makes other games stand out. Going back to Ryuji, he's one of if not THE best characters in the series. Even though everything great about his character comes to light in the finale, it still manages to make his character so much more tragic. And the final fight is the absolute best in the franchise. Truly the most memorable character in the franchise. 

While not being a fan favorite, I believe the combat in this game is really fun. The combos you can pull off are really satisfying. The only big problem with the combat is that it can get a bit stale repeating the same combos over and over again, though I haven't no damaged the game yet so I can't speak to whether this is true or not.

The game ultimately ended up as a disappointment, not living up to expectations.
Yakuza Kiwami 2 is the Sonic Forces of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. It uses a brand new engine, it had very talented developers working on it, yet the end result is nothing but a product that begs the question: ""what happened here?""

[h2]Horrible first impressions[/h2]
Kiwami 2 has the most horrible opening hours among the first three Yakuza games (0, K1, K2). If you are coming from Yakuza 0 or Kiwami, which is a safe assumption for many, you will find the game very disappointing, and for a variety of reasons.
Kiwami 2 does away with the style switching system, mashes all of the previous battle styles into one, and starts you with basics. That means, for the first 7-8 hours of the game, you have no access to anything equivalent to rush and beast styles. You have a bunch of simple combos and heat actions that are nowhere as flashy and exciting to use as their counterparts in 0 and Kiwami, and many of the actually cool stuff are locked. For example, remember those furniture wielding enemies at the beginning of Yakuza 0 that you could counter with a heat action? They are in the beginning of this game as well, but you cannot use heat actions against them.
And the combat itself feels incredibly off too. Enemies and bosses feel like tanks that hit hard and take a lot of hits before going down. The most reliable way of dealing with enemies and especially the bosses, is to grab something and swing it around, or constantly refill the heat meter with consumables and spam heat actions; something the new battle system encourages as now you can carry way more items with the removal of your limited inventory, and also you can equip up to 3 weapons to switch between them in combat.
The situation gets worse after you get to the upgrade system, because instead of a exp meter or money, Kiwami 2 awards you with 6 different tokens after each successful mission, random battle encounter or eating in restaurants. And the last one is actively encouraged as eating food rewards you with a lot of tokens, and even more if you manage to eat a food combo. Then, you can use these tokens to upgrade your abilities. This makes the game incredibly tedious as you find yourself constantly entering the restaurants, just to eat everything and get upgrade points.
Last but not least, the substories of the first 8 hours of the game are downright awful. Aside from a few, they are mostly fetch quests, or follow the ""short dialogue -> combat -> short dialogue"" formula. Even those that can be something special, like the Overwhelming Affluence substory, get absolutely destroyed by bad pacing and putting its finale in the same chapter. Almost none of them feel dramatic humorous like that was available in 0 and Kiwami.

[h2]And the pain continues...[/h2]
Unfortunately, the situation doesn't get better. In fact, the only saving grace of the game which is the story, also starts getting tedious after some time as well. The antagonists never feel as intimidating or unlikable-for-good-reason as their counterparts from 0 and Kiwami. The game even goes way too overboard while explaining stuff with a cutscene. Don't believe me? The cutscene that introduces Majima Construction Company's bad guys, goes on for about 10 WHOLE MINUTES!
The story pacing is so poor, that by the time I got to the fifth act of the game, it really didn't feel like the progression was enough to get there. And don't you dare hit me with ""but the original was like this too!"". Kiwami added new main story cutscenes f that helped players understand what Nishikiyama went through. So, what's Kiwami 2's excuse?
The combat just doesn't get better either. People say it gets good after buying some upgrades and moves, but it really doesn't change much and the road you have to take to get there is so not worth it. You still have to constantly go and eat at the restaurants to get tokens and upgrade your abilities, so you can have a chance against the damage sponge enemies and bosses. And all of this grind is not fun.
And speaking of not fun, the minigames are botched too! Kiwami 2 has the lowest number of minigames when compared to 0 or even Kiwami, and what the game actually offers, is not fun. Instead of having normal, yet entertaining minigames such as pool or bowling, Kiwami 2 introduces a minigame called Toylets that makes you partake in competitive pissing which sounds hilarious, but is not fun. There's also a very big downgrade of fanservice-y activities, as stuff like MesuKing, Gandhara and collectible cards have given their place to Photoshoots, where you try to make sentences on a time limit to unlock videos. Now you might try and argue that some of these are because the original Yakuza 2 did not have them either. But the problem is, even Kiwami had a lot more in it compared to the original Yakuza 1. Which makes me wonder...

[h2]Did… did they make this on a very limited time and budget?[/h2]
There's a bunch of stuff in the game that makes me question whether this game was made under tight deadlines and budget or not. The combat and upgrade systems both come from Yakuza 6. Club Four Shine's interior is almost identical to Club Sunshine from Yakuza 0. Even the cabaret minigame looks the same, despite getting small changes. There are a severe lack of minigames compared to 0 and Kiwami.
All of this, in addition to the tight release date of Kiwami 2 after Yakuza 6 (1 year), makes me believe this game was not a priority. There's no way in hell they got the same treatment, as one is the highly anticipated sequel to the series that acts as an epilogue to Kiryu's story as the main character, and the other is the remake of a PlayStation 2 game. Hell, even Judgment was also getting worked on to some extent in this time period. My guess is that they make Yakuza 6 first and then started using whatever asset they had to make Kiwami 2 in a short time period and with limited resources. And this can explain a lot of stuff with this game. Even the port quality.

[h2]Pretty on the surface, a mess on the inside[/h2]
Kiwami 2 is ported by QLOC, known for their great track record of porting a console game to PC. So clearly something has gone wrong if the port is such a hot mess, further suggesting the idea of time and money constraints.
For starters, the PC version's uncapped framerate actually breaks the game. If you set the game to run at anything other than 30 fps, the enemies start breaking out of combos that they are not supposed to, adding heaps of salt to the wound that is the combat system. Not only that, the ragdolls also get extreme and bodies and items get thrown around further and faster. The game may even refuse to run at a stable framerate and minigames might break or cause the game to crash due to frame pacing issues, requiring you to apply a community patch (SilentPatch) to fix them because SEGA sure didn't care.

[h2]A pretty good example of how to shoot yourself in the foot[/h2]
SEGA should have been more careful with Yakuza Kiwami 2. They should have either remastered the original or have done better work on this remake. People are going to play Kiwami 2 right after 0 and Kiwami. They know this is a new game with a new engine and not a remaster like Yakuza 3-4-5. They will have high expectations when they get to this game and will not forgive whatever flaws they see.
Alas, they didn't care. They just kept reusing stuff and didn't spend the needed amount of time and resources on it. The game is not fun, and I don't see why I have to keep playing what is not fun.


[h2]TL;DR[/h2]
An inferior product compared to Yakuza 0 or even Kiwami. If you're coming from those games, you're better off not playing this, as it feels like a downgrade to them in almost every way.",1705524053,1705524053,False,1,0,0.419852524995803833,1,True,False,False

15 hours into the game. I've installed ""SilentPatch"" and now the game is functioning as it should have. I will not be recommending this game due to how lazy the developers where with the port, by letting a modder fix the issue for them.

But this is not exactly a negative, since having 1 fighting style is how it used to be in the series, before 0 and Kiwami 1 released. 

The biggest positive here is the Dragon Engine. Which gives the game good optimization and performance, as well as beautiful graphics and fun physics. The combat is also overhauled due to change in game engine. which makes the limit on fighting styles less of an issue. 

Finally, Ryuji is so far the best villain and the final boss in the series. 
There is also a few special chapters where you play as Majima. Which is largely a short bit of fan service that functions as a prequel, and resolves some of the story from Yakuza 0.

Thank you for releasing this game on Steam, Sega. 

This remake is much better than the PS2 version. 
And I'm glad that the gameplay is almost based on the Judgment series, which in my opinion is the best of the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. 
The graphics are fantastic, as well as the story, soundtrack and locations. 
It's cool to see a modern version of Sotenbori.

I'm so glad we get to play the Majima saga, even if it is short (only three chapters). 

[spoiler] I'm glad that Makoto was able to thank Majima at least. The ending is great, and it's great that Majima can give her a farewell gift as confirmation that he's the one who gave her the wristwatch. [/spoiler]

In general, I'm thankful that you guys released the series on PC, Sega.

Zero's combat was barely passable but the gameplay and outright madness (Majima's parts mostly) did it for me. Overall a real nice game. Kiwami was intolerable at any level. ""Maybe it's its age"" I thought and finished it to give Kiwami 2 a chance. Kiwami 2 is better than Kiwami but just barely and I'm done with the Yakuza series.

--SPOILERS AHEAD--

I really like this game, but the last ~4 hours of it were... well, they sure were something!

I was really invested in pretty much all the new characters, the side content was great as always. I didn’t care for the story that much, but the characters were enough for me to keep playing. Ryuji was criminally underutilized, though, and hopefully he’ll appear in other installments. Majima was incredibly silly. Kiryu gets some very good moments, too. I didn’t have high expectations for Sayama, considering the previous game, but she blew my expectations and then some. I was into the Kiryu and Sayama romance at the beginning, but after their first kiss scene it was all down hill, so much so that I kinda hate the idea of them possibly getting together. The part where Kiryu almost gets Haruka into the entertainment history was disastrous, I was literally yelling at Kiryu through the screen the whole. It was the only time I was genuinely angry at any of these characters, it was just so bad. The whole story had an air of anti-Korean xenophobic sentiment I didn’t really enjoy.

The ending was something else. Too many plot twists, way too ridiculous, by the time the credits rolled I was laughing my ass off, and I’m pretty sure I wasn't supposed to. I truly have no words for it, it’s something you have to experience for yourself.

Despite its flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed the Dragon Engine. Sure, the fights were a little boring, but they were not cumbersome, so I didn’t really mind it. The substories were TOO good, probably one of my favorites parts of this game if I have to be honest. It was straight up evil to have Haruka’s requests available during the story, I got stuck on Virtual On and the golfing mini-game for three days. Evil. Did I mention this has the Cabaret mini-game?

When it comes to the Majima Saga: I enjoyed it over all. The opening cutscenes made me expect more yakuza politics, which we really didn’t get. It was great to see how Majima left the Tojo clan and how he decided to start Majima Construction. I love all things Makoto, and even though I loved how both Majima and Makoto got some well deserved closure, the whole thing felt a little off. Mainly how I felt It was unrealistic that Makoto hadn't changed at all in 18 years, It’s almost like she was plucked straight from Majima’s memories, like she’s just an extension of Majima’s Tragic Backstory™ and not her own person. Might just be me, though.

Pretty good game with an unintentionally hilarious ending.",1704744576,1704744814,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

　The Yakuza series still feels a bit clunky but remains playable. It no longer requires four different playstyles, which was a bit disappointing and reduced gameplay depth. However, I do appreciate the new experience farming with food. Yet, Yakuza 0 holds the trophy for character leveling using money. In this game, the money you grind is primarily used for the Majima Construction mini-game and buying end-game weapons, which I have no complaints about!

　While the game may not offer the same lengthy gameplay as Yakuza 0 or Majima's story, it is relatively short (Not as short as you'd expect for something hidden in your pants). However, the story is genuinely worth experiencing. I almost stopped playing yakuza because Kiwami 1, its story didn't captivate me as much as 0 did. But now, I'm ready for the next games in the series. If you're new to the game, it's recommended to start with normal difficulty. Unlike Kiwami 1, which had horribly unbalanced boss fights, this game is much easier to pick up.

　Perhaps in the future, I might not play Yakuza games due to the high modern minimum specs. Yakuza 0's graphics already look good, and I don't understand why developers keep pushing for 4K assets in their games, assuming everyone uses a 4K TV or monitor. Many games don't necessarily need 4K textures as their default assets, and people can still enjoy the game on 1080p.

　If I were to play all the Yakuza games in the future, the high specs required might stopped me from continuing the series for good. And, from Kiwami 1 onwards, this installment stands out more than Yakuza 0 graphic.

　 I didn't expect online content for the Majima Construction mini-game, such as different levels for each event that can be played online. It's pretty neat! Although I'm not a fan of it, due to its longer duration compared to cabaret mini-games, if it were a turn-based strategy, I might be more interested. As it stands, it's a bit too random and not to my taste.

　It's possible to complete the game in 18 to 77h, but I finished it in 40h. As you can tell, I'm not the type to collecting all achievement as if I have no life, but surprisingly, I managed to achieve more in this game compared to the previous one.

　There were so many surprises and characters in the game, which is why I'm now eager for the next games. Even though I knew it was a direct port from PlayStation 3, it could changed my perception of the game. I'm somewhat disappointed that there wasn't a different story arc like Yakuza 0, and it seems like the side quests have been reduced. I managed to finish them all in a short time, maybe because there were no collecting side missions like doll crane or rocket racing. Nevertheless, it's still worthwhile and makes sense. Honestly, I feel a bit let down by Ryuji. he could have had more depth like the characters we have today. But it's time to move on.

　I mean, imagine being a terrorist from Korea, getting caught, and watching all your friends get murdered. Then spending 20 years living in the same place, still holding onto thoughts of revenge. Koreans never change. they're still racist, just like what happened in the last ASEAN games. Glad korean group dancing behind yaosobi likes slaves as it should be! japan>korea!

　The game tends to get stuck at $20 bundles or less during sales, similar to what happened with the Remaster Collection. So, it's better to wait for a sale for the special bundle.

The game can get to be incredibly easy if you level up fast too, which might make this one the easiest of the new trilogy.

Kiwami improves on minigames, well only having the cabaret, Majima mini game wasn't good, did 3 missions. Story still great and more Kiryu, but less Majima, but he is now in the construction business. Haven't played his story yet, but will do soon.

Now that I’ve played Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, it’s a lot harder to come back to this game as Gaiden does a lot to optimize the Dragon Engine.

Putting Gaiden aside, it’s an alright game on its own. I don’t vibe too well with the story of Yakuza 2 besides Ryuji, so I can’t really say a lot of positive things about Kiwami 2’s story. The combat is alright at best, but the biggest complaint I have is the XP system. You have to get certain exp points from doing certain things and it makes upgrading your moves and stats more complicated and annoying. It’s just simpler to use money to upgrade Kiryu. Everything else, including mini games and substories, is pretty solid.

Overall, Kiwami 2 is an great game for someone experiencing the series for the first time. For the longest time, I though this was my 2nd favorite Yakuza game in the series. However, after playing the Judgement games and the later entries, I’ve started to grow less and less enthusiastic about the game.

Yakuza 0’s story was really good, Kiwami’s was decent but didn’t really hold a candle to 0’s, and K2’s story is really mediocre in my opinion (mainly due to the fact that we had to care about some Yakuza clan situation that was kinda dumb as it involved third parties that I didn’t really care about as RGG Studios failed to make me care, especially compared to Makoto in 0 and Nishikiyama in K1). The fighting styles disappearing was really disappointing as that removed the option for players to opt for a fighting style that complimented their preferred play style. However, the entire game engine changed which ushered in an upgraded visual and battle system/feel. The skill upgrade system was a pretty cool change and dunks on K1 (kinda on tier with 0 but a bit worse as requiring different categories of EXP was super tedious and just annoying). Sayama was also a huge annoying b!tch which sucks cus she's a pretty prevalent character...

- annoying blue filter + DoF filters
- low quality font
- cut music content
- combat, that while not the best, is imporved greatly through Triple AAA's Legend Remix K2 combat mod

At the end of the day it is just another Yakuza game with upgraded graphics, different (and more restrictive combat due to the flexibility that was offered with the 4 previous fighting styles), mediocre story, and oddly more side content than all other Yakuza games so far (Y0 still beats it in overall content though).

This game definitely has flaws, the combat system seems very nerfed from 0 and Kiwami. Although Dragon style is a combination of all previous styles in the other two games, it suffers quite a bit in it's lack of variety. Not very many heat actions too. But regardless, towards the mid point of the game, you will feel the heat! You will be unstoppable, once you work out the basics of this style. It's really satisfying in the end. 

Besides the combat, the substories are nice, but not many notable ones. Still worth your time. The Cabaret Club minigame was AWESOME. I got real engrossed in it. The dating sections were cool, i guess. But they were just a means to go through the main plot of this minigame. The effort and journey is definitely worth it and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND playing through it atleast once! Now on to the next major minigame, Clan Creator. It's as good as the cabaret club and introduces more memorable characters, GODDAMN! One thing I love about both these minigames is that the characters that you encounter in substories are recruitable in these games. It not only gives more use of them, besides just appearing once in the substories, it expands the world in a wonderful way. Feels like it all comes together! I LOVE IT!

Now, the story. I will admit that it took a while to get into at as in my opinion there weren't as many hard hitting moments. But the ones that hit, THEY HIT HARD. Some scenes are masterfully executed, with the perfect song (I used the licensed music mod which is MANDATORY AND YOU SHOULD NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT IT), the perfect premise, the right emotional beats and beautiful cinematography. Simply amazing. This is why I love Yakuza. This game, in particular, has one scene that instantly became one of my top 5 favourite scenes in a game (I SWEAR, GET THE MOD). On top of this, genuinely good writing with plenty of twists that will catch you off guard. But overall, Amazing story. I feel like I'll enjoy it even more with each playthrough. The ending is just perfect. The way the credits roll truly leaves a lasting impression. Just Bravo!! I love it! But the true ending (of sorts) is the Majima prequel chapters. These are too short, the combat is severely basic with a very noticeably lacking moveset and kinda drags sometimes. But despite these flaws, it has a few MAJOR memorable moments. It can be considered fan service. But in the grand scheme of things, it truly feels earned. It doesn't feel cheap. The ending to these chapters is what I consider the ending of the trilogy. Perfect closer. Nothing more, nothing less.

To be honest, one can stop the Yakuza story with this trilogy and still leave with a perfect and plenty satisfying ending, but alas, the show must go on...

See you in Yakuza 3.

9/10 for this individual game. 
10/10 for the trilogy.

It's a mediocre game, especially the story which was worse than i hoped it would be,whoever wrote it seems to have watched too many animes/ read too many mangas, but considering the fact they keep releasing yakuza games on what seems a yearly basis as if it's call of duty kind of manufacturing, could be SEGA'S fault at why the main story and the side stories are just childish,bland, boring and uninspiring except for a few and far between.

What i did enjoy was the aesthetics of the towns/cities, the neon light district and some of the mini games, there's too many of them tbh but all in all you play the game for the combat, which was satisfying the first 5-10 hours of the game, but still a downgrade from the previous games imo, was kinda missing the style switching fighting stances from yakuza 0.

I have played have previously, yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1, i would say this game is a slight upgrade in some parts to kiwami 1, but definitely not better than yakuza 0, would give this a 6.5/10 - and buy the game if it's on a discount.",1702903399,1702904878,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

The combat is the signature combat style from previous games but is more fluid and interactive.

While the story's pacing was a lot slower with a good handful of characters not feeling very memorable, the side content and gameplay more than make up for it. I can't count the amount of times I've laughed out loud from the ragdoll shenanigans of the Dragon Engine during combat except for one certain boss.

I dont know why but at least this Game has the Carbaret and Majima minigame in it, not like Yakuza 1.

And the Story is for me more interesting and also better?

without spoiling too much Yakuza 0 was at the end more for majima then Kiryu which is also good.
Yakuza 1 was more like hmm ""Internal"" Relationship Problems?

BUT this one had Ryuji in it as a villain and i have to say i Love this guy, he is really like a Dragon without using underhanding Tactics and respecting ""at least"" a few things regarding innocent People and lives.

What had Yakuza 0? like 5 Times the Same guy and in the end the mastermind wow.

in Yakuza 1 without Spoiling too much the Endfight was really exciting and packed with action and a cool climax.

The Gameplay was a lot different then the other two and i love this system way more.
You dont skill with money anymore but with 5 different skill points. money in this game is more used for majima construction and the carbaret clubs i think.

but earning skill points with eating is really a game changer for me, now i can eat and drink and it brings me more then just health regeneration and farming skill points is a lot easier and funnier for me than always farming the same  ""Big guys"" in the other versions.

the other big change are the fights. Now you have only one Style BUT you have now a Heat mode were you are invincible vs. staggers and your moves are way smoother and heat actions are easier and faster to trigger.

I like this and the yakuza 1 and 0 styles but here it is more like ""just brute force with heat mode"" the fights without these constantly annoyingly Quickstep punch combo etc. i dont know but i enjoyed this more than the others and the fights are faster then before.

Maybe it was too long ago when i played the other two games but from my memories i think this one is my favourite till now.",1702601805,1702601805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

YK2 improves on these:
- Overall gameplay is extremely fluid. Battle in/out phase is seamless, no longer felt like random Pokemon encounters
- Skill tree is much more simple and comprehensive as compared to previous games. 
- Enhanced cabaret experience with more features/skills. Way less grindy as compared to Y0

Lackluster areas:
- No enjoyable features from Y0 such as Baka Mitai, disco, pocket circuit
- Plot holes + Plot armors. Insert ""knifes and guns in cut scenes are dangerous"" memes here
- Majima construction just isn't fun for me. Also some characters are locked behind overpriced DLC it seems

Conclusion:
- Great game. One of the best in the entire Yakuza franchise.

[b]Price paid, AUD:[/b] $7.86

[b]Time to finish:[/b] 55 hours for completion of Kiryu and Majima’s story. I completed all of the side quests that were available on the map, but didn’t go hunting for secrets or do much of the minigames.

[b]Difficulty setting:[/b] Normal.

[b]Graphics settings:[/b] Ultra at 3440x1440.

Drive: Silicone Power 500GB M.2 PCIe SSD
OS: Windows 11

[b]Performance:[/b] Performance was great. No noticeable hitches.

[b]Graphics:[/b] Considerably improved over Y0 and YK graphics, the game is actually quite nice to look at now. I walked around the city quite a bit at first, just taking it all in. It really does look nice.

[b]Story:[/b] The first half or maybe even two thirds of the story was just okay. It didn’t really grab me. But then things started to ramp up near the final few chapters and it started pulling on the heart strings, and it ended up finishing really well. Overall, I’m very happy with the story and how things turned out.

The Majima Saga was short and sweet, filled with laughs and tears.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Everything just feels better in YK2. Combat is more fluid, Kiryu’s animations are far more natural, and things are just generally more refined, whether that’s the in-game menu getting a facelift or being able to walk inside shops now without loading screens, or skills and EXP getting a more condensed and streamlined feel.

They seem to have done away with the 4 combat styles and instead opted for a singular combat style that incorporates parts of the old styles, like how the old ‘Legend’ style used to work. It was a bit of a bummer at first, but once you get used to using it, it’s a great fighting style that just works and is very fluid. Really nice variations in moves when turning around mid-swing to hit someone behind you as well.

The combat difficulty in this game is not too difficult, while still being challenging enough at times. This is the first Yakuza game I’ve played that hasn’t made me feel overly frustrated with certain boss fights.

Cabaret Club management makes a welcomed return. In general, it was quicker to level up your hostesses than in Y0. Things are largely unchanged in this minigame, which is great, because the original was so good and this version is equally as fun.

Ragdoll physics is hilarious.

[b]Bugs:[/b] Sometimes during cutscenes I noticed when a character would walk on/off screen, they would just stay frozen at the edge of the screen. This may have something to do with my ultrawide monitor, as I’d imagine this may have been hidden off-screen on a non-ultrawide monitor.

[b]Final thoughts:[/b] YK2 is a refined and beautiful rendition of the gameplay style, locations and characters that we’ve come to love. With a story that doesn’t rely on its predecessors, and a heaping helping of the hilarious, this game is a fantastic addition to the Yakuza series.

Now we have most of older moveset together but with fluid animations and fights where you feel all punches and kicks. And overall game looks more lively.
Game itself is short as Kiwami 1 but you can see that RGG tried to make something of it (my guess is that Kiwami 1 was sacrificed in sake of proper Kiwami 2 remake):
1. We now have things from Zero like cabaret and karaoke with cutscenes
2. No more soul crushing grind except bouncer missions and arena... and skill points if you want to learn all skills. In that case you'll spend lot of time running to pharmacy to get Appstim RX then going to restaraunts to eat expensive stuff to buff up
3. Substories are fun again

Imagine playing Yakuza 3 after it...

I don't exactly remember the story. I certainly know it's not that bad as in Kiwami 1, and i certainly remember it was fun to play the game so story was sort off pleasant addition.
And yes, Majima is sane again. Not that masochistic one-dimensional boss guy from Kiwami 1

============================================================
После Kiwami 1 и Zero я не буду скучать по переключению стилей и дубовой боевке старого движка. Теперь у нас почти все старые приемы вместе, но с плавными анимациями и драчки, в которых ощущаются все удары. Да и в целом живее стало.
Игра такая же короткая, как и первая часть, но видно, что постарались что-то из игры сделать в отличии от первой части (подозреваю, что Kiwami 1 просто пожертвовали, чтоб сделать нормальную вторую):
1. Спасают вернувшиеся плюшки из Zero, типа кабарэ и караоке с катсценами
2. Убрали лютый гринд первой части, если не считать bouncer missions и арену... и прокачку скиллов, если приспичит собрать все скиллы, т.к. кучу времени потратите на беготню до аптек за покупкой Appstim RX и походы в рестики, чтобы пожрать дорогих блюд для прокачки
3. Побочки вновь нормальные

И вот как играть в Yakuza 3 после этого...

Сюжет толком не помню уже. Помню, что он точно не полное дно, как в Kiwami 1, и что в целом было весело играть в игру, поэтому сюжет был скорее приятным дополнением.
И да, Мадзиму вернули в адекватное русло, т.к. в kiwami 1 вышел какой-то однобокий дегенерат-мазохист",1620064073,1700747397,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most stores and buildings you can enter seamlessly (witcher 3 style). Combat has less option than 0 or kiwami, but it's WAY more refined and feels a lot better. Enemies are no longer as spongy as in kiwami, infact they're probably too easy. It's still better though.

The bouncer missions are horrible. You get good items from them which help a lot, but they are some of the worst designed levels I've ever played. it seems like they exist to show you that the combat is actually very broken if it gets pushed to it's limits. They will put enemies with machine guns that insta stunlock you into an unavoidable death. like you will just be stunned and continuously shot for 1 min until you die. the ""Solution"" is the break a box which has a shield, which can block the bullets. If you use the shield to break the barrier that is blocking you right in front of it, the shield breaks and you die. If you drop the shield to break the barrier with your fists, it's impossible to pick the shield back up again and you die. If you break the barrier, then break the box to pick up the shield, you then get to enjoy 2 mins of slowly inching towards the three machine gunners, as when a  bullet hits the shield, you stop moving. And there is only 0.1 seconds of break in the 20 second chunks of fire. This is just one example of one mission out of like 30, and they are all like this. They are designed to be the most annoying things possible, I couldn't come up with worse levels if i tried. 

Majima construction is fun for the first 2 levels, then you realise it's the worst rts you've ever played. It's a really fun idea, but it's an rts with the worst controls every, the dumbest a.i, and most annoying enemies. It's just not worth doing. 

The hostess club is pretty much identical to yakuza 0, except the pacing is worse. You'll beat the champion ship, and then have to mindlessly grind about 10 more nights if you want to experience all the girl story lines. It's incredibly easy and tedious. Also, to complete all the CP missions for the club, you will have to grind out like 30 more days of it, to get money and fans that you will never have anything to spend on. it's more money than you'll ever need. 

Haruka holds your hand and is smarter than kiwami, and is genuinely very sweet at first. Her ""requests"" are broken though, as in you can do them and the game just won't count it. her requests can literally softlock you from 100%ing the game.

the coliseum is also really easy (on hard mode mind you) and makes you grind the same stages over and over again to rank up. so much grinding. It's still the best coliseum out of yakuza 0 and kiwami though. 

Good game, just don't bother trying to completionist anything, it's not worth it.

Yakuza Kiwami 2 is another example of the saga, that just doesn't disappoint. Even with reused assets the devs manage to always bring such a great combination of story and gameplay to the table and top it off with the mini-games etc.

Majima is just a crazy unstoppable force of madness no matter what he does, the Tiger Drop finally earns it's name and Haruka still wants you to do questionable tasks to make her happy! 
Though the game was pretty tame to 100% for a Yakuza game. Sure, the bouncer missions are a bit to many but everything else is cheesable through items if you have problems with it.

First and foremost, it should be mentioned that the combat, along with the engine, has been significantly changed and improved from Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza 0. Initially, I was unsure how I felt about the changes and the more streamlined and fluid combat style. I felt frustrated and admittedly disappointed since I had grinded out the Majima Everywhere mechanic in Kiwami 1 and became quite proficient in the combat in that game only to have the engine and combat change so dramatically.  However, the longer I played and the more I practiced, the more I viewed the differences as improvements.

The sheer amount of content in this game is almost indescribable. Whether you find yourself grinding the mini-games, enjoying the hilarious substories, unlocking skills and heat actions, eating at all of the restaurants, or fighting in the endless structured battles, there is a little something for everyone to enjoy.

(SPOILERS FOR YAKUZA KIWAMI 2 AND YAKUZA KIWAMI, i guess)

in terms of story and difficulty or user playability, i would say that it is much better than kiwami
i felt that the game was a bit short (which is good) and for me, it felt shorter than kiwami. i think i am saying this because i played both games on hard mode, but the final 13th chapter was the worst compared to kiwami 2's last chapter, chapter 16. i am surprised kiwami 2 allowed you to save between fighting the waves of enemies and the final bosses, since kiwami and 0 made you have to play for an hour straight without saving (or more in zero's case). i am saying this because in kiwami i had to reload an old save to prepare for the final chapter because [spoiler]the jingu boss fight was actually so stupid. ""let's give two guys guns and armour as the boss runs around with his gun and grenades,"" they said. i literally had to grind until i got tiger drop as well as getting bulletproof gear to teach jingu and his guys a lesson, i barely even had to heal on nishiki since that fight was fair, or i would say that at least.[/spoiler]

i personally did not like the dragon engine combat as much as kiwami and 0's four style switching, and in the earlier parts of the game it felt like i'm not even scratching the enemies. things like tiger drop and guns are not a thing anymore, guns are just useless and i don't think there is even a place to buy them (probably is and i just don't know) and tiger drop is not as overpowered as kiwami but actually balanced. you can still do really stupid amounts of damage with extreme heat mode and muscle soda if you really wanted to.",1696726705,1696726705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Currently playing with the style switch mod that adds the other 4 fighting styles from Yakuza 0, I do wish they added them out of necessity to match kiwami 1 but they didn't. Although the Kiwami games are notorious for making a remake with the existing assets of the most recent entry (For example: Kiwami uses Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 2 uses Yakuza 6) 
RGGs use of reusing assets is not hidden and they do it loud with how little changes from Yakuza 3,4 and 5 but I think Kiwami 2 is the one that changes that trend.

Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a masterpiece of it's own, delivering a really deep story with a lot of drama, action and emotions. This is a real example of how to make a good and immersive story in a videogame.
They have improved everything in Kiwami 2 when compared to Kiwami 1. The graphics are really good and a huge upgrade when compared to the previous game, but not only that, the combat has been upgraded too and feels much better now with faster movement and more responsive controls. A lot of QoL improvements were also implemented like not having load screens when entering establishments.
I think Kiwami 2 is really when starting the series from Yakuza 0 starts to pay off. It feels like the story has reached its climax with excellent characters and a deep and complex story. Not to mention the Majima story that also made excellent connections to Yakuza 0.
It's really interesting how each game is interconnected. They have their own story contained within itself, but also makes connections to past games and even tease what's yet to come. A lot of things that happened in Yakuza 0 had their real consequences to the story now in Kiwami 2. It reminded me a lot of the Trails series, where a lot of these interconnections happen between each game while having a major plot that connects them all. Also pretty interesting that the directors of both Yakuza series and Trails series are named Toshihiro lol
The game took about 14 hours to beat focusing on the story mode. There's a ton of sidestories to do and minigames to enjoy on top of that, but the story was so good that I just wanted to see everything through and didn't want to stop for side content.
Yakuza Kiwami 2 delivered everything that I expected since I started the series with Yakuza 0. A deep and complex interconnected story with great characters that keeps getting deeper and deeper by each subsequent game you play. The more you learn, the more secrets are revealed as the story unfolds in a very satisfying and dramatic way. They also have improved everything over the previous game, especially the graphics, which are very photo-realistic and really good and the combat too feels a lot better.
The PC Port is also excellent and I was able to run it at 1440p 60fps High settings on a RTX 2060 Super without any issues. Very stable frame rate and zero issues during my entire playthough. Ran very smoothly and perfectly.
Can't wait to play the next game in the series, even though the transition may be a little bit harsh going from this excellent full modern remake to the old remastered games, but with an excellent story like this, I think we'll be fine going through.",1695001397,1695001397,True,5,0,0.539923965930938721,0,True,False,False

This is the third part of the Yakuza series (in chronological order), and I think it's the best part for me (at least for now). The most noticeable change is the engine, the new engine gives better graphics, more detailed environments, and new gameplay mechanics (for example, fights feel different now). The story is also quite interesting and engaging, as always, lots of plot twists, tense moments and of course epic boss fights.

[i](There's a paragraph at the end of the review ""In a nutshell"" if you don't want to read the whole thing.)[/i]

 [b] [u]Storyline [/u] [/b] 

So, what is this game about?[b] Our protagonist as always, Kazuma Kiryu, a year after stepping away from the yakuza life, the chairman of the clan is assassinated. He was killed by a rival clan, and now that means war, which Kazuma wants to prevent, and to do that he needs to find the new chairman of the Tojo clan. On his way he meets the villain of the story, Ryuji Goda, the ""Dragon Kansai"" of the Omi Alliance. He wants to kill Kiryu because there can only be one dragon, and now it's a dragon confrontation.[/b]

[b]As I said before, the plot in this part is not bad.[/b] But not better than before, for example, in the first part we had two main characters and two big stories that merged at the end. Those stories were pretty epic, in the Kiriya line he wiped out most of the Tojo clan, which was pretty cool. In Kiwami, we were confronted with the changes in 10 years. A lot of people we knew changed, a lot of people died, and the ending was very powerful. 

But now the story starts a year later (which isn't a bad thing, though), and not much has changed. We meet new rivals from the clan we met before, but in my opinion they are not as interesting as the previous ones. But that doesn't mean the plot is bad, it's pretty cool, though not as epic as before (but the ending is pretty epic too, nonetheless).

[b] [u]Districts and the Atmosphere [/u] [/b]

As for the atmosphere, it's the same as in the previous part, so I guess I'll skip that topic and talk about the elaboration of details.

[b]Thanks to the new engine, the graphics are better than before and now there are no loading screens (at least on the streets). You can enter restaurants and entertainment places on your own, now you don't have to press the button and wait for loading.[/b] You can also enter unusual places, such as an office or other building, where there is no entertainment. The level of detail of these places is also increased, there are a lot of interior items that are lying around and can be picked up in fights (much more than before).
Although I said the atmosphere remained the same as the previous part, I was meaning the atmosphere of Japan in the 2000s, but with this level of detail, the districts became more alive and interesting to explore.

[b] [u]Additional assignments [/u] [/b]

[b]This part of the game is most similar to the one that was in the previous game.[/b] The quests are very similar in story (in general the plots are different, but on the same level), for example in the previous parts we had a hostess club and this one has one, and they are the same (or almost the same) in mechanics. Quests are not unusual, but they're not bad either, especially with the new graphics that make everything more beautiful.

[b] [u]Gameplay [/u] [/b] 

[b]For me, this is the best change. Foremost, the game got rid of 3 (+1) fighting styles, for some people this might not be very nice, but for me, it's pretty good.[/b] I always use one, my favorite style, and don't pay attention to the others. Usually halfway through the game, I upgrade that style to the last one. If I want to improve anything else (in this style), I have to do some secrets or silly quests, but now we only have one style and more upgrades to it (and secrets or silly quests remain). Because of this, you have a lot of upgrades, and you can use them as soon as you want. 

[b]Also, skills are now more interesting, or at least make more difference in combat or exploration.[/b] For example, you can get a skill that shows you all the side quests on the map, which is pretty handy. The improvements in combat have also gotten interesting, from parrying to cancel actions. [b]Thanks to this, you can actually dodge or parry attacks normally now. In the previous part, fighting multiple enemies was quite difficult and uncomfortable, now it has become much better.[/b]

[b]But with weapons and consumables, the game took a step backwards. Now you can have all types of consumables (food, first aid kits, etc.) within 5-10, it makes you invincible (if you can use them).[/b] That's pretty casual in my opinion.

[b]Also, weapons are now more consumable than before.[/b] You can't even repair it before completing some side quests (now it's not as obvious and not many people can repair weapons like before), I didn't repair any of my weapons because of this. And it's also too powerful, I wouldn't recommend using it on bosses (at least not on bosses without weapons).

[hr][/hr]
[b] [u]In a nutshell [/u] [/b]

[b]The plot is not bad, very dramatic and tense, but not as epic as in the previous parts. The game has a new engine, which fixed many problems: battles became more convenient and interesting, much less loading screens, quite beautiful graphics, more detailed locations and characters, more convenient exploration and the map (now it is possible to put marks). Side quests are on the same level, that's not bad. The atmosphere is also unchanged from the previous part.[/b]

[b] [u]Conclusion [/u][/b] 

[b]I can say that the game is much more comfortable to play now.[/b] I used to get tired of the fights by the end of the game, especially when the game gave a lot of enemies at once (it was quite uncomfortable). But now this has been fixed, and I really enjoyed the fights in this part. The story isn't bad either, the exploration, as I said, is made more interesting by the new engine. [b]All in all, for me, it's a great game with some minor flaws.[/b]

It has the same weak points as the other ones, which is that the story is just too convoluted and involves too many characters to keep up with. Also, having played a lot of these games now, I feel like the character of Haruka has been underutilized in a lot of ways so far. I wish she did more in the game. Kiryu is a good protagonist as always. I was also glad to see Majima make an appearance in this game and get his own side story. The “Majima Saga” was not very long lasting, but was enjoyable. I do wish that they had made it more like Yakuza 0 where you could play as Majima on the same level and with the same amount of options as Kiryu. A lot of the side elements in this game were fun, but they lasted too long or had too many parts. After a while, anything gets repetitive and boring and that was the case here with a lot of the side elements. The cabaret club missions were fine, but it took a long time to build up relationships with the hostesses and complete their side stories. The bouncer missions were an interesting addition and they offered nice prizes but there were way too many of them and the last couple were needlessly difficult. The clan creator missions lasted for too many rounds. Each one should have been 6 rounds max. There were ones that lasted 10 or 12 or even 17 rounds, which was just way too many and felt kind of boring after a while. Satisfying Haruki’s requests was fine, but again, there were way too many of them to satisfy. Also, the poker request was abnormally difficult. The karaoke request was also a pain for me personally. Karaoke in Yakuza Kiwami 2 is just so much harder than it should be. But overall, this game was enjoyable. I am still holding out hope that they will make “Kiwami” remakes of Yakuza 3, 4, & 5.

There's, once again, a ton to do and I could probably spend another 10-15 hours if I wanted to complete the game. I won't though, since that would include doing all the boring/annoying activities that I don't want to do. 

While the dragon engine looks fantastic, overall I kinda feel like condensing fighting styles into just one was a step down. You'll pretty much just be using the same handful of combos the entire game. There's also a lot of jank that comes with the new engine. Sometimes it's hilarious ragdolling of the enemies, but there were a couple serious bugs I ran into:

-later in the game you can hang out with Haruka and fulfilling her requests would almost freeze the game. Her affection meter would start to increase EXTREMELY slowly to the point that I thought I was soft-locked. Apparently if you just pause and un-pause the game repeatedly until it's done, that fixes it. Later on this stopped happening.

-The ""Fists of Fury"" technique seems to be bugged to the point where it's less an upgrade and more a fatal downgrade. You're SUPPOSED to be able to chain 3 charge attacks together but when charging the 2nd, Kiryu never finishes charging and is just stuck in a charging state until you reset the game or the enemy kills him. I think it has something to do with the higher frame rate afforded by the PC version. Kinda crazy this hasn't been patched.

Other than those few issues and some tedium, which is mostly skipable (I refuse to learn how to play shogi or majhong and no one can convince me otherwise), the game is a lot of fun. 

TL;DR:
Game is good. If you've played other Yakuza games, you'll like it. If you like bizarre Japanese humor, you'll like it. If you like beat-em-up games with RPG elements added for good measure, you'll like it. There are some annoyances and if you set out for 100% completion, you'll probably hate it, but I found it very fun to just do what I wanted and leave the rest.",1690244519,1690244519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yakuza Kiwami 2 is the newest remake in the Yakuza series from SEGA, bringing over the 2006 PS2 game to modern consoles. This one will be a real treat for Yakuza fans, considering it's been long-regarded as the best game in the Yakuza series. That claim might be a little more contested with newer releases like Yakuza 0, but there's still no denying that Yakuza 2 is a fantastic game, and this Kiwami remake only improves the overall experience.

The story for Yakuza Kiwami 2 picks up not long after the events of the first game. If for some reason this is your first entry in the series, the game provides a decent enough recap of the events prior, so it isn't that difficult to get caught up. One thing that really stands out with Yakuza Kiwami 2 when compared to the later games in the series, is that series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu hasn't completely given up on his Yakuza background and the Tojo Clan, which makes for a more intriguing crime story overall. The introduction of the Division Four police, Korean Mafia, and other elements make for a fun ride. Everything about the story holds up well, which I was happy to see.

There's a whole host of new elements found in Yakuza Kiwami 2, like the use of the Dragon engine from Yakuza 6, new mini-games, side-stories, and even plot elements that help tie Yakuza 2 more into the existing games in the series. Majima has his own side-story via the Majima Construction plotline, the Host Club mini-game from Yakuza 0 shows up here, and you'll get even more New Japan Pro wrestlers via the Clan mode that was introduced in Yakuza 6. There is a ton of side activities packed into the game, the majority of which feel worthwhile. There's several other games to play, found in other Yakuza titles, like Mahjong, SEGA arcade titles such as Virtua Fighter 2.1, and even a, uh, urinal mini-game.

Along with the plethora of side activities, Yakuza Kiwami 2 adopts the combat and experience system of Yakuza 6. Kiryu will encounter enemies on the map highlighted by red icons that patrol the streets. If they spot Kiryu, they'll run up to him and initiate a seamless combat transition. Defeating enemies will earn Kiryu experience, which can be even further advanced by visiting the various restaurants and consuming food to heal up and gain experience bonuses. Kiryu has access to a ton of skills, some of which are combat based, while others are designed to boost experience gains, your hunger meter, or aid in the various mini-games like the Host Club or the Majima Construction scenario.

Like other Yakuza titles, combat is essentially a beat 'em up, wherein you'll use punches and kicks to take down enemies with varying combo attacks. The system seems basic on the surface, but as you unlock additional abilities for Kiryu, you'll gain access to additional heat moves for disabling foes, improved dodge and parry attacks, and even team-up abilities that depend on where you are in town, allowing an NPC to join the fray if you've already completed his or her quest. It's a pretty dynamic system overall, and while not new to the series, the frantic action keeps the constant encounters feel fresh and exciting.

I really, really enjoyed my time with Yakuza Kiwami 2, and as a fan of the series, I'd certainly urge you to check it out. It has very few flaws, outside of some minor animation issues and the occasional cumbersome combat sequence. It also feels like a much stronger remake than even Yakuza Kiwami, which was no slouch to begin with. It also has some solid ties to both Yakuza 0 via the new elements, and pre-existing story beats that feed into the more recent Yakuza 6. So check this one out when you get a chance, you will not be disappointed.",1690133939,1690133939,True,1,0,0.505102038383483887,0,True,False,False

 So yeah, sorry if this annoys anyone, and it might be partly my own fault for wanting to complete the game as much as possible, and realizing that sometimes, it's just an unfunny and repetitive grind - not only the mini-games, but the whole formula of the series, which, I must admit, is pretty great, but then, why again make it some sort ""diluted"" adventures, when the devs could have created less of them, but having more marking changes in gameplay and content, thus renewing a more, if not greatly, the franchise's variety?

. . . well, I do love this franchise, but maybe I just got tired at this moment, not being able to win 1000+ points at poker for that little obnoxious control-freak / moneysucker - never overspoil your kids or you might get an immensely severe backlash for your kindness : ))

Nah, Yakuza: Kiwami 2 has with no doubt the Ryu Ga Gotoku seal of excellence, really - it's just that it creates no true surprise, following the two first Yakuza in their tracks - so, either you might just love this franchise with no boundaries or limits, and won't mind the repetitiveness they include, or - you just might be in a serious grind at some point, if you're decided to fully complete the game - a very pleasant, relatively simple and casual one, but still a bit of a grind, alas.

It has the best villain in the entire series in my opinion. The music is great, especially the final boss theme. The combat feels great and feels like hits actually connect with enemies, unlike past games where it kind of felt like 2 characters doing canned animations while standing next to each other. 

The ragdolls and physics are too over the top though, such as how far enemies can be flung. It looks janky and can interrupt combos, such as when enemies get flung too far away to follow up with a heat move before they get back up. Walking into certain objects will cause the object to totally get destroyed and Kiryu kind of spazzes out. The majority of the time the physics aren't really that bad.

The PC port is not well optimized. On my PC I can only get 30-45 fps. I've seen similarly impressive looking games run better, and even on low graphics settings it can't go higher than 45 fps. (it's weird that Low/Medium/High settings all run at ~45, and Ultra gets 30) I have a GTX 970 and Intel i5 processor.

edit: I upgraded to a RTX 3080 TI and Ryzen 7 and now the game runs flawlessly at 1440p 120+ fps.

Yakuza Kiwami 2 took me a long time to beat. As with the last two games, the story here is top-notch - a little better than both of them, if I'm being perfectly honest. The graphics here are prettier than ever, and while seeing Kamurocho one more year into the future was cool, it was Sotenbori that caught my attention this time around. Of course, much of this is made up of reused assets, polished up for the new engine. No, what's new here is the combat. With revamped animations and a brand new engine, Yakuza Kiwami 2 was poised to blow me away with an improvement on the combat system. Unfortunately, the improvements present in the rest of the game were lacking from the combat, leaving it simple, button-mashey, and downright unfun. The only things carrying it were the fight music in Sotenbori and the flashy animations. Beyond that, the upgrade system of 0 and Kiwami, unlocking new moves as you progress to make combat skill-based, is gone too - in favour of flat stat upgrades to a set-in-stone moveset. Compounding the issue is how unbalanced the game is. By the end of the game, I was past fully leveled - and I went out of my way to avoid combat for the whole game. All in all, Yakuza Kiwami 2 presents the best experience in the series so far, provided you stay out of fights. That's hard to do though, as almost every sub story in this game ends in combat, with all the exceptions being the best sub stories (go figure). I like this game, but I probably won't replay it.

Dragon engine combat is fantastic IMO. It has its bugs (ragdolled bodies seemingly *pick up* speed when they hit ground), but it looks fantastic and plays well.

The story I have bigger gripes with; really nothing has topped 0. Spoiler ahead:

 [spoiler] The ending was quite the mess, lots of strange decisions with Kaoru suddenly being useless after she falls in love with Kiryu, and people dying / getting injured in cutscenes. Not to mention Kiryu giving up his responsibility to Haruka at the end, and then having the audacity to mention it without any real reflection. It was pretty bad, Ishin level bad.

- New Dragon Engine looks gorgeous. Being able to just walk in and out of the stores/restaurants/game centers looks and feels good.
- Larger inventory is pretty cool. Not so much a fan of the 10 recovery item cap after being able to take 20 Staminan Royales in previous entries, but items didn't stack in 0 or Kiwami 1.
- Combat is nice. I don't mind the shift away from the stance system, I quite like Dragon style and it makes sense not to have the other styles here.
- If you didn't like not being able to play as Majima in the previous Kiwami, you'll enjoy the Majima Saga side content!
- Glad to see 0's cabaret club side story make a reappearance.

Cons :
- Heat actions feel more scarce this time around and some are location-locked (and are ultimately the same heat action of An Ally Tosses You A One-Time Use Item With Different Animation).
- Not a fan of the levelling system here. Before, you either had to invest actual in-game cash to level up (0), or allocate experience in whatever skill you required (Kiwami 1). Here, you essentially have 5 types of experience, and each skill requires some amount of each, whether that's just one type or a combination of them. On the plus side it gives AppStims use here; the best way to get experience is to eat at restaurants. 
- Tied to previous, also not a fan of having to seek out some of the requisite items/activities in order to unlock all of Kiryu's abilities.
- Majima's side content is rather short at 3 chapters long and there's not as much to do aside from go from plot point to plot point.
- Not personally a fan of the Kamurocho Hills side story game (but I'm not good at strategy in the first place).
- Kept running into a crash during Chapter 8's midpoint cutscene.

Nitpicky garbage:
- UFO catcher physics are kinda weird this time around, the prizes feel heavier than they should be.
- The Toylets minigame doesn't work properly due to framerate issues. There's apparently a patch that works for it but I couldn't figure it out. Completionists are gonna have a harder time with this one.

I liked this one a lot better than Kiwami 1 now that I'm aware the story gets very grim at points, but this seems to be where the series also gets a bit goofier and hard to take seriously.

If you haven't played 0 or Kiwami yet, do play those first, but this is a really, genuinely excellent entry in the series. Uses the Dragon Engine, so feels like a marked upgrade from the games preceding it, and just oozes style.

Only thing I would say is Silent Patch is a necessity here to fix some of the issues with minigames that occur at 60fps.",1688401855,1688401855,True,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

It took me quite a while to get Used to Dragon Engine 
but after I got used to it, it was rlly e nice expirince to play with it.

The Story was well written, on some points quite sad and on others funny,
Ryuuji was introduces as a new Characgter, de Dragon of Kansai...
but for him only one dragon should excist, so his plan was to off Kiryu,
so he can be the Only Dragon...
At first I didn't like Ryuuji at all, by the End he made me cry.
I still don't like him xDD

the substories where fun! but the ones related to Golf and Baseball were annoying, 
since I am not that good in Minigames, so I haven't done them yet, 
but one day I want to complete all substories.

After Finishing the Main Story, I did Majima Saga, and was a bit disspointed by it,
at first when I read about it, I was really happy! I love playing as Majima.
But you can't rlly do things with him in the Game, it's mostly just to enojy the Story.
The Makoto Part made me sob like a Baby... So I think it were good additional Chapter.
But they could have been better, if there was a way to do substories, collect weapons and lvl him up.

The combat system has been massively streamlined removing the four fighting styles from Kiwami 1.
This makes Kiryu feel very bland in terms of the types of combos you can do. Heat actions animations are recycled for many of the weapons and items used in combat where in Kiwami 1 they all felt unique and satisfying.

Rag doll has been added to all character models making them look ridiculous when knocked around and there were multiple boss fights where the boss model would launch itself into the air after being defeated.
While funny the first few times it happened it just kept reminding me about how little the developers cared when making the second game. Kiwami 1 felt like a labor of love where Kiwami 2 felt like something cranked out as fast as possible. Hoping Remastered 3 is better.

However, there are some adjustments you will have to make when coming from Y0-5 or Kiwami. The fighting and combat are more ""dynamic"" and make use of the environment, but aside from that the combat has been super-simplified. Say goodbye to fighting styles or the classic intricate beat-em-up gameplay. Fights are now pretty janky and have been simplified into what is basically 2 buttons. This becomes especially apparent in the Majima DLC when you compare him to Y0's Mad Dog style.

The graphics are 10 steps forward and 1 step back. Everything looks higher-quality and the environments are [i]BEAUTIFUL[/i], but the rendering techniques they adopted makes hair, beards and eyebrows look weird. It also loses a lot of fidelity with transparent surfaces like glass and water, making the developers opt to make most of these opaque mirrors instead of see-through. It's clear the game was developed with nighttime in mind, because during daytime the environments look pretty bland, only coming to life during the absolutely stunning nighttimes.

This game is a solid recommendation if you're into Yakuza, but if you're new to the series please play 0 and Kiwami first. If the combat in those games is the main thing that got you hooked and not the story, environments, characters or side-activities then skip Yakuza 6 and skip this one.",1592429211,1686833759,True,2,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

[b] General Things [/b]

First, I will talk about the graphics, the open world, and just basic general things. Oh my god, the step up from quality is incredible and it fulfilled the expectations that I had for Kiwami 1. It's so cool that you don't have to transition scenes when doing things, like getting in and out of fights, getting inside building, you can even FIGHT in buildings. I think it's so cool that you can be more interactive with the area unlike the 2 previous games. The soundtrack is amazing as always. The story and characters were pretty nice, it didn't have enough time to flesh out all of them so I understand that, you will have to play the other games to get the characters and story more which is a common theme for Yakuza and other games I guess. 

[b] The Gameplay and The New Engine[/b]

The gameplay is so different from the previous 2, I'm gonna talk about the movement first. The movement, it's pretty smooth I guess? The only complain I could have is that you move out of the way way too much to avoid collision, I have no particular qualms about there not being a jog, it gives you a better feel of the human world of this game I guess, but gameplay wise I can see how people would dislike that. The New Engine is extremely goofy man it affects the combat too. For the open world experience with the engine, literally everything falls over the moment you slightly brush it everything felt way too fragile. Everyone flies around too much and I can't get the feel of caving in their faces in with them literally ascending after I punch them like 4 times the engine and the new ragdoll mechanics do not compliment each other unless you like goofy physics. The Combat was extremely underwhelming with that, all of the attacks felt really weak. The new sounds they use when you hit someone is way too ""tame"" I guess? 

[b] Difficulty [/b]

This game is so easy, when I was fighting one of the last boss: [Spoiler]Ryuji[/spoiler], he had a katana so I thought it would be cool to match him with my own, but all it took was the same rush attacks, and SPAMMED heat actions(I think I used a heat action at least 10 times in that fight), it was ridiculously easy that I was about to be extremely disappointed, but when the real last fight showed up it made up for it sort of. Speaking of the combat, I have a complaint with the new unlocking moves system. It was extremely limited and when I was gonna unlock heat actions, all you would see is coop moves and stuff. It was extremely disappointing when I just first started playing, not only was everyone was flying around in a single hit, now I barely even have any moves to do that? I think this specific entry more emphasizes on the weapons, because I barely even needed to use the infamous tiger drop, it was nerfed to hell so there was no specific reason to even use it. The early game fights were extremely limited and disappointing that I had to google specific things I CAN do just to make myself less bored. But it's all mostly fine when you level up to have more moves and heat actions.

Ultimately, after reminding myself of what this game was, I can safely say that I did enjoy it, It's a little bit of a weird departure from the games surrounding it in terms of the engine, because it plays like the later games whereas Yakuza 0, Kiwami 1, and 3 are much more similar to each other. It feels oddly modern, and it really makes the transition to Yakuza 3 feel kind of odd.

This game is both a gritty gangster sim of brutal violence and grim acceptance of fate- and - a game where your character sings karaoke, fights Yakuza dressed in diapers, and models for a photographer in a banana hammock, Thru the use of exclusively Japanese dialog, the realism of the city areas on the map, and even the cultural quirks of Japan to western eyes- the game is very immersive. Excellent voice acting that largely avoids the more extreme 'anime' type deliveries makes the world feel real enough to forgive the acts of murder you will dole out fully in public. Roaming gangs of bad guys mean that you will essentially achieve serial killer numbers just walking down the block with no one caring a bit. 
There are a large number of mechanics at work but none of it slows the pace of the game. Likewise, there are more novelty and side activities to enjoy that it puts GTA to shame. But none of them take very long or are difficult to complete with a controller. With so many things to do, just wandering the map at walking pace never feels slow and gives the fairly small maps a much bigger presence than sheer square footage. 
The story is deep, involved, and frankly convoluted as is common with Japanese serials. Despite the array of over the top crazy characters involved, the story itself is a familiar tale of the young turks rejecting tradition versus the old school gangsters that hold to a code. 
At times Kiwami 2 is more of an interactive move with long cutscenes where the player has no control, and to my knowledge no way to skip the scene. These can take long enough to go make a sandwich before control is handed back to the player. 
Combat is an absolute joy of senseless violence. Animations look fine at full speed but there are tons of close up and slow motion 'kill cam' moments that push the brutality envelope. Environmental kills also exist with suitably gory results. Side quests are often very brief and easy but can result in an 'ally' that will intervene on your behalf if a fight occurs close enough to them. While on the easy difficulty you can basically button mash thru most of the game, on harder difficulties you will need to bring a bit more skill to the party. However it only feels punishing when some enemies seem to magically block attacks endlessly. These fights drag on as you chip away at the boss then back off while he attacks, rinse and repeat. Weapons are rather limited in uses before they require repair and often I simply rely on fists and overwhelming violence to carry the day. 
The mix of comedy and serious story works well. Left fully to either the story and game would feel plodding or the comedy would wear itself out quickly. Together they balance the experience for the long haul. 
This was my introduction to the series and while it is part of an ongoing series, the story is self-contained enough to stand on it's own. There are constant references (and an entire re-cap movie if you choose) to the earlier games but you don't have to have played them to enjoy this one. 
Recommend just for the sheer depth of story, fun combat, and moments of utter insanity that make the game difficult to classify in any one genre.",1685980678,1685980678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really recommend to play on mid/high end PC if you want to have comparable graphics like PS4.

The story is great, the plot is more heavy, deeper, and well unexpected twist, that makes the Yakuza Kiwami 2 being one of my favorite story in the Yakuza series. 

The gameplay is really much like the other Yakuza, you have 2 Districts free to explore that is Kamurocho and Sotenbori, each have their own places to go, and minigames to play. And In Yakuza Kiwami 2 you can play with 2 Characters with their own Storyline, Kiryu Kazuma in the Main Story, and Goro Majima in Majima Saga.

The overall Experience is great, i hope SEGA will port all of Their Yakuza game in the near time, and maybe SEGA can also bring Judgment into PC since Yakuza Kiwami 2 shares the same engine and has the same town, so i think that will make things easier right??

The story was great except for maybe the last chapter which I thought was pretty stupid, but overall I enjoyed the story very much.  

This game I feel has some of the best sub stories in the franchise, or at least has potentially the best consistency of quality out of any of the games. 

My main concern with this game before buying was if the Combat would be good, and I can safely say no it's not ""good"", but what it is is INCREDIBLY fun. You're not going to be doing intricate Tekken combos like you are in Lost Judgment or landing these 5 person KO slow mo hits like in Yakuza 0, but you will be drop kicking rag doll dudes 40 feet away and swinging fully grown men by their legs like they're toys and it is so much fun. 

I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time.

I had fun playing through it, that much is obvious, but like with Kiwami 1, I'd simply say it's a great game. However, also like with Kiwami 1, I haven't played the original 2, so I have no say on which version is better.

The jump to the Dragon Engine was, needless to say, pretty jarring at first, what with the ragdolling and such, but after some getting used to, I'd say this has the best combat out of the games I've played so far, even if 0 is still the undisputed king of the series IMO.

Truth be told, out of 0, Kiwami 1, and this game, I found this one to be the least frustrating to get 100% on. Guess it helps that Haruka decided to lower her standards for her requests compared to Kiwami 1.

I also enjoyed being able to play as the Mad Dog himself with the Majima Saga, even with how short it was, but I personally preferred it not overstaying its welcome. Just my two cents on it, though.

Yakuza Kiwami 2 runs on the dragon engine previously introduced in yakuza 6 which came out a year before this remake

 (Gameplay)

There is no style switching in this game but there is a mod that lets you do so however even without the styles the combat is still really fun

 (Audio/Soundtrack)

Really great soundtrack but still out shined by some others and the audio is much better in this game most likely because of dragon engine

 (Audience)

Some death and gore

 (PC Requirements)

Kiwami 2 is fairly optimised on decent to high end pc's while still looking amazing (if you want the game to look better without any performance issues there is a mod that completely gets rid of the green filter except for cutscenes)

 (Difficulty)

Can button mash your way to the end but you can learn some other moves that can be hard to pull off and some combos are also quite difficult

 (Grind)

Anything grindable is not needed to beat the game

 (Story)

One of the strongest stories in any rgg game imo now remade in beautiful detail 

 (Game Time)

Around 20 or so hours

 (Price)

Every Yakuza game is worth its price

 (Bugs)

saw like maybe the occasional bug that wasn't annoying or gamebreaking

Pretty much all around it's a really good sequel.
The pacing of the story is almost too fast, not in that it's short (it's definitely not), but in that it usually wouldn't make sense for Kiryu to be doing anything but continuing the plot. I think it actually does that for more of the runtime than Yakuza 0 does.
It's a fantastic game, sequel, and entry in this series.

Yakuza KIWAMI 2 still has all these things, except the actual GAME part is HORRIFIC (in comparison to Yakuza 2).
I'm not a big fan of Kiwami 1 either, but in that case there is WAY more reason to play that one over the original. The first game had a forced English dub on PS2 when localized. The gameplay was pretty stiff. Majima wasn't everywhere (I actually prefer that, but whatever). So, as annoying and occasionally rushed as Kiwami is for me, I completely understand why people would play it over the original, and I can recommend it.

Kiwami 2 is not a game I can recommend over the original. The gameplay is decently fast, but it's an unforgiving chore. Not in that it's super difficult to win fights. More in that it wastes your time constantly. The only way to feel like you're having fun on a consistent basis is by picking up every weapon you see, which admittedly is something I wish I could do in the other games sometimes. The physics of the Dragon Engine are obnoxious and remove most of the weight from the combat. I have this same complaint in Judgment and Like a Dragon as well, but it's way less upsetting in those games. In this (and Yakuza 6 as well, I assume), taking out an enemy in brutal fashion feels a lot less satisfying than it should because their model bounces and floats around like a balloon. It's funny out of context, but for a whole game it just gets old. Kiryu also flies around like a balloon a lot, and that's really annoying as well. The newer Dragon Engine games keep these physics, but they're toned down a bit. Most of the ridiculous stuff happens with environments rather than characters themselves now. More importantly though, the gameplay just isn't very fun in this game compared to many of the others. I would say this and Yakuza 6 probably have the least enjoyable combat in the series, and since that's the main gameplay, it's just a chore as a result.

Performance-wise, it's a very demanding game, to the point where it's now the ONLY Yakuza game on modern consoles that you can't run at 60fps under any circumstances. My laptop (9th gen i7 and GTX 1650 with 16GB RAM) could barely run the thing over 30fps at very low settings in 720p. My current rig (i7-12700k, RX 6650 XT, 32GB DDR5) also struggles with the game at 4k, but admittedly conquers it at 1080p. I don't have any other Dragon Engine games on PC, so I can't really compare against them at the moment. My biggest technical complaints are that you can't remove the green tint over everything, and that ONLY ONE SETTING in the ENTIRE MENU changes the frame-rate at all (Render Scale). Not even V-Sync or Anti-Aliasing changes anything. It's all about render scale or just resolution. Very odd way to optimize a game in my opinion.

I could also go into a lot of other stuff like Kiryu not having a jog, the AWFUL upgrade system, the weird hunger stuff, licensing issues with music, etc.

It's not like it's a horrible game overall. There's good stuff in there. In fact, I'd even say it's a pretty good game. It's just that most of the good is from the original, which I would argue has some of the best gameplay in the series.

So, I can't really recommend you play this game, at least, not over the original.",1683015403,1683015403,False,4,0,0.565700232982635498,1,True,False,False

In this game, Kiryu Kazuma takes an early retirement as Tojo Clan Chairman, in the hopes that he can finally have a normal life after being a yakuza has taken so much from him. Unfortunately, he'll get sucked back into the yakuza life, as the Omi Alliance and other major clans from China and Korea threaten to absorb the Tojo Clan entirely into their fold. Additionally, a new Dragon rises to the fight, as Ryuji Goda challenges Kiryu to find out who will be the one and only Dragon of Dojima.

Yakuza Kiwami 2 may be a contender for my favorite Yakuza game so far in the series. The game took so many improvements from 0 and Kiwami 1 and made a truly stellar Yakuza experience out of it. While your fighting styles have been reduced from four to one, the one being the Dragon of Dojima style, combat has never felt better. Your punches and kicks feel like they carry so much explosive impact with them and despite having no styles with unique actions you still retain a lot of those actions, which are now just usable at all times, such as Rush's Quickstep or Beast's lethality with various bicycles. The story is just as exciting as previous entries, with plenty of intense action and serious yakuza tension piled on top of your regular dose of goofy as heck side missions. The boss fights (most of them, I fucking *hate* Man in Black) are super fun to play and yet again show how Yakuza games know how to do quicktime events right. Kiwami 2 feels like such a great example of all the things a Yakuza game can be.

In terms of downsides, there aren't a tremendous amount. There are some framerate issues on some of the minigames, most notably karaoke. In karaoke, the framerate of the lyrics doesn't match the words which doesn't match the background which doesn't match the notes, which makes playing it a headache, which SUCKS because there are some banger songs in this game. The XP and skill system in this game is a little cumbersome to navigate through. XP is separated into categories that aren't the most intuitive as to what you need to do to gain XP in a specific category, and gaining XP from meals is gated behind a hunger gauge that incentivizes eating healthier or more expensive food, but often just means eating food can lead to wasted money sometimes. 

Minor gripes aside, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a stellar Yakuza game that fans of Yakuza 0 and Kiwami will absolutely adore. I cannot recommend this game enough to those who enjoyed the previous entries, a 9/10 entry in the series for me.",1682761976,1682761976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In terms of gameplay, Yakuza Kiwami 2 offers a mix of open-world exploration, side missions, and fast-paced combat. The combat system is fluid and engaging, with a wide variety of fighting styles and special moves to master, but it's a shame that in this series they turned the concept into one fighting style. The game also features several minigames and side activities, including hostess clubs, karaoke, and arcade games, which provide a nice change of pace from the main storyline.

One of the standout features of Yakuza Kiwami 2 is its stunning graphics and attention to detail. The game's environments are beautifully rendered, and the character models are incredibly detailed and lifelike. The soundtrack is also excellent, with a mix of upbeat and emotional tracks that enhance the game's atmosphere.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to the game. One of the main issues is that the game can feel a bit repetitive at times, especially during the side missions and minigames. Some players may also find the characters expression a little bit off in some scenes.

Overall, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is an excellent game that offers a great mix of action, story, and gameplay. While it has a few minor flaws, the game's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, making it a must-play for anyone who enjoys action-adventure games. If you're a fan of the series or just looking for a great game to play, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is definitely worth checking out.",1682441607,1682442222,True,0,0,0.488215476274490356,0,True,False,False

The story follows Kazuma Kiryu as he tries to live his life outside of the Yakuza, as expected this does not go well for him as he is thrust back in the seriousness/wackiness of that world. You follow Kiryu as he tries to prevent a war from upheaving his life.

Combat: The combat in the game is closer to the play-style of Yakuza 6 Song of Life then it is to Yakuza 0 or Kiwami 1. This being the case makes more sense since they were make on the same engine and honestly this was a bit pleasing to me in the end because of the changes to the combat and the upgrading system for the game. Upgrading your skills in this game are more enjoyable to me at least from the previous games, Kiwami 1 being experience gain from battles in the world and from missions. Yakuza 0 upgrade system being the use of the massive amount of yen that you will acquire in your gameplay. Yakuza Kiwami 2 goes off the system of experience as well but specific types of it that you get from eating different foods around the worlds along with combat, some of these upgrades can give you boosts on your dodging or devastating skills that kill enemies instantly.

Minigames: Like many games in the franchise you can play a menagerie of different minigames spanning from Karaoke, full arcade cabinets from Sega's past, several different types of gambling(all in-game money, so not outside funds can be used for it.). But my favorite had to the Caberet Club and the Construction minigame. In the end there will be at least one minigame that you will really like as I found the ones that I really liked.

Combat: Combat is your standard beat em up for the most part, the fun part with it comes with upgrades that you get through the game. Like a lot of the games it is just fun with the combat though, through the use of weapons that you can just pick up in action or the fact that engine for the game is just wacky fun with the rag doll physics. Of you course you cannot talk about a Yakuza game without the heat actions, which I can say or enjoyable and painful to sometimes watch.

Sound and Music: Sound design for the game is top notch from just walking around the cities to the sounds of combat with the local ruffians of the cities you explore. All of this being complimented by the amazing soundtrack made for the game with most of the music fitting where it has been placed in the game.

Visuals/bugs: The game looks amazing right off the bat when you start the game, from the specks of water droplets on the character's skin to the lights reflecting off the water of rivers. Thanks to the Dragon Engine this is possible for the game. In the time that I spent playing the game I came across one instant where my game had crashed after a long gaming session, but it never happened after that one time so I do not think it was a fault of the game at all.

Overall: I enjoyed the game from start to finish, the story keeping me intrigued and dedicated throughout it's run, In the end I would recommend the game to anyone that wants to play the game for themselves or have people that want to play the game.",1682101950,1682101950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's insane how consistently high quality RGG's storytelling is.  Kiwami 2 experiments a bit by having a much bigger emphasis on weapons rather than hand to hand combat compared to its predecessor, and it's a big step up in that the enemies have far more varied movesets.

I loved the story, but I hated the combat.

Like, they had the Prequel + Kiwami 1 combat nailed down perfectly, yet somehow fucked it all up and made enemies be like Dark Souls bosses - enemies who block your attack give you a small setback so they can thrash their damage onto you. You can almost never do a full-combo because after 2 button smashes they'll start their non-interruptable attacks and just fuck you over and over. So it means you have to hit two-three times, block (or if the enemy has a bladed weapon / gun evade... like forever, since bladed weapons have quite a reach). On top of it, enemies are nothing but bulletsponges that add nothing of value.

So why do I recommend it? Because it's just my opinion of the combat, and installing some mods from nexusmods helped with most of my issues, tho dogshit AI behaviour not. Install 'Style Switching"" (adds the styles from Kiwami 1), ""no player hit bounce"" and if you want ""yakuza kiwami licensed music restoration"" as it adds the original japanese music (which is dope).

But overall I gotta say Yakuza Kiwami 2 ranks the lowest due to the dogshit experience with combat, and Yakuza was always for me about combat first, story second and hilarious minigames third. Tho the minigames in Kiwami 2 were quite inflated.

And only play Majima story mode after you're done with the main story, I just think Majima story does give some secrets subtly away that might be better if you experienced it out of the blue in the main story.",1681146319,1681146319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, it's extremely easy. An easy mode game for easy mode normies and game journalists. The majority of enemies are not difficult to fight, especially once you level up. It's just a grind to beat some of them, that's all. Compared to earlier games, it's much easier to achieve a high completion percentage. That's partially because there aren't that many activities to do, which is a shame.

Secondly, the story is incredibly inconsistent in its quality. Sometimes it's quite cool, at other points it's resident sleeper. Starts off really strong, then it slows down and picks up again, with various unrelated plot points thrown around. A lot of generic characters in this game, like the men in black. The main antagonists, the Koreans were ridiculously underdeveloped. The coolest character, Ryuji Goda is underused to a criminal extent, with too much focus in this game's story being on a few characters. Most of whom are not interesting! This story is super generic and doesn't make a lot of sense. That's all I can say without spoiling the details. [spoiler] FUCK THE ENDING, RETARDS ARGUING ABOUT NOTHING WHILE THE BOMB GOES OFF, PREPARED TO DIE OVER PETTY MACHISMO BULLSHIT. MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL!  [/spoiler]

Now for the good parts (and their drawbacks).

The side content is good, but kinda limited. The substories are decent, but most aren't memorable. The mini-games are fun. Virtua Fighter 2 is playable, which is awesome and kinda frustrating. Harder than all of Kiwami 2. Majima's construction is a breath of fresh air. Interesting story and the gameplay itself is awesome. It's quite tactical and interactive. The best part of it is that the characters you can hire are from substories and the coliseum, which encourages you to play the rest of the game. The cabaret club is fun, but I prefer 0's version. The best mini game is for us men of culture, if you know, you know. Komaki's training is awesome, being on the receiving end of Tiger Drop is funny. The coliseum is easy mode but fun, though I don't know what's with the annoying tigers and lions. An out of nowhere inclusion.

The soundtrack is awesome and really gives each area its own atmosphere. Outlaws' Lullaby is a classic among classics! The boss themes are epic, even though most of the bosses themselves aren't. Those being: Bad Fortune, Not Bad, Break Off, Ceiling of Needles, The Omerta, A Scattered Eternal Moment, Update With Gunfire. Being able to enter and exit many interiors without loading screens is great, and so is gaining access to rooftops. Combined with being able to run around in first person, this makes the game probably the most immersive in the series. The graphics are incredible, everything looks beri beri priti.

Well, it's been a lot of fun playing this game. It was the first time I played with a Dragon engine and it was the best, it improved the gameplay, visuals, animation, etc. I liked it so much! The sub-story is wacky and fun, as are the mini-games (Majima Construction & Cabaret Club Grand Prix).

In terms of story, Yakuza Kiwami 2's plot is definitely a step up from the first Yakuza Kiwami, but it still falls short of Yakuza 0's masterpiece. There's still a lack of character building for Ryuji Goda and Go-Ryu's march was a joke, which makes the lack of threat tension for the story, but at least the final fight with Ryuji was epic.

Coming from Yakuza 0, this game just should not exist. It's the exact same feeling I got moving from GTA 5 to RDR2. Like that transition, it all feels so familiar yet different, fresh and interesting. It sucks that I have to put this down as I finish Kiwami 1 first.

edit: 0, Kiwami 1 and now Kiwami 2 are done. Gameplay-wise, Kiwami 2 has got to be my favorite Yakuza game, if we're not considering any of the spinoffs. Story-wise, I actually like it a lot in terms of its plot. The premise is interesting and the characters who play a big role in the story are very solid and likeable. In my opinion, the story would actually hold a candle to Yakuza 0, but the thing is, and this was a problem for Kiwami 1, Kiwami 2's story is underscored by really cheesy 2000s writing.

A legendary dragon recommended this game series for me, so i bought it, even when it really isn't my usual cup of tea. This was my third Yakuza game so far.

The story is about learning to live with your past, letting go of things and gaining new things in life.

The game is a significant sift from the past games in its combat system and style. At first i absolutely hated the change, but as kept on playing i learned the mechanics and how to abuse them. Though i still don't like the new combat style compared to the old dragon style.

The games has many emotional moments and the ending had me crying.

Majima saga was quite the let down, as was the clan creator and the fights against Amon. On the harder difficulties the game pretty much demands you to start abusing the combat system, though the game still felt easier than kiwami 1 on legendary difficulties as a whole.

I recommend you get the Illegal Poison Kodachi from Kamiyama Works.

Spoiler free until stated otherwise.

Combat mechanics are one of the best in the series and I'm glad they got rid of the rush style because it was simply just OP (from what I've played (up to Y4), the mechanics are THE best ), graphics are really pretty, minigames are good, sidequests are fun. 

The story is interesting and the characters are very good, deep and likable. My only complaint is the bossfights. the process of beating them is decent, but they fall flat. I don't really know why, but I rarely got satisfaction from completing them. 

The soundtrack is amazing, I really enjoyed listening to it and this game has some great karaoke songs (don't they all, haha). The character designs are memorable, they have distinct personalities, motivations and they aren't perfect. I fell in love with so many of them. I really like how nothing is as black and white as it seems.

[b] MILD SPOILERS AHEAD [b]
[spoiler] One thing I found a bit odd was the sheer amount of plot twists in this game. If I had to speed run this game and take a shot every time there was one, I'd be too drunk to finish the final fight. Also, this game has a very frustrating enemy (imo, I might just be bad). He has blades attached to his boots, attacks fast and is quite powerful, so always save at least one good weapon for that encounter, he appears multiple times across the story.

Began with the Yakuza 0, followed by the Yakuza Kiwami 1. Both those games were great especially Yakuza 0 mostly because of the high-quality cinematics, that for me are the most important part of the story. 
When I thought it couldn't be any better, the Yakuza Kiwami 2 surprised me. 
Yakuza Kiwami 2 was made as a remake of the Yakuza 2 game on the new Dragon Engine, enhancing the gaming experience for this game. Not only in the cut scenes but overall the Kamurocho and Sotenbori look amazing in Dragon Engine, however, it may be a little demanding on the GPU.
So for the graphic processing, I would give this game 10/10 because it is for me so far the best-looking game in the Yakuza series.
The story is great and it fits with the previous games, but it may feel a little bit too complicated with so many unnecessary twists, but I guess that is just how the original Yakuza 2 was made, so it can't be improved much. 
This game for me was somehow special. I enjoyed the story, the graphics, the fighting system, and the upgrading system, and all of the minigames and substories were well-made thanks to the Dragon Engine that moves this game to a completely new level compared to the previous games. Plan to complete all of the side content for this one. 

Overall I would rate this game 9/10 and I wonder if there will be a better Yakuza game than this one. 
This one is in my opinion worth buying not just in bundles and during a sale but it is definitely worth the full price.",1677245020,1677245020,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Like a lot of other fellow players, the biggest gripe for me was the messy main story plot, it just doesn't age well. Everything was all over the place.

[b]Yakuza Kiwami 2[/b] is a REMAKE of the [b]second[/b] game in the series, originally on PS2 (in the same way that YK1 is a remake of the first PS2 game).
I started the series with [i]Zero[/i], and have been playing them in order since (0-K1-K2 so far, waiting for a Kiwami 3 for the time being because I am [i]not[/i] suffering through Yakuza 3)

[i]Yakuza Kiwami 1 is an absolute fucking travesty to the series taking a game that already wasn't all that good and then adding every possible feature and mechanic designed to frustrate you and waste your time to the nth degree. And its story still blows despite their flimsy band-aid attempts at fixing it.[/i]

[b]You have no idea how HAPPY I am that I can't say the same for this one though.[/b]



Being made on Yakuza 6's Dragon Engine (instead of the Kiwami engine used by 0,5 and K1) you can [i]immediately[/i] tell the difference, if you're playing them in order like I am. This game is genuinely [b]gorgeous[/b], and is programmed in such a way that there are (almost) no loading screens in the game; actively exploring the city, areas and the inside of buildings will seamlessly load in with no transition. The entire areas of Kamurocho and Sotenbori are a BLAST to explore and just walk around to bask in the environment, and it helps that there's a very generous amount of collectibles to gather and general things to do, as is series tradition by now.

...I will say though, that comes with the unfortunate side effect of this PC port specifically having some shit-ass optimization issues, and a couple of things that break on the transition from console-ridden-30FPS to 60 and beyond.
Funnily enough the biggest issue, the microstuttering, is caused by a single section of code.
Either way all of that can be fixed by installing the fanmade [b]Yakuza Kiwami 2 SilentPatch[/b] (that's what it's called), which reimplements those things in a less headass way and adjusts the framerate automatically on the fly for the few minigames and things that would otherwise break on higher ones.
[strike]You really shouldn't HAVE to get a fan patch to fix the goddamn game in the first place but it's still nice that you can pretty much fix all the issues the port has with little effort[/strike]



Anyway onto the other things.
The story, while you can still tell it's a bit old, is a MASSIVE INSANE improvement over the weird bullshit the first game's story was, with its 50% filler, asspulls, deus ex machinas and terrible Hollywood-ass villain of the week that pops out of nowhere and kills what was already a kind of mediocre plot.

This time it deals with the topic of foreign mafias (and not just the pathetic Snake Flower Triad, I mean an actual-ass Korean mafia), their association with a rival local clan, a multi-generational clan-wide grudge, an entire borderline mutiny that's going to screw over an attempted alliance with said local clan, and the absolutely [i]dire[/i] consequences for both clans that come from that.
The stakes are really high this time around, you [i]see[/i] things actually going down.
Also 2 introduces Daigo who [i]immediately[/I] became one of my favorite characters by a good margin... He's so level-headed compared to a lot of other characters around him.
[spoiler]I LOVE that Daigo notices the dumbass protagonists just left a perfectly usable gun next to the villain they just non-lethally beat up, and instead of just standing there and letting an important character die because of it (like in YAKUZA 1!!!!!!!!!!), he just ACTUALLY jumps in and shoots the guy himself, it's goddamn INSANE that nobody else had bothered doing that until now.[/spoiler]
Granted, Date is still the useless drag that he was in 1, and only holds everyone else back, but that's what comes with being a character from 1. Haruka is also unfortunately still present, but she plays a much lesser role here, being instead replaced by Sayama, a policewoman who tags along with you semi-early on and can actually mostly fend for herself for a change.

That said. As much as I appreciate most of this game's story.
[spoiler]THE ENDING BLOWS BALLS LMAO
HE REALLY JUST SENDS SAYAMA DOWN A CARGO ELEVATOR FROM THE TOP OF THE BUILDING THEY'RE IN SO HE CAN BEAT UP GODA NEXT TO A TICKING BOMB THAT'S GOING TO BLOW THE WHOLE THING TO KINGDOM COME
THEY FINISH FIGHTING
AND SAYAMA NOT ONLY CAME UP THROUGH THE STAIRS INSTEAD OF TAKING THE ELEVATOR BACK UP
BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING THE ELEVATOR BACK TO THEM TO GET OUT SAFELY BEFORE THE BOMB BLOWS, AND HOPEFULLY TAKE GODA TO THE HOSPITAL, KNOWING HE WASN'T ACTIVELY EVIL AND KNOWING HE WAS HER BELOVED BROTHER SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM AS A BABY
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO?
THEY JUST SIT THERE, WITH THEIR FRIENDS ON A HELICOPTER UNABLE TO GET CLOSE TELLING THEM TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE
AND THEY KISS
THEY HAVE A HOLLYWOOD KISS NEXT TO THE BOMB THAT'S GOING TO KILL THEM AND LET GODA BLEED OUT IN FRONT OF THEM
SHE'S KISSING A GUY NEXT TO HER BROTHER'S WARM CORPSE
IT'S SO FUCKING STUPID AND IT LETS GODA DIE WHEN HE WAS THE [I]ONE[/I] CHARACTER THAT COULD'VE BEEN COOL TO KEEP AROUND FOR FUTURE GAMES

AND THE BOMB DOESN'T EVEN GO OFF BECAUSE OF SOME CONVOLUTED SERIES OF DUMB PLOT TWISTS SO THAT WHOLE SCENE IS FOR NOTHING
IT'S SO STUPID, IT SINGLEHANDEDLY KILLS A STORY THAT I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY LIKING EVERY PART OF UNTIL THAT POINT[/spoiler]

...That stuff aside, the rest of of it, right?
The music, the cutscenes, the overall mood and atmosphere of the game.
It's good, it's just good, it's REALLY good in fact, I can't really hold anything against it. It's just a bit of a shame the story ends like that.



The Dragon Engine makes combat [i]ridiculously[/i] fun to play around with, especially with the sheer amount of things you can upgrade and unlock to beef up your moveset. And I don't mean just stat boosts and Heat Actions (i.e. glorified cutscenes that deal damage), I mean extra moves, charged attacks which are genuinely really fun to play around with and melt enemy guards like butter, running variants of your attacks, entire COUNTER-type moves that put the Tiger Drop to shame and let you absolutely destroy people.
Of course, the ragdoll physics are just a nice cherry on top, it makes dropkicking a guy and sending him flying across the street THAT much funnier.

[i]Some people have said that the physics ""make the combat less realistic so it's bad"" but honestly
[b]shut up LMAO this is the same game where a guy punches a tiger head-on and knocks it out instantly, i'll take a more FUN game over a more realistic one that I can get a pointless ""grown-up gamer"" ego boost from playing or whatever[/b][/i]

My only real gripe with the combat system is that having your attacks blocked by an enemy briefly ""stuns"" you based on the strength of the attack you were performing.
But even then you can circumvent that by just using a charged attack to dropkick their figurative and literal ass and break their guard, THEN you can beat them up to your heart's content. It's just fun.

Got a lot of side content for that too in the bouncer missions; it's like they wanted to still HAVE ""climax battles"" but actually letting you access your inventory/gear/weapons so they moved that into the game/savefile itself and you do them from there.
It's only [i]slightly[/i] annoying in the way it has 3 difficulties for every mission so you're expected to play them all thrice by extension.




[b]TLDR:[/b] Good game, VERY good game. Get it on a sale, and for the love of GOD don't spend money on the stupid DLC that literally just gives you overpowered weapons and minigame advantages.
But definitely get it, and play it.
Just remember to download the fanmade SilentPatch to fix the odd issues this port has.

+Pros:
+ Graphic was improved or should i say a good remake.
+ The story is so good
+ 2 big minigames with separate story. I prefer cabaret club, every girls so beautiful and cute in their way. Also we can have a date with all of them.
+ Music is good. My favorite is Demon Tigers, Cabaret Club OST and Final boss OST.
+ Minigame completion is pretty easy with me. Thank god it's not require acquire all weapons/gears.
+ Combat is ok with me.
+ Gravure Photo Shoot minigames better play when you're alone, don't play when your family around lol

- Cons :
- Ragdoll physics sometime is weird.
- Lack many minigames like Cee-lo, Cho han, Billard, Bowling, Roullete, Baccarat,...
- Graphic : Depth of Field looks so bad, it makes character's face look blurry.

The combat felt like pain, with so much forcing to use heat and weapons, while making you eat a mega-load to have any hope of getting skills you might actually want, while also littering the hell out of your exp pages with optional skills that are really stupid. Also, you have a phone that OFTEN buzzes at an obnoxious volume!

The graphics and interaction had some big upgrades, but most of the time I played this game I just wanted the story to be over ASAP. Big let down from how I felt about Kiwami 1.

The visuals are the most notable improvement in this game, running on the engine that was first introduced in Yakuza 6. Kamurocho and Sotenbori both look great and the character models are noticeably better too. Perhaps the best part about the new engine is that there are far less loading screens in the open world; you can enter and exist most buildings seamlessly and the random fights initiate much faster too. In addition to this, the interactivity with the city during the fights is greatly improved, allowing you to throw opponents through shop windows and knock items flying off shelves in the convenience stores (among other things).

The main story is also good, though not quite on par with the excellent story that Yakuza 0 had. Though as this is a remake of the second game, it can't really be held against the team who made Kiwami 2.

The minigames are what truly make this game one of the best in the series however. All of the classic minigames like Karaoke, Mahjong and the Sega arcade make a return and are as good as ever and the cabaret club and construction company games are excellent for the most part.

I haven't talked about the fighting system at all in this review, and that's because its not much different to how it was in the previous games, bar the removal of multiple fighting stances. It also isn't the main reason why I play these games. All I'll say is that if you liked the fighting in Kiwami or 0, you'll probably enjoy this too.

Overall, Kiwami 2 is an excellent sequel and well worth playing for anyone who enjoys this series.",1675449456,1675449618,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I was annoyed to see that the fighting styles had all been merged into one, and things only went downhill from there. My complaints are mostly about the story, which I won't spoil. All I'll say is that people that should die don't, people who don't die should, people who are evil are good, and people who are good are evil, and all the characters actually know each other from like 20 years back. Majima is exempt from this, because he is all that is good in the world. I eventually got so fed up with the story by the final boss fight that I pulled out the 12 something crowbars I gathered from around the game and invented Gordon Freeman style to finish the big bad off. I was so overleveled that it only took 3.

Overall, not unplayable, but I wish there was more freedom to go between Kamurocho and Sotenbori to finish side stories and the like. The movement and fighting itself is smooth (I like the fact that just going through town can seamlessly transition to fighting and then back to going through town) aside from the fact that Kiryu can disintegrate anything that he decides to walk through, over, or beside. The adding of a sprint meter was kind of confusing. I wish they just outright told you how much sprint you have instead of leaving you to guess.

I wouldn't recommend this as your first Yakuza game, but it's not awful, and can be fun and silly.

Gameplay: To talk about the gameplay of any of the game on this series is to talk about a lot of different things. The main loop involves walking around a district of Japan, usually Kamurocho, and finding things to do. In-between said things, you might stumble on some people who are looking for a fight.
	
	Fighting: The fighting in this game is more simplified than the other games on this series, like Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1, having no style switching, but it is still fun. The main combat attacks consist of pressing Light Attack to chain moves and Heavy Attack to end the combo altogether, like those Dragonball Budokai Tenkaichi games. Light -> Heavy is one thing, while Light -> Light -> Heavy is another. You can also hold the buttons of each attack to charge an different move. But the big thing on any Yakuza game are the Heat Attacks. Below your Health, there is a Heat gauge, which fills as you land hits and depletes as you take them. This back and forth encourages the player to be very careful on their moves. Having enough, you can unleash an Heat Attack, which are contextual moves that deal a lot of damage. Being near an enemy alone can trigger one Heat Attack, while having them attacking you and pressing the button before they make contact is another. The sheer variety of those attack are so cool and makes the game very enterteining. After winning a bout, you get 5 different types of XP, which are used to purchase new abilities, from being able to do new heat attacks, to beat able to run for more time. Each type of XP is associated with different aspects of Kiryu, and you can get more of one when doing specific things. Each skill requires a certain number of points from each type to be purchased, or just a lot of one type, and so forth. The funny thing, a great way to get those points is to eat.
	
When not fighting, there are a ton of minigames. From karaoke, to golfing, to mahjong, or shogi, the fact that there are so many things to do makes the game very hard to categorize. Yes, combat it what you do the most, but some of the best things about this game is being able to feel how lively Kamurocho, and Sotenbori in this case, are. Besides those, there are main story missions, and substories missions. Which mostly consists of watching cutscenes, running somewhere, or fighting. The story itself is interesting enough that you are motived to keep going, with amazing characters, specially the protagonist, Kiryu. Substories are more up in the air about what they will ask to do, but they usually are the main source of fun of the game, and some of its most memorable parts. Either emotional or laugh out loud funny, you will enjoy yourself.

Another important thing is the hunger system. When hungry, you can visit a restaurant and eat the food they serve. Doing so will give you Health, and more importantly XP depeding on the dish, and eating the entire menu of a restaurant will give you a little bit more, as well as eating specific combinations of food. However, eating when not hungry will just refill your health. You will need to wait for Kiryu to get hungry again to get XP.

Story:

	Kiwami 2's story takes place about a year after the events of the first Kiwami game, which is just the first game in the series remastered. It is an interesting crime drama about a conspiracy to start a major war between two yakuza clans. While Yakuza 0's story still is, to me at least, the beast, this one is also good, having great characters who are well utilized and great moments.

Visuals and Sounds:

	The fabled Dragon Engine used for Yakuza 6 is used here too, and it looks very beautiful. While facial expressions are serviceable to today's standards, the models and lighting looks very good. I remember playing it for the first time fresh out of Kiwami 1 and being blown away by the amount of detail that Kamurocho had to offer now. The district itself is a character in those games, and seeing this beautiful is very fulfilling.
	
	Sound design is also good. See, I've never payed active atenttion to sound design, but I plan to change that in future reviews. But suffice to say that every sound is exactly what you spec on a game this beautiful.
	
	The mixture of both these elements lends itself perfect to of the games best aspects, the action. Every impact has a satisfying feel, both in game and cutscenes. And when a punch has no effect on a cutscenes, it's on purpose and really, really funny.

Graphics:
About the same as Yakuza Kiwami, but everything is reflective now? I'm not exactly sure why.

Storyline:
Still really good overall, but very predictable. Every plot twist can be seen a mile away. Some parts were very odd though... like the age gap between the 2 lovers in the story.
I really hate the changes they made to the substories. Substories now become available at like 2 points in the game, meaning if you clear all the available ones at those points you won't have any more to look forwards to.

Price:
Get it on sale. Please don't pay full price.

Difficulty:
It's as hard as you make it (your choices effect the difficulty).

AI:
Not brilliant, but not dumb

Cutscenes:
Largely downgraded from Yakuza Kiwami. Many are back to the text-based ones of Yakuza 0 and the ones present have a noticeable lack of quality. Characters will teleport from position to position, breaking immersion.

Fun:
Exploring the world and seeing everything new added was a blast! Kamurocho is almost exactly the same as in the previous game, but Sotenbori is back with a near complete remaster!
Combat has been heavily downgraded. All movesets are combined into one in a very clunky and awkward system. Majima is still not a playable character (even less important to the story now), meaning his amazing moves are still missing.
The new physics engine really makes the game annoying. Certain moves can only be performed when enemies are in certain states - but it's a gamble whether they'll just teleport to their feet or fall in a position which makes it impossible to interact with them. It really makes the game more annoying.
Bonding with Haruka is just atrocious. I don't want to have to play the miserable Sega arcade games or ace every Karaoke song to progress the story. Just... why?

Sounds/Music:
Not bad, not good. Very strange audio mixing, especially in cutscenes. Sounds will start, last for a second, and stop. It's strange.

Replayability:
Imagine a 30 hour movie... would you want to rewatch it over and over?

Controls:
Use a controller. Do not try to use a keyboard, it will not end well for you. Feels great on controllers though.

Performance:
The new Dragon Engine gobbles up system resources. I had to lower the game setting to Medium to get it to run at a solid 60 fps (PC: i7-7700, 16GB ram, GTX 1060 6GB).

Modding:
None

Selling Out:
There is now a DLC which makes the Clan Creator business extremely easy. It's essentially Sega selling pay to win items in a singleplayer game.

Similar Games:
- Any other Yakuza game.
- Combat feels like arcade brawlers, like Mortal Combat.

Bugs:
- Audio cuts in and out
- Physics is just unreliable",1673809519,1673809519,False,1,0,0.493421077728271484,0,True,False,False

---( Fighting )---

🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 5

Kiwami 2 uses the Dragon Engine and because of this the fighting is superb. You can throw people into props and through windows. Enemies ragdoll and sometimes they flop around unrealistically but that is not a problem in my book. Moves and skills felt more balanced than other games. Kiryu only has one fighting style which I think was a great choice because that makes it simple. I also preferred Kiwami 2's skill system to the ones found in previous games. 

---( Story )---

🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 5

I really enjoyed uncovering the story of Sayama and seeing the return of our friends Majima, Date, and Haruka. The introduction of an adult Daigo was great too. The antagonists aside from Ryuji didn't feel too fleshed out but nonetheless I genuinely enjoyed progressing through the main story. 

---( Substories )---

🟩🟩🟩🟩⬛ 4

Definitely has some Yakuza defining substories along with a mostly average body of missions and a few meh ones (not a big fan of the 3 substory chain that has you beating up a guy over and over until he joins Majima Construction). I found myself completing the most substories in this game than previous ones. These missions felt great to fall back on while taking a break from the main story. 

---( Minigames )---

🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 5

The return of Cabaret Club was really enjoyable, It actually motivated me to finish the entire story line. Clan Creator was also really good because it was different and collecting characters for it through sub stories was enjoyable. There's also some new mini-games in the arcade and elsewhere and multiple gambling locations. Also you can take selfies, I think this is the best pillar to mention that so yes.  

---( Majima? )---

☑️ YES 🔳 NO

Probably contains the largest amassment of memorable Majima scenes in the whole franchise. The Majima Saga was kind of mid but you get to fight DIO and the ending gives us a lot of closure which I liked. 

Total Aggregate Score: 4.80/5.00... ""Majima Kensetsu... Shaka!""

As a whole, I think Kiwami 2 did a good job changing up the formula of 0 and 1, but has its own share of rough patches not present in either. The combat and progression systems are heavily revamped in a way that keeps things fresh for people who just played the previous two titles, and the minigames are overall pretty solid. The story is stronger than K1's story but still frequently feels like Kiryu lacks agency. Also, the casting of yet another foreign (to japan) ethnic mob as a villain faction plus the inability to get a coherent message across regarding the role of the police in the criminal underworld reminds me of K1's story in a bad way. 


Overall, you can see that an effort was made to keep things interesting, and to make side content that wasn't a complete chore. But this is at the expense of the main story's quality, and there's a lot of polish missing compared to 0 and K1 (like how almost no side content is voice-acted). But it's more Kiryu, so if you're coming off the previous games and want to find out how the funny yakuza man continues to suffer then you'll get your fix.",1672567746,1672567746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Plus, it goes on pretty cheap during sales! It has flaws, both in of itself and in artistic choices, mainly due to the latest engine being different in parts from the old PS2 and PS3 engines. It also started to peek its head into predatory DLCs with the minigame focused ones that add characters to an otherwise fairly simple and fun (in a grindy way) minigame, all to lure people that like throwing money at every DLC on the store. 

Of note, you should have a controller for the complete experience, trying to play on the keyboard isn't just heavily disadvised, I am pretty sure the devs make it clear that they never gave it a thought. Hell, the first thing you see is a warning telling you that ""real Yakuza use a gamepad"". Also of note, it's a direct continuation of Yakuza Kiwami 1, not to mention the amazing prequel Yakuza 0. So you should probably start with those, but the combat system is based on the original Yakuza 2, so no rush, brawler or beast styles. I say you wait and buy those three during Steam's themed sales, when you get cards and stuff, while also checking on SteamDB to see if the price really is at its lowest historically. 

Believe me, this trilogy from 0 to Kiwami 2 is like a holy trilogy, which introduced PC players to the series, breathing new life into it and making SEGA start remastering, remaking and releasing games on the West. Even previously unreleased titles, like the legendary Ishin which is being remade and going to release soon, not to mention the older rough ones like Yakuza 3 to 5. If you like brawlers this is a great game, even if you suck at it you can usually just focus on other stuff and use the myriad of items to cheat your way out of even the toughest fights on the highest difficulty.

If you're playing chronologically by timeline, the combat will absolutely shock you negatively. You go from Y0 and K1 into a new engine where styles are no longer a thing. One quickstep to start, as opposed to rush's forgiving quicksteps.

I also found it a bit harder to run at 144, but eh that's alright.

There is a lot to do here, with the same amount of substories give or take as K1. More content than K1 for sure. Won't go indepth, but if you enjoyed Y0's business stuff, you'll like what's in this game.

Soundtrack's just as good as usual, characters are lovable as usual, and exploration got a big upgrade with the dragon engine. Eventually, I enjoyed combat but only when I got a lot of upgrades. 

Pretty good! If combat didn't feel streamlined/more janky in comparison for the majority of the game, then I'd probably like this = to K1 without a doubt. Depending on my mood I like it just as much though.

10/10 as good as Yakuza 0
Where Yakuza 0 were better in some aspects, this game shines in others. Can't recommend it enough, I'll update my review after I Finish this game. As of now, i'm still only at chapter 6 :3


Updated Review 16 hours later, after beating the game.

I can confidently say, just frickin buy this game full price man. Last time I felt so emotionally messed up from a game was after completing Yakuza 0 some time ago. Man these games, this series. I'm way too hyped to play the next installment of the series.

Story only kept getting better and man... I wanna say too much, but I'm afraid I won't be able to contain the spoilers, just know that this game, atleast for me, is same level as yakuza 0, if you look at it overall. Though Yakuza 0 did some stuff better, this game did other stuff better for sure. If yakuza 0 was a 10/10 for me, this is prob a 9.9/10 for me, only because yakuza 0 laid the foundation, and made me buy every single goddamn yakuza game.


Super TL;DR: 10/10, get game, enjoy, don't regret.

Firstly, the addition of ragdoll physics on downed enemies simply removes all sense of seriousness from any encounter, as well as messes with certain actions that can only be applied to enemies in downed states, as now you have to rely on the ragdolls to work with you instead of having actual, properly implemented states as seen in previous games. Furthermore, the ""Fighting Stance"" previously known for it's reliable lock-on, is now mostly lacking that lock-on, allowing to you easily aim attacks completely off course from your target simply because you were moving in the wrong direction. All of these culminate in my feeling of disappointment towards the growth of the series into the Dragon Engine, after having already experienced the excellent combat of previous entries.

I still recommend this game to anyone looking into getting into the Yakuza/Ryu ga Gotoku series, as the main story is most certianly worth experiencing.

It's very hard to compare Yakuza games to other titles. It's just...Yakuza.
Walking through Kamurocho and Sotenbori is incredible and enjoyable and I must admit that eating food at restaurants and getting drinks in bars (for skill points and heat gauge) give big part of immersion to this game.

Sub-stories are of course top tier like always and even if there is decent amount of sub-stories you will find yourself looking for more and more.

There is also new mode called ""Majima Saga"" and I will look forward to finish it too.

There are some cinematics that are so good and it's shame that they are not longer even if they are not even short :)

It's fun, though.

The best parts are upgrading stats, eating to get experience, and fighting. That core game loop works (mostly) well here. And it gets interrupted just enough by all the mini games. Eat, mini game, fight thugs, eat, repeat. The fighting itself is good but has a spot or two where it becomes a tad clunky, especially in terms of using props/items/weapons, and the control is either too sensitive or too sluggish for me (the settings don't have a true slider, just a few notches to choose from in how sensitive the movement is). 

The only real problems are mostly movement/interface. Moving around when not fighting is bizarre... unlike the more arcade controls during fighting, while exploring it's possible to run up and press against buildings, vault over guardrails (which happens just by walking up to them even), and get too close to things to have the camera pan. It's a sort of throwback issue to the N-64 days that the camera doesn't pan well near walls. Further, as already mentioned, in the fighting itself, picking objects up and some of the context-specific moves are not at all intuitive. An instruction sometimes flashes to press this or that button, but it really is a *flash*, as in it might be up for tenths of a second. Which is something Arkham Asylum and the batman games did so much better, where the warning/indicator comes up with enough time to actually react *before* the exact moment the button needs to be pressed.

And the controls for mini-games... I get that some games vary greatly enough that they need other controls, but I feel like literally every mini-game has just completely different controls. Even the karaoke suddenly jumps to using the arrow keys rather than the WASD keys that could easily be used instead. I feel like the mini-games could have had some more controls in common between each one at times.

Ultimately a good game, and no need to play other entries in the series to enjoy it (this is the first Yakuza game I've played). 

But the camera/interface and controls are sometimes a slight hindrance, even when just roaming around.",1671920597,1671920597,True,0,0,0.479452043771743774,0,True,False,False

I've had this game on my list for a long time, and have had a save in it for probably over 6 years at this point. Now, I've finally beaten it. I had previously played Yakuza 0 en the first Kiwami, as well as playing the original Yakuza way back when on the Playstation 2. 

Yakuza 0 is the best one of these games I've played so far, so when in doubt, I would go with that one over this. It is after all the first game in the story, chronologically speaking. But other than that, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is probably one of the best entries to play. It has the graphics, the modern combat engine, and it also benefits from a pretty good amount of focus on the core of the story that mostly allows it to keep things moving.

I'll start by talking about what this game does absolutely fantasically. It does many things very well. All the Yakuza games do an absolutely incredible job evoking the experience of walking through a Japanese street. From the design of the vending machines and the chairs in restaurants to the flashy neon signs of some of the bigger busy-roads: it is all incredibly true to life. The loving reenactment Tokyo and Osaka in this game is a joy to behold.

The production values on the cutscenes are also very good (unless you count the Majima side-story, in which they clearly ran out of budget to animate the characters), and the story does a good job being one of those typical yakuza flicks, which is a genre that I love. It's an adoring homage to those types of stories, and the voice acting and writing for the most part just absolutely nail that vibe. 

Furthermore, some of the set pieces are incredible. Chapter 13 in particular features a final set piece that had me roaring with laughter and glee. The mixture of the serious and the absolutely ludicrous in these games is what makes them special, much in the same way Kojima games are. There are times in this game where Kiryu's infinitely badass attitude unironically had me pumped. Some of the combat scenes in which people think they someone can be mean while Kiryu is around, that then have you beat the ever living shit out of them, are incredibly satisfying. For all of these factors, this game is supremely easy to recommend.

However, there are also a few fundamental things that I kind of dislike about this game. The first is that the combat is good, but not that good. You can do some pretty awesome stuff in this game, and the combat often looks great, and has an enormous amount of weight behind it, in a good way. But on the other hand, there are instances where it felt very stiff to me as well. Specifically, there is an enemy later on (who luckily only appears a few times) with knives on his shoes, who really highlighted to me just how clunky the combat can be at its worst. In the final 5 hours of my playthrough, the combat finally clicked for me, but this is only because I got the double dash and the best block parry move unlocked. I could have gotten them sooner, but they're still pretty late-game upgrades by virtue of being very expensive, and so either way I feel like one has to be patient in order to get them. Getting those moves finally made me feel somewhat like Kiryu was fluid. Before, the tiny dash move seemingly just did nothing to help me dodge attacks, and I would often end up just having to exchange blows with enemy and win by attrition. There is probably something fundamental I'm not getting about the combat, but if there is, it doesn't teach you it very intuitively, I feel. This despite me being someone who loves character action games and is decently good at them. 

Another thing I kind of dislike is a fundamental aspect of the characterization of Kiryu. Why do they insist on having Kiryu be sort of a saint, when his character is one of being a literal gangster? The dissonance sometimes just doesn't work for me. I'm not even talking about them pretending that he somehow doesn't kill people; I'm talking about the story contorting itself in ways in order to make sure that Kiryu is always blameless for everything. The story is a real soap opera, for better or worse. Every characters is connected to every other character in a million ridiculous ways (everyone has always met, or saved everyone else's grandfather during the war, or was in the room where the mother was giving birth to the other character by chance). Kiryu is a cool vigilante who crushes people's skulls in the streets, and takes them for hundreds of thousands of yen, but the game still unabashedly wants to convince me he's a great guy who helps grannies cross the road (which he sort of really does.)  The writers seem to think Kiryu must be seen as doing no wrong, and there are a few times in the story when that tendency deflates the impact of situations utterly. 

The final thing is that the game is still paced like a Yakuza game at the end of the day. Random encounters in the streets no longer have a cutscene (thank the lord), but there is still this awkward pauze as the game puts you into the fighting arena mode. The substories are cool (and sometimes genuinely great), but they still use that typical tap-tap-tap dialogue box style without spoken dialogue, and sometimes things just last far too long. And I personally think all of the mini-games are superfluous, and I have no desire to engage with them.

With that said! This game is really great, and I am very grateful to it for the lovely time it gave me. My weird personal complaints aside, this game is an awesome labor of love that is easy to recommend.",1671888064,1671888064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is very much a give and take affair in a much more prominent way compared to the first, trading in a more consistent sense of being just decent to being an experience with towering highs and absolutely miserable lows. This was something that pervaded the majority of the game both mechanically and with its presentation. Despite that however, I'd also still say that I preferred this one over Kiwami 1, as the constant roughness that paves the way for some truly glorious heights makes for something that feels far more compelling and funnily enough also way more in line with the style of the games that so often fall back on the themes of stark juxtaposition as a lot of their appeal.

With this said however, there are a few aspects of the game that just feel strictly better to me, most of all the narrative. The way Kiryu's perspective has been so warped as a continuation of the previous game's events is really compelling to follow, showing the player someone who has become entirely disillusioned with the life that they'd devoted everything to for so long after tragedies upon tragedies began piling up. The theme of attempting to come to terms one's past further solidifies this along with being a constant driving force of basically every character featured prominently, with the attitudes they take on in regards to this largely being the deciding factor of their own sense of morality. This just happens to be especially compelling with Kiryu due to the way that it even seeps into a lot of the substories featured throughout, with him feeling far more frustrated and done with all the nonsense that he gets put through in them, very rarely feeling like someone who actually wants to go along with the absurdity and instead is just strung along time and time again. It ultimately adds a further sense of cohesion and consistency to his character that has always made him so great to follow along and see the way he feels the same regardless of how stupid or intense the moment happens to be.

It's really once you get to the pure gameplay side of things where the seams really start showing here, seemingly especially with the way the Dragon Engine is set up, though it's not all bad. The way the engine allows the player to seamlessly walk into stores and even up into certain other buildings adds a lot to the sense of liveliness to the locations that you explore, which works fantastically given how much time you'll obviously be spending in them, easily being my favourite thing about the engine on the whole. The light RPG mechanics added certainly have their positive qualities, especially with the way they reward you for messing about and eating at restaurants etc. to further encourage actually interacting with the world instead of approaching everything in the most ""video gamey"" way possible because of its comparative efficiency. With that said, the RPG elements also come with a problem when so many basic abilities that make the combat any fun whatsoever are now locked behind having to level them up with the exp points. So many of your capabilities feel absolutely pathetic for the first half of the game or so, with a lot of the more gradual upgrades not really doing enough to actually feel worthwhile a lot of the time, most notably the early quickstep being so horrifically bad that I genuinely thought it was a bug.

Mechanical progression issues aside, I also just think that the combat here sucks in general for the most part, particularly with the way that heat actions felt far less engaging to mess about with thanks to the far lower amount of fun contextual stuff to do. It all feels far more homogenous in here, with a lot of interactions being stripped back and replaced with more generic actions which ultimately takes away a bit from the world as a whole when it's no longer some strange, twisted playground of brutality. There's also just a certain overarching sense of the game lacking its visceral edge, with a lot of the basic attacks having utterly pitiful feelings of impact regardless of how much damage they actually can do. It leads to a very repetitive experience in a lot of places that's only really alleviated by the fact that the game is incredibly easy so you can at least breeze through it relatively painlessly.

The side content is something that I feel did take a pretty big step up here however, as while there are still quite a lot of them that are very dry and not even really a jazzed up objective to just beat up a bunch of guys, there's some really insane stuff that goes on too. There's some truly ridiculous and hysterical stuff that goes on here, but my favourite has to be the minigame that sees Kiryu having to piss with precise and variable amounts of force, which in itself is already pretty silly and out there, but when combined with the absolutely unhinged amount of determination he has to win at this pissing contest, it's just the perfect recipe to something that almost justifies the game in its own right. One other think that bothers me a bit is the decision to provide a little minimap icon to display where substories are so early into the game.

While it's an undeniable quality of life improvement to have, giving it to the player almost immediately has a tendency to cause these little side stories to feel closer to a bunch of boxes that the player needs to tick off rather than adding to the spontaneous nature of the world. A huge draw of these originally was the way it provided this chaotic quality to the world, where some weird, random nonsense could spring out at you at every turn, and while I do admit that the feature of being able to actually see where side quests are is a good one for being able to get through the content without a guide, adding it either in the premium adventure or near the end of the story would be a far more effective way of being able to provide atmosphere while still ultimately allowing you to pinpoint them on the map.

One other problem I really have with this is how much of the side content has the idea of repetition and tedium baked into it. There are a ton of neat ideas floating around, such as the top down tower defence construction game or the missions where you act as a bouncer and take out hordes of enemies, but a lot of them get bogged down by how often you need to go through basically the exact same motions to actually properly complete them. With a lot of bits and pieces being tweaked, so much of the tedium of exploring some of the side content would be solved and really go a long way in not having these absolutely painful stretches of nothingness. Overall though, despite the game sometimes having utterly cavernous low points of boredom and frustration, I still think this is a pretty cool game that once again embraces its absurdity in a lot of glorious ways. Definitely going to have to play the original at some point because I get the distinct feeling that this took some stylistic liberties that I wouldn't really agree with, but even with that lingering thought, this is still a cool game in its own right even with the way it ends up being pretty frustratingly messy in places.

No more ""multiple fighting styles"" system that separates certain moves with different stances! The combat assists from completed side-stories are all very fun and exciting. This game also uses EXP instead of yen to level up. I do prefer that system, because otherwise it makes me feel like I'm wasting levels every time I play arcade games. Some mini-games even offer EXP. The Cabaret Club Grand Prix was very fun, but sadly there is no Pocket Circuit racing in this one.

To start things off, I was initially a little conflicted going into the combat in this game. If you played Kiwami 1 (as you should) and (optionally) Yakuza 0, you will immediately recognise that everything has been overhauled radically, no more fighting styles to change between, only one that is some amalgamation of the four styles we've seen in the last two games.

It works of course, there are a few times I found it a little clunky as there are now charged attacks, light and heavy bound to (in my case) X and Y respectively. I play counters on occasion, and though it might just be me still learning the timings, but I feel the game doesn't register them as well as it did in Kiwami.

Feedback in fights are a bit more over the top if you will, as Kiwami 2 uses the same engine as Y6, it seems, bodies seem to have that Payday 2 style of just flying away as soon as they become a ragdoll state from throws and assorted kicks and hits, plus they just glide on the floor when they do so, assuming you didn't throw them into the river while in Sotenbori when the opportunity presents itself.

The story as always is enjoyable, I got invested in the characters as I did before with previous titles.

Graphics... yeah it's a major improvement, mostly. (TL;DR for 40GB or so, in short. Yes, it's quite detailed.)

Why do I say that? Well, there were some small bits here and there where character models of non-story NPCs looked suspiciously like they were ported from Kiwami 1 or Y0 and don't fit in with the level of detail that the entire world and other non-/player character(s) are at.

That being said though, if you don't look too close in certain areas like I did (check the Don Quijote store in Kamurocho while in the first person view, for a fringe case example.) graphics are very good, it's no Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but then those more recent titles take up an entire eighth of the storage on my desktop computer each.

What more can I think of to say? Well.. sometimes the game runs a little less than optimal in minigames, making it a bit of a  headache to play karaoke or baseball because you don't even get at least 60 FPS, so in fringe cases, it can affect my timing, or I end up completely lost over what happened.

Another thing I'm a bit pensive about is going away from the previous skill progression system, there are improvements to it, some new skills were added, some old favourites from other titles and what have you... now you have 5 different skill point categories when buying skills, I can't exactly pinpoint why, but it doesn't personally resonate with me. Your mileage may vary with that.

I can't really think of much else aside from all of the above, so I will leave it at that.",1670638388,1670639335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The PC version was released on May 9, 2019 and features the game’s engine, the Dragon Engine, for the first time on Steam. Kiwami 2 is a remake of Yakuza 2 from the PS2 era. The game takes place in 2006, just after the events of Yakuza Kiwami (or Yakuza 1) of which the Tojo Clan survived an internal, civil war and tragic consequences continue to affect all major characters. In Kiwami 2, the Tojo Clan faced a major rival, the Omi Alliance, who is led by Ryoji Goda, seeks to win all over Japan’s underground criminal organization. Yakuza Kiwami 2’s storyline is considered as one of the best, if not the best story in the entire franchise. Is Kiwami 2 worth purchasing?

The Dragon Engine on the PC is spectacular, beautifully impressive, and jaw dropping. The fictional Tokyo and Osaka urban environments are worthy for multiple screenshots. If the player can max out the game’s settings, the graphics are out of this world and highly realistic. Like Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, the number of miniature games is available for the player to access and doesn’t take as long which is a great convenience for those who want to 100% complete the game. Kiwami 2 core gameplay is like Yakuza 0 and Kiwami so I wouldn’t go further details on it since I wrote the reviews for the games already. The major difference is the protagonist’s combat style, which changed drastically and somewhat of a disappointment. The number of action moves are fewer than the previous titles and the game’s physics is inconsistent, wild, and unintentionally funny. Regardless, the moves are expectedly brutal for Kiryu to utilize against enemy NPCs and boss battles. The game’s greatest strength is the main story and the characters involved and the relationships among multiple characters. The voice acting performances from the cast are outstanding as expected from Japan’s notable voice acting culture and reputation. 

Yakuza Kiwami 2 has a lot of good merits, particularly on the game’s highly realistic graphics engine and solid story line, but there are some negative attributes need to be considered. The anti-aliasing setting is oddly taxing, specifically on SSAA. The SSAA is ranged from 1.00 to 2.00 which each option increases by 0.25. If placing the SSAA on 1.50 or more, the game performance will dramatically decrease even with contemporary and latest PC systems. The game is not Crysis or the CryEngine, but it is worth noting and recommend to not go at SSAA 1.50 or more. Not worth the performance hit for minimal graphical enhancements. Additionally, the late sequences in the game’s storyline are painful because of the story’s twists and turns – perhaps a bit excessive and dampens the overall storyline. 

Kiwami 2 is a solid game. I never played the original so I couldn’t compare what’s better or what isn’t, so the reader has to find other reviews to check. For me, the Yakuza series’ narrative and character evolution for the main protagonist stands out to me the most. This review applies mainly to those who are already invested into the series rather than new players. Regardless, Kiwami 2 has a solid recommendation, but a bit reservation on the later sequences on the main storyline. It’s worth for the $30 spent to give to SEGA and the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio (for me), but it’s also better to buy the title when it’s on sale.",1669949202,1670285460,True,15,0,0.671066403388977051,0,True,False,False

Yakuza Kiwami 2 it a completely remade version of Yakuza 2. This version uses the same engine as Yakuza 6, and plays as such. The combat is very fluid, and feels amazing. The substories are just as good as ever, and the new ones help tie in Y0. They did cut out an area from the original game, but this area is only in one portion of the game, and not vital to the story in any way. 

In essence, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a great way to keep playing Yakuza, and you should play this game if you like the series.

At some point you will be surprised when you meet characters that don't give you an excuse to violently bash their skulls against the wall. 

Unlike it's predecessors, Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami (Or Like a Dragon Zero and Like a Dragon Kiwami), this entry does not feature multiple battle styles so it might anger some people, but on the good side, upgrading abilities it's much simpler now and you don't need to updgrade your health 8 times before getting higher levels of damage like in the previous entries. The Dragon Engine also makes transitions way more smooth than previous engines so no more loading when entering buildings or getting into fights. If you see a thug you don't like you can punch them faster this time around.

The story is, as Mike Stoklasa put it once, ""Elegantly bad"". Good characters that are actually evil, evil characters that are actually good, and good characters that are actually evil except ¡NO! they're actually good. It's totally self-aware of how much shit it's throwing in the pot at the same time with it's constant twists to fall into the common narrative trap of turning into a pretentious self-wankery like it happens with a lot of ""auteurs"" in gaming (Won't name anyone but you are probably thinking of somebody you hate).

The story has everything: a struggle between to crime empires, twists, romance and large dumb men punching other men and tigers.
The gameplay is what you would expect from Kiryu era-games, but it's fun enough. 
The side stories are often insane and the best one involves fighting diaper fetishists.

Combat is very fun because it is more simple than the other games. There are no stances instead your combat has a lot to do
with your leveling. The xp system is very fun but its very unbalanced, if you do a lot of the side content you will be very overpowered for the fights. Weirdly your super moves to way to much damage to bosses but little damage to the regular enemies. Weapons also do so much damage probably stay away from them if you want to have harder combat.   
 Minigames are back since they are MIA from yakuza kiwami. There is the same cabaret minigame from 0 which this time around i found to be more fun, probally since kiwami had very little minigame content. Theres also the construction minigame where its like a topdown tower defence where you have characters who actually have their own stats and ablities. This is strangely addicting and compelling despite it feeling underdeveloped compared to the cabaret game.  

In terms of the story it feels way more fleshed out than kiwami ever did. Many returning characters make the story feel like a good continuation from the other games. The new villain is great, but the real shining light is Kiryu. This game Kiryu felt more human than ever before, his voice acting and writing is stellar even in the side questing his character is amazing.

Kamurocho and Sotenbori are mostly-seamless open-world style now, and it's so natural that it makes me forget where the loadscreens used to be.  Battles also flow in and out smoothly, and the new combat, while simpler, trims a lot of the fat that came with balancing several styles.  Gear and Weapons are better integrated than ever, and I found myself using them both extensively, which is a first.  The new character models are a great touch (gone are the days of Kiryu's 2cm pores), and while it isn't graphically jaw-dropping, it gets the job done with cinematic flair.  ""Real Yakuza Use a Gamepad"", but this port is fidgety, and will require you to delve into the Steam Big Picture settings to fix compatibility problems.  In addition, the Toylets minigame is broken at 60fps - temporarily turn the game down to 30fps to solve such issues.  

For completionists - the 100% journey took me approximately 85 hours to complete, with regular guide usage.  This is quite moderate by Yakuza standards, and the difficulty was not crushing.

Having only one style felt very off at first, but it works once you get to put more points into it. What I love about Kiwami 2 is the sense of immersion I get, just the simple fact that you can walk into stores, that walking is default, instead of running. Those all add up.

Kiwami 2 serves as a return to form after the mostly disappointing Kiwami 1. Like with all Yakuza games, if you have played one, you have more or less played all of them. Just as before, the story follows the ever-stoic Kazuma Kiryu and his on-again, off-again relationship with his clan. The plot is a major improvement over the previous game and does a lot to sell the melodramatic world of ever-shifting allegiances, back-stabbing, and twists. The plot in these games is never the main selling point but act as wonderfully entertaining ways to contextualize the maihem. This plot revolves around a rivalry between two Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance who are trying to expand their territory by absorbing the, now weakened, Tojo Clan. Heading the Omi is a man named Ryuji Goda who serves as a parallel to Kiryu—they even both use the ‘dragon’ moniker. The plot does a great job in wrapping up and incorporating old plot lines into this game to make it feel far bigger than the sum of its parts.
	
This time around, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio made some major upgrades across the board. Not only is this entry just as content-packed as Zero but it also comes with an impressive visual overhaul. While Kiwami 1 felt like a stripped down Zero, Kiwami 2 developed its own identity by making massive enhancements to the preexisting framework. Down to the little details, Kiwami 2 makes the cozy, familiar city of Kamurocho feel fresh and vibrant. I actually gasped when I discovered I could simply walk into most buildings in the city without any loading screens. The developers did an amazing job of turning the toybox map of the pervious games into a living city. 
	
Finally, the gameplay feels far more balanced than in either of the two previous entries. While this sounds great on paper, it is more of a neutral change. It is nice to use more of the skills you have acquired over the playthrough, it also feels disappointing to not feel like a invincible god of street fights (or at least not as much of one). Also, I always try to complete as much of these games as possible, and like always it tends to get a bit repetitive and dull towards the end so I would not recommend completing this game, just sample the options of what’s there. You earn enough experience to complete the skill tree without much grinding so kill yourself over it. 
	
At the end of the day, it is another Yakuza game but it feels elevated. While it does lean on your knowledge of previous games, nothing that comes before feels like required reading to have an enjoyable time. If you are curious about this series and want to test the waters—play Zero. But if you simply refuse to play anything without really pretty graphics, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a great time. For fans of the franchise: I doubt you need my recommendation.",1667665240,1667665275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Looks way better than Yakuza 0 and Kiwami.
+ Progression feels better than the previous two games.
+ Lots of enjoyable side quests and minigames.
+ Great engaging story (Except the ending).
+ Kamurocho and Sotenbori feel way more interactive now.
+ Majima is playable again (although it's not like Yakuza 0. Majima Saga has a very short story and combat options with Majima is very limited).
+ It has Virtua Fighter 2 in the arcade (One of my favourite childhood games).

Negatives:
- Fighting was the most lacking part in this one compared to the previous Yakuza games. I missed switching to different styles, so fighting quickly became boring.
- It's extremely easy, even on hard mode. Boss battles are super easy.
- Anti-aliasing svcks, and hair texture looks terribly bad.
- The ending was more idiotic than I could ever imagine.

Overall, I enjoyed it a lot, unlike Yakuza: Kiwami 1. In terms of gameplay & story, Yakuza: Kiwami 2 is on par with Yakuza 0. I spent half of my total gameplay just exploring the side contents.

The move to the Dragon Engine provides an enormous graphical upgrade over Kiwami, striking in how much more vibrant Kamurocho looks. The enhancements in the engine extend to everything you can see - the mini-map provides the live locations of every NPC in the streets, doors you can enter, and shows places of interest much more precisely than before, the ragdoll physics are deeply entertaining, and object physics in general are impressive in how you can interact with the destructible environment. Of the three games I've played thus far, Kiwami 2 is easily the most visually impressive.

Combat, on the other hand, feels like a big regression. Losing multiple battle styles in favor of a single style made combat much more repetitive than in previous games, and I felt that the combo systems was much less responsive here than it was in 0 or Kiwami. A lot of the time, I would bounce off a block and lose my flow completely, not having an idea of where in the combo I'd been interrupted. Furthermore - and this may not just be an engine but a game design thing - several of the bosses were absolutely ridiculous in their ability to eat and dodge hits and then dish out ridiculous damage by simply dodging around my guard to lay in a ten-hit combo. The Man in Black was by far the worst offender, with his stupid fucking knife shoes, but other bosses were just as painful in this regard. 

Narrative is what I play Yakuza games for, however, and Kiwami 2 is a big step up from Kiwami in that regard. Much of this hinges on the charisma of Ryuji Goda and Kaoru Sayama, the main antagonist and deuteragonist, respectively. Like 0 and Kiwami, Kiwami 2 weaves an intricate web of a plot, and though the goofiness of Yakuza starts to show through towards the end of the narrative, with false finishes and last-minute villain reveals that take some of the air out of the story to that point, I found myself absolutely captivated, as always, by the multi-layered family drama at the heart of the story. The connections to 0 weren't nearly as prevalent here as they were in Kiwami, which I suppose is understandable - even if it's a post-0 remake, a lot of those references and connective tissue were explored in Kiwami and don't really need to be rehashed here. Even so, the core narrative, the substories, the cabaret club minigame - all excellent, as expected.

Yakuza 2 is usually held up as one of the best stories of the entire series, primarily on the back of Ryuji Goda, and I definitely see where people are coming from in that regard. Kiwami 2 is a great game in its own right, deep and diverse, and a promising, if uneven, showing of the Dragon Engine that continues to underpin most RGG Studio games after this. Absolutely wroth it.",1667015700,1667015700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is your average Yakuza game story however I found it took a bit for it to get to the point where the stakes are high, it was quite enjoyable nonetheless. Throughout the story there are parts which don't directly relate to the story but are used to further Kiriyu's characterisation which I really liked. It really cemented for me how good of a character he is and I hope we keep seeing more scenes which flesh out his character.

The combat is pretty enjoyable because of the Dragon Engine's physics. It's comical how if you punch someone they just ragdoll and fly off 5 metres away. It's not as grounded as it was in the previous games but I think it's a lot more enjoyable doing fights with these physics.

Not only that, but this one's combat has some very strange design decisions and I do not recommend to play the game as it is. 

I [b] strongly recommend you install a combat mod [/b] to overhaul the gameplay. At the bare minimum, you'd want something that removes the bounce when an enemy blocks your attack (Such as ""No more hit bounce on block"" by dodolodo). My personal favorite however is ""Legend Remix K2"" by TripleAAA7331 as it completely changes the flow of combat, overhauling everything whilst adding it's own new stuff. It works very well. There's also the excellent ""Style Switching"" mod by ReLLeRtR that does exactly what is says, adding the style switching from Y0 and YK1 into this game in the Dragon Engine.

diff: Normal
Playtime: 49 H (Main game) & 4 H(Majima Saga)/ 59H(SteamPlaytime)
Synopsis:
Kazuma Kiryu thought his Tojo Clan days were behind him. He and the young girl in his care, Haruka Sawamura, have built a peaceful life from the ashes of conflict. All it took was a single gunshot to shatter that peace. Yukio Terada, the Fifth Chairman of the Tojo Clan, has been assassinated. With war on the horizon, the legendary Dragon of Dojima is pulled back into the world he wanted to leave behind.

Kiryu must travel to Sotenbori, Osaka in an attempt to broker peace between the rival clans, but Ryuji Goda, known as the Dragon of Kansai, will stop at nothing to get his war. In this world, there can only be one dragon.

Plus:
+YK2 got Beautiful upgrade by using Dragon Engine from Y6
+The Story is upgrade from Yakuza 1
+Sega Arcade is much Better ( VF 2 and Virtual ON)
+Sotenbori have the best Banger battle theme
+Ragdoll is fun

Minus:
-The Kiwami Content is too much makin it feel bloated
- 4 battle skill is lock in semi completionist (Bouncer mission, Majima Construction Minigame, Street Boss, Amon battle)
- Some skill lock in minigame completionist
- The Kamurocho map got 1/4 cut
- Enemies is very aggro to kiryu

Mixed:
=The most easiest and cheeseable Amon fight
=Kamiyama shop very weird system to increased stock
=Bouncer minigame
=Majima Construction story line ( I dont finished it)
= Colosseum fight is kinda weird line of easy and hard in some fight
=Ufo catcher camera in sega sotenbori is weird
=Y6 Experience system implemented in YK 2
=Max Drunk is only makin your walk/run is a hassle
=Takahashi character from YK2 face is very different from vanilla Y2 and that makin it different vibe and reason
=2 song got change for kiryu sad scene and finale credit songs 

Majima Saga is quite good the tie loose end Y0 Majima story and fast paced is makin it not too long to finish the story. the villian is just macguffin to progress the story tho..",1664434182,1664434214,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

No. just no. this is worse than 0. the graphics are good, but they feel....forcibly good? i dont really know how to say it but it feels like they were just adding every effect they could and hoping they could make it  look better. I have a gaming laptop, not an entire pc setup, so i cant exactly complain about performance, but it's just laggy. the worst part is, since the graphics have all these stupid effects plastered onto them, when you remove all the artificial-ness of it you realize how shitty everything looks. This makes the game: 
-gross on low graphics
-laggy (with crashes around every hour) at any relatively good graphics
THE GAMEPLAY.
Bad. just bad. fights no longer feel like a mix of evasion and agression, they just feel like spamming left click and praying. this is made even worse by kyriu's floppy ragdoll animations every time he gets knocked down, which admittedly did make me chuckle a couple of times, but they just make it feel like a big pause in the fight, since enemies dont even attack you while you're down.  it's not a tense ''oh shit, GET UP'' moment in which enemies start running up to you preparing their attacks while your character struggles to get up, you just kinda sit there and wait a few seconds.
i just cannot recommend this. i look at yakuza 0, a game that perfectly nailed the combat, the story, the substories, the graphics, and all around just the feel of the world, i just feel like this is such a downgrade.
get this game if you want to go through the entire series, but don't expect this to be better than 0.

If you're playing the series in chronological order, this one is going to feel very jarring at first. Once again, Kiryu is the only playable character, and on top of that his fighting styles are gone, condensed into just one moveset. The game boasts a new physics engine that Sega seemed to be very proud of- hitting an enemy with a heavy blow will cause them to turn into a ragdoll and go flying for 20 feet. Furniture that Kiryu touches with occasionally slip out from under him like it's covered in grease and will awkwardly explode. You no longer progress in a prolonged fight by sending an enemy through a locked door, opening a path for you. You now calmly open the door, demonstrating the new engine's ability to seamlessly pass through doorways without being interrupted by a loading screen.

Upgrading your character also got a major overhaul, carried over from  Yakuza 6. Kiryu now has 5 separate experience categories, which you gain at different rates and are used to unlock different upgrades. Progress at the start is very slow, and even towards the end of the game you need to shovel a lot of expensive food to learn abilities and boost your stats. 

Despite the changes, this was still a fun game. The side quests are as funny as ever, there's still an undeniable satisfaction from hitting enemies with your heat moves, especially the extreme heat attacks that are in this game. Even with the awkward new experience system, it arguably an upgrade to the restaurants that didn't serve much purpose in 0 and Kiwami 1. I still miss the styles of the last games,but after you get over how clowny the physics are you start to appreciate the charm of being able to punt a guy like a soccer ball while he's laying on the ground.",1661927470,1661927470,True,9,0,0.625336050987243652,0,True,False,False

I was originally gonna write what would essentially just be an essay just talking about how different this game was and how much I hated it, as I kept hearing about how good this game is and never really hearing anyone say anything negative about it, but I'll try to keep it short for the sake of those reading it, and my sanity (in hindsight, I failed horribly lol).

- The combat is insanely different from 0 and Kiwami, so it has a completely different feel and can be jarring when going from Kiwami to this game, which led to me experiencing a feeling that I can only describe as ""going to a reputable restaurant that I've gone to for years to get a delicious meal, but actually just getting a cheap bag of potato chips once I receive my food from the waiter."" Seriously, this is the only game so far where i felt compelled to use weapons to speed up some of the bosses, as in the other games fighting them bare-fist was pretty satisfying with how fun the different styles in those games felt to use, but here the only time I felt that I enjoyed the combat was when I [spoiler] played through the optional Majima saga, but it was ridiculously short and was pretty much just Majima's Mad Dog of Shimano Style ripped straight out of Yakuza 0. It didn't help that you get the chapters for the Majima Saga one at a time, with you needing to reach chapter 11 (out of the 16 chapters this game has) just to finish it. [/spoiler] Weapons are also ridiculously fragile in this game, you'll pick up a bike and if you get hit ONCE you'll drop it and it'll break instantly. Hell, even you do something like drop a METAL BASEBALL BAT, it might break, like the fuck? The combat in this game isn't even that hard, it's just really painful to sit through, with certain enemies just refusing to be staggered and my hits not feeling like they due anything at all, ONLY FOR IT TO HAVE APPARENTLY DONE ONE WHOLE HEALTH BAR WORTH OF DAMAGE!?

- The game was made with a completely different engine, which leads to it looking way better than 0 and Kiwami (but not running as well). This also messes with the physics a lot, which things like the crane game in the arcade highlight, with the claw grabbing toys but having them phase straight out of the claw once lifted up.

- The upgrade system is a total mess, with you getting different categories of EXP to invest into upgrades, with some upgrades being as simple as needing a bit of one category, ranging to a bunch of different categories. However, it's no longer as linear, with you being able to do things like upgrade your health, heat, damage, and get actual skills/heat moves at pretty much whatever pace you want (some of the EXP costs for the upgrades vary greatly though, which can kinda force you into getting some of the cheaper ones once the more expensive ones start rolling around). 

- Completion Points are also gone, with most of the things you got from it being turned into upgrades instead, like running for longer periods of time and the Nouveau Riche Influx perk, and tasks that once rewarded you with completion Points now just giving you small amounts of EXP.

- Sidestories can reward you with special heat actions from the person you helped out, but you need to unlock them afterwards for some reason...

- The story is alright at best, but painful to follow at worst. Like there's a (supposed-to-be tragic) scene where [spoiler] Kiryu gets stabbed in the fucking chest [/spoiler] but they have music playing that sounds like it's straight out of a 13 year-old kid's AMV. The ending will literally leave you going: ""Huh, that's it?"" once the credits start rolling, only for the scene that pulls up after the credits to clear up the confusion and reveal that [spoiler] the last bit of the ending didn't matter at all and that you were effectively jebaited into giving an iota of a fuck about these characters.

- game looks stunning, and the cinematics are amazing
- its a yakuza game so it still is fun in a sense
- dragon engine introduced ragdoll physics which makes fights pretty funny
- the story is gripping and still emotional, even if you accidentally looked it up
- some awesome set pieces and really fun boss fights to an extent

CONS:
- doodoo fighting style, which is boring as hell to use compared to other games
- ragdoll physics make most moves (like throws and curbstomping) sorta useless and ruins the combat
- enemies bounce your attacks off when they block
- you're either getting your butt kicked or are doing like 3 health bars worth of damage to a boss in a single heat move
- doodoofart exp system. i have beaten the game a few months back and i still cant afford half the upgrades
- dragon engine's shader is more green than the taco bell i dropped in the toilet
- and the shader is pretty laggy so id suggest you get a reshade mod
- the framerate being uncapped ruins some minigames
- majima saga was nice but at the same time way too short
- this game jerks off yakuza 0 more than any other game (not saying zero is bad at all, but it kinda gets embarrassing)
- a whole city from the ps2 version was cut out (what the deuce moment)
- this is like the one yakuza game where i felt like i was shot more than stabbed


so in all id say that if you cant get your hands on a ps2 or the HD versions on PS3 in japan that this game is alright. however it is far from my favorite and if i have to get a mod to enjoy the combat, then i know something is wrong

The combat system was streamlined and the menus easier to navigate, which I ended up liking way more than the circular menus in Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1.

the cutscenes have been redone entirely, so there better directed than the original game's, and the additional minigames and side missions have really fleshed out the game.

I really wish steam had a neutral or mixed feel because there were definitely things I enjoyed and many things I also didn't enjoy. I'll try to make this as simple as possible.

If you had played Yakuza 0 or Yakuza Kiwami, you'll know the style of how the story and fighting went, they went quite different with the fighting in this game, you only have one mode and it's the blue one, the brawler mode, the things you could change in fighting were just using weapons. You could get weapons from the shop or pick up weapons from enemies during battles and you can put them in your inventory, I like this idea. There are very minimal loading zones this time meaning you aren't bombarded with loading zones when going in and out of shops, it's very seamless, no loading when you're going into a street fight it's a lot more smoother going in and out of things. I definitely liked the story better than Yakuza Kiwami but I still think Yakuza 0's story was better than these two. One of the biggest things I enjoyed was the inventory in general. You no longer have 25 slots max, you have 10 slots per item so you can carry loads of healing items without worry for your inventory space, which is incredibly good considering how much you'll use them. One great thing I'll always be thankful about is how Kiryu doesn't keel over and suffer every single gun shot and then you have to spam a button, E for those keyboard and mouse users like myself, it doesn't exactly help too much when it feels like everyone has a gun and everything will stun you, you just can't spam anything to do anything about it. Majima is definitely not annoying in this game and in fact he's significantly more comedic, I enjoyed his appearances and there seems to be more of him, a backstory I think? I've yet to do it as I was more focused on the story.

And now on to the cons,
Remember how awesome the cutscenes were in the other games? I mean they seem similar here except they've removed all voice acting from outside animated cutscenes, it's all the noises from dialogue that you'd expect from substories, it felt like they didn't have time or weren't bothered to care about voice acting for the main story, I guarantee many of you relied on subtitles anyway but having the voice still adds character than just mumbles.
The combat, again, is definitely a downgrade not only is there one fighting style and you don't even feel like the Dragon of Dojima anymore, they made the fighting feel goofy almost, there's literal ragdoll physics, if you hit someone onto the ground, they'll flop over like an actual fish it just kills the tension and its quite upsetting.
Remember those fat guys that hold the chairs and other massive furniture, they are the absolute worst in this game. They are bonkers tanky and there is absolutely nothing you can do against them, every hit will toss you across the room, ragdoll form.

I could continue with the cons but I really don't want to bash the game any more than it deserves, I think the story is really good, I think the game is good. I just think the gameplay is bad, it feels very rushed and I honestly think the post credits scene was awful. Not awfully animated or anything, I just thought it felt cheap. If the credits were the end. I'd genuinely be happy with it It would feel like an actual end not another cliff hanger.

My final verdict is this is a great story but not the best game to play, if this were a movie, or if this were the same design as Kiwami 1 then that would change my mind heavily. The game felt more tedious than fun sadly.

Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami set the bar pretty high, and Kiwami 2 had no problem reaching that level for me. 

Before I get into my thoughts about the story of Kiwami 2, I would just like to say I'm very thankful and quite frankly impressed about the way the skill system, inventory, and overall gameplay was modified to a precise point where it is still very engaging and prevented any repetitive-ness of grinding out skills and such from the previous installments. I had a great time. 


The story of Kiwami 2, like kiwami, left me dumbfounded. Without getting into spoilers, the continued story of Kiryu in Kiwami 2 hit me hard, and after the emotional wreck Yakuza Kiwami left me (not in a bad way whatsoever), Kiwami 2 was able to preserve the seriousness, melancholic, and at times lighthearted moments of the Yakuza games thus far. It is not the same thing happening over and over again, it is just a genuinely interesting and ""edge of your seat"" kind of story, and one I was fully engaged in the whole time. 

I really do recommend and hope more people can enjoy and experience the Yakuza saga, especially 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2.

My biggest issue however is the ridiculous ragdoll physics as well the fact that half of my attacks seem to clip through enemies like they are not there. Other than that, the combat system is okay I guess though I prefer the previous different style of 0 and Kiwami.

   [*] The main story was much better than Kiwami 1 and the antagonist was built up well. The plot twists were timed perfectly!
   [*] I completed 54 sub-stories out of 76. They ranged from being funny to emotional and had a lot of references to other media.
   [*] Physics in this game is based on their new engine and I felt that it was a good change from the previous entries. Having said that, the ragdoll was sometimes a bit over the top.
   [*] The graphics qualify is insane and the ability to enter any shop without a loading screen was a much-needed improvement. The skill system was tweaked as well.

   [*] The karaoke songs were decent although the new system of button prompts was a little jarring.

+ fight without loading screen
+ better immersion 
But it's heavier, takes up way more gpu juice so your fps will be affected ( unlike 0 and kiwami 1)
No style switching so if you're coming from 0 and ki 1 yes it sucks, the style in this game is like a mix of dragon and brawler 
Weird green tint on the screen
The level up system is bad, you have to learn a move then unlock it??? wtf 
On a positive note: Story is good
Mini games and side quests are good
Map and Graphic are improved massively ( compares to 0+ kiwami 1) 
We get to play Majima again ( pogger) 
Improved inventory with way more room 
Good in game economy 
Coliseum is good with Free for all fight ( very fun) 
Combat system ( after getting through the early game) is very clean, smooth, enemies can't guard lock you forever, and you get way more heat moves

The Dragon of Dojima has found a rival, like it or not, in a Kansai yakuza who also has a Dragon nickname who thinks there should only be one dragon. By the end of this soap opera-like journey of brotherhood, betrayal, secret heritage, and brawls, Kiryu's on the top of an unfinished skyscraper with a love interest while a bomb counts down. Oh yeah, it's drama!

The game is the game. I felt like Kiwami 2 moved back into some of the Yakuza 0 feel - as opposed to Kiwami 1, which was more sparse. There's more of a sense of whimsy and about neither Kiryu nor the game taking themselves too seriously all of the time. Side quests are fun, one of the game's two big minigames is fun (I liked the tower defense-like Majima-focused Clan Creator, skipped the ""manage hostesses at a club"" game entirely), fighting tons and tons of dudes in random street brawls and plot-related marathon fights is fun. I did think it was a bit of a slow starter, taking a while to get rolling. For several hours I asked myself, ""Am I bored of this? Have I had enough Yakuza?"" Then the old fun feeling kicked in and didn't let go. I liked that combat got streamlined so there are no longer multiple stances; I seldom used them anyway and found it an annoyance.

My modest laptop started running into occasional issues with the graphics in this game. There were occasional weird herky-jerky movements of the models during cutscenes that looked creepily like when aliens are pretending to be human in some kind of horror movie. I also had difficulty in this game using my Switch Pro controller, as the game kept putting PlayStation symbols on the screen for quick-time event prompts. When you've got XABY and the game flashes triangle, square, circle, or X, it's... you know. Especially when, no spoilers except to say this, the final boss fight requires you to execute one quick-time button push no matter how thoroughly you whip the guy's butt OR ELSE YOU LOSE AND HAVE TO DO THE WHOLE THING OVER, it's a little bit of an issue!

They pretty much reversed everything that happened at the end of Kiwami [spoiler] Kiryu becomes a Yakuza again... agin and Haruka goes back to the orphanage. [/spoiler] At this point it's just silly to be honest.

I liked the Majima Construction company questline because of Majima, but it was one of the worst defense/strategy games I've ever played.

The Hostess Club manager on the other hand... I did not like the return of this mini game. The way they go about finding a reason to get Kiryu into the Cabaret Club management minigame is somewhat funny, but really stupid. In Zero he didn't want to do the Real Estate Agent thing either, but at least it made sense. Either way, I really didn't want to waste dozens of hours into the same shit again, but I already finished the Majima construction company. I was at least somewhat happy around the end, because they got Majima into this quest line as well.

In terms of gameplay this is the weakest Kiryu ever started and he is only reduced to one combat style. Generally it's not that bad, but while the combat is a little more complex it also kinda is less complex. At first you have to work around how weak Kiryu is and later you pretty much just use heat for everything.

This might be the most beautiful Yakuza game on PC, but it kinda lost the style of the previous games for realism. The world is more open and you just enter the stores and arcades from the hub world now, the random encounters are also more direct without the small loading screen.

My problem is that everything is kind of worse now, Kiryu's sprint is almost not existing and even after maxing it you can barely go more than 5 seconds. You also run into shit like the bycicles and other trash that's in the way. A lot of the old minigames like the UFO catcher or darts are also worse mechanically and in terms of control.

The story was probably the weakest out of the remakes and the prequel, but the ending was way better than Kiwami even if you had to wait for the after credits to see it.

I am pretty tired of the gameplay loop of these games. If the story at least could keep me interested, but only Zero was really good of the three games I played now. I'm not sure there is a reason for me to get more Yakuza games, unless the remasters become really cheap.

Time to finish + 90% of the sub stories: 42,2 hours

Additionally to the story they added the Majima Saga, which is kind of lazy Majima fan service and I totally fell for it. Majima, you're too good for this world.

Again very happy Sega are releasing Yakuza to PC in story order rather than the console release order. This is fantastic apart from some people don't understand that the Kiwamis are remakes of old games. So of course Kiwami 2 has less features and is generally shorter than Yakuza 0. While 0 is the newer game it is a prequel. 

Release Order: Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5, Y0, YK1, Y6, YK2, YLAD(7)

Story Order Y0, YK1, YK2, Y3, Y4, Y5, Y6, YLAD(7)
(Kiwamis are remastered so replace the originals, 3-6 may not get the Kiwami treatment)

Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a remastered version of the PS2 game Yakuza from 2006. The remake has been done very well and they have built the game with the Yakuza 6 Dragon engine. Kamurocho and Sotenbori look beautiful in the new engine with the hustle and bustle of the cities feeling even better that before.

A year after leaving his former life in the Tojo Clan behind, ex-yakuza Kazuma Kiryu is called back into action when the clan's Fifth Chairman Yukio Terada is murdered by assassins from a rival organization, the Omi Alliance. Returning to Kamurocho, Kiryu must find a new chairman for the Tojo Clan and prevent an all-out war between the Tojo and the Omi, bringing him into conflict with Ryuji Goda, the legendary ""Dragon Of Kansai"" of the Omi Alliance. 

The fighting system instead of having the three stances like in 0 an K1 have now been merged in to one fighting style. While some people prefer the 3 stance fighting this mode is very good as when you learn the combo's you can have some very fluid fighting. The fighting like in all Yakuza games is meaty and satisfying. The weapons system has been enhanced nicely too being a lot more fluid than the previous versions.

With the new engine there are no loading times or screen fades when entering shops and fights etc. Its just instant which is really nice.

You get to play as Majima again in this title with him having his own stand alone story. ""Majima Saga""  explains how Majima came to leave the Tojo Clan following the death of his patron, Futoshi Shimano, a year earlier and form a legitimate enterprise, ""Majima Construction"", between Yakuza and Yakuza 2. 

The voice acting, cutscenes, storytelling and music are stellar once again.

Slightly less mini games than other titles and substantially easier to complete the completion list in my opinion. There are a lot of cheat items for the Japanese games like Mahjong and Koi Koi. The mini games have all had a polish and there are some new ones. Darts, Golf, Mahjong, Koi Koi, Blackjack, Poker, Bouncer Missions (A lot of them lol), Karaoke, Photography, Cabaret management, Clan creator. I personally enjoy Mahjong and my love for the series was that strong I actually learned how to play basic Richii Mahjong.

Cabaret management from Yakuza 0 is back which will make a lot of people happy as that mini game is like pure crack on the addiction level XD.

Clan creator is in this game which I hear was in Y6 originally. In this mode its like a top down RTS using a team put together to defend Majima construction. Can be quite challenging (It has been nerfed if you choose to use the CC DLC)

Couple of things omitted in this title which I missed were, No Pocket Circuit and No Baka Mitai

I have very high hopes for the rest of the series being brought to PC now after the recent announcement and release of Yakuza 3,4 and 5 to the PlayStation. The Yakuza director has hinted very strongly that we will get them.

Thank you SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio for this fantastic series and thank you for bringing it to the PC <3

YK2 really impressed me. At the start I did not enjoy it at all, I was used to the combat of 0 and Kiwami so wasn't 100% on this combat, the general vibe was different cause of the different engine but got used to that. What was a downgrade was the performance. Kiwami 2 is not a good PC port, the performance is inconsistent where there are quite a few stutters when in the city (possibly due to the buildings having interiors that you don't need to enter by loading in but instead accessible from the outside) however the most important thing that the performance affects is the combos, it is harder to fight enemies with 60fps or higher compared to 30 and im unsure why they didn't fix that.

On the other hand the game is great, I think the story is better than 1 and the ending was amazing. When you get further in the combat is actually really good and I had alot of fun just fighting people on the streets, you won't be disappointed.",1657138140,1657138140,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

Starting off with the positives, the world feels more alive than Kiwami thanks to traffic & a ragdoll physics engine that results in Kiryu knocking over absolutely everything within walking distance. Those same physics lead to punching enemies into the air so far they leave the screen, or launching them several meters back into their unsuspecting cronies. The minigames are all there as you'd expect, though I'll be honest & say they've never really been my jam when it comes to this franchise.

The story, however, most certainly is. It feels like a step up from Kiwami in pretty much every way, though out of the three titles I've played so far, I'd still say Yakuza 0 stands alone. Still, it's extremely wacky, surprisingly emotional, & while it might be a bit too reliant on the ""Rule of Cool"" for some, for me, I wouldn't want it any other way. If by the end of the series I don't see Kiryu punch a moving tank to a standstill, I'll be feeling disappointed, because he's punched pretty much everything else up until this point!

The combat is sadly something I'm yet to bond with, though. It feels like something that's gatekeeping me from enjoying the story, although thankfully you an trivialize most of it with consumables & weapons. I understand it's all part of the spectacle, & it might just be that 3D brawlers just aren't my jam, but I cannot recommend it based on the combat alone - Fortunately, I don't have to.

Overall, I still have gripes with the combat, & yes the story is cheesy insanity carried by a hell of a lot of cutscenes, but I'm not sure I'd have it any other way. Just imagine Arnie's ""True Lies"" set in Japan co-written by a somewhat drunk Tarantino, and you've pretty much got the Yakuza franchise down.

Being able to switch combat styles in 0 was cool, but I'm more a fan of 1 fighting style that has it all and Kiwami 2 executes that perfectly. The story, although the end is not as impactful as Yakuza 0's, is so unique and you must experience it if you enjoy Yakuza.

I feel that ""Legend"" difficulty is too easy. I don't know if it was my experience playing yakuza games so much or if i over-built Kiryu (I don't think I did) but i feel like those final few fights should have been more grueling and challenging but At the end I didn't even need to use many of my Health items or weapons. 

One other thing I'm not too happy about: I wish Ryuji Goda was more. He seemed like he had so much more to him but I don't feel like he was given the spot light enough and I don't think he was as fleshed out as he could have been. I feel that him and Kiryu are equals, but the story doesn't lead you to really believe that.

With all that said, I give this game a 9/10 objectively, but subjectively a 10/10 because dispite its flaws, I'm struggling to decide if I like this game more of Yakuza 0 more.",1655074534,1655074534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not only do they downgrade the combat but they have ruined the leveling system, it is so stupid to have the only efficient way of getting skills is by purposely making yourself hungry so you can eat to gain skill points instead of the tried and true leveling through ACTUAL COMBAT.

Nearly no effort in this game, music are pretty average but that's subjective, though the original's style in the music direction is nowhere aswell. I'd beg for a PS2 port of this game, as the combat is probably one of the best Yakuza has gotten in og 2, even better than Kiryu's moveset in 3&4 imo, along with some pretty sick bosses like the Hayashi fight, this remake is not comparable.

It's just not as good as the themes and executions set up in Yakuza 0 and Kiwami. It's always a joy, though, coming back to Kamurocho now and seeing what has changed since the previous games, what has returned, what hasn't, and what new songs are available at the karaoke bar.

It can be forgiven that this game came out so early in the series that there's a little bit of weirdness involved in its storytelling, namely the Sayama romance plot that was dropped in 3 onwards and then pretends like that never happened. Granted, you could read it as Kiryu rebounding after losing Yumi in the previous game.

This game continues to make callbacks to side stories that happened in 0 and Kiwami, like the cabaret club and the extra chapter that concludes things with Majima and Makoto, as well as showing what caused Majima to step away from the Yakuza and start up a construction company.",1654712134,1654712134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the first game in the series that uses the Dragon Engine, and you can really tell that the devs tried to do everything they could with it. Some people complain about the graphics being too bloom-y and water looking but I don't have that complaint. There's also a LOT of cutscenes in this game, like 90% of the scenes that would normally be the textbox ones that you mash to skip are replaced by full on rendered cutscenes. Graphics still clean so I won't fuss about that either.

Now onto the most controversial part of the Dragon Engine, the ragdoll physics in fights. Yes, you're gonna miss the gameplay from the last 2 games. But the fighting in this game is by no means bad, chasing enemies who fly across the screen after a jab might be annoying but it can make some hilarious moments while playing. The upgrade system is alright, it actually made me eat at restaurants a lot in this game which is an achievement I guess? I used to just ignore them. Also, the first time I saw that you could walk in and out of buildings freely blew my mind.

Ryuji Goda is by far my favorite antagonist of the series so far. They set him up as a very basic person but take his character progression in a really interesting way towards the end, and the atmosphere set up by the final fight is my favorite in the series so far as well, it feels like you get injected with so much testosterone and adrenaline. The fight itself on the other hand, not so much to be honest. It honestly went by so fast, that I didn't even get to the best part of the OST by the time I finished. The boss OSTs in this game slap by the way.

Notably this game is the most expensive in the series for some reason, maybe because of the Majima Saga. Honestly it's 3 chapters full of fanservice. The main plot is pretty basic, but what can you expect from what's basically a mini arc. But the fanservice part, this saga delivers so so well. Won't get into the details here but showing the player the serious Majima still buried deep below for almost 20 years is great. You play through his saga and start tearing up, you head into a karaoke bar and he sings Shiawase Nara ii Ya and you start bawling. 

Long story short, this game is definitely a recommend. It'll take a while to get used to all the changes from the Dragon Engine but when the game starts to get good, it gets really good. Expect the same great substories and minigames (I love the return of the cabaret club, although I haven't actually started on it). And hey, 3 games in, only 4 more games left so you might as well go all in. Well now, you're gonna have to start the black sheep of the series, Yakuza 3.

Yakuza Kiwami 2 is one of those games that fall flat on a few aspects but make up for it in every other one. Story as usual is superb and one of the best in the franchise in my opinion. Ending had me in awe after I finished my favorite boss fight of all time. Gameplay is where it becomes pretty subpar considering the original Y2 had amazing combat. Difficulty is a lot easier compared to the rest of the games, lock on is broken in the aspect of where it doesn't lock on to an enemy if you're not facing him, and the fighting style was reworked to better suit the engine albeit a bit futile if you ask me. As much as I love the Dragon Engine and it's ragdoll physics, it just doesn't suit Kiryu's fighting style considering it was built around the engines where wall bounding was a mechanic. This engine better suits a certain lawyer-turned-private investigator's fighting styles if you know what I mean (and to that extent his ex-yakuza partner). One redeeming factor of the game however is the return of the cabaret club minigame in which I know a lot of us who played Y0 enjoyed to the fullest. Certain characters from that minigame also return along with new faces. As it is a DE game, many people who're fresh off Yakuza Kiwami will find a lot of aspects reworked like the inventory system, nerfed Tiger Drop, and no loading screens when entering a building (with a few exceptions). Graphics in the DE are amazing which enhances cutscenes by a lot, but it goes without saying that it's a lot heavier than the previous titles. [url=https://youtu.be/EichdGKOnh0]Luckily, playing at 30 fps in this game is actually preferable which is explained in this video right here[/url]. Substories have that essential Yakuza wackiness in them alongside the minigames. The soundtrack is arguably my favorite of the series and I am still mad this is one of the games that had a limited soundtrack release. Overall it's a good game that's somewhat limited by it's gameplay but still a pretty enjoyable experience.",1653206389,1653206538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered ""Goodbye"", she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again,
But I know...
This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before

Repair your broken wings

Combat 
The combos are quite bland since the removal of different styles. It's all the same stuff but you can do a couple of cool moves like a special heat move with companions if you happen to be traveling with any at the time of the fight. Also there are many many items to use and the inventory system is a bit less painful to use. Overall the heat moves are the same but there are special ones you can perform on some bosses so that's a new plus.  

Stats
Seems like they don't let you go quite as crazy in this one you won't find yourself rampaging through everything. If you have money you can max out in a couple of hours. The fastest route is to do the hostess club and max out how much your hostesses can earn as well as how much you take home. After you make around 20 Million yen look up the best places to eat and the combo meals. Max out how much you can eat and how much exp you get from food. 


Story 
Well like any Yakuza game get ready for at least half of your time to be spent on taking in cut-scenes.

1. Görsel olarak hem 0 hem de ilk kiwami'den daha başarılı bir iş çıkartılmış.
2. Etraftaki nesne ve yapılarla etkileşim ciddi bir oranda arttırılmış. (Nesnelerin parçalama efektleri güzelleştirilmiş, yapılara özel takılma veya sendeleme animasyonları eklenerek oyun dünyası içerisindeki varlıkları daha hissedilir hale getirilmiş).
3. ""Clan Creator"" ve önceki oyunlarda da yer alan ""Cabaret Club"" gibi oldukça eğlenceli yine bir dünya mini-game eklemiş yapımcılar. (Hiç şüphesiz bu ekip mini-game yapmayı çok ama çok iyi beceriyor).
4. Yan görevler (Substory) oldukça güzel hikayelere sahipler ve sonlarını merak ettirmeyi başarabiliyorlar.
5. Dövüşler ve boss fightlar kararında, güzel ve akıcıydı.
6. Sotenbori bölgesi 0'dan sonra yeniden dönmeyi hep istediğim bir bölge olmuştu. Ne yazık ki yapımcı ekip bize kiwami'de bu şansı sunmamıştı ama bu oyunda istediğiniz zaman taxi'ler aracılığıyla sotenbori'ye gitmemize imkan sunmuşlar ve ben bunu çok sevdim. Özellikle 0'dan sonra güncellenmiş bir görselliğe sahip sotenbori bölgesine resmen dibim düştü. Keşke ana senaryo içerisinde daha fazla vakit geçirseydik.
7. Biraz sona doğru kaldı ama oyunun ana senaryosundan da bahsetmek lazım. Özellikle 0'nun ana senaryosunu çok sevip ilk kiwami'nin ana senaryosunu özellikle 0'ya kıyasla daha zayıf bulmuş birisi olarak bu oyunun senaryosundan tam olarak istediğim her şeyi aldım. Dişli bir baş düşman, sürekli odağı değişen, bulmaca gibi başlayıp siz ilerledikçe çözümlenen ve kesinlikle bir an olsun temposunu kaybetmeyen oldukça iyi bir ana senaryosu var.

(-)
1. Her ne kadar gözüm sürekli ""Pocket Circuit"" gibi güzel ve eğlenceli bir mini-game arasa da ne yazık ki bulamadım.
2. Sanki özellikle 0'ya kıyasla dövüşler çok daha sıkıcı ve tek düze bir hale gelmiş gibi hissettim. (Yanlış anlamayın dövüşler eğlenceli ama 0'yu oynadıktan sonra bu oyunun sunduğu çeşitlilik sanki yeterli değil gibi geldi).
3. ""Clan Creator Bundle"" denen DLC'yi almazsanız eğer oyunun mini-game'lerinde özellikle de en başlarda baya bi zorlanıyorsunuz.
4. 0 ve kiwami oyunlarında video izleme seçeneğimiz vardı. Bu videolar genelde cinsel içerikli videolarda yer alan japon bacılarımızın yaptıkları (bence) tuhaf danslarını içeren ve zararsız, sadece komik olan kısa videolardı ve anlamadığım bir şekilde bu oyunda da video izleme var ama siz izlemiyorsunuz. Siz video'yu izleyen Kiryu abimizi izliyorsunuz. Ulan ne saçma salak bir dizayn seçimidir bu! Ben neden aq Kiryusunu izliyorum ekrandan ""ah uh"" diye sesler gelirken. Madem videoyu göstermek istemediniz abi o zaman toptan bu etkinliği kaldırın oyundan. Hayır yani böyle aşırı saçma ve gereksiz bir hale gelmiş.

Sonuç: Yakuza Kiwami 2, kiwami oyunundan kat ve kat daha iyi ama bence hala 0'dan eksik kalan pek çok kısıma sahip olan tam olarak 2 oyunun arasına yerleştirebileceğimiz bir yapım olmuş. Oyunda negatif olarak hatırladığım neredeyse hiçbir şey yok, bahsettiklerim de o kadar önemli değil zaten.

The biggest drawback of this title is the optimization, or rather the lack of it. After this part it will be strange to fire up 3, 4 and 5 where they are only remasters, with old combat system and general gameplay mechanics, but we have no other choice.

Starts out really good but quickly diminishes its potential. The Omi yakuza war is so interesting and fun conpaired to the jing won mafia plot with the detective woman that takes up so much of the game that most of the games story feels wasted. Go Ryu is such a badass who is given hardly any screen time. Honestly all of the Omi alliance had potential to be a bad ass villain league but they are not used at all in the story and only do much at the beginning and the end. Also the game has some of the most generic not relevant subplots I have ever seen. Like actually sub story level stuff that must be completed. Once I realized what they were I skipped over them. like I said the story has its moments but alot holding it back.

Majima storyline:  
The Majima saga is really short and just exists to give Kiryu and money boost if you do the side content. story wise if it just exists to set up some of the events of the main game and it plays out in a similar way. Only exception to this is the makato stuff. Its so wholesome to follow up from the Majimas plot in yakuza 0 and is the only Ark Majima goes through.

Combat and gameplay:
Dragon engine looks really nice but the combat is generally a downgrade from yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1. Lot more lose and floaty which inst bad but mainly misses the mark in terms of variety and options in attacking. The fighting is not bad its just its not as good. but it can be very rewarding when you get good at it. 

Dragon engine: 
Its awesome. No more looking at somewhere and not being able to go to there. No more loading screens in between areas. exploring the cities is flawless and still really fun to do. 

Substories:
Not much to say here. They are still really funny. this game has some of the bests like the baby one, the photo shoot, the voice acting gig. Brilliant work here.

Conclusion: Honestly if you played and liked yakuza 0 and kiwami 1 your gonna have to play this one. even with its plot failures its a true yakuza experience an you cant skip out on it.

In that case, make sure you memorize the PS button layout, I am still working on that haha. Anyway, the story is a masterpiece, and easily one of the best in the series.

Starting this game after playing 0 and Kiwami, you'll notice something quite quickly: the removal of battle styles. At first, I thought this would impact my experience negatively, but I quickly learned that fights felt a lot more fluid and upgrading Kiryu felt more impactful. His move set overall felt very well balanced with lots of offensive and defensive tools at his disposal. This game also comes with the addition of ""Extreme Heat Mode"" which turns Kiryu into an absolute beast. Komaki Tiger Drop being nerfed was desperately needed for combat to not become absolutely trivial like it did by the end of Kiwami.

The storyline, while at first felt rather shallow and boring in comparison to the previous titles, ended up being a very meticulously crafted and emotionally driven narrative which left me crying at the end. While at first I disliked the cast, over time I grew to respect their characters the more the game delved into their story. You'll find yourself revisiting a lot of old places, while also meeting a lot of new faces. Overall a very well executed and concise experience.

Cabaret Club management returns alongside a new ""Clan Creator"" mode where you join Majima and his construction company. The cabaret mode remains just as fun as ever. Clan Creator, while I don't personally enjoy the RTS-style gameplay, is quite honestly entertaining merely by its concept and execution. It retains enough charm to keep me hooked.

And of course, the classic Yakuza humor is around to stay. TL;DR this game is 100% worth its full price. If you can grab it on sale, do not hesitate.",1648297863,1648297863,True,14,1,0.676416993141174316,0,True,False,False

It has flaws, but I still love it. You'll most likely start the game thinking the main antagonist is incredibly boring and one-note, only to come out of the game's ending at LEAST respecting him a shit ton. While a couple of the early chapters can drag on a bit, and the main antagonist becomes absent for a long time, there were times that I would forget that it's a faithful remake of a PS2 era game from 2006. Plus, the music enhances the impact of the most emotional beats to an insane degree. No other game has made me tear up during the final battle, before.

Oh yeah, the Jingweon Mafia plot is there too... The plotline regarding Ryuji Goda and the whole ""Two Dragons"" thing with him and Kiryu is honestly one of my favorite stories in a video game, but I'm not going to pretend I cared about like 95% of the Jingweon Mafia parts of the story at all. Hell, I completely overlooked it and had to edit this review when I remembered that it existed. I'm still able to find great joy in the overall story, but that secondary plot about the Korean Mafia did nothing but add like 5 twists that had no impact whatsoever during the last 2 chapters. If you ignore like 90% of that plotline, this game's story comes out to be like a 8.5/10, in my eyes.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
I could go on and on about the variety of actual things to do as a result of all the minigames, but when it comes to the main focus, the combat, this game is absolutely wonderful. Nearly every hit and technique is incredibly visceral and satisfying to use and land, regardless of their actual practicality. Landing one of those finishers in Extreme Heat Mode that let you get extra damage by mashing Y during the zoom in is the sorta feeling that makes you feel incredibly powerful in a way many games can only dream of. The combat is kinda similar to Mario 64 in that it's pretty easy to get into at first, and while there's no need for the average player to master it, putting in the work to get better at it is so satisfying that it's worth it just for that feeling you get after you pull off something sick. 

The only issue I have with this game's combat is a single enemy type, that being the large fellas holding furniture during some of the extended combat sequences that require you to wait for them to use their telegraphed, armored singular attack so you can slowly chip away at their health. The loss of the heat action from Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 that allows you to one-hit them stings. But thankfully, they aren't used that much, so it doesn't bog down the overall experience much, if at all.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
The Dragon engine is visually such a huge upgrade from the engine used in 0 and Kiwami 1 that it isn't even funny. I was genuinely shocked when I booted this game up totally blind and saw the streets of Sotenbori for the first time. Definition of a glow up.

[h1] Music [/h1]
The music is really fucking good, and it's utilized wonderfully. This is something you realize the instant you get into a street fight in Sotenbori and hear ""Outlaw's Lullaby"" for the first time.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
I got this game on sale, but in all honesty, I don't think I'd have any qualms with paying the full $30 for it if I knew I'd enjoy it as much as I did. I genuinely see myself going back to complete the substories, and other miscellaneous missions just so that I can continue to experience this game. 9/10.",1642077694,1647906354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Collectively, what they give you is some of the best gaming has to offer, and much of the praise I have for Kiwami 2 is echoed in what I'd say in a review of the others. I have a handful of qualms with Kiwami 2, most minor, but on the whole it's a Yakuza game. And that means it's very, very good and an easy recommendation. If you haven't played the series and are somehow stumbling on this review, start with Yakuza 0 then Kiwami 1, then play this game. But most importantly, play the Yakuza series. These games are insanely good.

With that out of the way, I'll give my thoughts on the good and bad of Kiwami 2:

The Good:

-No game series does humor as well as Yakuza, and that's as true here as in any other iteration. Yakuza isn't afraid to push boundaries, and some of the sidequests in particular are absurd in all the right ways. Somehow Yakuza is able to do this in between incredibly tense and dramatic story beats, all while playing the Japanese John Wick. I don't know how they pull off this tonal range but they do, and it's glorious.

-The drama really is amazing, though. I cried multiple times. And even though so many iconic characters have gotten killed off, they somehow find a way to add new ones and make me care for them. It's not a perfect story for sure; they might have gone a bit too far with the twists near the end, and I definitely prefer 0 and Yakuza 1's stories more, but there are so many scenes and set pieces here that I'll remember forever that it's hard to complain.

-As with the other games, Kiwami 2 is set in one of the most gorgeous, fully realized virtual worlds I've ever seen. What's especially appreciated here is that there are no load times when entering buildings! This really keeps the open world moving and is a huge difference maker.

-The facial animations, voice acting, and overall presentation are as good as ever. If you've played the others you've come to expect it but it really can't be overstated. These are damn good looking games.

-The Majima side mission they added that's exclusive to Kiwami 2 (and wasn't in the original Yakuza 2 at all) is incredible. So much so that it might be my favorite part of the whole game. Majima in general is one of my all-time favorite video game characters, and just about everything he's a part of in here is awesome.

-As with other Yakuza games, the variety of optional content is just absurd, and really helps immerse you in the open world. You won't like everything (I personally hate the Majima Construction minigame), but you'll certainly have fun with whatever side content appeals to you, and most of all you'll just enjoy that it's all there if you want it. Oh, and the Caberet Club is back, baby! ^_^

-You'll get so god damn cultured playing these games. I learned Mahjong and Shogi from Yakuza, for crying out loud. Hell I think my very rudimentary Japanese skills got better too. You might not know what a ""kuro gyaru"" is or much about gravure, but you will after playing Yakuza, and you know what that's freaking sick.

The Bad:

-My biggest qualm with this entry is the Dragon Engine. It's still quite enjoyable, but it streamlines things quite a bit, and thus pales in comparison to the depth of Y0 and Kiwami. Instead, the game seemed to put more emphasis on weapons and heat actions, which is fine, but truth be told most of them are absolutely broken. I struggled to find a playstyle that made the fights rewarding for me. If I played without weapons, it felt like combat was too simple, but when I played with weapons, everything was way too easy, even though I played on Hard difficulty. When you max out Kiryu, boss fights go down remarkably fast, and there's no worse example of this than the final sequence. The final fights ended up being super anticlimactic for me, and sure I could have gimped myself by playing with certain restrictions, but honestly the game gives you way too many tools to trivialize it.

-That isn't to say that Kiwami 2 is braindead easy; it's not hard by any means but rather it's mostly just uneven. Certain fights (Coliseum fights, Man in Black, etc) are legitimate challenges and others are over in a matter of seconds. I try not to use health items at all in Yakuza games, but I had to break that rule a few times in this one. Like I said, I found it hard to find a rewarding playstyle.

Minor gripes:
-Enemies on the overworld aren't rewarding / engaging. They don't drop much money or experience, so you mostly just want to avoid them. But so many spawn that it's tough. It doesn't take long to beat them down, but sometimes you just want to go from point A to point B.

-The earlygame is paced quite slowly. A lot of time is spent on a new character (Daigo Dojima) but then he's pretty much thrown away and discarded as the story progresses. The game picks up as it goes on, but it takes a bit to get going.

-Continues after dying don't always just send you right back into the fight. Y0 and Kiwami did it correctly so I'm surprised this is a problem in this one.

-If you read quickly and don't let animations fully play out, there is a lot of animation jitter between each text box. You'll get used to it, but it's one of the first things you'll notice in an otherwise highly polished game.

-Some of the cut content from the original Yakuza 2 is a big time bummer. Most of the music doesn't make a return, and there's even a small ""third city"" called Sinseicho that isn't in this one at all (they incorporate it into Sotenbori instead). There's a substory where you play as a host (so sort of reverse caberet club) that's cut too and apparently that's one of the best. Kiwami 2 is still by far the definitive Yakuza 2 experience at this point, and other than the music, none of that stuff is all that important, but it doesn't quite have the accuracy to the original that Kiwami 1 had, and that's a shame.

As with it's updated predecessors, Kiwami 2 offers a deep consistent experience as Kiryu (and to an extent, Majima in his three bonus chapters) in our old stomping grounds of Kamurocho and Sotenbori, with all the bells and whistles of the other two games almost completely in tact.

Now, this is understandably not always a good thing, as anyone who has played mini-games can explain, playing crane game and considerably obtuse (arguably under explained to hell and back) Japanese gambling games get's extremely old, extremely fast, and having most games reappear between titles, with a whole new slew of challenges with em can be a tad tedious.

Which is fine, as frankly that is all optional!

In this title, every single upgrade is determined by a few factors, which are mostly sub-stories, and of course, experience. How do you get experience? Doing literally anything! Including simply eating out at the diners, or just punching dudes. It's very easy to bring Kiryu to god status long before end game; especially if you are focused on the real meat of the game, the sub-stories.

 Although a good chunk of these are dedicated to 'allies' around both cities. Many of the stories are very well fleshed out, offering a great experience, even if arguably the rewards tend to be a tad random, or even lacking if they aren't unlocking employees for both of the main sub story games, or techniques for Kiryu to learn. Still, the characters are the biggest reward.

To bring it to a head, the combat, as the main draw point of the game, is considerably a comfortable middle ground of the game play of Zero and Kiwami 1.
 The engine is extremely well used for insane ragdoll physics, leading to some of the crunchiest violence this side of Japan. 
Of course the strange lack of the Brawler, Beast and Rush makes the over all options of the game some what lesser, as Kiryu by default uses his Dragon/Legend style, albeit much more free form.
 One could say it's more accurate to the original experience, and of course the weapons system got an overhaul that ultimately replaces the three styles giving Kiryu many options outside of fist fighting.

Finally, we have the main story. Continuing a year after Kiwami, and offering story of duty, honour and keeping tradition in the face of a changing world, where traditional Yakuza are slowly petering out in the face of a new more business focused Yakuza. With a focus on Kiryu coming to terms with the events of last year, and finding his own path with Haruka as his adoptive daughter.

While the story is utterly fantastic, and gets the 'made me tear up' award just as the other games have done, I personally found the double dipping of Cabaret from Zero with extremely few changes to the formula, and the over all lacking of a certain something to the Clan Creator mode. 
As well as a few too many places where the game said 'Go mess around or do all these things with Haruka.' when I arguably felt that the game should have just kept going to the finish line (especially when I have to redo mini games that I've already done, just for Haruka).

In the end, I absolutely adored Yakuza Kiwami 2. A story always worth watching, and action worth playing... of course, I have no intent to replay it, as 30 of the 64 hours was spent on effectively grinding Kiryu up with the repetitive Cabaret, and consuming Millions of Yen worth of food and digestive medication. Not exactly the most engaging way of power progression. However, past that grind was a deep, emotional, gut wrenching story about a man literally to powerful to die, suffering in order to regain a home in his broken life.

It has a great story, a great set of characters, great action and combat, great music, a lot of activities in the game itself and amazing visuals - in spite of a lot of 2D being used on 3D objects it has more detail and is more appealing than many 3D games out nowadays. It goes to show how old-fashioned game design was truly something else. 
Add to that a more streamlined EXP gain system as well as training and a faster combat system as well makes the gameplay a bit more entertaining than it's predecessors, small changes yet enough to make it feel fresh.
And that Majima Sub story almost brought a tear to my eye, if you ever play this game make sure you play those chapters as well, they are not part of the main story but it is a must and its very short.

TLDR;
Pros:
- Great Story, though Yakuza 0 still trumps it in this regard.
- Great characters and voice acting.
- Great Music.
- Very fun and easy combat system.
- A lot of activities in-game.

The jump in graphics after playing Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami is jaw-dropping with the dragon engine making the cities of Kamurocho and Sotenbori feel more alive than ever. The ability to explore the city with barely any restrictions is liberating and even though the physics can be janky and goofy at times, I feel that it adds even more charm to Yakuza Kiwami 2.

The combat is very different from Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami and I'll admit to the fact that it is not as good. Does it mean that it is bad? No, not at all. Yes, the weird physics and hit boxes can be infuriating at times and the combat does feel very stiff at times. However, if we look at it on it's own without comparing it to Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami, it is still good and is still quite fun with satisfying heat moves and combos.

The music may not be as good as Yakuza 0 but it is comparable with Yakuza Kiwami with some notable hits like Outlaw's Lullaby and A Scattered Moment.

Lastly, the story. The story takes many twists and turns and it can be quite predictable at times. Furthermore, the plot does take a dip in quality at certain points but overall, the story is still amazing with plenty of badass and emotional moments. The most memorable experiences from this story personally was the reunion of Kiryu and Majima and the final battle against Ryuji.

Overall, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a great game. I highly recommend anyone to play this game but there is the downside of the game being a sequel so to get the maximum amount of enjoyment from Yakuza Kiwami 2, it is also highly recommended to complete both Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami first before jumping into this one.",1645534016,1645534016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are nice, the story so far is... decent, not bad, and there are a lot of cool minigames & other stuff to do. But the combat... man, at least in hard mode enemies are blocking and side-stepping 90% of the time (except for random thugs maybe) while your side-step sucks balls at the beginning, so your only options are to parry (which is annoying considering that positioning yourself in combat is rather sluggish) or to spam some weapons or heat moves, which at least for me is not fun.

It is quite enjoyable. Found the ragdoll mechanics little weird and funny. Shouldn't have done that but it is understandable since the Yakuza 3-4-5 are remasters instead of remakes, they made it so that it will be more comfortable for players going for the future installations of Yakuza game. (Havnt played Y3-5 yet) 

The Graphics are magnificient, i thought it'll be the same as previous two games, but this time, they over did it, my pc couldnt give 75 frames at highest settings, had to tone it down a little.  Beautiful Graphics. Impressive, very nice. 

The new hunger system and exp grind is also very enjoyable, you dont necesarrily have to grind, but even if you want to, it is damn well enjoyable. 


You can skip thugs/hooligans in this game. This is actually nice. 

when playing earlier yakuza games, sometimes you just didnt wanna fight them,even if you could beat them up in 30 secs, sometimes it felt bothersome, hence u can run away from them in this game cuz of the new engine they made. P.S (people who cry about hooligans, stfu about it lol)

The story is crazy, will keep you hooked up to it, but don't expect it to be as good as Yakuza 0 or Kiwami 1 Story. Even though the story is god damn crazily good, I still prefer Yakuza 0 and 1 Story over this. 

Dumb readers, who think it's gonna be bad only cuz i rated it 3rd, just cuz it's 3rd doesnt mean its gonna be bad. It is hella fucking lit. Amazing Story.


Lovely Side missions, gonna keep u hooked. 

Cons of this game 

- I find the ragdoll mechanics little funny, not bad,but kinda ruins the aspect of the game, when you see someone so awesome as enemies flying like dolls. So yeah that's the only con i think this game has for me.

The entire game is amazing.

Overall my rating is 9/10 for the entire game

Positives:
I don't mind this new combat. Less options than 0 and Kiwami 1 had. No longer are you switching between 3 fighting styles(Or 4 if you do some grinding). It's a lot more simple and I personally don't see too many issues outside of the ""Lock on"" being too clunky for some boss fights. The new way to level up your strength is a bit  better too. I don't like how you ""Learn"" a new heat option in game, but then have to ""Unlock"" it again even though you just learned it but whatever. New engine looks great. Ragdolls are hilariously janky if you hit them just right.

Story is.....fine I guess. I liked a lot of it but some parts of it just lost me completely for how convenient some things were. I have yet to play the extra Majima story but I can still recommend the main game.


Negatives:

Gripes are the grinding needed for the cabaret club to complete all the sub stories. I found myself pretty bored about an hour into it. I don't mind SOME grinding I mean hell I grinded almost all of my stats to max just by getting every food item through the game and upgrading everything. Even with upgrading the cabaret club exp and money earned to max it was still crushingly slow so I dropped it. Maybe I'll finish it later.

Majima Construction. I don't like this type of gameplay. Top down ordering troops around. Not for me, I played 4 of the games before just dropping it. 

One of the sub stories needed you to be very good at majong (Thankfully there's a ""Cheat item"" you can use right above this area to easily pass this challenge but still).

[h1] 1: Combat [/h1]

Unpopular opinion,but the combat is absolutely clunky and sluggish in this game coming from Y0 or YK1 where the combat there was fluid and just perfect. Sure there are new heat actions that are pretty hilarious not gonna lie,and using weapons is better than the previous games,but you mainly wanna use your fists and kicks in these games. Kiryu feels like exactly like everyone describes him in combat,an old man,he moves slow,barely can dodge anything and he does not feel like the Dragon of Dojima that we know him of.

As for Majima,the combat is pretty good but with only 2 heat actions of it`s own which is pathetic for an iconic character like him.

[h1] 2: Story [/h1]

Skip this part as it will contain spoilers (duh) if you haven't played the game yet. 
At first,i didn't like Ryuji,as I thought he would be the stereotypical brute villain but no,he shows us all how much of a giga chad he is,I mean,he had plenty of opportunities to kill Kiryu,but no,he likes a fair fight,even returning Haruka back to Kiryu after Ryuji killed that fat fuck of a Omi Patriarch that i`m not bothered to remember his name that kidnapped Haruka.
The romance between Kiryu and Kaoru made me giggle like a school girl when it happened.
Insert KSI`s ""YES YES YES"" meme here.
And the many plot twists that happen in the final chapters of this game mess with your mind but in general it`s a pretty good story,and i honestly dunno if i prefer this,Y0 or K1`s main story as i love all of them.

[h1] 3: Majima Saga [/h1]

A short prequel before the events of the main story of this game. All i can say is that it`s short but sweet at the end.

[h1] 4: Substories [/h1]

They are pretty good,there are some famous ones like the ""Be my baby"" one or the ghost tape one. They are full of quality too which mind remind you of Y0`s substories which some of them will reference back i think.

[h1] 5: Cabaret Grand Prix [/h1]

Yeah,i know it`s a recycled minigame from Y0,it`s still the best one in this game too,with some QOL improvements and overall being better than in the game it originated from. Koyuki best girl,change my mind.

[h1] 6: Soundtrack [/h1]

Decent enough,not that many memorable pieces maybe except the final Ryuji boss fight one,but outside of that,meh.

[h1] 7: Conclusion [/h1]

If you are a fan of Yakuza,this is a must play,despite some flaws with the combat thanks to the new engine,it`s still a fun game to experience,to laugh and cry with.

The story kind of gets convoluted and ass-pully too, especially near the end, but it kind of plays into the tone the game is going for I think.  Stuff that doesn't really make sense logically, but it makes for an exciting moment are things I can forgive a lot of the time.  What I CAN'T forgive are the removal of movies during karaoke for slideshows of past moments in games.  What were they thinking?  By far the worst move.

The presentation, graphics, and gameplay are the best in the series so far. There is so much to love about this game. I'll start with the elephant in the room: the new engine. It makes the game actually look and play like a triple-A title. It's such a breath of fresh air to be able to walk in and out of every building without having it load every time. Though what's easily the best part of the engine is its physics. It has one of the most unrealistic physics engines I've ever seen and yet it fits so perfectly.

As for the actual gameplay, whether it be combat or side quests, it's also a hefty improvement. The combat has the best progression in the series so far and it feels so much smoother. Plus, the physics engine elevates it even further. The side quests are also at their best in the series. You do stuff like fight a yakuza family with a baby kink, pose for shirtless pictures while being photographed by a man in his underwear, and voice act sex scenes in an upcoming video game. They are also a few new side activities like the hilarious peeing minigame and the softcore porn photoshoot nobody wants to admit they completed. I have to give a small shoutout to the Bouncer missions where you fight through a bunch of goons. It made me really appreciate the game's combat. Also the Karaoke is great as always. The first song I played was Tonight which made me quite sad for reasons I don't want to spoil. The Cabaret Club also returns with a few slight improvements (except I preferred the music from Yakuza 0). 

And then there's the outstanding presentation. It's wonderful to watch Kiryu pop a glass of champagne in the Cabaret Club or perform a slew of entertaining heat actions. The presentation is at its best when in boss fights. Nearly every boss intro is super badass, with the final boss being one of the coolest fights I've ever seen in a video game. The music also puts these fights on another level. I had no clue some soft piano could set the tone of a fight so well.

And of course I wouldn't forget about Majima. He runs his own construction company which is actually a full-fledged MOBA. Whether you like it or not, it's quite impressive that they put this much effort into a Majima side quest. This might be a bit of a spoiler but he shoves himself into the Caberet Club Tournament which is a great callback to Yakuza 0. But there is a short side story you gradually unlock while playing the main game called the Majima Saga which basically catches us up to why he started Majima Construction. This next sentence is another spoiler. Makoto Makimura has a humble appearance in the Majima Saga and it is by far the most emotionally powerful part of the game. The same goes for Majima's ending in Yakuza 0. They were both enough to choke me up.

I don't have much to say about the main story but I think Ryuji Goda is the best villain in the series so far since he actually is somewhat humanized. I also have the story to thank for some great memes like when Kiryu slams a table and aggressively opens a door. The story is decent. Not amazing and not bad.

Overall, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is probably the best game in the series. I prefer Yakuza 0 a little bit because of the story, but Kiwami 2 made such a massive improvement on the gameplay. Even if this is the only Yakuza game you ever play, you will love it.",1643957698,1643958688,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gone is the smooth, precise, arcade-y feel, replaced by some weird mush of Rockstar Games physics and mediocre brawler mechanics with stylish heat actions added on top. The lack of diversity in movesets really hurts, and the developers have compensated for this by making boss battles significantly shorter. Kiwami 1 may have issues with difficulty, but it eventually forced you to memorise a huge arsenal of powerful moves, and that ended up being a far more rewarding experience. Kiwami 2 greatly oversimplifies combat to the extent it starts feeling brainless, and does absolutely nothing to force players to deeply engage with the system, because there is little depth to begin with.

But apart from that, this is definitely a huge step up from its prequel. The story, presentation, and characters are improved across the board. Even the music is pretty good, and the minigames are really great too. 

Seeing Kamurocho and Sotenbori for the first time with these graphics is probably worth the price of admission on its own, but there are also serious technical problems with this release. The aliasing is absolutely horrendous, and the game often hitches just before heat action prompts show up, which makes combat unbelievably annoying.

Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10, same as I gave Kiwami, on the strength of the presentation and story alone. My quest to chase the high of Yakuza 0 continues.",1643134696,1643260915,True,1,0,0.501754403114318848,0,True,False,False

This makes it extremely difficult to hit your attacks since u have manually guide all of your hits while the boss can easily hit all of theirs. Technically speaking you can lock-in by clicking your scrolling key in your mouse...but know what the problem is? As soon as you let go of scrolling key your lock immediately dissipates. And you know what is great about this game? You can't customize the controls. I wanted to switch the lock-on feature on my left Ctrl key and guess what? It's impossible! there is a control setting on the Options menu, but certain actions are always fixed to default setting. (For example, Left Click=weak attack, Right click=Heavy attack, Middle key/Scrolling key=Lock on, these settings are unchangeable unfortunately)   
Another thing that ticked me off was that there was literally no counter-play u can employ against the enemy especially the bosses . You can't parry enemy attacks, u can't dodge enemy attacks (u technically can but since you move so little u end up getting hit anyway), u can block enemy attacks but that doesn't mean a thing since u can't counterattack afterwards (they will dodge it). Also have I mentioned that you can't use strong attacks during the boss fights? Even if u do stun them for 1~3 seconds, as soon as u right click (heavy attack) they are immediately ""cleansed"" and will dodge=>counterattack right away. And when bosses dodge unlike u they slide a good meter or 2, whereas ur dodge stretches for a couple of centimeters, can't believe I forgot to mention that.

Don't think I'll get any more progress on this game though. First of all, let me say this is a good game. If you've played any of the previous games, you'll enjoy this one. It follows much of the same recipe and that should be what you're looking for. That said, I'll give my opinion on this game.

The story is good. It's not great. I really loved the previous two games, and this one had some unexpected twists, but the character writing felt off for a lot of characters, There were a lot of times when characters just acted weird and strangely.. out of character, I suppose. Either way, it's pretty good, even if the ending had a bit too much 'but really, I'm the culprit!' 'no, -I- am the culprit', etc.

However, what would define this game for me, and what I would advise against, is the grind. This game has a lot of minigames and I am a sucker for completion. However, doing that will be a struggle. Oh you want to do colliseum? Sure, here's a million things to grind through. Oh you want to run a cabaret club, here's a million openings to grind through. Oh you want to run majima's construction, here's a million battles to grind through. I did most of the grinds, but couldn't get myself to do them all. Probably don't.

My advice for this game? Play it a bit. Do the things you like, leave the things you don't really like. Only 100% this game if you *really* want to, but probably don't get bogged down in the grind like I did. You'll enjoy the game better.",1642476141,1642476141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It takes some time to get used to after Zero and Kiwami, yet it's the most hilarious game of the first trilogy. The content devs added to this remaster is like 50% of the base game. I'm 90 hours in yet I can't say I've experienced everything Kiwami 2 has to offer.

The only downsides I noticed are: XP-based progression doesn't work as smooth as intended, saving slots are limited, one substory is locked behind the mahjong match (you can cheese through it tho).

What I can only praise: colliseum free-for-all mode with 8 fighters, re-introduction of the Cabaret club minigame (now it's the main cashcow), tower-defense minigame of Majima Construction. All spiced up with exhausting level of interior\exterior design and absurdly surreal physics.

The main theme of identity is executed pretty well with its twists and turns wrapped in a mystery-crime-drama tale. With lots of tension throughout the campaign, the game still manages to find some breathing space to develop Kiryu and other characters's relationship, mainly Osaka Division 4 police Kaoru Sayama, Jiro Kawara and Omi Alliance's Dragon of Kansai, Ryuji Goda.

These main characters are trying to find the answer (except Ryuji Goda as he is the villain) to the mystery surrounding foreign mafia and Yakuza local war as each of them later struggles to cope with the newly found answers to their past. How they deal with their identities is what is the center of Yakuza Kiwami 2's core, with Kiryu thrown into the mix with his own struggle over a certain character death.

in terms of gameplay, Kiwami 2 is a very superb one as well, with its streamlined fighting style, brutal Heat Actions, responsive controls and great sound design. What is noteworthy is its massive new contents including Majima Construction; a real time strategy minigame and Cabaret Grand Prix minigame which is a continuation to Yakuza 0's Cabaret Club minigame, among other minigames.

Looking at its characters and story alone, it's easy to see why Yakuza 2 is fan-favorite but along with this Kiwami 2 treatment, it ends up being as one of the best and most immersive Yakuza game ever with story full of genuine human emotions and fun gameplay.",1642326796,1642326796,True,0,0,0.49550214409828186,0,True,False,False

Looking back I'd say Yakuza 0 is definitely the best one out of the three. It certainly has the best story, and the graphics are not 100% up to par with the third game but they're right up there still. Go play it, it's a cool and interesting story and at the same time there is plenty of fun and silliness too.

The second game (Kiwami ""1"" if you will) was definitely the weakest. Graphics wise it's a big step back, and moreover the story is short and just kinda meh. [spoiler]Majima is reduced to nothing but a bad joke, which I found awful especially after him being such a strong character in Yakuza 0.[/spoiler]. At the beginning of Kiwami 2 you can choose to watch a quick recap of the events from the second game, and honestly that's enough to get the gist of it. You're really not missing much if you just skip this one entirely.

The third game is certainly the prettiest one and it has some nice quality of life updates, e.g. being able to walk in and out of stores without any loading screens. The combat is simplified a little (no more different stances) but still loads of fun with all the situational special moves they added. As for the story... not as bad and not as short as 1, but not as great as 0 either.  [spoiler]Majima is still mostly there for comic relief but still they did a better job with him this time around.[/spoiler] The story and the missions toward the end are terrible (ugh that Osaka Castle level...). I'd say play this one only if you really loved 0 and want to see a little more of the city with a nice graphical update, but as far as the story goes try to keep your expectations low so you don't get disappointed too much.

There's no tension in the fights, the hit sounds are boring and lack punch, and without any variation of styles, you just kinda...keep punching. Till you win. It's very boring to me.

I hate the eating mechanic to make your stats better, it just takes so long, and you farm the hell out of one location. It's very tiring.

All right, looks like you've been on a Yakuza binge lately – you've already dealt with [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nuitcalme/recommended/638970/]the prologue[/url][/b] and [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nuitcalme/recommended/834530/]Kiwami[/url][/b], so now you're looking at Kiwami 2, most likely rubbing your hands and drooling (just a little) in anticipation🤤

Kiwami... You should be well aware by now that it means ""extreme"" in Japanese. Well, the name hasn't changed, the only new thing is the Arabic numeral at the end, so it should be more of the same, or at least very similar... right?

Well, it's a little bit of [b]yes[/b] and a big friggin' deal of [b]NO[/b]. Despite many core elements being kept largely the same – it's still a beat 'em up RPG with all-too-familiar plot devices and our sweet boy Kiryu gracing the streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori with his divine presence – Kiwami 2 still has a lot of notable differences from its predecessor, and I'd like to use the graciously allotted 8000 characters of available space here to tell you about them and not let you die of boredom in the process. 

So, buckle up and make yourself comfortable – we're sallying forth into the realm of the new Dragon Engine🐉
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2698075070
Here's the roadmap we're gonna follow:
[list]
    [*]💻 Performance drops – laptop owners beware!
    [*]💾 No loading screens when entering buildings – something you never thought you needed, but it's an absolute game changer.
    [*]🚲 Destructible environment – nothing says ""Fierce Dragon"" more than being able to decimate an entire office in 5 seconds.
    [*]🤸‍♂️ Ragdolls and new fighting [u]style[/u] – yes, singular.
    [*]🎮 Reworked experience, inventory and completion list – tastes differ, you may hate it or love it to bits. 
    [*]💋 ...and, last but not least, Horny Dragon – Kiryu will be finding himself in all kinds of sexy situations way more often than in both previous games combined.

[h3]Performance drops[/h3]
[quote]The happy owners of desktop PCs may heave a sigh of relief, but for those with laptops I shall be the bearer of bad news – the Dragon Engine may just be way too awesome for our weak-аss computers to comfortably handle. I experienced virtually no lag or stutters in Zero and Kiwami, but Kiwami 2 felt a lot more jittery with constant FPS drops. I got used to it fairly quickly though – most of us are ready to sacrifice a lot for a pretty picture, and in this game, it's a pretty picture all right😍[/quote]

[h3]Loading screens begone![/h3]
[quote]One of the reasons for performance issues on lower-end PCs is that the open world actually became open for the first time in the series. You can walk into stores and buildings in general without having to stare at black loading screens, and I'm honestly at a loss for words to express how much it adds to the level of immersion. The streets of Kamurocho are finally full of people and objects now, too. It all just feels so alive. The first time I launched the game, I spent two hours just walking everywhere and staring at signs and taking pictures and selfies and oh god you can climb onto the roof?!😲[/quote] 

[h3]Destructible environment[/h3]
[quote]The Dragon of Dojima should not be stopped dead in his tracks by a measly traffic cone. Now, the traffic cone will obediently fuсk off to the side, as well as crates, bicycles, signs, benches, people... You can go eat at a restaurant and then destroy it completely in a fight with a group of thugs. The owner, scared out of their wits, will tell you to leave and will not sell anything.[/quote]

[h3]Ragdolls and the new fighting style[/h3]
[quote]Bicycles and traffic cones won't be the only things flying around Kamurocho and Sotenbori – don't forget about the lifeless bodies of slain enemies colliding with (and subsequently destroying) shop windows and patio tables. Yes, you only get to use one moveset – but even then, the combat feels very satisfying due to being a lot more... [i]""realistic""[/i]. Not realistic as in ""strictly obeying the laws of physics"", but realistic as in ""enemies don't have the same falling animation"".[/quote]

[h3]Experience, inventory and completion list[/h3]
[quote]...have been completely revamped, and I think I spent at least several hours getting the hang of the new system. I don't wanna get too deeply into the details, so let's just say this:

> EXPERIENCE, LEVELLING AND UPGRADES – the new approach is way more complex, but it's also more fun and rewarding, with a billion unlockable skills and ways to earn experience points;
> INVENTORY – having 10 of each recovery item has made the game a cakewalk... for the most part;
> COMPLETION LIST – won't show completion percentage anymore, but will tell you exactly what you need to do in order to fulfil each requirement.[/quote]

[h3]Horny Dragon[/h3]
[quote]Let's be honest – we all love the trademark zany Japanese humour, especially when it's about all things racy and lewd. This is the niche they excel in, and you'll find more than enough of that juicy stuff in this entry of the series.

[h2]Majima Saga[/h2]
You won't be able to play as Majima (everyone's favourite cute little angel) in the main story, but you'll get a bite-sized DLC to enjoy for a couple of hours. It will tell you about the important events between Kiwami and Kiwami 2 – standard-issue Yakuza drama, with a nice little emotional cherry on top.

Won't tell you what that cherry is exactly, but it hit me more than the entire main plot. By [i]""it hit me more""[/i] I mean that I was a sobbing mess, even in front of my girlfriend – and you will be, too, unless you're a heartless bastard😭

[h2]Various tidbits[/h2]

[tr]
	[td][b]Music.[/b] I don't know how they do this, but time and time again they surpass my soundtrack expectations. It's as brilliant as ever – this one freaking [b][url=https://youtu.be/ABraCjUkij0?t=110]SLAPS[/url][/b], man; no other song will get you more pumped for... managing a cabaret club with cute girls. However, the devs also choose strange songs to go with some of the most important cutscenes in the game, and you'll be put off initially, only to realise how genius the choice is a little bit later.[/td]
	[td]Take [b][url=https://youtu.be/-Twv8I4ve8U?t=61]this song[/url][/b], for example. When you hear it first, it sounds wonky and a bit stupid and out of place in impactful, emotional cutscenes... Suddenly, a minute later, you understand that it's possibly the greatest piece of Yakuza soundtrack of all time.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b]Completion.[/b] I would say it's the easiest of the three games to complete, save for one thing – bouncer missions, Kiwami 2's equivalent of Climax Battles. There are 26 (!) of them, each one in three difficulties, making it a total of 78 (!!!) 

With each one taking roughly four or five minutes, you can easily do the math and... Ye-e-eah...🙄[/td]
	[td]Not only is this a slog, but the last three missions are, for want of a better phrase, straight up fuсking unfair. Thankfully, you can pretty much cheese everything with a special equipment item. Classic Yakuza style – presenting the player with a broken challenge, but letting them use all the ""broken"", overpowered tools. Godspeed.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b]Friendly warning[/b] – you will be spoiled. Pampered by the luxurious splendour of the Dragon Engine, I now kinda have a hard time adjusting to the old-school, robotic feeling of Yakuza 3 Remastered...[/td]

*This review does NOT contain any spoilers about the story.

The new engine is really good, though the ragdolls are clunky. The major benefit of this engine is the ability to walk freely between interiors and exteriors, so an Open-World game, and also most of the cutscenes being rendered in the engine, so there's no disconnect between gameplay and cinematics.

One thing I do have to pick with this new engine is the fighting styles (or rather, the lack of them). Yep, Brawler, Rush, Beast, Dragon? Forget about them. In this game there's only one fighting style, which is a mix between those 4 kind of. It's alright, but this game is a little buggier than those made on the older engine (like Yakuza 0 and Kiwami). Heat actions icons not appearing, being stuck in side-stories (only happened once in a training sub-story), people flying across the battle field and so on. But, it still was fun so I can't really say anything.

The story is pretty good, Majima Saga just being a very nice, added bonus, that happens between Kiwami 1 and Kiwami 2 and dives into Majima's character, which I felt he deserved.

The extra content is fun and nice, maybe some annoying and confusing, but I'd say that's in the 2% of the time. There's so much to do, I actually kind of feel overwhelmed, but I enjoy the extra content so it's a good type of overwhelming. It's not necessary, but for those hungry for loads of content, it's there, don't worry.

The Cabaret Club minigame is pretty good, pretty much the same as Yakuza 0, maybe a little more refined.
I really enjoyed this minigame in 0 so I was very happy to see it back here.

Majima Construction for me just wasn't as fun. It's pretty hard to take care of all of your deployed units, but try it and see if it's something YOU might like. I played it a few times and that's it.

Overall, it's your standard Yakuza game, with loads to love and so much content you could sink 100's of hours into this game. It feels more fluid thanks to the new engine, though keep in mind it isn't as refined and bug-free as the old engine. Can't wait to finish the side content!",1642018049,1642018049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I get why, storywise, Kiryu doesn't use those styles anymore, but the combat in this one is just...languid; mobs aren't much of a threat, but bosses can dodge as much as they need and block every punch you throw at them, immediately staggering you out of your combo, while you're stuck with the one style that tries to balance everything from speed to power, and the fight becomes less of a punchy-punchy back-and-forth brawl and more of an opening-finding, poking, Heat action-spamming slogfest.

If there's one thing I genuinely enjoy out of the combat, though, it would be the Extreme Heat mode. What it does is: when your Heat gauge is full--as in, actually full to the brim and not just one section of it--instead of using Heat actions, you can activate Devil Trigger, raising your attack power, allowing you to pick up motorcycles, automatically swing nearby objects, and gain access to unique, ever-so-slightly more violent Heat actions. My favourite part, though, is that it changes the final blow of any heavy-attack string to a pseudo-QTE where the camera zooms into the enemy's face as it makes contact with Kiryu's fist or foot in slow motion and you have to rapidly press the heavy attack button to accumulate damage.

Aside from that, being a remake of the second game in the series and all, the writing isn't as compelling as, say, 0, and I found that multiple substories are almost quite literally just

Hostile: ""Hey punk, you gonna keep punking or do we have to beat the punk out of you?!""
Wee Lil Victim: ""Oh no, mister hostile! Please don't beat me senseless! Oh were it not for the absence of a gallant warrior here to rescue poor me in my time of need!""
[SUBSTORY: Ye Olde Harassment starts]
Kiryu: ""The only punk I see here is you""
Hostile: ""What was that, asshole?! I'll beat your punk ass too!""
[Kiryu beatdown noises]
Hostile: ""Forgive me, mister dragon! I shan't be a knave evermore! AIIIIEEEE!""
Ex-victim: ""Thank you, sir! I promise to repay this debt however I can!""
[SUBSTORY: Ye Olde Harassment CLEAR]

Then they unlock a situational Heat action. Not the most compelling substories.

The game looks great though, I'll give it that; doesn't give it any points in my book but there you go.

I'd say only get this game if you really want to experience Kiryu's entire saga or if you really, really just want another Yakuza to play.",1641956204,1641956204,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you played Yakuza Kiwami 1, the game follows the same basic format. Do some missions, get some cut scenes, get some twisty turny story, solve all the problems with your fists, buy ladies underwear, save the day. You know, typical Yakuza stuff.

This game sports graphics much better than the previous game. The game looks really good. 

The whole battle system just feels better, more rewarding. There is some funny rag doll type physics which just add some wakyness on top. Upgrading your skills is a bit more interesting, and better laid out. 

There is a hunger mechanic in the game and when you eat you get XP. The food looks great, you will say to yourself.

Like previous games there is a lot to do if you want. There are many mini games and side adventures and it's totally up to you how deep you want to go, or if you just want to do the story. You can open and run at club, date club girls, shoot darts, golf, gamble, help Goro defend a construction site and more!

Like the previous game, the story is kind of stupid and over the top, and has a lot of twists and turns so you really can't guess what is going to happen.

For me, this generation could be the best in Yakuza series. Most of action games will get bored post completion and you may not have reasons to continue further, but this one's definitely not.

- Outstanding story-telling as usual

- Good fighting mode with smooth combat

All three games are amazing, but 0 is still my favorite so far and Kiwami 2 edges out Kiwami for multiple reasons. Better substories, more stuff to do, returning the business-style substories from 0 but in new ways, giving resolution to Majima for things that happened in Yakuza 0--this game really does it all. 

There is a TON of fanservice regarding Yakuza 0 in this game. Lots of cameos, references, and direct continuations of storylines. It's all really, really good, but it definitely means that in order to enjoy it fully, you MUST have knowledge of events and characters in Yakuza 0. (I mean, the entire Cabaret Club Czar storyline is just one big callback to Yakuza 0.)

Combat felt TERRIBLE to me at first in this new engine, but once you realize that charged attacks are a godsend and will stop enemies from breaking your combos, it isn't too difficult even on Hard difficulty. Kiryu feels weak and combat feels sort of frustrating at first, but once you begin to level up skills, Kiryu can and will become godly. Seriously, my Kiryu ate bosses for breakfast, even on Hard.

There is a lot of stuff to do in this game. Lots of fun minigames this time around (except the robot fighting one for Haruka....UGH), and more silly substories and fun events. Both business substories, the cabaret and Majima Construction, are strong additions. 

The storyline is just what you'd expect from Yakuza, with plenty of riveting and well-done scenes and characters you know and love. The final chapter pulls out a record amount of plot twists though, lol. Definitely a scene to behold.

A great game and a great series.

4) Virtua Fighter 2.1 is playable in the arcades
5) The Cabaret Club activity from Yakuza 0 is back and expanded
6) Absolutely bangin' soundtrack
7) Gravure Photoshoot minigame with real idols ( if you're not familiar, maybe search ""Gravure"" on incognito mode ;) )
8) Main story and side content together, there's like 80 hours of gameplay here. Even at full price, that's great value for money

1) No Baka Mitai at Karaoke (that said, an instrumental version is played in some of the bars)

Steam unfortunately doesn't allow a rating in-between yes and no, but mine does tend to be a little more towards the yes side. Also: I have no fucking clue about how to properly structure or write this. I'm writing this on a whim after finally getting all achievements and playing it for a half a year now.

[h1]Technical difficulties[/h1]
This PC port is atrocious. When you start the game, it is basically gambling if it will actually render the game or if it will be a black screen with an infinitely falling Steam notification, forcing you to quit and restart the game over and over again until it finally renders properly. 

Forget ever tabbing out of the game to read messages, watch a Stream or generally anything else outside the game, because as you soon join in the game again, it will be a black screen yet again and you can keep spamming Alt+F4 and keep on clicking the ""X"" to close in the taskbar, it will take at least a minute no matter what for the Game to finally crash and trying to open the task manager or anything else will not help, as the game in this black screen state will always overlay over any other Application you have running. Streaming over Discord also wasn't possible for me.
The previous PC ports of 0 and Kiwami 1 already presented various technical difficulties such as random crashes at certain settings etc., but Kiwami 2 certainly takes the cake here.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story is not horrible, but not great like 0's either. I'd say slightly worse than Kiwami 1. Major complaint for me is introducing characters, but then sidelining and dumping them for more than half the game, before reintroducing them at the end after fighting ""ass-pull backstabbing traitor surprise villains"" to somehow connect to them again, a mistake which the first game did as well. Some new Characters are interesting like Daigo, Ryuji and Kei Ibuchi, but it's especially sad with Ryuji and Kei because they have a great and cool foundation that never really gets greatly built upon or fleshed out and it turns out as really flat and unchanged in the end. Most substories are rather forgetfull I'd say, but some stand quite out and are interesting like: 
[list]
    [*]""Be My Baby""
    [*]""The Legendary Dragon""
    [*]""Embracing my True Self""
    [*]""Kazuma Kiryu, Professional Voice Actor""
[/list]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay wise it has made a lot of Improvements over the previous games, thanks to the new Dragon Engine (although that has seemed to introduce other problems as mentioned before), like fluid and seemless transitions into fights and buildings, ragdoll effects and physics and obviously greater graphical fidelity. 
Thanks to this game basically being a Yakuza 2 re-skin of Yakuza 6, Battles have gone way more stale though. As there is now only one single fighting style, and only a limited amount of different combos and heat actions one can perform and it gets really boring and repetitive very quickly. One thing that I noticed was the seemingly inconsistent UI. When you try to quit or exit something, sometimes the selection already hovers over ""yes"", sometimes over ""no"". In certain sections, if you click yes, the game will ask you again if you are sure or not, while in most sections it doesn't. 
The game is quite tire- and bothersome to play for me like the previous games, because for example: 
[list]
 [*]you need to keep running back and forth to purchase certain items and trying again
 [*]RNG screwing you over
 [*]having too many menu pop-ups
 [*]extremely annoying enemies and fighting styles
[/list]

At first I played this game for 1-2 hours max before I got too tired and lethargic, and dropped it a lot of times, which explains why it took half a year for me to actually finish it.

[h1]Verdict[/h1] 
Yakuza Kiwami 2 isn't a horrible or bad game, but it definitely missed a lot of spots where it had more potential or even dropped ones it already had. It's an alright game, not something I'd recommend for everyone to get into Yakuza or looking for a really good game. This is rather for people like me, who like to play all the games in a series in canonical order as is possible and who have played the previous Titles Kiwami 1 and Yakuza 0 and want to get the full story before moving to the next games. 

I'd rate it a .... 6-6.5/10? maybe I'll change my mind.

Battles are hillarious because of ragdolls. Leveling system is great and makes me eat at cafes for a reason other than healing. Being drunk actually has a fun effect. Pissing game is funny. Gameplaywise this beats Kiwami1 easily 
Story is okay, I guess. Plot twist was obvious. Having a threat of a war being resolved in three fights was so stupid. Majima being beat up by some goons (even if over a hundred, still, it's Majima ffs) made me upset.

Y2 receives a new coat of paint for this remake but, in my opinion, the fancy graphics don't really do the game a favour. I would've preferred if they kept this remake in the previous engine, the one used for Y0 and Y1Kiwami. Yes, the character models look great and the lighting is spectacular so visually this game is impressive, but the visuals don't really do enough to hide this game's age.
Storywise, it's pretty standard affair. The plot is needlessly complicated throughout with many plot points and characters and flashbacks all crammed together. Yes, by the end it all makes sense and ties in together, but the pacing is a little bit off and the trade-off is that the final chapter is a chaotic mix of plot twist after plot twist, merely minutes away from each other, bringing all the characters together in a 'No, it was actually me that did it.' scenario that repeats itself a bit too many times. Still, some twists really did surprise me and it can be forgiven that the original story is quite old at this point but the fancy graphics fool you into thinking it's more modern. Still, is it bad? Nah, but it's not great either. Its saving grace is that Kyriu's character is explored in an interesting way that, I thought, ties in very well with the previous story and he remains throughout an amazing character and protagonist.
Minigames are, once again, prevalent and needlessly difficult. I don't find them 'challenging', I just find them so difficult that completing them becomes a chore with very small elements of fun throughout. For example, I love the karaoke but trying to actually get the score high enough to 'complete' it seems impossible so I just didn't bother, personally.
The Cabaret side quest is back in this one from Y0 and I enjoyed my time with it, though its story wasn't as good as the one in Y0. They also introduced a new side quest series with Majima Construction, but that too felt very grindy and not too interesting. What I liked about these two is the way they used the characters available and it felt like the famous NPCs of the Yakuza world have been given some sort of presence and purpose, which was something I appreciated.
Speaking of the world, it was great to return to Kamurocho and Sotenbori, seeing them with the new updated engine, though I felt that their previous iterations in Y0 had more charm and aliveness, though I am aware that this is technically an older game.
To conclude, you should play this as a fan of the series, seeing the next chapter in Kyriu's story, but it didn't feel like it deserved the attention and time that I dedicated to the previous entries. It's a bit bloated and trying too hard to impress, but overall remains a confident Yakuza experience.
The soundtrack didn't feel very impressive either, but again I'm coming to it with my ears adjusted to the wonderful OST of Y0 and probably expecting a little too much.

PROS: Kyriu - Characters - Some cool story twists - Combat gameplay and physics
CONS: OST - Story pacing - Completion - Less charm",1637413710,1637413710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything is still here: the great characters with addition of new ones that have development, a better writing than kiwami 1(not quite like 0, still really good! Personally I am torn between the ending, but no spoilers), the satirical and sometimes sad sidequests which philosophize on moral values are still there!
Rework of some minigames and additions of new ones work great and are quite enjoyable!

The addition of the Dragon Engine only improved on already a great game, graphics, seemingless transitions between outdoors and indoors with no loading screen, improved fighting mechanic from kiwami 1 (Sad we won't see it in another yakuza game due to turn based combat coming into play, but I don't know how good or bad that turn for the series is since I haven't played it), great music to accompany fights, ragdolls(one of the funniest shit).
The world feels more detailed, alive than ever and just walking around taking selfies and looking at the scenery is very enjoyable.

I love it, I'm lookin forward to loving the next games and hopefully the new director after Toshihiro Nagoshi will make a great yakuza [spoiler]sunset 4[/spoiler].

I came into Yakuza Kiwami 2 expecting more from what Yakuza 0 and Kiwami gave me. I got more (and I also got some things different that I'm not too fond of).

[h1] The Good [/h1]

Yakuza Kiwami 2 brings along with it the things that made me fond of 0 and Kiwami: brutal, hong-kong action flick, over the top violence, ridiculous side-quests, a kick ass soundtrack, and too much additional content than I am actually willing to participate with, for better and for worse.

Kiwami 2 is probably the biggest game in the Yakuza franchise I have played so far, being on par with 0 in terms of raw, total content, so there's definitely plenty for people to enjoy here.

Kiwami 2's story is actually pretty solid, better than Kiwami's and about as good 0's. Not bad. I usually don't care for story but when it's done well on top of solid gameplay I have nothing but praise.

If you're following from 0 to Kiwami to Kiwami 2, like I have, then you will be happy to know that the Cabaret Club major side-quest is back, with new girls to make papa LOTS OF MONEY, and the inclusion of a ""new"" mini-game, which is MAJIMA CONSTRUCTION, where you play a sorta tower-defense like game using some of your favorite side characters and enemies from the Yakuza games to beat the hell out of punks who want to destroy Majima's construction operation. It's essentially an entirely different game in its own right, and its fun side content for when the combat gets tire-some.

A new side-story that wasn't present in the original Yakuza 2 has you play as Majima, preceding the events of the game's actual story. It's a small side-story, and as such, is very minimal in content. You simply get to play with Mad Dog style Majima from 0 the entire time, and me telling you reader that much isn't really a spoiler.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

Yakuza Kiwami 2 made the absolute most horrid sin of all sins in any beat em up game. Enemies can block your attacks mid-combo. That means every single attack, the enemy can potentially just block it, throwing you off your game entirely and letting them get in some cheap punishes. That's not how this works. See, what's SUPPOSED to happen, is that as the player, when I throw out an attack, and I hit an enemy THAT ISN'T BLOCKING, every subsequent strike in the combo SHOULD connect UNLESS I try to do an ""untrue"" combo, in which case, the enemy can recover from being struck and potentially punish my more risky move (or, if I made the right bet, I land a more devastating strike on them). The only other time the enemy gets to punish me is if I completely miss my attack, known as ""whiffing,"" due to them dodging or my accuracy was awful, which would allow them to get hits on me, or the enemy has ""super-armor,"" meaning they do not suffer from ""hit-stun"" when you strike them, which lets the enemy eat your attacks and hit you anyway (which requires you, the player, to understand your attacks aren't getting through and thus you need to A.) grab or B.) dodge).

This is basic fighting game 101, and this is how 0 and Kiwami functioned, and this how practically every other action-fighting-beatem-up-hybrid of a game has worked forever. Even if they could ""combo-break"" that's a whole lot different than the enemy blocking your attacks mid-combo, which disrupts the pacing of combat and leads to very unsatisfying gameplay. A wheel is a damn wheel. Making it a square doesn't do anything except for make it annoying as all hell and make me put Kiwami 2, in terms of it's major gameplay component (being the combat) lower than 0 and even Kiwami. 0 had 10 different fighting styles, 5 for each character in Kiryu and Majima, and Kiwami, despite being half the game 0 was, contained 5 returning styles and even fleshed out the Dragon style to the point to where it almost had some Majima styles in it. Kiwami 2's combat is just the Dragon Style the entire time, without the flare and style it had in 0 and Kiwami.

That being said...Kiwami 2's combat is still pretty good. I simply did not like it as much as I liked 0 and Kiwami's combat, and it was a more frustrating experience because of that.

[h1] The Ugly [/h1]

Speaking of ""flare,"" I don't know if it's just me or not, but things feel...lacking in ""impact."" Kiryu's combos don't feel as satisfying to land. Some heat actions certainly have punch, but others feel a little flat. The ragdoll physics actually do more harm than good because it often feels like I'm pounding on wet plastic bags, and whenever Kiryu is stuck in a ragdoll state, flopping around like a fish out of water, part of me laughs, and part of me is annoyed because he won't get the hell up. This also extends to trying to finish enemies in a ragdoll state, because they're constantly rolling around on the ground sometimes your window to finish them off with a heat action doesn't happen, or, you can abuse the map geometry and keep them stuck in corners so that they never get up.

Basically, the ragdoll physics, at least to me, don't do the game any favors and was more often an inconvenience than a glaring detriment to gameplay, along side the flow and impact of attacks on enemies not feeling as strong as they used to. The only exception to the lack of impact on attacks is from the ""Extreme Heat Mode,"" which is where the best, most brutal heat actions are.

Some music tracks are recycled from Yakuza Kiwami. While I'm not against their inclusion (as they're awesome tunes), it does conflict with the style and tone of the newer tracks in the game. Kiwami had a very distinct feel to it in terms of it's music, and mixing it with Kiwami 2's just makes it feel kinda iffy.

A criticism I have of the Yakuza franchise so far, from 0 to Kiwami and even Kiwami 2, is how there are certain characters introduced that have very dramatic introductions, only for them to get killed off literally within the next or the next next cutscene. They're there, and then they're gone, but they get all this dramatic attention to them and it doesn't feel right.

[h1] Verdict [/h1]

I didn't like Yakuza Kiwami 2 as much as I liked 0 and Kiwami in terms of gameplay and side-content, but Kiwami 2's main plot was actually pretty good all things considered, it's a very pretty game, and despite it not being as alluring as the previous games in terms of gameplay, it was still pretty damn good.

Kiwami 2 is an interesting change in play from Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1. Instead of loading when entering store fronts or pubs you can generally go in and out directly which makes for a somewhat smoother experience. Weapons can be collected from beaten foes. This was a nice change from Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 where you could pick up the weapons of goons but after the fight you tossed it aside. In Kiwami 2 you have the option to store it during the fight and sell or repair it later. Fight styles are gone however which was mildly disappointing as I favored rush style with its fast paced stick and move style of play. It's still possible once you unlock quickstep Max but boss targets tend to start defending or counter punching after getting hit in the blindside once or twice while in previous iterations rush could land a full combo. Parry sort of follows the same problem. Though there is a heat option after parry I found it less reliable. Fighting large scale mobs tend to dissolve in either weapons swings, bouncing from target to target or grabbing a goon and using them as a wrecking ball as you hurl them into the rest of the crowd. A rather pleasant if repetitive move. Charge moves are a nice touch particularly in dodgy targets as there is a wider swing to the attack. A lot of the earlier iteration problems are not present as regeneration armor doesn't seem to be present nor is firearms as massively over powering as there are less large aoe weapons more limited shots. 
The story is ok if a little weird with the flashback memories of people who appear clueless of events that they were part of and yet have to investigate in modern day. It's a little predictable in parts but suits the game.

I went to Kiwami 2 straight after playing Kiwami 1 and comparing the two, I personally like 2 more than 1. The combat in this one feels more mobile and I preferred having the condensed fighting styles. Character models do ragdoll when they get hit hard though which sometimes is a bit off-putting, but is a minor point really. The story is much more in depth than it is in the first game and the characters are great. As always with Yakuza games, the sub stories are hilarious and are worth completing. The only part that really annoyed me was doing the bouncer quests for the achievement. Of course, you don't have to do all these but if you're going for the completion, 26 quests with 3 difficulties each gets a bit tedious. The Majima Saga was a great addition and is certainly worth playing through, both because it's Majima and why wouldn't you want to play as him, but also for the added context of how things ended up the way they are at the start of the game. I enjoyed doing the cabaret club minigame and spent a lot of time on that, and preferred it over the Majima Construction game as this felt a little long-winded, albeit good for the accompanying story. 

Overall, another brilliant Yakuza game that's worth playing. For me, it seemed to have a perfect way of making me feel like I'm really good at it but at the same time, challenging me enough to keep me engaged and trying hard.",1634982604,1634982604,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being the last of Yakuza series that feature the signature flashy action combat, Yakuza Kiwami 2 also sees the final installment with Kiryu Kazuma as the protagonist. Kiwami 2 is a swan song to a 15 year saga of Kiryu and it is mostly a triumphant one. Excellent graphics, engaging sub-stories, wonderfully realized mini-games topping off what is a mostly good story, revamped physics engine, good leveling economy and progression as well as  combat. 

With even Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s spin-off Lost Judgment having an uncertain future, there’s no telling if and when Yakuza’s flashy combat system will make a return and so Kiwami 2 is a bittersweet end to the old-school Yakuza series. 

It is a worthy farewell. Strongly recommended. 
[hr][/hr]
[h3]What’s Excellent[/h3]

[list]
	[*]Beautiful near life-like graphics.
	[*]Interesting and well told sub-stories.
	[*]Excellent and robust mini-games. 
[/list]

Kiwami 2 has the best graphics of the old-school Yakuza series. Character models are rendered to near life-like and they are beautiful, and the environment of Kamurocho and Sotenbori are as densed as ever. Both towns feel alive and lived in, and Ryu Ga Gotoku went 2 steps further and remove the loading time for entering and exiting the shops, making the transition seamless. The effect is spectacular, it’s like you’re really walking into the store. The buildings too have a lot of depth, allowing you to enter it, going to it’s second, third, fourth floor and the attic, weaving into the buildings rooms and offices and even finding their exits in the back alleys. It’s a novel experience. 

Having people walking on the streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori isn’t what made them feel alive, rather the many many sub-stories is what gives these cities their life-like character. Kiryu is still helping people and solving problems. It is these sub-stories that make Yakuza feel like an open-world game in a closed map and it is something that Ryu Ga Gotoku has perfected. The stories are interesting, ranging from helping a granny against a triad to voice-acting a “Boy’s Love” video game, there is so many things here that you make laugh or move you. 

Another Yakuza series signature is it’s always entertaining and well-designed mini-games. Cabaret Club makes a return with Yakuza 0’s alumni hostess Yuki taking centre stage again. The obligatory underground Coliseum also makes a return with everything still in tact. A new mini-game called Clan Creator is introduced, with you leading Majima Construction company as foremen. It’s a mini real-time strategy game with you controlling many heroes to battle against other construction companies for control of Kamurocho Hills. There is also the slightly not wholesome and a little annoying Haruka’s Request, where you get to spend time with your adopted daughter Haruka fulfilling her wishes that includes gambling in the Purgatory Casino. Lastly, There is the overly long Bouncer Missions, a 28 stage rush mode where you get to go around Kamurocho and Sotenbori beating out different types of mobs and bosses. 
[hr][/hr]
[h3]What’s Good[/h3]

[list]
	[*]New physics engine make the environment more interactive. 
	[*]Story has great potential, with good beginning and middle.
	[*]Leveling economy and progression is solid.
	[*]Combat is more free form with more emphasis on weapons. 
[/list]

The new physics engine makes the world of Yakuza more interactive. Kiryu can now knock over benches, bikes and traffic cones, he can also leap across railings or jump off from the 2nd floor without fall damage, he can also climb over slight elevation, etcetera. Of course, due to a new engine there is also new jank. Character models here behave like rag-dolls especially during combat, but it’s nothing game-breaking. 

The story as a lot of potential, enacting the long awaited rival gang-war between the Omi Alliance and the Tojo Clan as well as foreign organized crime. As usual there is deception and betrayal, and the set-up and build-up is I’d say, spectacular but Kiwami 2 didn’t quite stick the landing. Kiryu’s romance with Sayama is I believe unnecessary but understandable. And the twist at the end is unjustified because there was no fore-shadowing of it. Goda Ryuji is an excellent antagonist and most of the side characters are interesting as well although, I think there are some parts that are too Hollywood for my liking such as the Game of Death inspired sequence, with a gaudy golden castle rising from the ground. 

The character and leveling system is pretty solid, where you know have 5 stats that you require to level, and everything you do in Kiwami 2 will raise these 5 attributes. Combat, mini-games, sub-stories, playing arcade, darts, karaoke, eating, drinking, all contribute to raising your stats. These stat points are used to gain a variety of skills including techniques, heat actions and life skills. This economic system works really great and do mimic a life-like experience. 

Due to a new physics engine, the combat system gets tweaked a little bit. Battling groups are now free form and even enemies can utilized environmental assets to hit you. Weapons are now greatly buffed, and there are even more essential in Bouncer Missions as well as main story boss fights. Enemy A.I. is also enhanced being able to dodge and counter effectively. Heat Mode is unbalanced, especially with bosses which make them practically invulnerable except when you pop your own heat mode. And of course, the rag doll effect is ridiculous and funny but it doesn’t negatively affect combat. 
[hr][/hr]
[h3]What’s Could’ve Been Better[/h3]

[list]
	[*]Cringe ending to the main story. 
	[*]Mini-Games are too numerous and exhausting. 
[/list]

To be fair, there aren’t many negative-ish things to say about Kiwami 2. The story is 15 years old and so, most of the weak points on the main story can be forgiven. Particular, the less than satisfying romance between Sayama and Kiryu, which I thought rather sudden and the build-up wasn’t executed as realistically as I’d hope. The ending though was just not very good, and handled in a very 80s Hollywood summer blockbuster way, rather than a 70s Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola direction. It’s corny and cringey at times though, it’s really not that bad with all things considered. 

Also another negative is the length of mini-games. On top of the already lengthy Cabaret Club and Clan Creator that averages 10 hours each, there is also 3 different types of battle mini-games that include the Coliseum, Street Bosses and Bouncer Missions. The Bouncer Missions especially takes forever to complete, and the last 9 stages where you have to defeat the Amon brothers are especially difficult. It is very exhausting and takes too long to finish but fortunately, these battle mini-games are not essential to the main game (unlike the Cabaret and Clan which arguably, are essential to the main story progression). 
[hr][/hr]
[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Old fans can still find some solace in knowing that Yakuza’s 3 main PC releases, Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami and this Yakuza Kiwami 2, are great games that are worthy of any collection. I would recommend buying all 3 and start with Yakuza 0 and if you already played the previous two installments, Yakuza Kiwami 2 will be a moderately satisfying end to this long-running franchise. Strongly recommended. 

Of course, you can still buy the Playstation port of Yakuza 3,4,5 and 6 on Steam if you’re so inclined.",1634187600,1634187923,True,9,0,0.576676428318023682,0,True,False,False

In short the game does what Yakuza does best; it blends a tense action thriller story and also jams in about 80 hours of side content ranging from goofy side stories to several mini-games or even entire game modes to playing Virtua Fighter 2 for 3 hours for some reason. Gotta play Yakuza dude what are you waiting for go start at Yakuza 0 and work your way back here.

[h1] Sub Story 69: A Rambling Review [/h1]

At first I was a bit worried that this game wouldn't live up to both Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami. The switch to the dragon engine was a bit jarring. Everything was so shiny and Kiryu felt a hell of a lot heavier to control and yearned for the Kiwami/0 engine. I'm glad to say though that once you get used to the new combat system things start to really click and the shiny new coat of paint make the cities of Kamurocho and Sotenbori really shine.

Let's talk about combat. At first, I lamented the loss of the distinct combat styles and style switching however the newfound weight of the overhauled physics really makes combat feel impactful and heavy. I feel like it really works even 
though some of the style and complexity of the combat is lost. However, some new additions such as extreme heat mode and charge attacks keep the combat interesting. Essentially you will be playing the entire game in what is the dragon style of the previous games, which isn't such a bad thing. One thing I particularly enjoy is that extreme heat mode brings back elements of [strike] Best [/strike] Beast mode which is rad. So overall I feel it's a bit of a downgrade but not enough to really hold anything against the game. [spoiler] Of course this doesn't matter if your a rad dude and just Tiger Drop everyone you meet. [/spoiler]

So the combat is different but it's still fun. But what about the story? I hear all none of you ask. Well hypothetical person it's great! All of the twists and betrayal and absolutely rad title card entrances that you've come to expect are here. Gotta love Ryuji Goda dudes rad and I'm a sucker for motivations that are basically ""THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE"" which is what we've got here. Add in some bombs a foreign mafia some pretty good romance surprisingly and an ending that actually leaves Kiryu happy (Is this even legal in a Yakuza game?) and you've got a pretty enjoyable experience.

You like side content? Of course you do you idiot you're playing a Yakuza game. Get on board cause we've got 80+ hours of it here buddy and it ranges from amazing to kill me now. [i] Amazing [/i]: Kiryu voicing a Yaoi game. [i] Kill me now [/i]: Playing 72 bouncer missions [b] OF WHICH ONLY  24 ARE UNIQUE [/b]. Seriously though most things presented here are excellent and the bouncer missions are the only content I really thought was egregious padding. I mean did we really need three versions of each mission seriously? But I digress, the game offers a good amount of side content you can even hang out with Haruka and be a good dad or sing karaoke with Majima.

Speaking of Majima, he's a construction worker now and it's great the mini-game attached isn't the best but it isn't horrible. He does get a small three chapter playable side story which is cool adds a little backstory to the game as well.

Another plus about a game like this is that if you decide you want all the achievements you get to not only bash your head against 72 repetitive bouncer missions but also get to learn how to play Mahjong which is hard but now that I know how to play kinda it's actually pretty fun. So hey thanks Yakuza I feel a bit more enriched as a person now.

Basically all of my complaints could be solved by not being a completionist and ignoring some of the more less engaging content but in comparison to everything the 72 bouncer missions is kind of a drop in the bucket and I had a ton of fun in my 130 hours with the game there's even gravure photoshoot sessions as a mini-game with sexy ladies or taking Kiryu to a place to watch movies ranging from implied porn to horror and then he gives a small review that tend to be pretty funny. 

Oh I guess some people don't like the experience system but I thought it was fine not as cool as using literal money or having to fight Majima though so whatever it's kind of a minor aspect of the overall experience.

So yeah this game rocks.

Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a game developed and published by SEGA

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Yakuza Kiwami 2 overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a great action game to play in short bursts!

If you've never played any Yakuza games, and you like strong but kindhearted protagonists, I recommend you stop reading any reviews and blindly get and install and start up Yakuza 0. That's what I did, and I've never in my life made a better decision regarding digital media.
By the time I finished Yakuza Kiwami, I thought ""jeez, the fighting system might get kind of repetitive after 150 hours of it, I wish they could change it up in the next game... but I guess that'd be too big of a risk to take, and you can't exactly remake an entire game and still make it fun for the same reasons."" But I was kiwami wrong. (Kiwami means extreme)
Yakuza Kiwami 2 feels like I'm playing a Yakuza game for the very first time... again. That feeling is beyond stellar, and I wish it on anyone. On another note, seeing the characters develop further through the Yakuza storyline feels like I'm watching my friends grow up. It's a beautiful experience that I haven't seen anywhere else in the same fashion yet and I've been playing videogames for more than a decade straight. 
You know how game reviewers always give 9/10, or 96/100, because they're too much of a coward to give a full score to any game? Well, anyone who doesn't rate Yakuza Kiwami 2 10/10 lives in a world of lies. These last three weeks I've been playing Yakuza hours every single day, and I've played through 3 Yakuza games in a row without anything that has a story in between, I can clearly see any weaknesses that Yakuza Kiwami 2 might have, and I must say, they're not that bad.
I took 40 hours to finish the main story of this game, and an additional 18 for the three biggest side stories. I don't 100% for shit, I just play what feels fun, and this game surely does.",1633256444,1633256556,True,19,0,0.683858811855316162,0,True,False,False

The fighting system is much more simplified and so are the heat moves (until you advance further in and unlock EH Mode). You now play using the ""LEGEND/DRAGON"" fighting style from 0/Kiwami 1, with things mixed in like the clothesline punch from the Beast style, and the Drop Kick from the Brawler tree, and the Quicksteps and Punches from the Rush style. What I mean by ""Legend/Dragon"" mode is heavy attacks are timing based like in YK0, where holding down the heavy attack can change what attack you throw.
Story Wise:
The game has a great storyline in the series, and it offers twice as more than the original PS2 Version. Voice acting is again once again on point. If you played 0 and Kiwami 1 you'll have a blast, in the Cabaret's of Sotenbori, and in the side content of Kamurocho all villains are IRL wrestling big shots from the NJPW.
My one issue with the game if you're a completionist:
One side story is a Mahjong Tournament, and if you've never played it like me, it's hard, and it's even harder without the items that make it simpler for you to win in Mahjong, because the game doesn't offer a play by play guide to the player to teach them anything, it just gives you a 19+ piece Slideshow with everything.

Otherwise, I recommend the game. It also brings a full version of Virtua Fighter 2.1, and Virtual-On!",1633134585,1633134688,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The new engine has improved physics, dramatically improved textures and a different way to make the inventory and fighting work. There were so many changes to Zero and One that I don't even know where to start; and while I didn't think all of them were better - I prefer the battle stances, the more limited inventor space, the older experience system and the higher karaoke difficulty - all together I believe Yakuza is doing changes in the right direction as far as moving into the future goes. One step back, four steps forward.

The amount of fanservice in the game is downright insane. The fan-favorite Majima makes his appearance over so many instances that it almost feels like Zero again. He's there for your caba-club minigame, he is there for your Majima Construction and he's there for a few extra chapters where you actually get to control a 'nerfed' version of what we were used to, but all the same the extra mile was appreciated.

The minigames were reworked and while I don't agree with all the chances overall they ended up better than before; although it is a shame to see bowling go, the inclusion of a full RTS/beat-them-up hybrid makes up for that in spades. There are full, actual arcade SEGA games available to play and the extra missions were *brutal*; this may be the most powerful iteration of Kiryu yet with his new weapon mastery, special heat mode, new equipment options, far more healing items that you'd think necessary and variety of counters, but he really needs it for the optional, uber-hard content available.

I'm not gonna lie, this is a fantastic game but it slightly loses to zero for me. I liked the challenge of a few fights, and even the twists and twists and twists and twists  at the end rivaling your average Mexican telenovela were a little too much. ""Ha-ha! I was actually the final boss!"", ""No! It was me all along!"", ""No, you fool; I played you like a fiddle!"", ""I outplayed your outplay with HIS outplay!"", ""No! actually...""",1630900115,1630900115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The side stories are mostly pretty interesting and there's a ton of other things to do rather than play the main story.

[b]General: [/b]
It has vast improvements to the first installment, making it feel much less clunky and a lot more open.
Combat is faster and therefore more enjoyable as well.
The Majima Saga was a nice bonus on top and felt more polished than the Majima Everywhere mechanic from the first game.

[b]Substories: [/b]
Unlike the Yakuza Kiwami 1, it's easy to keep track of all of the substories. The substories were far better and more memorable generally as well. Some of them even spread up into multiple parts.
Not all are great, there are a fair few minor ones as well but that is to be expected.

[b]Minigames: [/b]
Minigames are one of the best Part in the Yakuza Games.
Big Minigames: 2
- [spoiler] Majima Constructions [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] Hostess Club Four Shine [/spoiler]
Unique Minigames (Not counting those which are in most other games like Shogi, etc.) : 3

927380,98452833,76561198306366976,0,4,2195,0,2195,1630249567,"This is EPIC!

I played Yakuza 0 and loved it so much that I decided to play the entire series. Moved on to Kiwami next and liked it a lot even though it was a step or two down from Y0 and has some annoying problems. Then I hyped to play Kiwami 2 as most consider it to be top tier Yakuza game.

The first half of the game has some pacing issues as well as other deeper problems especially the combat. The combat is a departure from the previous games which were style based and I think this new combat system is a step down. The style based combat system was much more enjoyable. The first half (more like 40%) of the game is really a chore, I hated the combat and the story was kind of all over the place. Many times I thought of quitting the game as I was not enjoying it but my love for the previous games made me push through.

After that is when the story starts getting a sense of direction and flow and it gets exciting. The combat gets more and more enjoyable as you improve stats and gain abilities and with it the combat starts getting some pace to it. From here on out, the game is a blast and I had an amazing time with it.

I still think Y0 had the best villains by far. No one comes close to Kuze. In this game, since it is juggling so many characters/orgs as antagonists, they don't really do much with Ryuji Goda. I loved this guy whenever he was on screen. He is a Yakuza with a code. He could have been so much awesome if he had his own game where he and his family are the only antagonist.

The story is amazing but second best to Y0. Combat is third behind the other two games. For me Y0 pulled more heartstrings and had better character arcs.

My ratings:
Y0 - 9.5/10
Kiwami 2 - 8.5/10
Kiwami - 7.5/10

Majima is awesome and hilarious in this game. Wish he was more involved in the action directly rather than doing things in the background or off screen.

WE NEED A MAJIMA GAME. PLEASE.

While it doesn't necessarily have the clarity or focus of Yakuza Kiwami 1, or the top notch drama writing of 0, it's still supremely solid. The combat is appropriately pared down to be simpler (much closer to the original games), but still fun to roll through crowds of enemies. Overall, still irreverently a Yakuza game and something I enjoyed every moment of. 

Pros:
-Ryuji Goda Fucks
-Kiryu battling a ""Competing Dragon"" is a cool thematic direction for the series.
-Kiryu punches not one, but two tigers
-Some of the substories are EXCELLENT (Fake Kiryu, Gondawara Family, etc)
-THE BONKERS OSAKA CASTLE SEQUENCE IS REALLY GOOD
-Majima Construction is objectively great
-Majima Saga was short, but sweet. An explosive bundle of emotional catharsis and closure for Majima after the events of Yakuza 0. Well appreciated.
-The Kiwami Exclusive fanfare in general is pretty good and really helps tie the game into the series current state.

Cons:
-The integration of the Jingweon Mafia is cool in some ways and very meh in others. Very weird to paint all Jingweon guys as LOYAL TO THE DEATH TO THE CODE when literally we are playing a game about the Japanese Mafia and their adherence or not to a Code. 
-The plot gets a little convoluted at times. Some twists feel like twists for the sake of twists. 
-Less memorable substories overall than 0 or 1
-You shouldn't have to spend EXP to buy ally heat moves. I didn't end up getting a single one.
-You can no longer pick up HEAVY OBJECTS like motorcycles

Misc:
-Food based EXP was an interesting direction. I don't think I hated it. It was fun watching Kiryu eat entire restaurants back to back.

And 2 might..honestly be my favorite. It’s so cool how they did these remakes. Connecting things with 0 better. I love callbacks, and as the series grows the more the better. This game improves on a lot of things, it’s a different engine, which looks really nice, but it mainly brings in a lot of quality of life improvements. Locker keys are back but the finder doesn’t take up an item slot anymore for example. But mainly the no loading times going in and out of stores, the world continuing moving on while you’re inside, the random street fights included, which are still annoying, but you can avoid them better. Also you can throw guys into store windows and the store won’t serve you anymore until later. Couple that with insanely hilarious rag doll physics. And it’s the best engine they used so far. The combat is a bit more simplified, but I liked that a lot actually. Only complaint was lack of variation in heat actions. Though there were some awesome new ones, overall they were kinda low on new stuff, but that might be because I didn’t invest in that skill tree much. The side quests in this game had a lot more humor compared to Kiwami 1, and was more on the level of 0, which was awesome. Also a lot of heart again. This game series just has such a nice feeling put into the side quests. This game also once again features 2 major mini games. The hostess club game from 0 returns, and while it’s mostly a repeat of 0, it again just has so much charm and heart into the stories around it. You get the feeling you’re home with your friends. Also fun surprises and characters really make the story line there. Which brings me to the second big mini game..MAJIMA CONSTRUCTION! Holy shit when they first sang the song I died laughing. The actual mini game itself is pretty fun. But the whole theme around it, and especially the song is just so good. The main story is a bit more over the top compared to 1, which is great. Including a certain Yakuza Huntress~ add in an awesome Majima stand alone DLC thingy and it’s a perfect game. I once again did all side quests/optional bosses and a lot of achievements. And as usual, the only thing that’s stopping this game from being a 10/10 is the grinding really. Mostly in the big 2 mini games though. But damn this game is close.

The dragon style ain't bad, they added stuff to make it more viable such as charged attacks that stun, but it's not as bad as using Rush style to juggle enemies then using Beast to destroy them with a bike.

Anyways, with that out of the way...

MAAAAN THIS GAME IS GOOD

The graphics, the gameplay, the story, all really good.
There was a new engine in place for this that carried through 6 and 7 as well from what I know, known as the ""Dragon Engine"". To think, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios built a whole new engine from the ground up, and now it makes the game look so smooth and beautiful. Absolute props to them for it, I think it looks much better than 0 and Kiwami, even though those games still look pretty good themselves. And they made it so most buildings don't need a loading screen anymore! Just enter the door of it, you're still in the same load session. 

The gameplay is a step up from it's predecessors, with what feels like more movement. Ledges you can walk onto, already opening the map up at least a bit. Railings you can vault over, and even some points, THERE ARE BUILDINGS YOU COULD JUMP OFF OF AND MAKE A SWIFT LANDING. (unless you're running) I spent at least 3 hours just running into street obstacles to knock them over such as signs, bikes, benches and people. (The people were in my way! I had no other choice!) The combat is more fleshed out than that of the previous games too, with charged attacks and some timing tweaks. (It feels like that to me, at least.) And you can also enter the aforementioned buildings (from the last section) and fight in those buildings. Did you know there's an achievement for that? (I won't elaborate, just do some testing for it!)

The story is... well, I can only say it's really well written. I don't want to elaborate on this one either, as the story is a big part of the game. 

Therefore, all I can say is to take my word for it and try it yourself! If it isn't your cup of tea, then that's fair. Then again, this is all just an opinion review, so if you're taking my word for it, get a bit of salt along with it. (As in: take it with a grain of salt)

Let me start out with, the game is really fun. But it didn't feel like yakuza yk? Maybe it was the dragon engine, maybe it was the lackluster heat moves, maybe i'm just being picky with the artstyle. It played like a yakuza game though, so thats all that matters. However, the weapons in this game feel really cheap to use. You can find them everytime you beat generic thug#21321 , and they do massive damage. imo, weapons always felt like an alternative to using your fists to me, not a direct improvement. 

HOWEVER, this game is amazing everywhere else. 

Story? 15 chapters and worth every second of your time. Graphics? Fucking astounding. It looks better than real life inside The streets of kamarucho and sotenbori. oh yeah, i almost forgot to mention, along with getting 15 chapters and hours upon hours of gameplay, you also get an additional **3 CHAPTERS** to fuck around as majima.

Because of the new physics, Kiryu constantly ragdolls and flies around the place. In this game, you have to wait for him to get up and recover on his own. You can't mash buttons to get up quicker like you were able to in previous entries. The result is several boring seconds of doing nothing and just watching Kiryu having a seizure on the floor or something.

Most actions are mapped to different keys now, for better or worse. RIP, all the muscle memory I've acquired from playing Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami.

[list]
    [*]Once again return to Kamurocho & Sotenbori, now featuring the new ""Dragon Engine"", visual representation and environmental textures are vastly more detailed than Y0 & YK
    [*]Very interesting story that focuses on the internal politics of the Yakuza
    [*]Majima Saga acts as a interlude to Kiwami 2's events, which take place briefly after the events of Kiwami; gives player's the option to play as Majima once again and also gives closure on a certain Y0 story
    [*]The open world has been expanded upon drastically, entering and exiting buildings is seamless without loading screens or downtime; this makes exploration, hidden items, and the completion list extremely intuitive
    [*]Physics, albeit hilariously unbalanced; makes weapons and charged attacks feel a lot more impactful
    [*]Very different but a more straightforward combat system, with the removal of Kiryu's battle styles (brawler, rush, beast), Kiwami 2 focuses around constant weapon switching and storing
    [*]Completion List & substories, many new distractions await you in 2006 Kamurocho & Sotenbori; new minigames & systems are always welcomed, substories are noticeably shorter than the previous games
    [*]Climax Battles have been phased out, instead there are 2 main side activities that have their own sub-plots developing that Kiryu can partake in

This game is good, better than a lot of games i have played. However, I feel like the combat is the worst when compared to Y0 and YK1.

I would have liked it more if you could ""build"" towards fighting like the specific styles, i.e. building towards beast would have you rely on weapons more, but the weapons are stronger, etc. 

I feel like the story is my other gripe with this game. Without spoiling, I feel like the story should have focused on what the last 2ish chapters did. I didn't care for a lot of the other parts of the story though.

The combat this time around isn't really shadowed by an op technique you can spam (unlike heat actions/beast mode in 0 and tiger drop in Kiwami). The weapons are probably the most op thing in there, but they are encouraged and so it feels less like cheesing the game.

As for completion, it feels balanced : it's like yakuza Kiwami but without the money farming, which makes you feel like you are actually making progress. (+ you get to play dress up and spend some time with Majima so win win).

Side stories are still a lot of fun. I was addicted to the cabaret side quest for a long while, but overall there are a lot of backward steps from Kiwami 1 in my opinion. 

The main story starts off really well, but then eventually descends into this nonsensical conga line of ""IM A JINGWON SURVIVOR TOO!!! MWA HA HA!"". It gets so bad that I just stopped caring about the story, because it was obvious they were just throwing out twist after twist just for kicks.

One of the main characters, Sayama, who is supposed to be this badass cop, just turns into another cliche tsundere who just wants to be loved. I had to start skipping cutscenes with her in them because she never actually said anything relevant to the plot. I watched the cutscenes on youtube at a faster speed to make sure i understood the story, that's how awful it got. 

The combat was a step down from Kiwami across the board. ridiculous rag dolling, bosses that all had hyper armor, heat actions that were very finicky.

The graphics engine is obviously new and needed more time to work out the optimization.

It's rad. You can play as Majima and as Kiryu and it's the entrance to the Yakuza series so it's really fun and refreshing to have gameplay like this, just a shame it feels a little tiny bit outdated. Also guns are soooo annoying :(


[b]Yakuza Kiwami = 9.7/10

The game feels like a glorified DLC of Yakuza 0 which doesn't mean it's a bad game. I really liked the story and I feel like the karaoke was done right. I love the Majima Everywhere system and obviously grinded that out as well. Only thing I didn't really enjoy was the combat because it's the exact same as in Yakuza 0 and after countless hours of that game you kinda want to have something refreshing.


[b]Yakuza Kiwami 2 = 7/10
Karaoke Meter = 2/5 (Nothing new, still images ain't it chief)
Story Rating = 7/10 (Kiryu's choice in the ending is pulled it down to 7 from a 9)

The Dragon engine is AMAZING. Man this game feels sooooooo good! Just a shame the story has such a dumb ending, like it definitely feels not something Kiryu would do EVER. If the ending wasn't do disappointing I would've definitely given this game a higher rating


The new engine really carries the game. I still enjoyed it but it lacked final touches, like e.g the karaoke was the same as yakuza kiwami without cool and goofy animations. Also I felt they did Majima kinda dirty by giving him such a major role in the game and telling him he [spoiler]has to stand up against the go-ryu clan[/spoiler] but in the end he doesn't do much aside from [spoiler]surviving order 66[/spoiler]. I love Majima and the fact he just gets shrugged off like this sucks. In the final ending he doesnt even do anything about [spoiler]the bomb and just sits down there while HIS BUILDING IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE? LIKE WHAT?[/spoiler]

I did not love Yakuza Kiwami 1 as much as Yakuza 0 because most of it is just recycled content from the previous game But Yakuza Kiwami 2 Brought me back into  that YAKUZA FEEL. Yakuza Kiwami 2 had so many improvements and changes from making the city more immersive by it looks, populated and BEING ABLE TO GO INSIDE STORES!, The Graphics is really good that makes it walking in the Kamurocho and Sotenbori in first person relaxing. They also shifted the New Combat system from 4 fighting styles to only 1, but it's not a downgrade because combat is still amazing. The Heat actions are also Cool and blood pumping specially when kiryu is fighting a Boss or Ryuji, I really love Ryuji. 

There is 2 stories, the main and the Majima saga but Majima saga is just a short side story. The story starts fairly slow but never boring, Characters are detailed both looks and their personality and the plot is good and delivered well but i'm kinda disappointed in the last chapter. The battles and bosses are great (except for that knife boots dude), Ryuji's first fight is amazing and the second got quite boring because I maxed my stats and got too prepared before ending the story. Side stories in the other hand are quite fun and others are unique I tried completing them except for the majong ones. 

Of course not all games are perfect, The combat of the game feels slow and kinda grindy at the beginning. Less combos, heat actions and you really need tons of money to EAT FOOD to gain stats. And that eating to gain stat mechanic, It's not bad but the way of gaining is really dumb in my opinion. restaurant had different dishes that also differ in stats and some shops/resto's has Trash food. lastly, Majima Saga is REALLY short story, it only has 5 chapters and I didnt like the combat of majima. You can gift kiryu to help you in the main story but I did Majima saga after I finished the story soooo, dunno. Majima Feels slow and your arsenal of combos/heat actions are really limited and you can't gain more. I think those ""Boss"" thugs in the street with skull should give you new combos instead rather than money for kiryu. 

But Overall I'd give Yakuza Kiwami 2 a 8/10.
Almost wanted to Complete the game and kiryu's stat but bouncer mission are too many and boring.

What a legend, his personality just fits perfect and adds some light-hearted moments in this deep story-line. Which is incredible, I'd say after playing Yakuza 0, Kiwami 1 and 2. Kiwami 2 is arguably the best game out of the 3. The second I entered the world. It looked and felt alive. The visuals were 10x better than the first Kiwami and I was shocked looking at the difference between the two. The world felt open and real. The stores were open and there were no loading screens to enter most buildings. The menus were better and the game in general was a massive improvement. The cut scenes were really well done too, this series is basically an interactive movie. The devs and writers for this should feel very proud, they latch you in despite some of the problems with the mechanics. 

There were a few problems I faced like the mf with knife in his boot. Tell me why he was harder to fight than the last boss. That dude is op as fuck. He dodges everything, blocks everything and will perform the same combos back to back giving 1 shot to hit him. However I figured out how to beat him without being super cheesy and just using heat actions or weapons like a lot of people say to do. Just try to block most of what you can, use heal items and just press triangle to kick him when you get the chances. That and grabbing him and knocking him down were the best ways. People here will tell you to just quickstep, parry and all that but it's unrealistic unless you're just a god at combat. For casual players you gotta be somewhat cheesy. The other problem I would say is lack of funds. I was a broke mf and just like the last game you can't earn bank by beating everyone up like Yakuza 0, you do earn some money as enemies drop them but it's nothing like 0. But thats why you have the club to run and gold plates to sell n shit. 

As I make my way through this series I'm worried about the next 3 remastered games as I'm aware they aren't full remakes like the Kiwami bunch. But I'm still going to finish they to see what happens next. I want to see where Kaoru, Kiyru and Haruka go if they're even apart of the next chapter to this story. 

(edit): I have just learned that they totally ditched Kaoru for the rest of the series. What a fucking shame. I'm heartbroken because I felt like that was a good reason for Kiryu to fight for. His new family. I didn't like Kaoru in the beginning but she grew on me later in the game and I felt that chemistry between the two. I'm quite annoyed with that decision of completely making her useless in the story now. Like what was really the point of her anyways if you just leave her out forever? If that was the plan in the first place then they could've ended the series there. I get why they didn't continue that relationship, for gameplay reasons with the bars and shit but damn at least have her return for Yakuza 6. I've read a bit about that final ending but nothing to spoil me. I'm a little worried now that the story starts to miss its mark in the next 4 games. I'm sure it will still be great but I don't expect it to match 0, Kiwami 1 and 2. This part doesn't sit well me knowing she's gone in Y3. But I'll be finishing the series despite all this hoping there's more to feed off of and that it ain't that bad. 

I'd also like to say that this is one of those stories that you just don't want to end, it reminds me of my Cyberpunk 2077 ending. I didn't want it to end because I enjoyed it so much and it sucks that it does end. If Yakuza was an endless story, I would play it until I couldn't no more. Idky or how I got this attached, because tbh I only watched 1 video about this series and decided to jump in blindly and now I've got myself addicted to all this. Which means it's gonna hurt more when I begin to finish the Kiryu saga. I did read that they're making a movie, hopefully they include everything abt this story and make it worth it. 

Once again this series amazes me each time, idk how this series is so underrated. It's the best experience I've had in long time when it comes to games and entertainment In general. I recommend this to anyone who loves a rich story, open and living world to explore with awesome combat. I've sunk 120 hours into this series so far and I plan on dropping more soon.

 Anyway, Kiwami 2 is great - I still slightly prefer Yakuza 0 but it's close. Loved the story, the side content (especially the cabaret club, I never clicked with it in Yakuza 0 but I decided to give it a proper go in 2 and ended up really like it) and the combat (although it gets a little same-y compared to 0).

8.5/10.

Some story telling seemed really amateur, though.  Deliver a dog to the lady from the orphanage, turn around, take two steps, and get a text from the kids who've already been playing with the dog and taking it for walks!  Come on, you couldn't have that play later?  Also, last words after getting shot in the chest (multiple times, at point blank) I can deal with.  Long speeches, not so much.

But those are really just small parts of the whole game.  You're mostly going to be fighting, eating, investing in skills, eating some more, and playing whatever mini-games strike your fancy.  Cabaret is back.  The fighting ring is not only back, it was quite a bit better than the last game's ring.  There's also a mini-game that plays a bit like an RTS battle.  I didn't enjoy the latter at all, so I just ignored it.  (The DLC mostly gives perks for that game, so I would suggest making sure you enjoy that game before paying.)

Ambushes from Mojima are out, thank goodness.  Instead, bosses show up on the street where you can fight them at your leisure.

You play as Kiryu, a (in this game) former Yakuza, which is a term for the Japanese organized crime syndicates. The main story is a thrilling tale of drama, intrigue, and immense amounts of violence. The side stories are zany tales full of comedy, culture, and immense amounts of violence. The game mostly consists of roaming around one of two city areas at a time, doing various tasks to progress the plot of the story and get roped into side stories where Kiryu meets various characters that live in the city or experiences any of the activities available. Many compare the game to either GTA or Shenmue, and it's probably closer to the latter than to GTA. You do various side activities in the form of minigames or are simply put in the vicinity of their location so that you know where to go to play them later, and while the story revolves around crime, Kiryu is an upstanding guy despite being a former yakuza that he doesn't do anything actually... bad. Not intentionally anyway. The only time when you can think of him as doing illegal activity really is when any of the randomly generated thugs, delinquents, ruffians, etc. accost you in the street forcing you to fight them. And that's a player choice more often than not, as you can choose to, instead of simply punching and kicking them to submission, shoot them or stab them or swing various sign posts, metal poles, or other debris into their skulls. But even then, you supposedly ""aren't killing"" them since that's not Kiryu's way. 

But this all adds to the charm, really. It's very obviously a video game world, but the characters are super serious during main story beats which doesn't really detract from them. One second you can be sitting around with a few characters waiting on news from the surgery a friend of Kiryu's is having from a bullet wound he suffered, the next moment Kiryu can be running down to a discount store for a pair of underwear to hand off to a guy who crapped his pants a few days ago and refuses to leave his toilet stall until he has a fresh pair. Or gets wrapped up in disciplining a yakuza boss that's forcing his ""infantilism"" fetish on his subordinates. Or just playing Mahjong for several hours at a time. But these moments of side stories flesh out the world to give the city much more life than most other locations I can think of in video games. It gives Kiryu more of a personality too in a relatively unobtrusive way. Like, the guy is this big scary looking gangster that will very easily drop everything else he's doing to do Pocket Circuit racing against some literal children, and spend millions of yen just to make his strong enough to beat the kids' cars. But it feels believable because he isn't contradicting himself. And the sheer amount of stuff you can do in this game is astounding. There's fully fleshed out mechanics to play mahjong, shogi, minigames for batting cages, darts, black jack, a tower defense minigame, hell you can literally go down to an arcade in the game and just play Virtua Fighter. There's so much to do and so much you can experience that it's kind of crazy. I do have a few complaints though that are more specific to this one.

Firstly, it seems a little bit buggier, and I'm not sure if that's because this is a PC port or if Kiwami 2 is just a bit buggier than the other ones I've played, but Kiryuu has had some buggy-ness around objects in the environment moving him around a good bit on occasion, basically launching him a tiny distance if he stands on something wrong. This is the only bug I'm aware of though, which isn't bad by any means but worth noting that I didn't encounter a single bug in any other Yakuza game I played, all of which have been on PS4. The second thing is the encounters. Now, I like the combat just fine, but it feels just a tad repetitive, especially since Kiryu can't walk a single block before someone tries to pick a fight with him. I think, in the future if there's a Kiwami 3, or for future installments in the series, there should be an item you get (probably lategame or after finishing the story) that you can wear as an accessory that either reduces or eliminates the random thugs spawning. The sheer amount you face just becomes tiring, and it makes me feel like I've fought off the entire population of Japan. Not to mention the combat, while easy to pick up and has a decent amount of depth to it, is simplified to a few buttons, one of which has two purposes for both heavy attacks and also for what are essentially super moves. So if you're trying to stay prepared for an upcoming story segment, you'll likely run into an encounter and use up some health from random punches hitting you as well as using up super meter on accident when trying to perform simple heavy attacks. 

At any rate, these are my only issues with the game, which are relatively minor issues, and everything else about it I could easily gush about, such as various locations in Kamurocho playing Kiryu's karaoke rendition of ""Baka Mitai"" in the background, or some of the dumb shennanigans that Kiryu gets himself into.

Don't get me wrong I loved Yakuza 0 and, Yakuza Kiwami 1, but YK2 is just on another level.

Everything is just fantastic: 
The new dragon engine makes travelling through the city and eating at restaurants as well as fighting to be extremely smooth.
Story, characters and cinematic and 100% more testosterone, 1000% more manly sweat and 10000% more tears... or at least... [I won't spoil]
Kiryu is so damn hot, I can't even...

The only Con i can think off, is missing Bakamitai on the karaoke, and maybe all other great songs too from previous titles. ;_;

Anyway, while i recommend starting with YK1 or Yakuza 0. 
BUT, You can technically jump in and start YK2 without missing too much, as the combat is much superior in YK2.

Whereas 0 and Kiwami feel more like a direct evolution of the franchise's previous entries, Kiwami 2 has an extremely apparent generational leap that brings a completely redesigned experience. There's some great changes to be found, but I think some interesting parts of the series have been abandoned in the process. Kiwami 2 is a really solid Yakuza game, but I can't help but wish it had brought a bit more to the table.

The most refined part of Kiwami 2 is the open world, and man it's amazing. You'll notice immediately how seamless the world feels, there are no longer any loading screens between buildings, which dramatically improves the pacing & immersion of the world. The cities also feel a bit more open in general, there are a number of passageways and interiors that were previously blocked off that incentive exploration and just makes navigation more fun. Yakuza's always prioritised density over size in it's worlds and it's especially commendable here. I enjoyed finding pathways that lead to rooftops most, to take in the splendid sights. Kiwami 2 looks excellent, the environments and characters have so much detail jam packed into them & it's pretty amazing how well it ran on my fairly outdated rig, it feels pretty optimised. The content that fills the world is solid too, aside the numerous returning minigames which have always provided the series with a lot of diversity, you also have a load of fun substories that break up the action really well. My only complaint in this department is that Kiwami 2 doesn't really have any unique selling point for it's world. Both business games are reused from Yakuza 0 & 6 (I'm also not a huge fan of either), there's almost no new minigames and the substories, while still excellent, don't really bring anything new to the table. I know it's a remake, but considering they were willing to add massive amounts of content that wasn't in the original, it would've been nice if it was a bit more unique. They've also removed the city of Shinseicho, which isn't a huge deal since it was very small, but it's unfortunate to not see that area with all the benefits of the modern dragon engine. Kiwami 2 doesn't bring any big new element to the table, but the quality of life mostly makes up for it, leading to great interpretations of Kamurocho and Sotenbori worth exploring.

Combats received a huge redesign in Yakuza 6, and they've brought that back to Kiwami 2. This redesign always confused me, it's not different enough to make the experience innovative, but it changes just enough to bug me. Kiryu's fighting style is completely different here, you still rely on light and heavy attacks, but it's replaced that fast and arcadey feel with a more realistic brawler. Combat does feel fresh by how it takes advantage of the city, now that you can enter any building mid-fight or even just run away through the streets. The animations are greatly improved too, Kiryu's attacks all flow into one another, the ragdoll on enemies is hilarious and heat looks better than ever. By all means, it's still a lot of fun, tackling groups of enemies still feels satisfying, it just lacks the strategy of the previous games. Kiryu's moves lack meaning now that you can just kind of spam your way through fights, his leg sweep is the only combo that has any specific use (as a guard break) compared to the older games, where each of Kiryu's attacks provided differing outcomes. It also kind of ruins the storytelling of Kiryu's move set, evolving from it's unrefined styles in 0 to the complete Dragon style that he uses in the later entries, now he just fights completely differently for a single entry and it's rather odd if you then go to Yakuza 3. Combat's absolutely at it's best with larger groups of enemies, it's a lot of fun to plough through enemy hoards, but those 1 on 1 engagements really show how the old system excelled in comparison. I also think the upgrade system here is just, kind of bad. Most of your exp comes from food and miscellaneous challenges now, I can see what they were going for and I appreciate how open the upgrade tree is that you can go for specific abilities instantly, but It just becomes annoying to try and unlock some of the later moves. Kiwami 2's combat is still expertly crafted and stands out well, I just found it to be lacking in comparison to other entries in the series.

I think the biggest thing Yakuza 2 did for the series is expand the Yakuza world, due to it's story. Whereas the first game felt like Kiryu's story with a Yakuza backdrop, I really like how this game can blend those two worlds together really well. Introducing Sotenbori and The Omi Alliance immediately makes for some gripping stakes, the goals of the narrative are immediately clear and the intrigue is only further enhanced by uncovering the mysterious Jingweon Mafia. The amount of characters that return from the first game makes the world still feel active without your intervention, and I love how the events of Kiwami 1 are still extremely important here, Kiryu is both a loved and hated figure after the first game and it's just awesome to see you actually having an in-universe reputation from your actions. I'd say the majority of the narrative is really engaging and exciting, it still has mild pacing issues and some filler, but I was really invested  throughout. That's why it's particularly disappointing to say that I just cannot stand the ending of this game. To me, Yakuza has a pattern of a reliance on plot twists and lack of pay off, and it's particularly strong here. Without going into detail of the events, I just found the ending did an awful job at delivering on the awesome build up throughout Kiwami 2, and it left a real sour taste in my mouth. There's also just some really bizarre character moments I hated. It's a weird position, cause the narrative feels so good throughout and the bosses still stand out, but a lot of the positives of the story relate very closely to that lacking conclusion, it makes me kind of unsure as to what my final thoughts are on the narrative as a whole. Also, the ""Majima Saga"" included with this game is very lacking to say the least, I don't think it needed to be included at all. Its just an hour or 2 of generic fights, uninteresting plot & a small amount of fan service, I'd highly recommend skipping that endeavour. While I think the story doesn't quite stick the landing, Kiwami 2 still excels in expanding on the franchise's history and sets a great foundation for future titles.

Favourite Moment: [spoiler] Storming Osaka Castle brings together the two essential pillars of Yakuza (Gripping crime drama and colourful, ridiculous exploration) perfectly. It's a high point in the story that delivers on a brilliantly hyped up villain, but it also has you brawling your way through an ancient castle full of ninjas, culminating in a ridiculous yet iconic brawl with 2 tigers, the absurdity speaks for itself.

Kiwami 2 is a great all rounder Yakuza title. It does everything the series is known for well, but it doesn't shine in particular area and lacks individuality that the other titles possess. I'd recommend Kiwami 2 to fans wanting to continue Kiryu's story or even just any prior Yakuza fan who wants to see how these titles are with such a big generational jump, but it's really not a good starting point for the series.",1612496450,1624933058,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Kiwami 2 overall, is a great game, graphics are gorgeous even on lowest settings compared to Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1, but from this FPS took a great hit, which i didn't mind at all, so if you care about FPS, prepare to have a good computer to get it.

The game play switched up from the battle styles from 0 and Kiwami 1 to the new dragon engine combat system, takes some time to get used to and has physics! I like the old style better but this definetely isn't bad at all!

Story is uhh, fine until you get to the end, which is a massive disappointment to say the least. If you care about that before buying it, search it up on Youtube, wont spoil it for you. But even then, the rest of the story is great.

Majimas sidestory is fine enough, like a 1.5 hour journey with a new combat style

The side content in this game is what really is great, because there is a great amount of it.
Cabaret club made its return yet again, which is fun as always, and clan creator is here aswell, which is fun aswell!!

In my mind, [i]Yakuza Kiwami 2[/i] can be ranked in the top three in the [i]Yakuza[/i] series. The remaining two of the top three should be [i]Yakuza 0[/i] and [i]Yakuza:Like a Dragon[/i]. But anyway, I fall in deep love with entire [i]Yakuza[/i] series.

As a game remade in 2018, [i]Yakuza Kiwami 2[/i] has superb and beautiful graphics and has improved a lot of physical details compared to the previous ones. At the same time, the optimization of the game is still so great. There is no low frame rate or dropped frames in the game. The game uses the same brand new Dragon Engine as [i]Yakuza 6[/i]. Overall, it was a  successful remake.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Due to the use of the new Dragon Engine, many aspects of the game have changed a lot. The map of the game is much more detailed, making it more convenient and intuitive for players to watch. The depiction of Tokyo and Osaka is also more detailed and lifelike. I can't help but linger in these two cities. In addition, there are also cars that are moving on the streets, which are closer to reality. More user-friendly is that more taxi service locations have been added to the city, saving a lot of time. The buildings in the city also have more places to walk, making the players more free to play.
The battle system of the game has also changed a lot. When you play [I]YK2[/i] after playing [i]Y0[/i] and [i]YK1[/i], you may be more or less uncomfortable. This game cancels the previous setting of the four combat styles, and instead only has a fixed, more comprehensive combat style. Intuitively, the sense of striking feeling is indeed reduced a lot. But the battle is surprisingly easier compared to the previous games. Especially in boss battles, your normal attacks will cause more damage, and extreme skills or Heat Moves are easier to trigger.For me,in the last boss battle with Ryuji Goda,I take medicines and constantly use Heat Moves to beat him out. The previous boss fight has never been easier than this time. 
[i]YK2[/i] also follows the great traditions of the previous games, retaining a large number of minigames, which increases the playability of the game.I really love this lifelike city in [i]Yakuza[/i].

[h1]Plot[/h1]
I consider [i]YK2[/i] has the same brilliant plot as [i]Y0[/i]. [i]YK2[/i] lets me relive the excitement and warmth when I was playing [i]Y0[/i].All in all, [spoiler]a year after leaving his former life in the Tojo Clan behind, ex-yakuza Kazuma Kiryu is called back into action when the clan's Fifth Chairman, Yukio Terada, is murdered by assassins from a rival organization, the Omi Alliance. Returning to Kamurocho, Kiryu must find a new chairman for the Tojo Clan and prevent an all-out war between the Tojo and the Omi, bringing him into conflict with Ryuji Goda, the legendary ""Dragon Of Kansai"" of the Omi Alliance.[/spoiler] The ups and downs and infinite reversal of the plot really made me addicted, as if I was in it. This work also has a deeper portrayal of the main characters, especially for the new comers, Daigo Dojima, Kaoru Syama and Ryuji Goda. 
This work also has ulterior motives in the portrayal of family and love. In addition to the desperate kiss of Kiryu and Sayama before death, what impressed me the most was the night when the two played in Osaka. The good time was The difficulties and obstacles that followed laid the groundwork for them, and the difficulties and obstacles that followed in turn reflected the sincere feelings revealed this evening.
The most unforgettable thing for me was the spirit of the gunshot wounded Kiryu and Goda in the final battle. It can be said that it shocked me deeply. The poignant BGM during the battle further enhanced the tragic atmosphere. I was holding back my tears to get it through.  He has gone through so many conspiracies and betrayals along the way, and eventually met a frank and righteous opponent Ryuji Goda. This may be the best ending for two of them. Ryuji Goda is absolutely a very charming villain.

[h1]What impresses me most[/h1]
Actually I didn't expect there would be a Majima Saga Plot.It really really surprises me. It's very coincidental and interesting that [spoiler]Majima receives service from a woman named Tateyama, who turns out to be Makoto Makimura, who Majima saved from the Tojo Clan 18 years prior. Majima, while attempting to hide his identity, learns that Makoto still kept her old watch as a memento of her savior. Some time later, Makoto leaves the country with her family; she receives an anonymous gift prior to her departure, which turns out to be a replacement strap for her watch. Realizing that her customer that day was also her savior 18 years ago, Makoto finally finds comfort knowing she has no regrets leaving Japan.[/spoiler]I was crying when I saw this happy ending between them. What can be more emotional than this?How romantic Majima is!

[h1]This is a must play for men.[/h1]

This time around the combat system changes from separate battle styles, to a single one that has sprinkles of the previous ones, it took me a while to get used to (after 0 and K1 were so similar at their core) but it's really enjoyable. The PC version seems to have wacky physics (from what I understand this doesn't happen on the original console release), but they are not annoying, the're quite hilarious at times.
The fact that the entire town is present at all times with seaming-less transitions in between battle, roaming and even entering shops, makes Kamurocho feel more alive than ever.
Besides the main story line, K2 has not one but two side businesses, similar to 0 though this time both managed by Kiryu, the Cabaret Club feels just as great it did in 0, and it includes some new changes like skills the hostesses can posses. On the other hand, there is also a ""tower defense"" like mode in Clan Creator, where you need to strategize the position of your worker units to protect your equipment. Both modes come with their own storyline to immerse yourself more in the world and provide as side activities you can do while taking a rest from the main story.
Overall I enjoyed the game a lot, I don't have many noticeable bad experiences with it, besides the fact that one minigame is completely broken and unplayable in this version, and the solution is to either apply a fan patch or change the game to run at 30 fps manually.

The main differences in terms of gameplay is that the battle stances are gone and instead you focus on unlocking upgrades for a single stance reminiscent of the Dragon of Dojima stance from the previous two games, whether this is good or bad depends on personal preference, as for me I vastly prefer it this way where you feel more rewarded for practicing your skill rather than just using the stance the game wants you to.

[h1]""Finally, Virtua On and Virtua Fighter on PC. Also included: Yakuza Kiwami 2""[/h1]

I’m going to talk about some mundane technical stuff for a while. By doing this, I can trick people into thinking that this review isn’t going to veer hard into sheer weirdness later on.

Yakuza 2 is a 2008 PS2 explorative brawler that, quite secretly, was kind of excellent. It’s the continuing tale of Kazuma Kiryu, a former Yakuza member trying to make a go of it as a civilian. He’s really bad at it. Turns out his prior employers, The Tojo Clan, are having major issues with a rival faction, the Omni Alliance, and have genuine fears of being assimilated. After the events from the previous game, they’re drastically short of manpower, so are forced to turn to Kiryu. In an attempt to avoid outright war between the two factions, he agrees to go on a diplomatic mission, visiting the Omni to try and barter peace. To his surprise, the senior members of the alliance seem pretty receptive to the whole idea. Everything seems to be going well. Until it isn’t.

Most of the blame can be placed on Ryuji Goda, the impatient patriarch of an upstart Omni splinter clan spoiling for conflict. Ryuji’s this massive hulk of a man, always seemingly on the verge of losing his shit and battering everything in sight. But writing him off as a brainless lug would be a mistake; it’s his careful scheming that continues to snatch away any hope of the peace talks succeeding. He steals scenes by sheer presence. He’s a rumbling volcano of an antagonist you’re always expecting to explode, but contradicts this with an air of intelligence that makes him all the more chilling. He wants a war. If anyone can get one, it’s him.

This was all very well received, with a lot of series veterans ranking Ryuji as the best foil the series has yet to produce. But more people should have been part of this discussion; Despite being critically acclaimed at every step and having a loyal, vocal fanbase Yakuza never graduated any further than an underground hit outside of Japan. Then Yakuza 0 happened and everyone finally piled on the bandwagon. And they were very, very happy to find there was this whopping back catalogue of games to work through, giving SEGA the luxurious problem that there was a massive spike of interest in their old games. The speed bump was that the early, early entries were three console generations removed, but they had to find their way onto the market somehow. SEGA could have taken the easy route, shined their archaic software up as best they could and released them as HD remasters (as they would for most of the series) but they went above and beyond for the most venerable games. Yakuza 1 & 2 became Yakuza Kiwami 1 & 2, both rebuilt from the ground up using the new engine developed initially for Yakuza 6. And there was much rejoicing.

This is probably going to end up being a long review already, so I’ll try and save us both some effort and tell you that the Kiwamis make a ridiculous amount of quality of life changes, transforming brilliant games ravaged by time into brilliant games that take advantage of modern advancements. It was a stroke of genius from the giant brains over at SEGA, meaning that people could transition from the series prequel, Yakuza 0, straight into the established canon without a massive quality drop. People making the trip to Yakuza Kiwami found themselves playing a faithful adaptation of the original game with all the bluster and sheen found in Zero. Good times were had. And then Kiwami 2 blew it away.

It’s the bigger game, for one, but it also had more extras implemented. It adopted the cabaret manager side quest from Zero and the RTS clan creator from Six. There’s three unlockable chapters for lovable psychopath, Goro Majima, explaining what he’s been up to between games, and even tying back to his origins in Zero. Where perhaps it noticeably falters in comparison is that, rather than adopt the same combat system as Zero and the first Kiwami, which gave you multiple fighting stances you can cycle through mid-combat, it instead refines Six’s single-style combat, but with a renewed interest in heat actions. These are high-powered attacks that momentarily pause combat to allow Kiryu to do something unspeakable to his opponents. Like ruthlessly batter them with a traffic cone. Or stab them in the belly before driving the knife even further in with a sadistic knee lift. Or throwing them groin-first into a nearby pylon. Or casually dropping them onto an already downed thug. Or, and this one really sucks, being lobbed a used plunger from a friendly toilet attendant, suction cupping someone’s face with it, then using it to repeatedly mash the back of their head into the floor. You’ll eventually pry the plunger free from your victim’s face, complete with a splattering of the urinal water that was trapped within.

Lack of different combat styles mean less variety of combos and heat moves but still It is more enjoyable as compared to Kiwami 1, thanks to the removal of that Infuriating Health Regen mechanic of Bosses. Boss Fights in this are cakewalks thanks to some OP weapons.

As usual the story starts off slow but really starts to pick up as the mystery unfolds, The first few sub-stories are just simple quests of fetching or beating-up few enemies to acquire some allies around the city for Ally Heat-Moves which I didn't even bothered to unlock, only after these are the real wacky stuff.

Out of the 2 major [b]mini-games[/b] in this, I never touched Clan-Creator after the tutorial but Cabaret-Club is the real deal as this one can be considered as a direct sequel to the Yakuza 0's Cabaret Club but with more hilarious Dating mini-game which is just Kiryu teasing or getting teased by Hostesses and ofcourse we also get to dress-up girls, couldn't ask for more!
Majima Saga is cherry on top as we finally get to play as The Mad Dog himself and this also ties some loose ends left by Yakuza 0.

This review is hot off completing Yakuza Kiwami 2 to completion, so this will be much fresher than my previous two reviews. As I had much more enjoyment with this one than Kiwami, it should hopefully be a shorter review akin to my 0 review. 

Yakuza Kiwami 2 truly earns the Kiwami moniker, with a bomb going off in the Millenium Tower setting the stage for the epic feud between East and West that lies ahead. Kazuma Kiryu is once again enthralled into the Tojo Clan's affairs after leaving it behind in the last game, and his adventure is one hell of a ride. Kiwami 2 has a great story that matches the intensity and emotion of 0's, and it's easy to see why I liked 0's story so much when this story existed well before that game. Not only does this game give some pretty memorable sequences, it also has a memorable villain to boot, after coming off of Kiwami's disappointing final villain, it is truly a breath of fresh air. Kiwami 2's story is how you build upon an alright first game to great effect. While not quite as grounded as Kiwami's story, I don't see that as an entirely bad thing. I recommend getting the music patch as some of the original songs weren't licensed and some scenes lose their effect due to this change.

New to the Kiwami edition is the Majima Saga as well, though it should be renamed Majima's Side Story, as it is fairly short and only offers a glimpse as to how Majima got to where he is in the story. Though it is short and the effects of it are negligible at best, it does have you meet up with a certain someone again, and that makes it worth playing if you were gripped by Majima's narrative in 0.

Kiwami 2 runs off the Dragon Engine, and it is a sight to behold. While the uncapped framerates makes the ragdolls look more comedic than realistic, the game looks and runs pretty alright on my mid-tier machine. Certain minigames were cut and the variety isn't as vast as 0, this means you'd have an easier time doing the completion list for the minigames, at least. Some minigames have been made drastically easier (darts), while some prove to be a bit challenging (getting 30 mahjong wins is a tedium that's not appreciated). In order to do the Toylets minigame though, consider getting the SilentPatch to make it playable above 30 FPS.

Kiwami 2 sees the return of the best 0 minigame, Cabaret Club, as Kiryu is basically doing what Majima did in the 80's again. While it feels derivative at times in the story and accompanying substories, it's helped by still being at it's core, the Cabaret Club. If you loved it as much as I did, this will be a treat for you. New to the Kiwami rendition is also Clan Creator, which is a tower defense-ish minigame where you command Majima's construction crew to fend off against realtors and goons who want to take over the Kamurocho Hills project. This proves to be an alright minigame, though the final mission sees a great spike in difficulty if not prepared. There is a DLC that gives you really good characters, and I did that so I cannot confirm for non-DLC characters, but I believe it's doable as there is a wide range of characters to recruit into singing Majima Construction's theme.

Kiwami 2 is also home to some of the most legendary substories, perhaps in all of the Yakuza games up until this point. Kiwami suffered from having a lot of repetitive substories that involved people trying to scam Kiryu continuously, but it did have substories that pertained to the main plot. The substories here are of the quality of 0's, meaning most of them are fairly memorable and fun to do. You won't be disappointed in this department.

Combat is quite different from the games that preceded it. It's oddly weighty and you can't break enemy blocks anymore. While this is pretty annoying being constantly stopped mid-combo, the combat is still good enough to have enjoyment out of this one. It is probably the easiest game in the series as of late, especially with the help of the Weapon Master skill, which allows you to max out the durability of a weapon as long as it isn't broken. This basically gives you infinite durability (as long as you keep swapping or removing them before they break) until you are able to purchase the infinite durability weapons in Premium Adventure. Playing on Legend also doesn't make the QTEs faster, most likely because if you fail a boss QTE, you have to restart again (I know from experience doing the last section on Legend, real embarrassing).

Climax Battles are replaced with Bouncer missions, and if you bought the DLC that gave you some better weapons at the start, also with the help of the Weapon Master skill, it becomes fun in the earlier sections and more doable as you near the end. I much prefer this to doing pre-set missions with certain parameters, as you have access to your gear and weapons in the Bouncer missions, making them more fun to do even if there are a lot of them to do.

Yakuza Kiwami 2 is probably some of the best fun I've had since 0. Kiwami in retrospect, is a necessary stepping stone to really enjoy Kiwami 2, and that is all the more worth it to experience one of the highs of the Yakuza series as of playing the series. While going into Yakuza 3 will need a lot of getting used to, this truly is the better of the 2 Yakuza games to have gotten the Kiwami treatment. A terrific continuation of the Dragon of Dojima's story, and some of his most defining moments are seen in this one.

+ Unique Eating mechanics

+ Good Combat Animation

Cons
- After Playing Yakuza 0, combat in this game feels off. You effective move in the beggining is throwing and using weapon. in yakuza 0 you have 4 different fighting style so the combat is variative and good (except rush style).But after a while you will adapt this combat mechanic. And its okay
- Fewer Heat action than yakuza 0
- Weird Ragdoll Animation
- Facial Animation in Sayama and Haruka not as good as Kiryu and the other cast

Despite a lackluster story and really funny Dragon Engine physics, the charm carries this game through.",1622957770,1622957770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are definitely a lot of quality of life improvements which were much needed like more storage as well as the stacking of items. The experience system on the other hand seemed it was made more complicated for no apparent reason . The simple completion point system of the first game was vastly superior in my opinion. The story is really good with plenty twists and turns. The visuals have been improved drastically since the first remake , at first i could not recognize the city of Kamurocho since it looked exceedingly better than it did in the first game. They also have added another playable city named Sotenbori which is much smaller in size to Kamurocho but definitely adds much needed freshness to the game. The fighting system has also been simplified with only one style instead of the four in the previous game which was for the better as i see it. The side content has also been considerably improved with more engaging side quests and unique characters. There is also a separate 2 hour campaign where you play as Majima (unlocked by completing the main campaign) which is really fun as Majimas fighting style is much different from Kazuma's. But the main draw of this game which made me sink considerable hours into just one single playthrough were the Majima Construction and Hostess Club management minigames. They were really well made with a lot of thought put into it even though they were completely optional. People who like basic management style games will definitely love this.

Pros:
- Improved graphics, animation, lightning and physics
- Improved ambience
- Combat improved (in parts)
- Cabaret Grand Prix
- Combat Arena
- Majima Saga (too short and just a fan service, but good nonetheless)

Cons:
- History subpar to 0 and 1, but its ok
- Bugs and crashes (first time i had crash in a yakuza game)
- strange physics sometimes (ragdoll)
- Majima Construction (boring tower defense)
- Some sub histories tied to pain in the ass mini games
- Objects break like made of paper
- Sub histories that already appeared in other yakuza games

The cons arent that bad, just annoyances (except crashes, that i found excessive).

Yakuza Kiwami 2 has such an incredibly strong story it's ridiculous. Ryuji Goda is the best antagonist of any Yakuza game I have played so far (those being Y0, YK and YK2), he has so much presence and absolutely steals every scene he's in. His motivation for specifically fighting Kiryu is kinda weak but I don't care, Ryuji is probably one of my top 3 favourite Yakuza characters. Kaoru Sayama is a fantastic foil to Kiryu and her place in the story is super well written. Fuck, dude, this game's plot is so fucking good it's worth playing it just for that.

The new engine is also amazing. The game looks incredible, the most major gripe I have with the engine that Y0 and YK run on is that everything looks kinda like plastic but Kiwami 2's engine looks great. The new engine has also totally switched up how the combat works. Yakuza Kiwami 2 has had the best combat of the games I've played so far. 0 and Kiwami 1 all had moments where I got frustrated with the combat but that never happened in Kiwami 2. Grabbing a dude twice Kiryu's weight, spinning him in a circle and then tossing him into 4 other guys will never not be fun. If I have a complaint, it's the removal of the multiple fighting styles. 0 and Kiwami 1 let you switch between 3 fighting styles whereas this game combines them all into one, sort of how the Dragon style from Kiwami 1 worked except much smoother. It's by no means a bad system and, like I said, it's really fun to kick people's asses with it but it does make combat feel somewhat more repetitive since youre invariably throwing out the same combos and heat moves against every enemy. The way Kiryu moves also makes combat feel a bit floaty and less grounded than it did in Y0 and Kiwami. Again though these are very minor complaints, I absolutely loved Kiwami 2's combat.

In terms of side content, Kiwami 2 knocks it out of the park. The substories are all so much fun to play (dont play the Be My Baby substory, worst mistake of my life), there are entirely separate games contained within the in-game arcades, like Virtua Fighter, which are addicting in their own right. Hell, there's an entire RTS game in here disguised as a construction company run by a shirtless man with an eyepatch. What the fuck. There's also a B-story, the Majima Saga, that you can play once you've beaten the main game. It's very short, only 3 chapters long, but it still serves you your Majima fix and acts as both a nice prologue to this game and a good epilogue to Yakuza 0. Everything about Yakuza Kiwami 2 earns it that £25 price tag (the second highest in the franchise, behind Like a Dragon which costs £50). One of my absolute favourite games of all time.

The story of the Dragon of Dojima continues in this extremely faithful remake of the PS2 original, as he finds himself dealing with the threat of the Omi Alliance's Ryuji Goda and a broken, messed up Tojo Clan that desperately needs the help of a legendary Yakuza. 
How will Kiryu face the challenges ahead and deal with the hardships of a potential new clan war? By beating the shit out of everyone with his bare fists, bicycles, traffic cones and household items. Duh.

It's not like I had low expectations or anything (especially considering just how masterfully crafted each Yakuza game is) but man, I'd say it's among my favorites solely because of how it handled certain aspects.

First off, the game looks great. This was the first Yakuza game on PC to use the Dragon Engine (The one used for Yakuza 6, Judgment and Like a Dragon, just to be clear) and it shows. Both Kamurocho and Sotenbori are oozing with life, detail and colors and the game doesn't have the stupid 30 FPS lock that still plagues the console versions, even the recent Xbox port.

The soundtrack is pretty neat too. I don't think it's as good as 0 (Or hell, even Kiwami 1) but it has a lot of catchy tunes that perfectly fit each situation they're played in. ""Outlaw's Lullaby"", ""Break Off"" and ""A Scattered Moment"" are my personal favorites (Careful though, if you search the latter online you're bound to find a LOT of spoilers. Trust me, you'll like *that* in-game moment where the song plays a helluva lot more if you go blind).

Lastly, and I MUST talk about this since others rarely do that: pacing. My God. One of Yakuza's biggest issues (Even in some of its best chapters) is story pacing. There are many, many occasions in Yakuza 0, Kiwami 1 and Yakuza 5 where the story suddenly comes to a screeching halt just for the games to ask you to do mundane, boring stuff.

Not with Kiwami 2 though, the game keeps moving and moving and it doesn't let up.
From the moment you start the game until the very end, Kiwami 2 keeps things interesting and bombards you with unexpected twists, amazing characters, badass action and even major tearjerkers.

And the best part is that it never seems to lose its spark and interest, it never overdoes things.
It knows when to drop the big reveals and it knows when it's time for the player to kick back and relax.
The pacing in Kiwami 2 is legendary.

My only complaints are that the game is VERY easy and that the fighting mechanics were kinda downgraded when compared to 0 and Kiwami's four-style combat system. It's not BAD, mind you... But it kinda devolves into button mashing.
As long as you keep upgrading your stats regularly and buy, like, 5 health items before each major fight, you're gonna be fine and nothing will really ""challenge"" you.

Other than that, though? Not a lot to complain about. 
Yakuza Kiwami 2 does not reach perfection (then again, no game does that) but it's still a rock solid experience for old and new fans alike. I highly recommend this one.",1621586873,1621586873,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

The fighting in those games wasn't bad by any means, but K2's combat just feels more fluid to me. The lack of loading screens when you enter restaurants and stores is also a very welcome bonus. As per Yakuza tradition, there's lots of substories to dig into, and this game has a number of wacky and memorable ones.

I love the return of the Cabaret Club mini game. I spent an ungodly amount of time on that in 0, and I am happy to say that I have ""As You Like"" playing on loop in my head again after 3 years. On the other hand, Clan Creator was... okay for me? I'm not the best at tower defense games, but after getting used to the mechanics I could complete most of the stages in one try. My advice is to get one employee who's ability can repair equipment, one who can heal your fighters' HP. The other two abilities are up to you. Good luck with having the Majima Construction Anthem permanently drilled into your brain. 

Story-wise, I still feel this game pales in comparison to 0. I might just be biased because 0 was my first Yakuza game, but I just wasn't as emotionally invested in K2's main plot? I do like most of the characters (especially Yayoi and Daigo), and I think Ryuji is a cool and pretty intimidating antagonist. Kaoru is badass and I like her as well, but her romance with Kiryu feels a bit... rushed, in my opinion. It's only been a year since the events of Kiwami and I find it a little hard to believe that Kiryu would move on so quickly. But IDK, as someone with little interest in romance that might just be a me problem ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

(Not to mention how the devs chucked her away right off the bat in Y3 despite everything Kiryu and Kaoru went through in this game, which I find both hilarious and a little sad.)

Majima Saga though... hoo boy. I completed it within an hour but it was the most emotional I ever got while playing this game. It's a nice and satisfying conclusion to Majima and Makoto's story. I won't say anything more but yes, I cried. Just a little.

To sum everything up, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. I wouldn't pick up K2 as an entry point to this series, but it's a solid game with tons of stuff to do, fun combat, and a story with unexpected twists and turns.

The combat system is super fun and I have never been bored playing one of these games. The heat actions are entertaining and badass and it makes every battle that much enjoyable.

There's loads of stuff to do in these games tons of mini games and stuff. It also features classic games of the past Such as Virtual Fighter and ect. The substories offers a break from the man story and provides witty conversations, heartwarming moments and a tad bit of stupidity and shock. 

The RPG mechanic aka attribution points really makes these games feel like a good JRPG. You can use them to unlock more heat actions and boost Kiyru's stats. And to top it all off you can carry over these things into NG+ and continue upgrading Kiryu from there in case you haven't fully upgraded him yet. It adds more reply value to the game itself.

The graphics are also amazing, the controls feel smooth, and the world itself is pretty cool. 

I don't just recommend Yakuza Kiwami 2 I recommend all the Yakuza games. 

The games are pretty affordable and easy to get. Especially on consoles such as the PS4 and Xbox since they offer every single game for 20$ it's almost the same on PC as well except Yakuza Kiwami 2.

After finishing Kiwami 1, I went straight to Kiwami 2 because spoiled myself with the graphics this one had. Now having done most of the sidequests (Except for the final sidequest), I'll put a review here,

The story picks up literally after Kiwami 1. Kiryu, the main character, can't catch a break and is pulled to the Yakuza world once again. The story is cheesy and melodramatic and overall enjoyable. To be honest, I'm not really a fan of overdramatic parts of the game (and also the plot twist), but overall this story is good and a fun ride. To bad we won't see a certain interesting character from this game in future releases.

Gameplay is the main strong point in this one. The newer Dragon Engine same as the one used in Yakuza 6 (haven't played that one) is used for this game. The physics although goofy are perfect satisfying to see. The combat now more resembles a bit of Sleeping Dogs (the game where I expected Yakuza to be) but has its own unique mechanics. Although the heat actions are a bit underwhelming at first (especially coming from Yakuza Zero and Kiwami), I watched to old Yakuza 2 game and realised the devs stayed close and faithful to the old game's heat actions so I'll give it a pass. 

Free roaming is fun. Kamurocho is detailed af with this engine. Although smaller in size compared to GTA and Assassins Creeds' worlds, the content is all over the place in every nooks and cranny. Theres also a second city to explore. 

All the sidequests and substories are fun except for the Majima Construction Arc. Ngl that arc is the last thing I did in this game and it is boring af. I'm not really a strategy type of person but even learning all the chracters, upgrading, and making formations and shit never really made it interesting. Its a good thing that it was a sidequest instead of a main one. The Cabaret Club Arc was fun tho.

Overall, very fun. 4/5

Edit: I don't know how I forget to mention the Majima Saga. That saga acts as a sidestory and takes place before the main plot. The Majima Saga really gave closure to Majima's character. Having not be a fan of the main story, this one atleast satisfied me. Yakuza 0 fans, this one should not be ignored.",1612090487,1620803004,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Everything in this game is as good as 0 and Kiwami or improved, except for one: Combat.

It's terrible.

- There's no flow of combat. A mere block can stop your combo;
Actually the inexistent flow of combat shows on every encounter you have and it's even worse on bosses.
- You get ragdolled in a silly manner if you get knocked down, it breaks immersion even;
- The lock on is terrible;
For you at least, on the enemies it's so great that if you hit the from behind the automatically turn towards you mid combo and guess what... They block, or dodge, or parry, or poise like if they're wearing a full Havel set and break your flow of combat.
- Remember styles from 0 and Kiwami? Yes they're gone, you're stuck with Dragon of Dojima style. And a gimped one that you must level and yada yada;
- Have i mentioned that the flow of combat of this game is broken all the time and at times you'll fight bosses by hitting one or two light punches or spamming charged atacks? All those things that you learned from the previous titles are thrown out of the window.

I hope it get's better.",1620366327,1620366327,False,1,0,0.445677429437637329,0,True,False,False

is a beat-em-up game. You control Kiryu Kazuma through his life as a Yakuza.
You can roam around the city, to beat some thugs along the way, level up his skill, play minigame, earn some money, etc.

Game has a superb story, it is recommended that you play through the previous title, Yakuza Kiwami (and Yakuza 0 optionally, the prequel). Although you can get to play this title directly and do the ""remember past events"" on the start of the game to get the gist of the story before Yakuza Kiwami 2.

There are a lot of side events and minigames that you can do along the way if you want to complete the trophy, They are fun.

The main story takes me about 16 hours to complete, and the rest of the time i ended up messing around with the side quests and minigame. Those 16 hours of gameplay and story entertain me with hot-blooded action and fun.

I truly recommend getting this game. Get the Yakuza Pack for cheaper price, and better on discount, as you will want to complete the whole series as they are fun.

The story did not grab me as much this time as in 0 and Kiwami 1, but it was still mostly okay and I am always happy to see Kiryu kick more butt. The ending was among the worst things I have ever seen, though - it was the video game equivalent of a car pile up, made almost zero sense and left a very sour taste in my mouth. Going forward in my journey through the Yakuza franchise, I may choose to forget it altogether for my own sanity's sake.

Still, all things considered, it is more Yakuza, with all the over-the-top things you have come to expect by now. Fighting is still mediocre, the side activities are mostly fun - though Majima's construction blows - and the city is absolutely beautiful. A great way to spend some more time in the Yakuza world if you can look past some (heavy) story inconsistencies/flaws and one heavily flawed side activity.",1619919377,1619919546,True,3,0,0.554751217365264893,0,True,False,False

it uses the Dragon engine. 10/10

the story is pretty similar to that of the first [i]Yakuza Kiwami[/i], but I feel as though this one is much easier to follow. a lot of excellent characters from that game return for this fabulous experience. Ryuji Goda is easily one of the best villains in the series and once you've played this you should understand exactly why.

the graphics are astounding. beautiful. gorgeous. Kamurocho looks so vibrant on this new engine. can't get enough of how this game looks, even with its strange yellow/greenish tint on everything it looks amazing. something that blew my mind in this game is that there are absolutely NO loading screens transferring from the outdoors to inside a building, shop, whatever. it feels so smooth even with my somewhat unimpressive PC specs. newer engines really do games wonders when done right.

it has a much more nuanced combat system combining all of Kiryu's styles from the previous two entries into one. the combat system in this one feels very far detached from that of the previous two entries, so it's a little jarring. it's a little strange to adjust to, but once you're used to it it feels pretty great. I think I still prefer the combat of [i]Yakuza 0[/i], though. having a proper physics engine and being able to fling objects (or people) into enemies is immensely satisfying. although, everything feels a bit floaty and I found a lot of enemies bugging out in hilarious ways, nothing I'd consider game-breaking. 

plus, you get to play as Majima in the Majima Saga once you've beaten the game.

This game is great, the map is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, the story is top tier, everything is perfect really. Minigames are great or atleast better than previous games (FINALLY, MAHJONG TILES WITH NUMBERS ON!), and some stuff that is just mindblowing compared to the earlier games (walking into stores directly!)

You can ignore the below rant on combat.

However... honestly... when I first played this game I loved it, especially how it forced me to adapt to combat properly (I was overly reliant on dodging in Yakuza 0 + Kiwami, meaning I never blocked). After dumping another 120 hours in Yakuza 0 and replaying Kiwami to 100% completion on a new Legend save I genuinely felt like a true master of the combat system that could run circles around all opponents. Kiwami 2 honestly feels much worse in terms of combat.  People that play on KB+M no doubt will complain it feels floaty, hence why the game tells you ""real yakuza use gamepad""- which couldn't be more important for this game particularly. To me though, the main issue with combat isn't the floatyness, its the unreliable, imprecise, fighting. Kiryu always sprints around, meaning group combat can be a bit harder to co-ordinate (unless you want to barely move your joystick to make him walk, but that makes dodging punches unreliable). Heat actions only seem to work on command about 50% of the time, which sounds annoying but its absolutely soul destroying on Legend difficulty (asin, you do an animation that should allow a heat action afterwards but half the time the command won't even come up, or comes up for literally a frame). The arena has bullshit lock-in animations which can bully your health to 0 in no time flat, and blocking now cancels your combos, which absolutely destroys the flow of combat that Y0 and YK had. <- this cannot be overstated

You can carry an absurd amount of health boosters around, so late-game combat is honestly a joke compared to other games in the series if you know what you are doing.

The fun substory ""essence of..."" abilities are way overpriced.

Some minigames (milky nose, mahjong) are extremely hard to do for the completion list, and if you try to 100% your legend saves (like me, the moron) its a bad idea because the final bouncer missions on Legend: Legend are ABSOLUTELY impossible. 

Overall though this is a fantastic game, but if you want to 100% a Yakuza game, definitely don't pick this one. It is heavily recommended to play the prior Yakuza games too, to understand what is going on.",1618262331,1618262582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It changes the combat formula up but if you give it a chance and don't consider using items/weapons cheap, you'll have a blast. I'm already simultaneously dreading but looking forward to playing Yakuza 3, if only to see the story play out.

Going from Kiwami 1 (K1) to Kiwami 2 (K2) is kind of a shock since K2 was made using the engine RGG made for Yakuza 6, so we get a glimpse of that combat. A lot of people I know hated the combat in K2, and honestly I went from going ""oh, it's refreshing"" to ""man this sucks"" and settling on ""ok this is a net good improvement... maybe?"" - it's still up in the air but I think overall once you start unlocking moves with EXP and using items (like RGG wants us to), the combat potential opens up again. There's still something off that I can't put my thumb on.

Kiwami 2 captures that feeling Yakuza 0 (Y0) gave to me where I felt an actual desire to explore the old stomping grounds of Kamurocho and Sotenbori. A lot has changed in the world since K1, let alone Y0. The cities felt alive, even a bit moreso than Y0. Being able to enter and exit buildings seamlessly instead of pressing a button to move to a new section of the map that held the interior of the store? Beautiful.

Majima Construction was an awful minigame. Conversely, the Cabaret Club was a welcome surprise.

The game is filled with rich looking cut scenes from the moment you start the game to the end of the game. That's what sets this game apart from all the other games I have tried in the past. I usually skip a lot of the cut scenes in other video games but what I found to be the best aspect in this game was how the game tries its best to put you in the world of the Yakuza. The characters displaying emotions in scenes really helps you understand the characters better. My favorite character would probably have to be Majima though. There are a few parts in the game where I got in a few laughs from him. Especially, when he bangs his head on the steel table. Most of the game is really just cut scenes. Sometimes the characters exaggerate certain tasks but a lot of times, the missions turn out to be really easy. The game, for me at least, was a lot easier than Yakuza Kiwami 1. The battles in the first game seemed a lot harder than the ones in this game. The ending didn't feel all that epic but I understood the story a little better.

The city in the game appears to be small and at first glance I'm thinking, this game shouldn't be that hard! The city here looks like I can get through it in a few days. While I didn't get through most of the side quests in two days, the side quests really had me going all over the place. There's a lot of secret interactions within the city and minigames one could take part in. It had so much to offer but I didn't like how there are street gangs literally on every other block in the game. It gets annoying fighting/avoiding them. One would have to devise a plan to avoid them to try and get to your main objective or side quest. 

There was only one fight I needed help on and that was the first fight with that one blonde dude. His name started with an R. The game asked me if I wanted to switch over to easy and I did. Sure, I felt guilty but doing that made me want to continue the story instead of adding this game to my junk list just because I couldn't beat one enemy.

All in all, if you like a good story with some Tekken styled violence, you should add this one to your wish list. Maybe you're not like me and won't beat this game in a few days and enjoy the whole game on your own time. I'm not saying I just wanted to get this game out of the way, I just have a tendency to want to get things done. I will definitely come back to this gem. 5/5",1616615073,1616615073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a good sequel. Yet again. Remade. 1080p. More than 60 fps. Console gamers, eat your heart out. 

Mocking aside, HOLY DAMN how good this game looks, graphically. We'll start there. Kamurocho and Sotenbori now really, REALLY looks AWESOME deluxe, no doubt thanks to the fantastic Dragon engine. The lights in the city, the reflections of the water, the wrinkles of Granny White - It all looks so good! It is superior to a lot of other titles, graphically.

Gameplay-wise, I'd say a lot has changed from 0 and Kiwami. For the better? Maybe. For the worse? No. You have physics now... Or well, you did in 0/Kiwami too, but now they cranked it up from 6 to 10. The player ragdolls when he takes a mace to the face, the NPCs flail around. A BIT immersion-breaking, but I learned to ignore it really fast. Oh, and you don't have the 4 styles of fighting anymore, just your fists and the eventual weapon you pick up. HOWEVER: I think this was a good choice. Sure, the styles were awesome, BUT, switching to them in a middle of a fight is something that you sometimes ""forget"" to do, because you got so experienced with one of them. I am on the fence about this, BUT I found myself using weapons much more, which made for so many more awesome combos and finishers. You can pick up signs and physics objects, and as you do a finisher, you sometimes get a QTE, which I think is based on how much Heat you have. It's fun and destroys faces.

The side missions are fun as always. No, really. Not only do you have the usual sub-stories, but now you can walk with Haruka, hand in hand as she drags you around Kamurocho and Sotenbori asking for stuff to do. Of course, little angel, let's go to a ramen store, just gotta beat these guys up first...

Speaking of: The encounter thingy has been changed quite a bit. You know in 0 and Kiwami when you bump into someone? Yeah, that doesn't happen here. Now you see where the NPCs that will fight you are, so that you have a good chance to just run off. You could do this in 0/Kiwami as well, but I feel it is better ""refined"" here. Well, whatever. It makes for some good EXP beating the thugs up, so I usually rushed into them full speed. 

The EXP system has been changed. Now you get these 5 different ""orbs"" after a fight. I don't know exactly what each of them mean, but if you have 100 reds and 200 blues, you can then unlock the next combo or health upgrade. I like this system.

The story is not as tear-jerking as in Kiwami, but it has its moments. I did feel bad for some of the bad guys, but nothing that left me a sobbing mess (Thanks for that, SEGA. (Talking about Kiwami)). Instead of it being Date-san that follows you around in every chapter, although he is there, the main attraction (and boy do I mean ATTRACTION) is Sayama Kaoru. She forces her way into your heart, and you will eventually come to like her. Trust me, she is a fine one.

I could write so much more about this game. Seriously. The karaoke, the Majima construction mini-game, the kabakura mini-game and so on. But this is something you have to see for yourself to truly get what I mean. 

So ultimately, do I recommend this? Hell yes.

Kiwami 2 is an closure that every fan of Yakuza 0 and previous Kiwami deserves. High note fights, another change towards fighting system they like to twink it every game to keep it fresh. I believe, but it's always filled with satisfaction. Tons of side stories, with a lot of laugh all around. New mini-games, picture dating sim included. Just what the hell...

And the main story, again with power the Ryuji, Kiryu and Majima are making it on point. Especially one in small after story segment. Again a little bit of lack in side cast, but these are hard to find now. New generations of bosses stepping in. Still police department played bigger role and they had some cool characters, special treatment deserves new lady Kaoru Sayama - adds another layer for Kiryu side.

I would say, that it has been closed just as it should. Even though the game is easy no matter the difficulty, because of item stacking. It's still fun to experiment with finishing blows and moves, fights look like they should. So yeah this is Yakuza on the right track again.

The Tojo Clan is in disarray after the events of Yakuza Kiwami, Virtua Fighter 2 has been installed in the Sega Arcade, and Majima has started a construction company—tearing down the homeless camp of West Park in preparation for the Kamurocho Hills office complex. But more dramatic than any of these small developments is Yakuza Kiwami 2's big change: the series' new Dragon engine, and the many improvements and changes it brings.

Yakuza is an economical series that rarely reinvents the wheel. It often reuses assets and animations, because the focus is always on the same handful of districts, and the small ways they change over the course of decades. Kiwami 2 is still a Yakuza game, which means it's a crime drama interspersed by fights, exploration, minigames and substories full of ridiculous slice-of-life character moments that help humanise protagonist Kiryu—making him more than the hardboiled stereotype he could so easily have been. It's also a remake of 2006's Yakuza 2, which, despite looking significantly better, features mostly shot-for-shot recreations of its cutscenes.

Yakuza 2 is usually considered the best game, at least story-wise, so the heavily updated graphics seen in this remake should be a great way to see how this story plays out. 

Gameplay is usual Yakuza fare, though due to this new engine and the up in the quality of character animations it brings, this game's combat tends to feel like it drags on more than it really should. The game still feels as arcade-y as it's PS3-era predecessors, but in a different kind of way, and it's a difference that isn't bad if we were to speak ""objectively"" (as objective as we can be about a video game), but it's not my cup of tea. You'll have to play for yourself to get a better picture of what I'm trying to describe and to see if it's something you'll be into more than I was.

Also, if you liked the Cabaret management minigame from 0, it returns here, and it's still surprisingly fun like it was in 0.

What can I say about Yakuza Kiwami 2 that hasn't already been said about Afghanistan?

First of all I am appalled that this game has an overwhelmingly postive steam rating. 
And I hate to be that guy but the original game is 100 times better than this. Why? Because they f*cked this remake up, that's why.
For reasons including: 
- butchering the combat
- babbyfying the difficulty
- removing substories, minigames, areas from the original
- ruining the atmosphere
- replacing fantastic music from the original with awful new music that barely fits, which ruins otherwise great scenes from the original

Now for the details. 
The combat in this dragon engine is abysmal. It's mashy, there is no thought, the physics are stupid, and it's about as deep as a puddle. If you played this immediately after coming from 0, 3, 4, 5, or hell, even Kiwami 1 for that matter, you know what I mean.
The combat is fundamentally broken and you can effortlessly cheese every enemy/boss, final boss is a cakewalk because of this even on the hardest difficulty. Now for me the worst part of this game is the story. Holy f*ck the story is absolutely terrible, and 60% of the game is cutscenes! I know this is standard faire for Yakuza games, but it's especially dreadful in this title because the story is one of the worst stories I have ever seen written in my life. Stupid twists and cliches happen in other Yakuza titles, but they are fun, entertaining, and really don't take themselves seriously. The writers of this game really thought they were making the new Statue of David or some sh!t. The characters are annoying and terrible,(thank god the worst character leaves at the start of 3 and never comes back) I can go on and on but you get the picture. The graphics look nice, so I guess there's one good thing about it. Overall it's the worst Yakuza game by far

TLDR: Skip the Kiwami demakes and play the originals instead.",1614898939,1614899411,False,2,4,0.436192214488983154,5,True,False,False

Just like Yakuza 6 it's fun after a few hours & then drains me.  Like it's one of the least polished Yakuza games I've played for a reason; 1st would be Dead Souls.  Like I've played the series before it became popular in the west so yeah I can see this for newcomers & yeah if you're a hardcore wrestling fan there's some Japanese wrestling cameos clan creator.  I've said this before like yes I prefer the original over this remake like a real lacking of a soundtrack, side content, heat actions, location removed I guess due to the game being rushed & I guess they could not find a asset to rely on, the arena system is garbage (which I can see why it's not used in 6 due to the Dragon engine), the mini games are even more dumb down, insulting & busy work.  Like yeah I don't not hate this game generally like there are some things I do like they added in like some new heat actions but sadly now octopus back up attack :(, the photography ecchi live action cutscenes are great,  A cabaret club system is great if you enjoy that.  So yeah they gutted the chicken & added new stuff.  Like oh I hated of how some of the cutscenes removed a lot of the subtlety from the game by adding sound effects & it's really hard to take of those scenes seriously that's part of the main story. Plus I don't hate the band SiM this does not fit the game at all like it maybe fits with the Majima story but yeah I prefer Krazy Ken Band like not because of a preference but his soundtrack actually fits with the Mafia crime drama.",1614870649,1614870765,False,1,1,0.502513647079467773,0,True,False,False

For me,the game was fixed by setting the frame rate cap to ""unlimited"" ,but I got a pretty strong build, so keep that in mind. I'd wager different PCs experience different problems.

With that out of the way,I just wanted to say that Ryuji Goda is a massive TURBO CHAD. Nishiki may have been a great villain,but Ryuji I think is the better rival of Kiryu - both being the ""dragons"" that they are, each having a different view on how to use their strength,but both being honorable and badass. 

The game also shows how even the stoic giant that is Kiryu,a man who punches tigers between the eyes, can also have his weaknesses.

Overall,great story,great characters,great OST, return of the cabaret club is welcome, including tons of other mini-games, I love the new combat personally as it is smoother and also - the cinematography of the cutscenes is amazing.

Very good story and subtories, great minigames, with the returning minigames mostly improving, they have added allot of quality of life features, with allot of new features too that make the game more fun. Even though the game has less unique music that hasn't been brought back from past games, the new tracks are still great. Grinding is allot more easier since you just grind for money and eat combination of food to gain 5 types of exp that you can use to slowly upgrade, unlock abilities, stats, minigames upgrades and you can upgrade your sprint now, without using cp (since there isn't a cp system) which for me is a plus. The new characters and the voice acting is still amazing. They added allot of little features that are fun to mess around with, like the objects that are placed throughout the town now have physics, which let you just push them and even destroy them while roaming around, now you can take photos and you can roam around town in first person. Once you are spotted by an enemy, they just walk after you, instead of running. which makes it easier to escape them, you can even run away while in a fight and escape. The heat actions are more funnier and some of them are just straight up hardcore, for example: the most famous one is the heat action where Kiryu literally stick a tube up an enemies anus and pushes it further in by punching it deeper. The three chapters of the Majima saga storyline you unlock throughout progressing the main story where great, since you get to fight as Majima with a limited moveset of the legend style that plays very similarly to the Yakuza 0 version and the ending was very satisfying and emotional.

The bad:

The game has been poorly optimised for pc, in the sense that it lags sometimes when opening up the menu and running the game on high render scale will make your pc lag and/or overheat, even while having the recommended specs. Even after upgrading all of the stats and abilities, the combat in this game is still bad, since it's stiff, slow and just unsatisfying, hitting an enemy that is guarding, leaves you in allot of end lag, it cancels your attack and it completely gets rid of your momentum and speed. Enemies are constantly guarding which makes fighting painfully slow sometimes and they instantly dodge your grabs, sometimes grabbing damages the opponent, without actually letting you get a hold of the enemy you're grabbing, basically acting like a punch that doesn't hit stun. This game has ragdoll physics which can be funny and fun to mess around, but they can be annoying, janky and they ruin the ambience of serious fights, the most annoying thing about it is that, it can send enemies and bosses far away, which make it harder to use heat actions on them and kiryu himself ragdolls, which makes it so you take longer to get up. There isn't any unarmed heat actions or abilities that counter guarding, so the combat is more oriented towards using melee weapons instead, since they counter guards and you can heat action a guarding foe with weapons.

I would recommend to buy this game for anything else, besides the combat, since the combat and the way the game runs is the only big issue that this game has.",1611472203,1614610082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What a conclusion to this sort of original (prequel+remakes) trilogy.

The good:

- The game looks absolutely gorgeous. The Dragon Engine is just beautiful during gameplay and especially the lighting and map designs during freeroam. Some of the cutscenes are also very well animated.

- Almost no loading screens. The freeroam is seamless. Can enter shops, restaurants and minigame locations freely as they are directly connected to the outside of the cities.

-There are physics and proper collision with objects! You can walk through the street and move around benches, bikes and other objects and even break them on rougher contact.Fighting in a store and dropping items from shelves and then the shelf falling off is just so interactive!
When fighting bodies fly back due to knockback. The ragdolling can be a bit silly sometimes but overall it's a great addition.

-Sayama.
Although not playable, she is the 2nd main character of the game and is a great character.
A strong, assertive woman, who is also attractive, feminine, relatable and kind.
No fanservice, no pandering, no agenda forced but just genuinely a good female character. Take note SJW-pandering Western developers.

- Following on the improvement of Kiwami (1) over Yakuza 0, minigames and completionist task are fairly easier to do now. With once again Cheat items having a return. Although things like Mahjong still took a while, the overall experience was far less grindy and annoying compared to Yakuza 0.

- The city of Sotenbori is back :).

- Unlike Kiwami (1), The story here was quite enjoyable and interesting, in some ways even more than 0's.
The triple (Or even quadrupel) twists at the end, that pretty much all happened one after another during the final battle however felt a bit overdone and unnecessary.

-Cabret club minigame is back! And the story directly continues from the original in 0. Awesome!

-Although not a lot, we got some more cute Uncle Kiryu and Haruka moments. Yey!

- Music wasn't too bad. Still can't beat Yakuza 0's OST, but was better than Kiwami (1).

- YOU CAN SKIP PRETTY MUCH ALL DIALOGUE NOW IF YOU WANT TO. WHAT A GODSEND FOR SECOND PLAYTHROUGHS( In my case Legend playthrough). I cannot describe the relief i felt when i noticed it.



My complaints ( Nothing that i would really consider ""BAD""):

- Did we really need 70+ bouncer missions? There was nothing unique in most of them, and the varied difficulties for each map didn't add anything other than healthbars for the most part. A better way to implement this would to just have one of each map instead of 3 and just balance the overall difficulties better, or have less maps all together.

- I wrote this review almost right after i finished the game, and other than the Cabret club side plot, i can't remember a single substory. They were all just not memorable here. Having ZERO voice acting in nearly all of them once again doesn't help either.

- Just like Kiwami (1) and unlike Yakuza 0, you can't skip freeroam battles. It is easier to avoid than before as enemies don't instantly jump you on here and you can maneuver around them better, but still annoying.

-There's a lot of backtracking for both the main missions and the side content. Personally felt worse than the previous 2 games. After almost every main mission, or during every side story, you are always sent to the other end of the map from the location you were. Then once you reach your destination, you have a conversation, maybe a short fight and back to the original position or a different spot at an extreme end of the map. Walking around the map, increased quite a bit of the run time of the game.

- The combat is a bit hit or miss. It's far more enjoyable than Kiwami (1)'s and although i haven't played yet obviously better than 3's. It is rather slow and you can't pull off too many moves as you only have your Dragon style now. 
There is a lot of focus on using weapons and their corresponding heatmoves on this one. It's still fun and works fine, but it ain't great.

-This is an issue with all Yakuza games, or even every Japanese game but you need to suspend a lot of disbelief to enjoy this or any other game of the series. There's a lot of moments where the main characters not only get ridiculous plotarmor, but there's decisions being made by characters that just don't make sense. So many gun standoffs than somehow end up either with fists winning and barely a shot being fired or shots to the body and endless monologue instead of just finishing someone off. It's of course very dramatic and cool, but also so very silly when you really take a moment to think about it later.

- For some reason unlike the previous games, there's no voice acting in main mission dialogue if it isn't Cutscenes. odd choice.

-Clan manager, a sort of tower/base defense minigame, is kinda hit or miss. You'll either sort of like it or be madly bored of it. The subplot revolving around it makes pretty much zero sense even by some Yakuza series standards as well.

-Haruka's design seemed a bit off for me. In Kiwami (1) she looked like a cute kid, but in Kiwami 2 it looks like an aged face was placed on a kids body in a way. Hard to really describe but easy to spot once you see it.


Overall this is a fantastic game, that is cheaply priced even without a sale.
The game is complete, has tons of content, no silly microtransactions or DLC locked content. 

Of course i wouldn't recommend starting with it, playing 0 and Kiwami(1) beforehand would be better.",1614134143,1614134377,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Kiwami 2 is a gem from the Yakuza franchise. It uses the newer game engine that Yakuza 6 and Like a Dragon run on which makes it stand out quite a lot in terms of quality and gameplay. The game looks great, and it plays even better.

The gameplay is the star in this entry as I never had so much fun just bashing my way through Kamurocho and Sotenbori and doing every mini-game and sub-story. I spent hours learning and perfecting my Mahjong gameplay just for the achievement and god damn was it fun when I actually learned how it works. Aside from the side stuff the actual combat is great. It feels smooth, pulling off special moves is a blast, the heat actions are amazing, and just being able to pick someone and spin them into their mates is so fulfilling. The games world is also fully interconnected, there are no loading screens if you're entering a store from the street. Its all just part of the map, which can lead to some fights being led into the convenience marts which then lead to more special heat actions using the store as the canvas.

The story is decent, although I wouldn't say it beats Yakuza 0 for me. But I did enjoy the story in this game quite thoroughly as having something live up to the story of 0 is quite a feat. But just on its own the story was decent and the typical Yakuza story you'd come to expect. Plenty of drama, betrayal, pain and comedy with our favorite major character Majima Goro.

The music was phenomenal and have some truly great pieces that I added to my playlist. High octane and even somber pieces all weave within the gameplay and story to make some truly unforgettable moments in this game.

There's still a lot I did not cover as there is the whole Hostess mini-game (Which is like a continuation but also even better version of the Yakuza 0 hostess mini-game) along with Majima clan creation which was an... interesting strategy game to say the least. Overall I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of the Yakuza franchise as you'll have a great time with it and love every minute of the gameplay.",1614123694,1614123694,True,4,1,0.559321999549865723,0,True,False,False

	If I had to summarize what the Dragon Engine improves on graphically, its primarily the lighting. Because the texture work on the PS3-era games (0, Kiwami 1) holds up well enough that  you'd be hard-pressed to differentiate Majima's model from here or Kiwami 1. It's when you see these models in the new night-time lighting that it sets itself apart. The way water reflects the environment off the floor, and storelights hit the pavement is something I can't imagine on a PS3. It might seem simple, but it changes a lot.

	Lighting and model improvements aside, the devs also have more resources this time around dedicated to areas they previously spent less on. No longer are you going to see low resolution, static textures used for storefront windows on buildings you can't enter. This time around we get NPC's interacting inside with full store decor. You also get debris, chairs, and trash cans that look decent. You'd think these are small improvements that don't do a lot, but you'd be wrong. Kamurocho and Sotenbori also have more buildings you can enter along with more alleyways and crevices that expand the city. But that's to be expected with each iteration.

	Compared to the PS2 game, this is the definite version, albeit not as strongly so as Kiwami 1. Kiwami 1 was almost a 1:1 replica of the first game, with stuff added. Kiwami 2 is 85% the same game, but the town of Shinseicho is missing, as is the male host side-quest. The sidequest had you playing as a male host who's goal it is to raise money, which was just the talking sections of the cabaret mini-game when you're trying to level up the girls (no big loss). The town of Shinseicho is the bigger missing piece here. Shinseicho wasn't relevant to the game-a small area with something like 3 stores, and visited only once. So you're not missing a lot, but they still engaged in the act of subtraction when crafting a remake, and that's always a negative. I get that development time and its irrelevance merited it, but I'd still love to see it in the new engine.

	Still, I'd argue Kiwami is the go-to experience since it adds the cabaret mini-game from 0. The original PS2 release had a cabaret game, but it was drastically different and nowhere near as good as it would turn out to be in later games. You also get the Majima focused side-game (clan fighter); bouncer missions (go through levels and fight bosses); the ""Majima Saga"" mini-campaign (finished in under an hour). The level-up system makes use of food more-so than before, but you can also level up to such a point that the boss battles become a joke. So the overall game is much easier (MUCH easier), if you choose to level up to that point, that is. 

	The combat system is similar to the PS2 original. It's not an exact replica, but it's in the same simplistic sort of vein. All your base combos are the same. As such, weapons play a bigger role since you don't have a mountain of heat actions and ways of opening up blocking enemies. Weapons, with higher base damage, are more viable ways of finishing fights that would otherwise take longer. I could understand staying truer to the PS2 original's combat in a remake (even if they didn't do that with Kiwami 1), but from my understanding this is just Yakuza 6's combat system with slight alterations. 

Like many have stated, combat feels like its regressing in complexity. I'm not so hard on it here since Kiwami 2 is just a remake of Yakuza 2, and in that respect combat is an improvement. It'd be more appropriate to delve into this point in Yakuza 6. As such, I'll say this: there was room to trim Yakuza 0's combat (what was the purpose of 'Brawler'), and combining various elements of the fighting style's isn't a bad idea. That said, the game could use more heat actions and introduce some of the nuances from the missing fighting styles (crowd control of 'Beast' and swiftness of 'Rush'). But combat is improved over the PS2 original, and even on its own I wouldn't call it bad.

	The writing is what I really have some complaints on: more ambitious than the first, but seems to not be able to handle its two story arc well. Yakuza 2 has two plots running parralel to one another. The problem is that the secondary plot (the Korean faction) completely eclipses the first (Ryuji and the Omi) to the point of irrelevance. Ryuji-the guy on the box and the man touted as the main villain-disappears/goes AFK for a LARGE portion of the game and is relegated to a sub-boss. Ryuji and the Omi appear every once in a while to remind you that they're in the game, but they're all ultimately henchmen for the much larger plot at play. They're tied to the secondary story in the easiest and laziest way, further burying that unnecessary plot arc as nothing more than people being useful idiots. It's a shame because Ryuji truly is built up as a fantastic threat, but becomes a wasted character. Imagine the final boss not actually being important to the story.

	Funnily enough, the secondary plot is actually good. It's a crime drama that ties our main character's histories together. Sayaka enters the story as a rookie cop, and comes out the main character of the game. Kiryu is only tangentially involved here, and arguably a secondary character. The only issue is the scenario can get ridiculous on that 'video-game writing' level; a foreign mafia is seeking revenge on the Tojo. Which is fine, but the long amount of time and the lengths some of these people go through to enact it becomes comedic. I like the ambition in the writing, but I can't take some of it seriously. Still like it, though.

	I'm down on how they handled the final boss and the two stories. I'm even down on the missing town of Shinseicho. Let's tack on a third bullet point and beat down how ridiculous a 26 year revenge plot where you become president just to randomly bomb the oval office is. I'll still praise Yakuza 2's ambition and effective dramatic moments. Better than 0? Hell no. Better than 1? I can see why some would prefer Yakuza 1, but I'll take Yakuza 2's larger scope in the end.",1613976315,1614014150,True,3,0,0.467496544122695923,1,True,False,False

Dialogue: 10.0/10
Gameplay: 8.0/10
Setting: 10.0/10

I know this total comes out to 9.0/10, but the sum is greater than the parts together. 

Graphics: 
The environments of Sotenbori and Kamurocho look absolutely stunning in this game. It really feels like the red light districts they are based on. What's a little weird is how detailed the faces are. Some are very well-detailed while other's, not so much. But the faces that are detailed have the best detailing out of any game. 

Sound Design: 
The fighting sounds, the bustling sounds of Tokyo and Osaka, mix very well to give the game a high score in that regard. 

Soundtrack:
The soundtrack has an abundance of music. What I really liked is how Sotenbori and Kamurocho have different songs playing while you fight, to represent the difference in location. Some of the songs they bring in, for example, ""The Sound of Breath"" by SiM is absolutely fantastic for the ending and does soundtrack right. 

Plot:
This game plot is very sensible and it always keeps you on your toes. The pacing is excellent and it doesn't feel drawn out. The villains are those you can sympathize with and the supporting cast is amazing. This game is one of the best, if not the best story in video game history. It is slightly better than Yakuza 0's story. There's also the Majima Saga, which is about an hour long, but provides some really good closure for the events of Yakuza 0 and is fun to play. 

Dialogue:
Nothing to complain about. All the banter makes sense, nothing is out of place, and the comedic dialogue is quite good as well. We can really see the voice actors put their heart into their lines so it's pretty great overall. 

Gameplay:
The gameplay takes a step back from Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, but the gameplay is still very satisfying for a beat 'em up game. The heat moves are in less quantity, but when you execute on them, are just as satisfying. The side quests and the minigames are also super satisfying. The story takes about 20 hours to complete, and I dumped 40 hours into the game. 

Setting:
Sotenbori and Kamurocho feel like very bustling environments and are a proper city, in comparison to other cities, for example, Los Santos in GTA V. There are so many side quests.

Say goodbye to the multiple fighting styles and hello to the one and only Dragon Style, fitting of Kiryu Kazuma but an unfortunate farewell for the players. If you've played Yakuza 0, Kiwami and are now playing Kiwami 2 in a row like I did, I recommend setting the difficulty to 'Hard' because after a couple substories and your incredible fighting skills, the game gets incredibly easy.
The story for Kiwami 2 is, in my opinion, the best out of Kiwami and Kiwami 2. You still have the main cast and a certain someone who makes an appearance for the first time. You finally visit Sotenbori once again and get all the feels and nostalgia from Yakuza 0 and Majima is still the beautiful bastard we know and love. You also fight another Dragon for the first time in 20 something years! You should also do yourself a favor and play the Majima Prologue, it is REALLY good and offers closure for some tied knots.

I've seen a lot of people praising it and I don't really get why.

I can't say the game doesn't have its moments, because it does, and the graphics really impressed me compared with the other 2 I played.

The story wasn't as good as the previous 2 I mentioned, the side stories were uninspired and there was even two recycled ones from Kiwami 1.
The Majima minigame has a nice story with some funny moments, but the gameplay itself was terrible.
Managing Four Shine (the cabaret) was kinda nice, but has been done before, and I can't really put my finger on what it was, but for me on yakuza 0 was better.

For me the combat has suffered a lot, it's much simpler now, and I'm not talking about the multiple combat styles that are gone, for me that doesn't matter much. But the heat actions are much more limited now, and what you can do in general as well. Recycled animations for environmental objects while before there were quite a few that were unique.
Having simplified the combat how do you make it challenging? Make the enemies basically have an almost invulnerable shield at certain points of health, have some lame attacks that depending on the situation are basically insta-kill or at least will leave you in a very bad shape. Ok those were optional fights, but they were insufrible.

I wont say I did EVERYTHING in the game, but I completed every sidequest, maxed out Haruka's affection, completed everything on Majima's minigame, all Bouncer missions etc. I just didn't try to check every box, but saw pretty much everything the game has to offer, and all I can say is that I'm disappointed.

Its fun, it has a lot of content, especially if youre a fun of clan creator or this hostess club shenanigans and it also has a nice story (way better than kiwami 1). Music is as always good and the new combat exp system is quite refreshing even though it feels like a mess because you have to scroll through thousand of moves which isnt that appealing.
For the combat I have to say its a step back.
I think the 4 different styles were perfect, they made the combat interesting for every kind of player. The heat moves also feel very weak. While Yakuza 0 had some brutal heat moves who really had an impact, everything in Kiwami 2 feels downgraded in that case. Youre not sitting there being like ""OH SHIT"". It just doesnt feel as brutal as before.
So in conclusion: Better than Kiwami 1 in most aspects, but still miles away from Yakuza 0.
The Majima Saga is also nothing great, its very short and you have like 2 heat moves with Majima and the main point is just more combat with Majima and a tiny story. As I said, nothing great, just a fine extra bone.

This game is running on the new 'Dragon Engine', which basically means that it got a very big graphical boost and stats/upgrades work differently. Whilst people might not care about graphics and stuff that much, it made a huge difference for me just wandering around Kamurocho and Sotenbori, especially with the photo mode and first person view they added.

Fighting has changed slightly, as in there isn't multiple modes to fight with anymore, instead just one - closely matching the brawler type in the other games. The added heat moves and weapons offset slightly this however, and enemies don't have specific modes that you need to beat them anymore. I think it tightens the game up a bit, allowing more polish to be given to the one fighting style but it's understandable if you miss the variety of the previous games.

Mini games and other fun stuff is still there, but if you're already this deep in the series that's to be expected. The story however is where I think it shines the brightest. After the events of Kiwami 1, Kiryu is just a civilian with PTSD chilling with Haruka, until he obviously gets roped back into the clan. This time under the threat of Omi invasion. All the main characters feel very fleshed out, with clear goals and motivations driving them to keep moving forward. I guarantee that even the most stoic of people out there will be feeling pretty emotional after the ending, and with a 20+ hour story, you'll definitely have enough time to get to attached everyone by the end. Just as a side note, the Majima saga is really good, it ties up some loose ends after the events of Yakuza 0. It's only 3 chapters, so please play it.

I would 100% recommend this game at full price, but it goes on sale for 50% off relatively often, so it'd probably be wiser to wait.

Another entry into the Yakuza series, and a sequel to Yakuza Kiwami. Can SEGA keep the good times rolling? Or is it just another so-so sequel? Lets get into it.

[h1] [b] The Good [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Combat [/b]

- Combat has always been a staple of the Yakuza games as in it's simplest form... you kind of just beat the **** out of people for the entire game. What Yakuza Kiwami 2 has down, however is a bit different from some of the other Yakuza games. Kiwami 2 removes the 4 (sometimes 5) fighting styles found in other Yakuza games, and simplifies them into one base combat mode, while allowing some of the more famous aspects of combat be unlocked through skills. This both adds a new and refreshing combat style to the game for returning players, and is simple enough to not scare off new players. A win-win, I say.

[*] [b] The Story and Characters [/b]

- The Yakuza games are famous for many things, but a good story and lovable/memorable characters are their biggest selling point to me. In Kiwami 2 you return as the famed Kazuma Kiryu, also known as the Dragon of Dojima. You must travel to a far away city to attempt to broker peace between two Yakuza clan, but an unexpected coup throws a wrench in your plans. Throughout this story you will experience the Yakuza game's famed characters and side stories which can range from ""wholesome and heart-warming"" to ""I think I was just tricked into being a gay-porn model"", y'know, just Yakuza stuff, man.

[*] [b] The Humor and Entertainment Value [/b]

- This is a very weird point to make, but there is so much to do to entertain yourself in Kiwami 2 that you can literally forget that you were supposed to be playing a game. I actually walked into an arcade off the street, played crane games and rip-off fighting games for three hours, and forgot that I was playing a videogame inside of a videogame. Other than that, there is so much random stuff that keeps you busy in this game. That, plus the very unique sense of humor you can only find in the Yakuza series makes for a game so entertaining you might forget you were supposed to be playing the story.

[*] [b] The Graphics [/b]

- The game is just actually quite beautiful. Walking through the lit-up streets or rampaging through a building, it just looks good. A nice remake. 

[h1] [b] The Bad [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Pacing [/b]

- I will admit the story and some of the character developments can feel quite... rushed? Things come and go outta nowhere. The game seems randomly paced at times and can occasionally through you out of the immersion with it.

[h1] [b] The Ugly [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Shadow of the Past [/b]

- I never try to compare a game to it's earlier entries, as it is important to always try to move and improve on ideas. However, Kawami 2 just doesn't give me the same feelings I got when playing earlier Yakuza entries. By no means is it bad through, and if this is the worst point of the game, how bad can it be?

[h1] [b] Overall [/b] [/h1]

927380,85803035,76561198045966039,0,60,2686,0,2686,1612244463,"This review is written form the perspective of first playing Yakuza 0 and the first Kiwami.

Kiwami 2 is the last of the original trilogy of PC Yakuza games, and up until recently, probably the last Yakuza a lot of people could play. It is the only entry in this trilogy not to make use of the style system, and also introduces an entirely different level and experience system. 

In this game, Kiryu has one basic light attack combo with different heavy attacks based on when in a combo you hit the button, and based on which direction kiryu is facing. These attacks can also be charged for greater ability to deal damage and break through guards. At first, I was afraid this would be underwhelming compared to the many options of the previous two games. However, in place of styles, this game puts much more time into the balance and usefulness of weaponry (both improvised and prepared). In the prior entries, I felt like weapons really didn't have much purpose, and only really used them when beast style automatically picked them up. Here, they do decent damage and seem to have better durability. Some weapons you get from having save data from kiwami (such as the machine gun) are actually so strong they are entirely broken.

Weapons often have a heat action that can be obtained from spending experience points, which brings us to the new leveling system. After finishing battles, substories, or other things on the completion list, you will receive experience in different categories. These can be used to acquire new attacks, new heat actions, quality of life features, or just general stat-ups. 

This system is good in theory, but I feel its bad in practice. Many substories end with you gaining a new ""ally"" in town or receiving a scroll. These allies perform special heat actions, and these scrolls give you special actions you couldn't otherwise use. The only problem is, for some reason, actually using these rewards requires spending experience. Completing these substories only gave you the ability to spend experience to actually learn the ability. This makes the rewards feel hollow, and they feel tied to the level system for no reason other than to waste experience. I actually never unlocked a single ally attack because I found everything else to be a better investment. Again, the system itself works fine, and I wouldn't be upset to work with it in other entries.

The story in this game tries to be much more complex than the prior two. Ultimately, 0's plot boiled down to solving mysteries about the empty lot, kiwami's plot boiled down to trying to find a specific person. Kiwami 2's plot is about how actions taken by one party tie into motivations for another party with direct relation to this or that character who ends up not being connected the way you think and so on and so forth. Quite frankly, I'm not even sure how to summarize it and be sure I don't accidentally spoil twists. If I had to give a basic summary I'd say this story is about rising tensions between the Tojo and Omi. Kiryu, feeling responsible for the events of last year (the events of the first game) involves himself in trying to protect and maintain what remains of the Tojo family.  However, the police force in Osaka is closely monitoring his actions, leading to a cop following him around for much of the story. The game becomes not only about solving the immediate issues in front of Kiryu, but also about the growing bond between these two characters. 

While the story has good character drama and is emotional, I can't help but feel like it became very overcomplicated by the end. It felt like it was more interested in having unexpected twists than making sure the story was good. This isn't to say the final result is bad, just that it could be better. 

Overall, Kiwami 2 is a very good, but also quite different, entry in the series. I will say I plan to move onto the rest of the series, but from here on have literally no knowledge about the series. I am a bit concerned Yakuza 3, being a game from the early ps3 era with none of the refinements of the Kiwami entries, may feel underwhelming or clunky gameplay wise, but I will give it a fair chance. I also worry the storyline will continue to become more interested in making sure the plot is complicated, rather than that it is memorable and interesting.  I would say that Kiwami 2 is about as good as Yakuza 0, which are both a bit better than the first Kiwami. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who found the other entries fun.",1612248245,1612248245,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has everything, and I mean EVERYTHING a great game/franchise needs.  Every episode is crafted with precision, love and skill,  and they're all so well put together there are almost zero technical issues. You never have a dull moment in these games, and even though there is quite a lot of walking from point a to point b, just looking at the vibrant, bustling streets you're walking is a pleasure in itself. Each game looks and feels so alive, and they're all stuffed to the brim with lovable, unforgettable characters, interesting side-quests and minigames that are actually really fun (but not mandatory).

Yakuza 0,  Kiwami and Kiwami 2 all have a fantastically written main story that can bring you to tears if you let yourself be immersed in their world. I'm usually not a fan of ""movie-like"" games, especially not if the plot is so linear, but in these games you are presented with so many, beautifully crafted little gifts in between cinematic cutscenes, so many things to do, so many ways to enjoy yourself,  that the games simply make you fall in love with them and their exceptionally well written characters, to the point where you not only ""forgive them"" for having cutscenes that are sometimes several minutes long, but you actually really start to enjoy watching  them, just as much as you enjoy the heart-pumping action sequences when you get to curb-stomp yakuza bosses and toss delinquent teenagers in the river. 

Long story short, these games are phenomenal. Ryū ga Gotoku is practically the only AAA franchise these days that's still exciting and is still worth both your time and money.

The Graphics and the city itself have improved alot to the new game engine, the city is now more lively and busier than ever with moving cars and the ability to walk into any building without loading screens (you could also see people within each store and restaurants which is a very nice touch)
Its also really cool to see the city evolve throughout the series, places that was once unaccessible now available to explore and new shops/buildings popping up everywhere taking over closed shops/empty buildings.

Gameplay and storywise it’s the same as the other games but I rank this story better than kiwami but not as good as yakuza 0.

Not only is there a new engine to showcase the streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori, there is a new combat system, skill tree, and a multitude of mechanics. Like previous installments, there are an insane amount of activities and mini-games. Kiwami 2's new combat system allows for new satisfying combos and finishers, with the ability to store weapons dropped by enemies. Along with that, by far one of the best additions. Rag doll physics. To have an enemy fly away at Mach 7 speed after a devastating punch or kick, alongside the rumble of the controller, amplifies combat to a new level. Partnered with these new fancy moves, is a phenomenal story. Building upon Zero's and Kiwami's story, with even MORE surprises and twists, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is an emotional and epic narrative.

After starting off with 0 I felt a little dissapointed overall with Kiwami but this game did a complete 180 and is ALMOST as good as zero imo

Story hits alot harder than than Kiwami and had way more twists that actually took me by surprise and emotional moments, it does drop the ball here and there with some filler stuff that really doesn't need to be there. [spoiler] Hey did you want to hear the entire backstory of gouda's tattoo? Well here's half a chapter dedicated to that [/spoiler]

Graphics are obviously WAY better but audio took a step back, sure the jazz is nice I guess but I got tired of hearing it for every fight and it just didn't slap as hard as the stuff in 0. One little note if you're having fps issues is to check the resolution in the graphics settings because for some reason the game automatically put it to the highest setting for me, fixing that made it run like butter tho

Combat was something I was iffy about because I really liked the multiple styles of 0 and kiwami but in hindsight I can admit I did spend most of my time using one style over all the others (Rush and slugger). This one size fits all approach in kiwami 2 really did grow on me and it has a bit more depth due to things like charge up attacks that can be prepped mid combo and the extreme heat mode doing more than a damage buff/ unlocking new moves. I found weapons were also more useful in here but sometimes to a DISGUSTING degree, I did only play on normal difficulty but I did that for all yakuza games and I easily beat a boss fight within like 10 seconds using some wooden sword.

There's also alot of improvements to minigames and substories, most notably map icons that point out where most substories actually are (also the writting for said substories is WAY better than Kiwami). I haven't gotten around to trying all the minigames yet but they improved on my favorite (karaoke) and made my not so favorite ( baseball) actually enjoyable. Oh and the cabaret club management is back (praise be) and they even made it so shops that you can partner with have a little icon pop up indicating the fact when you run by (praise be). 

There's also just a myriad of different QOL improvements that you'll definitely notice and appreciate when playing (such as way better inventory) and all around this just feels like a really smooth game that improved on everything from the previous 2 titles (except maybe the story compared to 0...but come on)

the main reasons i dont recommend the game despite those are: the combat is absolute garbage. everything is floaty , enemies and you ragdoll everywhere, when your attacks get blocked you recoil back so most combos are really unsatisfying, the styles are gone and your options are severely limited, the boss fights feel either frustrating as hell or way too easy (if you use a weapon). 

unlike in yakuza kiwami 1 where the cutcenes are a shot for shot remake here they remade them in a new engine. so they are slightly off. in some cases its worse, they ruined some of the most atmospheric scenes in the game (the kiryu smoking alone in the rain scene has some edgy punk rock music instead of the freeflow jazz that acompanies the original. one boss fight is completely missing his music)

if you loved the story of 1 and dont care for the shitty combat (like honestly i did) then pick it up.

I'm going to be blunt here. As someone who played the previous two games to 100% completion, I'm happy to say that Yakuza Kiwami 2 is not as bad as Kiwami but unfortunately, it's not as good as Yakuza 0, either. It fixes many of the weaknesses that were holding back the previous two games while making a few of its own. It's an average game through and through, and I'll explain why. But first, let's start with the positives. 

[u] The Positives [/u]

[b] 1. The Graphics [/b]
Yakuza Kiwami 2 is the second Yakuza game to run on the new Dragon Engine, and the game looks downright gorgeous. You will spend much of your time being in awe at how beautiful it looks, and how much improvements have been made since the last two games. Kamurocho and Sotenbori feel more alive than ever, and it's a blast exploring the two cities again in higher graphical fidelity. 

[b] 2. The Majima Saga [/b]
Set ten months before the events of Yakuza Kiwami 2, play as Goro Majima as you witness the domino pieces being set up for the events that would soon unravel a few months later. It's a new addition to the story that was never there in the original game. It goes beyond just providing contexts for the main campaign. To avoid any potential spoiler, let's just say anyone who was deeply invested in Majima's story in Yakuza 0 will finally get the closure they've been waiting for. 

[b] 3. Frustrating mini-games are gone [/b]
If you're like me, and you hated many of the mini-games in the previous two games that rely almost entirely on luck to win, then you'll be happy to know pretty much all of them have been removed and replaced by better ones in Yakuza Kiwami 2. A few of them have also been altered to be less grindy, so that's a huge bonus. 

[b] 4. Fun substories make a return [/b]
In my review of Yakuza Kiwami, I mentioned how I quite disliked many of the substories that were in that game for their lack of creativity and fun. However, that is not the case here. This is the one area where Yakuza Kiwami 2 can competently compete with Yakuza 0, and I'm happy to be able to say that. 

[u] The Average [/u]

This section is going to be entirely reserved for the plot of Yakuza Kiwami 2 because I firmly believe the story to be the most PAINFULLY average part of the entire game. The one good thing I can say about it is I guess it's not as bad as Yakuza Kiwami. But, that's not exactly a high praise when you consider just how terrible the last game was so surpassing it isn't really saying much. The story isn't a travesty by any means but it certainly has the potential to be a lot better in so many ways. Just trust me when I say if you're walking into Yakuza Kiwami 2 expecting the same level of writing as Yakuza 0, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Overall, it's passable. 

[u] The Negatives [/u]

[b] 1. The new combat system is worse in every way [/b]
Combat used to be the highlight of the Yakuza experience for me in Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, but in this game, it's nothing more than a watered-down version of what we used to have. Seriously, what the fuck happened? Nearly in every regard, it is objectively worse:

‣ Remember the four distinct fighting styles you used to have that kept combat from ever feeling stale and boring and helped make each fight exciting, fun, and varied? They're gone! There is now only one style. Much of the fun to be had in the previous games are now gone, and you're going to be forced to substitute them with different mediocre weapons that break faster than Greece's economy. One more thing, they made firearms absolute dog shit in this game. WHY???
‣ Combat feels weightless due to the ragdoll physics present in the game. It's funny and entertaining at first but after a few dozen times it starts to get old and annoying quickly, and you soon realize all it's doing is taking away from the impact, force, and weight that were once there in the combat that made it so brutal and visceral. 
‣ Distracting mobs with money is not an option and running away is significantly harder if you get spotted. So, in the end, what you have is a combat system that is worse in almost every imaginable way with ragdoll physics exacerbating the problem while having next to no option of running away to help alleviate the repetitiveness of combat. Great, this is exactly what I want in my Yakuza game. 

[b] 2. Bad facial animation outside of cutscenes [/b]
The upgrade in graphical fidelity means bad facial animations are now front and center and more apparent than ever before especially the mouth. I think I've seen robots with more realistic mouth movements than what the animators were able to come up with in this game. It's exceptionally bad.

[b] 3. The written dialogues are underwhelming [/b]
This is a subtle trend that I've been noticing ever since Kiwami but in Kiwami 2 it's even more apparent. Just to make sure I wasn't imagining things, I went back and re-watch playthroughs of Yakuza 0, and the difference is like night and day. The dialogue in Kiwami 2 definitely lacks the personality, charm, and style that made Zero so great. The protagonist himself, Kazuma Kiryu, is the perfect example of this problem. This is essentially the difference between the two games in terms of the quality of writing in a nutshell:
Yakuza 0
Kuze: Cocky little shit! You're gonna make an enemy of me? You think you're ready for what that entails!?
Kiryu: I'm ready. If I weren't, I'd have no business calling myself a yakuza. 
Yakuza Kiwami 2
[Daigo Dojima is tied up and being held captive by four yakuza grunts]
Kiryu: Give him back or else.

[b] 4. There are a lot of fillers in Chapter 10 [/b]
Just like with Kiwami, this game also suffered from a chapter being riddled with fillers for absolutely no reason whatsoever. You will be spending more than half of chapter 10 doing busywork that could have easily been turned into two simple substories. It wasn't important and contributed nothing to the story in any meaningful way. 

[b] 5. Frame rate related issues [/b]
There are quite a lot of problems with this game that can't be solved unless you fix the frame rate. Fortunately, the people over at this website had made a patch to fix these issues. For your convenience: https://cookieplmonster.github.io/2020/01/18/silentpatch-yakuza-kiwami-2/
Unless you want to be frustrated by having certain mini-games and things not work properly, I highly recommend you install this patch first before playing the game. 

[b] 6. The completion list no longer gives any meaningful rewards. [/b]
In the previous two games, completing the completion list gives you points that you can spend to unlock exclusive powerful weapons and perks that can only be bought in the CP store. Instead, now it only gives you attribute points that will only go toward unlocking skills and stats. Incredibly disappointed in the direction they took with this. 

[u] In Conclusion [/u]
Yakuza Kiwami 2 is an average game that took many steps forward but also many steps back. Its plot and characters are nothing to write home about but if you're a fan of the previous two Yakuza games, then I do believe it's still worth checking out this one. I'm looking forward to playing all the games in the series once the rest of the collection comes to Steam next year.

I knew where Taitei Blvd. was, Senryo Avenue, the locations of every little attraction. It was a pretty city to explore, with bright signs and such. But then came the gigantic jump in quality of Kiwami 2...

I don't know Kamurocho anymore. So much has changed over Kiwami. But what probably got me most, was the graphical fidelity. Usually, I'm not one to give a damn about graphics. But the moment I stepped back into Kamurocho... my jaw dropped. The city feels so much more alive. So many more people walking around, the bright lights nearly blinding me for real... and all the other stylistic flourishes of the series turned up to 11.

Combat is much more simplified. Rather than three main styles and the Dragon of Dojima style, we only have one style and 3 weapon slots. It's all Thug style now. Or I guess technically all Legend style? Either way it feels a lot less flexible. But I think they finally balanced out the leveling up system at least, likely due to reducing Style count. 

On the upside of this, your toolkit is much more expanded and useful compared to an individual style. You're also blatantly encouraged to use weapons more, giving you some variety in there. Guns got hugely nerfed though. Feels Bad Man.

I have one outright downside though. Kiryu's movement speed. Maybe it's due to the engine change but he feels so much slower when running around town. They seemingly doubled your base sprint time but your walk and run feel so much slower compared to the blistering speed you could go at in 0 and Kiwami. Or maybe it's just the graphics actually giving the illusion of slower speed. I should do a side by side comparison...

I'm still in the honeymoon phase I'm sure, but at this moment, I feel like this is overall a huge upgrade over 0 and Kiwami and makes me look forward to the rest of the series coming to PC.",1610208556,1610208556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The carefully crafted and refined formula of the franchise never seems to get old no matter how many times they do it, and with Yakuza Kiwami 2, they’ve only managed to perfect it even more. 

Personally, having not played the original Yakuza 2, I can’t make very many comparisons between this remake and the original, so I’m largely judging this as a standalone product.

Utilizing RGG Studio’s recently developed Dragon Engine, Yakuza has never been better, both in terms of gameplay and graphics. It’s such a powerful and complex engine that even the most high-end of PCs will be left with fans whirring as loud as humanly possible, as if Kazuma Kiryu himself is tiger dropping your CPU.

The combat feels more slick and stylish than ever before; you really feel the weight of each and every blow you deliver to your opponents, complimented by a throbbing, energetic soundtrack not too unlike its predecessors. The quality of life improvements in general make the game all the more satisfying to play, with items now being separated into individual groups, as well as a much more lenient approach to skill trees. The ragdoll physics, and the physics engine in general, never get old; even 100 hours in I’m still laughing my ass off at the idea that Kiryu can make a motorcycle self-destruct simply by walking into it.

And you can play Virtual On in the arcades. What more could you ask for?

The story and cutscenes are top notch; no longer is the storytelling bogged down by incredibly slow, dull pacing like in the previous games, with the cinematic cutscenes being front and center. Every single shot and line of dialogue is packed to the brim with emotion; the scene with Kiryu trying to light his cigarette in the rain by his lonesome after a falling out with Kaoru is cinematic perfection, amongst many other powerful moments in the game’s narrative.

As much as I’d love to continue praising the game for paragraphs upon paragraphs, it isn’t without its flaws. Due to being built on a completely new engine, a handful of minigames had to sadly be cut; longrunners like baseball, karaoke, and golf remain in tact, but there’s no more billiards, bowling, pocket racing or the like from the previous engine’s games. There’s also a lot of bullshit moments in the story missions (i.e. locking you from beating the fucking final boss behind a QTE), but overall, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is without a doubt the most commendable entry in the series thus far.

Playing those games first will help to familiarize you with some of the combat mechanics and quirks of the game. 
There are a lot of fun things to do in Kiwami 2 and the story is very entertaining and immersive.
The battle and upgrade system is different from the previous games to keep things interesting.
The cities are more interactive and vibrant in this game!
There are more NPCs walking around which makes it difficult to rush through the city without bumping into delinquents.

This game is such an improvement from Yakuza Kiwami. Kamurocho and Sotenbori have vastly been improved with even more detail. The minigames were mostly fun and I actually learned how to play mahjong properly. The completion list wasn't too hard to complete either, but weapons seem to be pretty overpowered in this game. Somehow, everything looks as bright and flashy as the setting from Yakuza 0, which I didn't think possible after the darker tone of Kiwami. The first time I loaded the game up, I was blown away at the cars actually coming through the larger streets. This kind of small detail made a huge difference.

That's all I knew. Kiwami 2 gets better.

Nobody really got it across to me that Kiwami 2 is in a completely different league from 0 and 1. 

I'm not saying Yakuza Kiwami 2 is necessarily better than 0. I'm only halfway through with 2's story, and I liked 0's a lot more. But pretty much everything else about Kiwami 2 is a more satisfying experience.

0 was a PS3 game, and Kiwami 2 was built from the ground up as a PS4 game, and it shows in every aspect.

The world is far more detailed and better lit. You can sneak into alleys and climb up stairwells, and enter random offices. There is no loading between going from the exteriors of buildings to the interiors, and vice versa. You can walk up to a restaurant window and see everyone eating inside, and then just walk inside with no loading screen. You can get into fights outside restaurants and throw enemies through their windows, and then get refused service by the restaurant afterward.

The fighting is a lot more satisfying than the previous games. Gone are the 4 different styles and skill trees. You have one set of moves and a ton of different abilities to learn. 

The XP system is a lot more flexible this time. It's fed by battling, but also mission completion, eating, and certain random items you collect. 

The hostess minigame from 0 is back, virtually unchanged. I enjoyed its story in 0 more, but it's still a welcome addition to 2. The clan creator isn't so hot, but it's not that bad either. Definitely one of the less interesting features in the game, but at least it's different from everything else.

I'm not gonna go into much detail here because I personally think it's best to approach this game as blind as possible, that is if you've played 0 and Kiwami before. 

And that's another thing I feel like I have to add. While it is not mandatory to have played the aforementioned installments, I strongly do encourage to experience them prior to Kiwami 2 as a lot of story details are tied directly together.

To get the very best out of the story, I recommend you start with 0, then straight into Kiwami 1 and THEN you can start Kiwami 2.

Like I said, it's not mandatory, but imo the story, characters and overall worldbuilding is so much better if you play the games in order. The emotional bond between Kiryu and Haruka and basically every other character in this game is much stronger if you've played the other 2 games first. 

But that's just my opinion, you can start off with any entry you want as every story is self-contained, just know that the emotional impact won't be as strong if you skip 0 and Kiwami, which I might add I think is kinda silly because all of the Yakuza games are pretty damn fantastic. Hell, you ain't got no reason skippin' any, so play them. All of them.

Do it. In order.

what keeps it from being better than zero is the story. the story feels like it lies heavily on twists and reveals and it gets a bit ridiculous later in the game. it is still a decent story but not as engaging as yakuza zero. the cabaret storyline is just the same minigame as yakuza zero so i found mysdelf not doing it having already done it once already and the majima constructions storyline is not my cup of tea, im not big on real time strategy tower defence  if thats what you would call it . i might at some point come back to play it but right now im content leaving it unfinished.

[b]Note:[/b]
If you haven't played a Yakuza game yet I'd say don't play this game you'd be robbing yourself of the experience, I'd say instead start with 0 and work your way upwards, playing through them all is extremely rewarding and there are many story lines that carry over between games!

[h2]World Exploration[/h2]
This is what I would consider to be a truly next-gen Yakuza game, there's no loading fade to black every time you enter a building, you just walk in and you're there. I cannot begin to describe how shocking that felt after finishing Kiwami 1! It truly makes the world feel much more connected.

[h2]Combat[/h2]
Ditching the combat system of Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1, this combat system feels much more streamlined and enjoyable. Instead of switching between different fighting styles you're focusing more on heat moves from my experience and that was much more enjoyable.

[h2]Story[/h2]
Kiwami 2 continues with an even crazier story with even more threads to keep track of that all overlap in interesting ways. The ending is very much worth getting to!

Now let's have Yakuza 3, 4, 5, and 6 on PC, please.✡️

☑️Audio - 8/10☑️
From Kiryu's singing to the soundtrack itself and the consistently excellent voice acting, Yakuza Kiwami 2 always sounds wonderful. Some music can occasionally grate a bit, however.

☑️VISUALS - 9/10☑️
Yakuza Kiwami 2 continues the series' tradition of detailed, realistic character models, and makes both Kamurocho and Sotenbori feel even more immersive than they've ever been before. Virtual tourism at its finest.

☑️PLAYABILITY - 9/10☑️
Fighting is endlessly enjoyable and filled with inventive ways to beat your foes into submission. Kiwami 2 takes Yakuza 6's combat and fleshes it out further, making for an enjoyable and exciting brawler experience. Outside of fighting, the wealth of mini-games and sub stories give you plenty of fun stuff to do.

☑️DELIVERY - 9/10☑️
Polished to within an inch of its life, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is the most complete and substantial entry in the series yet. Beyond the main storyline, there's the Majima Saga, 2-player mini-games, brawling in the underground Coliseum and loads more besides. Simply brilliant.

""No thanks. Everyone important to me, they're right here in my heart. I'm out of that world now. Not that I really wanted in..."". Yakuza series is one of the best action-adventure game series developed by Sega. This time an ex-Yakuza but still the Dragon of Dojima family, Kazuma Kiryu is called back into action. But this time you will learn the true story of the rise and fall of his old friend and enemy Goro Majima. If you played the first two games in the series, then Kiwami 2 is a MUST play.

[h1] INFO [/h1]
- This review is a personal opinion. Try the game for yourself.
- You can play the game by itself, but it is best enjoyed if you played it after Yakuza Zero and Yakuza Kiwami and before Yakuza: Like a Dragon to grasp the full meaning of the saga.
- Kiwami 2 can be pretty much compared with Kiwami 1, not as good as Yakuza Zero but still a great story in the saga.
- Once you started playing the saga with Yakuza Zero, there is no going back, you must play all Yakuza games. The proper order to play the games is the Steam chronological release order: Yakuza Zero, Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza Kiwami 2, Yakuza: Like a Dragon. While the plot of Yakuza: Like a Dragon takes place 5 years before the plot of Yakuza Kiwami 2, they are totally different stories. Also Kazuma Kiryu is featured only in Zero and both Kiwami games but he is not part of Yakuza: Like a Dragon game. 

[h1] PROS [/h1]
- Decent main story with an interesting plot, this time you will play the Majima saga and understand why Majima became the madman you met in the previous games.
- Better than Kiwami 1.
- Decent graphics, good soundtrack.
- The voice-overs are in the same Japanese with English subtitling and this gives more authenticity to the game.
- Excellent cutscenes and game atmosphere and the lively environment makes you feel immersed in the Japanese life and game's story.
- Good optimization, high fps count.
- Deccent skills tree.
- Enough side content, good side mini-stories.
- Best manual save option in the series.

[h1] CONS [/h1]
- Partial ultrawide support (cutscenes have side black bars, you can change FOV and display ratio to show them stretched or letterboxed).
- Very short story compared with Yakuza Zero and shorter compared with Yakuza Kiwami.
- Even if better than Kiwami 1 story, Kiwami 2 is still not as great as Yakuza Zero.
- A bit different combat system that seem not to be as good and interactive as in the previous games.
- Compared with the previous games, a bit more useless content and dialogues to fill-in gaps of the main story.
- In 4k, some ported animations feel a bit strange due to the Dragon graphical engine upgrade.

The combat system here was simplified a lot, i have heard a lot of opinions on it that it is worse than kiwami 1, but i enjoyed it more than kiwami 1 's combat.

The combat works well with its emphasis on one battle style and the refined progression system made completing tasks, battling, eating, and exploring more rewarding. 
I prefer the new minigames and the return of the Cabaret Club management; the batting cages feel better than ever, karaoke feels great, golf mixes things up just right, and the clan creator game provides another goofy side story.
The substories are well-written once again, a step up from Kiwami. The new skill that lets you find them on the map really alleviated the headache of finding those last few substories. My favorites were the stories including Granny White, the Sunflower Orphanage, the infamous man-babies, and the scam companies.

[u] My Few Complaints [/u]
The new physics engine, while realistic and engaging much of the time, still has moments of heavy buggery or silliness that breaks the immersion factor. The difficulty generally works fine, but some enemies near the end of the game have busted movesets that drain healing items fast. Some parts in the middle had small pacing issues, though that may have also been influenced by my breaks between playing the game across a few months.

Why Kiwami 2 is my favorite title in the Yakuza series thus far:
- Overhaul of the combat system, doing away with complexity in favor of a ""one size fits all"" approach. Controls have been changed so it's easier to execute combos and heat moves are now easier to hit because the marker is moved to the center of the screen (WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ALONG.)

-A cinematic experience that the first Kiwami lacked. Many cutscenes look like they were ripped straight from a Yakuza movie, with the characters demonstrating intense amounts of nuance and emotion through subtle actions and behaviour. 

-Drop-dead gorgeous graphics. Sotenbori and Kamurocho have never looked so beautiful in the Yakuza world and are faithfully rendered to their real world inspirations. 

-The Police are finally playing a more serious role in a game about organized crime! |

-The game's atmosphere and tone (outside the main story) are so much more positive. The sub-stories are humorous and over the top, in a Japanese kind of way which make me grin from ear to ear. One of the reasons I fell in love with the series was because it was fun and made me laugh. If only this game had dancing!

# The Good Things

+ The Cabaret Club Minigame

There is a funny minigame in it called the ""Cabaret Club Grand Prix"". It's a hostess simulator where the player gets to groom hostesses
as the manager of the club and then host parties where costumers come to chat with a hostess and pay for it.
It's a ""Grand Prix"" because the player have to compete with other clubs to become the best in the country. The competitions have stories with plot twists, background and everything which makes it a good sidequest.
I don't know why but I had a lot of fun with this silly quest. It also had a huge effect on the game because I made a lot of money while playing it insead of grinding on the street(beating weak enemies over and over).

+ Overall Stability

The game was surprisingly stable - no crashes or artifacts. But the autosaves are not reliable.

+ (Some) Cutscenes

[i]Some[/i] of them are really well-made like they're from a proper movie - dialog, camera, faces etc. This was the ""feature"" that hooked me initially but later I found out that this is also one of the weak point of the game.

# The Bad Things

- Cutscenes, cutscenes, cutscenes...

If you don't like long cutscenes in a game where they treat the players like they're stupid then this game is not for you because most of the cutscenes are [i]extremely long[/i] and boring.
Of course, if you can't bear asian movies then you won't like this game anyway because there is barely any gameplay:
if I exclude the cabaret club minigame, I think I spent more time watching cutscenes than playing the core game. For every 5 minutes of gameplay in the main story you get multiple 5 minutes-long cutscenes.
There are also a lot of ""cutscenes"" that are not voice-acted and I just had to click through the dialogues while they moved their mouths - this happened frequently between ""real"" dialogues - like they were place-holders - so I guess they just didn't have the budget or time to finish the game.

- Lots of minigames, very little fun

Most of the minigames have nothing to do with the base game which is fine for me but they're also really boring and very repetitive.
If I would want to play mobile games I would play them on a mobile.
I would totally play the cabaret club on a smartphone while I'm traveling. I wouldn't play the rest again even if I would get paid for it.

- Spamming low-quality sidequests and encounters

While I was walking on the streets I got [i]constantly[/i] spammed by stupid sidequests and low-level fights. Regular people and gangs just came up to me, explained their boring stories and the resolution was almost always the same: beat up a few baddies and say good bye.
This would have been okay but I was forced to listen to the start of each sidequest and I often got ""teleported"" from my current position - taking user control away is bad.
Imagine if you would play the Witcher 3 and you would constantly get stopped by strangers to find their pans...

- Tedious level-up system

You have to beat a lot of weak enemies, eat food at restaurants, click+wait through all the nonsense just to get a little boost. The game has a lot of ""skills"" but the gameplay is far from diverse.

- Trashy combat system from bollywood

You need to level-up to get anywhere in combat(you can also just chug drinks if you have the money) but the combat system will be still stiff and rag-dolly, like it's a comedy game.
I didn't expect a soulsborne experience but I just couldn't prepare myself for the disappointment - most of the time, the combat feels like playing with a cheap bollywood movie.
Most enemies are way too weak and bosses feel like bullet-sponges if you don't use your special skills enough. They usually have 4-5 phases with the same moveset but with lots of poise, grab attacks and no cool-down between attacks.
From the controls I can tell the developers never played on PC.

- The graphics are incomplete

The anti-aliasing is terribly weak - everything is constantly shimmering at 1440p/ultra, jaggies are everywhere. Some objects have good textures but most of them are blurry which creates a really ugly contrast.

- Performance is subpar compared to the bad grapics

In terms of efficiency it belongs to the bottom 10% despite the fact that areas in this game are really small and the details are low. I'm playing at 1440p and 144Hz and my PC runs games like the witcher 3 fine but in this game my fps frequently drops below 90.",1603556586,1607429664,False,4,0,0.463578671216964722,0,True,False,False

[u] Story [/u] [b] NO SPOILER [/b] : one of the best stories ever made, engaging, exciting, fun and full of twists plot

[u] Game Design [/u] : combat system beautiful and rich in talents and skills but slightly lower than 0 and 1,the only real flaw is the combat stance and a not beautiful ragdoll.
			lots of fun mini games

[u] Level Design [/u] : small but rich maps, beautiful and different side quests. perfect level of difficulty

[u] Audio [/u] : beautiful soundtrack especially in the final part of the game.

[u] Graphics [/u] : with the new dragon engine the graphics and faces are stunning

[u] Game Time [/u] : long, about 30 hours only for the main story, 100 or more between side and minigame

[u] Price [/u] : it's all worth it

Combat is somewhat redeemed by greatly expanded heat move offerings, combos involving a lot more kicking and heat burst mode making you a walking tank. Boss fights on normal feel under tuned with some street bosses being harder than late game bosses. The Coliseum feels overturned at times especially whenever you can run into enemies with 6 health bars in the first tournament.

The first thing you'll notice is that the ability to swap fighting styles is gone, replaced with the ability to store three weapons at a time to take out whenever you need them. I felt this hurt the game somewhat from a strategic standpoint, as sometimes it was kinda fun trying to figure out which fighting style worked best against a specific opponent. I also felt that weapons were somewhat overpowered in this game, as even the final bosses died in seconds when I was wielding a weapon - of which you can purchase powerful ones literally seconds before the final fights. I completed the entire sequence of final battles without once having to heal. That being said the combat still feels familiar in spite of being arguably more limited in scope, and retains it's fun due in part to Kiryu feeling like a superhero this time around.

Another addition that the dragon engine provides now is that the cities are seemless. When you go toward a building there isn't a loading zone. You simply push open the door and walk into the shop as part of the normal playing map. This also goes for any building interior in the game with very few exceptions of special locations you have to drive a taxi separately to. Additionally due to the weapon heavy focus of this game the world is populated pretty liberally with stuff, such as entire rows of bicycles being locked up. And if you bump into them the game reacts by knocking them over, or in some cases completely wrecking them. In a battle near a convenience store you can enter the store during the fight and start breaking shelves. The world reacts to the player like never before, somewhat making up for the decision to limit the combat system to ""get weapon and win"".

The story is quite a bit more interesting than the story presented in Kiwami 1, and felt a lot closer to 0 in theme. Even with simple touches like Majima seeming less like a Joker cosplayer this time around, and more like his personality in 0 where he is crazy, but in that ""crazy like a fox"" kind of way. You see the crazy act get dropped for more serious moments several times, which helps for when you unlock an additional mini story mode where you play as him. This mode is highly recommended for people who played through 0, as it contains some of the most satisfying moments in the game during one of the chapters of it.

Kiwami 2 is still a pretty high recommendation for me, as even with the somewhat subdued battle system I didn't find myself having less fun with it. Perhaps it was more mindless fun, as instead of swapping styles to match kiwami auras to prevent recharging health (of which you won't run into that here, as a heads up) you instead spend most battles beating opponents with whatever isn't nailed to the floor within grabbing distance along with comical heat actions such as straight up throwing a guy off a bridge, or having a local shop owner throw you two giant leaks to use as weapons because you helped him find a new cooking utensil.

This game also is something of a return to the true identity of Yakuza, with the side quests very heavily veering into the goofy territory. A welcome change after a majority of the substories in Yakuza Kiwami 1 more or less were ""I'm being scammed by this person"" over and over, with very few overly comical variations on it. The game feels more like Yakuza 0, in spite of the more basic fighting system. If you enjoy the others in the series by all means give this a run. Especially if you intend to play Yakuza: Like A Dragon down the line, as that game contains a couple of references to things in this one.",1605560304,1605560304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have binge-played this game and even though I have completed the main story I cannot stop playing it. 
This was the first Yakuza game I have ever played and at first I thought I wouldn't get it because I didn't know the story. False. The storytelling in this game is so good that you feel part of the Tojo Clan without having heard of it before.
To be fair i played this game in ""Easy"" mode just to get used to it so I don't know if that is why I felt beating up people was very easy right from the start. Kiryu is a good fighter and if that hadn't been the case i think I would've abandoned this game very quickly.
I very much liked all the substories as well and the various little things you have to do (like eating every food from every restaurant). So even when I didn't feel in the mood to beat people up I got good enjoyment out of this game.
I got incredibly hooked on the Four Shine quest I must admit. At first I thought ""what crap, how sexist"" but I quickly found out that this was actually a very challenging and enjoyable minigame.

The gameplay differs from 0 and K1 where it doesn't have styles but that's not inherently a bad thing, and one good thing I do like is that you can run away from encounters mostly if you really don't give a damn to do them at the time. The cabaret club mini game is back and is as fun as it was in 0, and Clan Creator is pretty neat as well, tho if you aren't a fan of RTS. I getcha. The Majima Saga is very short but it gives very nice closure on a major note left in 0 which made me damn near cry.

I would recommend this game for sure, especially moreso on PC if you have an above average PC as you can run the game at 60 fps and above VS the locked 30 you get on console. I would say my ratings for Yakuza games (so far) would be 0 >> K1 = K2. it's hard to say which of the kiwami games is better but i can at least recommend it to any fan of action games! Just be sure to play 0 and Kiwami 1 if you wanna get the full impact of what the game has to offer. PLS SEGA bring the rest of the games onto PC!!

The experience system here is much better than 0 or Kiwami 1. In 0, money is used for enhancing both your skills and as currency. This made spending money a slightly painful choice. In Kiwami 1, there was one type of experience that you would use across all the fighting styles. 

In Kiwami 2, there are different types of experience for various aspects / activities in the game, such as stamina, hitting harder, and so on. The system for lategame stats is also more developed, as there are more skills to unlock after maxing out your base skills.

The cities of Kamurocho and Sotenburi are amazingly detailed and feel like living, breathing spaces. There are so many things to do - if you are just focused on the main storyline, you would be missing out on so much.

The fighting is as it was in all other games albeit a bit less options, which is completely fine with me. I miss the old system but the new one works fine. Speaking of fighting the psychics (rag doll?) is hilarious. I am not sure if it was meant to be that way but bodies just fly and is not very realistic but its a great feature of the game! 
Some of the other things stayed the same as well. Predictable substories. Walking around the city looking for another substory (including give people life lessons, etc) and for some reason, gangs, delinquents and Yakuza seem to always want to pick on Kiryu but no one else.

The story plays out quite well with several twists and turns, leading to an ending that keeps you guessing in the final chapter. Players with keen eyes can start to piece part of the story together earlier on but the ending will be a surprise to most.

The gameplay works well, however the combat early on in the game can prove quite frustrating as Kiryu is quite gimped in terms of even basic fighting abilities including a functional dodge. As you build out your skills the combat becomes much more enjoyable.

The game is fun and recommended to anyone who has already played Yakuza 0 or Yakuza Kiwami 1.",1604265074,1604265074,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

IMHO, content and story wise, I still think 0 is the best out of the 3. With Kiwami, being quite difficult for completionist (damn you Majima Everywhere) and 2 being the easiest to complete. 

As for the story, with 2, I think there's not much on the line as although Kiryu has always been a trouble magnet, the people most closest to him are more or less dead so there's not much on the line. Haruka is also a non factor in the story. What I'm dissapointed at is they always manage to f*ck up Kiryu's relationship with women after the end of the story. Kiryu deserves some sexy time. This is the same with Majima, although there's some closure at the end of his chapter from 0, I still think that he deserves to be happy as well with you know who.  

All in all its still a 9/10 game for me. Definitely recommended but you shouldn't be playing the series in succession as it will burn you out especially for the extreme completionist.

Visuals improved much over the previous games and the story was more intriguing with many plot twists thrown in than the two previous games. Combat was also changed surprisingly. There is no more style switching, you only have one fighting style which resembles the brawler fighting style in the previous games. You can now upgrade stats such as Defense, Health and Attack level. Also you can still gain new abilities through the upgrade menu. Combat feels more realistic (up to a certain point) than the two previous games, with noticeable differences in how opponents move and also the rag doll effect that was added, adds to that realism effect. Combat also is more reliant on items this time around. You can now pick up weapons and store them on the fly and set them to a quick button to take them out in combat.

The graphics difference between this game and the previous is astounding, I can't help myself but to change into first person with the HUD off and appreciate the bustling neon filled streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori. The Dragon engine did this game justice, the way light is simulated looks way too real. You can also seamlessly walk into buildings with no loading screen.

Kiwami 2 reintroduced the beloved the Hostess mini game, with its own story of Kiryu managing the Four Shine club with Yuki from Yakuza 0. It also introduced a new tower defence mini game called Clan creator which is  a revolves around Majima's construction company.

The notable 4 different combat styles from previous game is gone which can be a bother for some people. Kiryu now only use 1 style which feels the most similar to his dragon/legend style. I am a big fan of the combat change, the attacks feel weighty and sending enemies flying can be funny. But throwing enemies can be a huge waste of time in combat because enemies will be flying at least 3-5 meters away from you. With the new engine, ragdoll is added into this game which can look goofy as it seems to be tied with your frame rate. My opinion seems negative but what the game does right is making you feel powerful, as you upgrade your stats and unlock more moves you will feel overpowered. You can also unlock what ever skill you want as long you have the experience for it.

So far I am up to chapter 6 in the game,  I've encountered some enjoyable substories which were lacking from Kiwami 1. The most stand out substories are the silly fun ones. My personal favourites is the Kiryu imposter quest, catching a panty thief, the 'Be my baby' substory (the weirdest one so far) and modelling for a guy in a speedo. These substories I experienced is on par with Yakuza 0.

This game has breathtaking visuals, a very customizable combat system with lots of enjoyable side activities to do. Kiwami 2 is a treat for Yakuza 0 players and forgot to mention it has a Majima's own playable story.",1603455008,1603455134,True,22,1,0.690342903137207031,0,True,False,False

Yakuza 1 was a much shorter adventure through the first of the two cities in the previous game, only one protagonist, pretty much everything was halved in terms of content.
Yakuza 2 takes away the complicated fighting style mechanics from the above two games, but balances the traits of each in almost every other way. This is my favorite game of the series thus far -- more simplified fighting makes it less of a headache to play so far, the game once again visits both of Yakuza 0's cities, with their own substories and characters, and the plot is the same gentle blend of serious crime drama and goofy side story content.

Only negative so far is that the Karaoke experience is quite lacking. Boo!",1603317571,1603317571,True,2,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

* A lot of side content. Arena, bouncer missions, club management, Clan Creator, Mahjong, etc.
* You can go to Sotenbori again.

Cons:
* Final chapter is way too easy. Kiwami 1's ending felt like a challenge but this was the opposite.
* Majima Saga was too short. Maybe an hour long at most.

Kiwami 2 is the remake of Yakuza 2, the second game of the series. This game uses the Dragon Engine, which is way more advance compare to their older games other than Yakuza 6.

Lets talk gameplay,
It's still a action fighting game but you lose all your styles, the current fighting style feels sluggish in the beginning so you'll have to upgrade it to really like it.

Substories in this entry is a lot more interesting, the plot for each of them are great

Minigames get some extra oomph in this entry, I love almost all of them. They aren't boring and you'll come back once in a while to play em again.

... And I don't feel like I have to or anything! This game has become one of my favorite games of all time along with Yakuza 0. I wasn't feeling absolutely thrilled while playing Kiwami 1, but after finishing this game (plus the Majima Saga), I REALLY want to play every Yakuza game plus their spin-offs now more than ever.

The Dragon Engine is pretty to look at and the ragdolls can be hilarious and immersion-breaking at the same time (Kiryu should not be allowed to look as silly as a common thug when he gets sent flying lol).

Yakuza Kiwami 2 is on a different Engine, however, and not everything seems to carry over. However, I am having a lot of fun playing this, and would highly recommend it if you enjoyed 0 or Kiwami (or the original Yakuza and Yakuza 2, which I never played).

Like Kiwami, Kiwami 2's writing is a little rough in some places. But keep in mind that Yakuza and Yakuza 2 came out in 2005 and 2006 respectively, and that Yakuza 0 was the 7th released game in the series; so of course it was a bit better written as it came out after they had at least 6 games behind them. This doesn't mean I think the writing is bad, though. It's just got that mid 2000s PS2 era vibe to it... seeing as they're remakes of mid 2000s PS2 era games.

All in all, I do recommend this game, as well as Kiwami and 0. I wouldn't take my word too highly though, seeing as I only managed 20~% of Yakuza 0 (at this time), and 65~% of Yakuza Kiwami (at this time), and am in no way a completionist.

Kiwami 2 pushed the bar even higher and i can't stop playing it.

The only negative thing i have to say about it is that in previous games the skill trees for all the special fighting moves were much easier to understand and more organized while on Kiwami 2 the whole thing was simplified, it might be better for people who play it for the first time since it's easier to level up when u understand how it works but i personally liked the skill trees on previous titles better.

The only complaint would be how it cannot match the gigantic amount of content offered in Yakuza 0 and 5. Those two just had so much to offer the other games in the franchise can only struggle to shine in their shadow of their big D amount of content.

I was initially skeptical and thought that everything is currently overhyped due to the meme that is 'Baka Mitai', but I'm so glad to be proven wrong.

The characters are well-written, and the music is great. As with most JRPGs, there's a bit of grinding involved, but grinding is actually FUN in these games. Sure, some quests are worse than others (I personally think the Haruka quests are annoying af), but most of the sidestories are enjoyable.

For Kiwami 2 in particular, I enjoy the streamlined combat system in comparison to Kiwami 1, though I do miss being able to swap styles. The minigames in Kiwami 2 are a lot more fun. Cabaret club is a money hellhole that I'll happily throw myself into...
Clan creattion is okay, if you would like to support the developers I recommend buying the DLC bundle. Plus it gets you through the construction storyline faster, and nets you achievements faster as well.

this game is probably a great remake of 2. So, the original yakuza 2 was clearly trash is what im saying.

get the game if you liked kiwami, 0 and yakuza in general and you love the minigames, cabaret club management, and yakuza TD.
dont play it if you want bakamitai and a well-dressed clown handing you a golden pistol for half assing your completion list.

i will say that i cheated to get a ridiculous amount of money so i dont have to grind out a lot of content.  but im not going to complain about how grindy the game is because it really wasnt bad, i just didnt feel like it. 

the game is graphically better and the camera is smoother, but for some reason it became harder to control your character?  kiryu couldnt stop bumping into walls, couldnt turn to face opponents with R1 (better to face them manually), and walking through doorways makes me think kiryu has a BMI of 3000",1599651883,1599651883,False,0,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

In this game they only speak in Japanese, but it wasn't an issue for me.
Maybe it made the game more fun, forcing you to read the subtitles.

Overall, a great experience. Good storyline, great characters, fun combat and side stuff (like cabaret management from Yakuza 0), etc. The kind of game where you can beat up street punks, get some fine dining, and go gambling while hardly moving a block. Also, no shortage funny gags in Yakuza series tradition to keep the game lighthearted despite its serious themes.

Still, I've got my complaints. Because this uses a new game engine called the Dragon Engine, I can't even get a 30 fps framerate without having the game look like complete junk (I have a GTX 760), whereas in previous titles I can play in fullscreen with nice-looking graphics. Also the ragdolling is insane, but I think it's actually kind of amusing, so it's not necessarily a bad point.

Also, not to flex or anything, but the game was way too easy. I played on hard and the only part I really had trouble on was the fight with Ryuji at the start of the game, on which I had to take up the offer to switch to easy difficulty for the fight. Otherwise, heat moves and weapons are insanely overpowered and made the game feel way too easy, especially compared to Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 (which I played on normal difficulty).

The story is interesting but not really special, however the plot twists at the end are good and nearly impossible to predict. The side content is fun as always except the colosseum at higher levels because many enemies have like 15 health bars (no joke) but it gets a lot more fun and a lot easier the more you play since you get new moves and more damage/health/rage.

At first I fucking hated the new combat but as the game went on with some very important upgrades such has lotus furious fist it can make the combat way more enjoyable. Make sure to learn moves from komaki as soon as you can because it will make the combat more enjoyable and it does not take too long to learn it. The combat is has upgrades that take part of all 4 combat styles from previous 2 games but the basic one you start with suck dick so make sure to get good upgrades. Next the new exp system is categorized into 5 different exp types. Now you can farm exp way easier with eating food other than beating the shit out of enemies for million fucking years like kiwami 1. Now the story was ok for me. I thought some part was really fucking stupid. I personally enjoyed the side content way more. The cabret club and clan system is back. The cabret club story line continues on from yakuza 0 and you do get to see the chracters from cabret club again. The cabret club also has new mechanics for girls and restrictions that make the game interesting and not stale.

That said lets start with the positives:
It has enough content for way more than 40hours,I just personally didnt want to play the cabaret content and some other side stuff .The new engine provides great visuals and way fewer loading screens,you can just walk into buildings and from area to area without loading,it makes a big difference.
Main story is,as you'd expect, interesting and fun to follow. Theres plenty of weapons and side stories to spice things up a bit. 
Now some negatives: 
I dont know what they messed up with the new engine but outside of the pre rendered cutscenes the lip-synch is awful. Obviously the new engine uses way more ressources than the old one ,so if your pc struggled with 0 or kiwami 1 maybe hold off on purchasing this one. 
Some sidestories are laughably short. I get that they only exist to unlock people for the two big minigames,cabaret and clan creator,but seriously,eating the entire ramen menu is what this game considers a substory? Not even some hooligan attacking the ramen chef that you have to defeat ? Quite silly. 
Theres now only one combat Style. Now some of the combat styles in previous games where admittedly quite cheesy with rush allowing you to dodge basically everything with easy but I still miss switching combat styles based on the situation.
That said I certainly got my money's worth and can recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed 0 and kiwami.",1598719100,1598719100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am big fan of the series but beware the GRIND (especially for those completionists). 

It's so disappointing to see dishonorable game mechanics implemented just to bill the hours towards the user. In some cases, most evidently in it's terrible [i]Texas Hold'Em implementation[/i], the game is not just frustrating and fruitless, it is plain [i]uninteresting[/i].

After careful analysis and a tedious grind during [i]Haruka's 1,000 chip quest[/i], I saw the AI's pattern. This is not a simple quest and it makes the cheating poker items relevant and just defeats the purpose of the mini game altogether. It is definitely not worth grinding to get the chips because there is a calculable tiny probability the player will beat the AI in any turn. I think for one attempt, I calculated that it might add 3-5 hours of hapless luck based grinding just to get the 1,000 chips but then another 2 perhaps for the losses incurred because the game penalizes you for losing chips. This is without the Joker Card items. There are plenty of strategies online and you can see the unanimous hatred for this aspect of the game.

It is because of this quest that I gave up on trying to do all of the quests. I have, as of yet, to get higher than 980 chips and I just rage quit for the 5th time to shamelessly shit on this piece of the game.

- It plays smoother than the last two on the new engine

Graphics: This is where the game is an obvious cut above the previous entries. The city looks so good that I would easily mistake it for real. The game looks next gen compared to Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, and attention to detail is mind-boggling. Simplest tasks like opening different types of doors are so fluid that they actually look natural. The gameplay is strikingly similar to cutscenes. This is one of the best looking game I have played of late - and I did not expect to say this about a Yakuza game.

Gameplay: With the newer and sleeker Dragon engine the gameplay is much smoother than previous games. Other than that, it is the same reliable Yakuza mix of beat'em up and free roam, and it is as delightful as in the past. The substories are more than half of game's chunk, and they are hilarious enough that I burst out laughing multiple times.  

Story: The weakest link, in my opinion. While Yakuza 0 still has the best ever story, this time it's not as disappointing as in Kiwami, and the finale is actually really clever. The main issue is that it picks up amazingly in the final moments - while being a ho-hum cheesefest over most of the game. The main bad guy is great though. He has clear goals and a personality.

The extra content like substories, cabaret club management and the clan creator etc is massive and thanks to the better engine as polished as the main story. I have yet to go through it all but I look forward to it.

Overall, this game is great, and lives up to Yakuza legacy.",1597271022,1597271022,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That being said, this review will be more comparing kiwami 2 to 0 and kiwami for reference, as to rate kiwami 2 in a vacuum is a clear must have.

-Plot of course is a rollercoaster in the best of ways. I don't know if I would say as good as 0, but I did enjoy it more than kiwami. Characters again are great and really fleshed out and its very cool to see their growth from kiwami 1 for those who play a part here.
-Combat is still serviceable, but the simplification of kiryu's moveset from 4 styles to switch between to 1 general style that mixes parts of each does reduce the depth and skill ceiling of fights, so I would say the other games did them better. Getting upgrades and unlockables is improved, however, as you gain varying amounts of 5 different exp stats that can be spent in different combinations to gain new heat moves or raise base stats.
-Side quests are fine, there's more variety than having your wallet stolen every 5 minutes like in kiwami and helping people usually results in them coming to work for you in a minigame or unlocking a special heat move that you can use if that npc is nearby.
-Kiwami 2 has quite a few returning minigames such as the cabaret club, gambling, claw grabbing machine, etc so those are still fun. New additions include a fun golf range and an rts style mode, as well as interactive urination.
-Graphically I feel like kiwami 2 does not quite stand up to the previous games on a mid-range pc. This engine is capable of some great things but without a beast of a computer it either looks strange or lacks performance. I never reached 60fps in kiwami 2 despite that being a constant in the others which really is unfortunate because while I did stay above 40 fps after settings tweaks, I personally felt this was a bad tradeoff to having physics on items in the main world and cutting out loading screens when entering shops.

The leveling system has been broken down into points in specific areas which allow for eating food to be a great contributing way to fuel a constant source of experience points.  It gives credence that everything in the world has a place in the game.

One second iteration of the Dragon Engine and it's great fighting and physics system compared to the previous generations from (3-5 0 Kiwami 1) which felt stiff and unwieldy in comparison.   As much as I would like to have the next remakes of 3-5 in Dragon, it's unlikely to happen due to production costs involved.  I would love to have Saejima Taiga tossing people into the air and midair grab into a power bomb or something.  

Kiwami 2 story takes another step in adding to Kiryu's woes and the amount of twists that it has was somewhat absurd but then again, it is patently typical of a ""serious"" crime drama.

This is a remake of Yakuza 2 with a different game engine, which brings a fresh change to the combat system from previous titles. I will compare this game to Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 in this review.

Combat:
With the new combat system, you only have one style of fighting and you pretty much have all you need to start beating enemies up from the beginning. The skill system has changed from either paying money or gaining a single exp to gaining 5 different types of exp which you spend to improve stats or learn new skills. For the most part, the skills you learn don't seem to add much since you can just click enemies to death. Combat has become a lot more active compared to the previous games, in that even the environment plays a part. Objects can be kicked around for damage, there are a lot more quicktime events, enemies usually have weapons, 3 weapons can be equipped and pulled out, and NPCs can assist in battle through heat actions.

Minigames:
Some new minigames have been added and some minigames have been removed. Pool, cee-lo, cho han, baccarat, roulette, bowling have been removed. But golf, gravure photo, cabaret club, and clan creator have been added.

Substories:
The substories have stayed about consistent from 0 and Kiwami 1.

Music:
The music is really great in this game. Easy to get pumped up for long fights.

Story:
This is a remake of the original, but the story is a lot more interesting than Kiwami 1. It is closer to the Yakuza 0 level of storytelling, but still has some gaps and leaps from the original. Also the Majima Saga was added to close any remaining loose ends from the end of Yakuza 0 and the events prior to Yakuza Kiwami 2.

Game Performance:
Unlike 0 and Kiwami 1, this game is more intensive on the graphic card. It took me a while to find the correct graphics settings to change from 20 fps to 40-50 fps. It is unbearable to play the game at 20 fps, but once you reach close to 40 fps, the game becomes very enjoyable to play. Also the cutscenes might run slow as well.

The graphics are SO good compared to Yakuza 0 and Kiwami that you'll find yourself walking around enjoying the views of Kamurocho and Sotenbori. I liked the story, but the characters have some very childish and stupid behaviours and there are things that just don't make sense (that is more of a Japanese culture thing though). The combat system was changed and I like this one better. You need to be more aware while fighting, but I don't understand how the developers did not add a decent lock-on system. The one it has really sucks and in a game where you will be fighting against multiple enemies at the time, it just doesn't make any sense. It can be very frustrating some times, even if you have already mastered the combat system. 

Now, can you believe there are 76 (I believe) Bouncer missions? WTF!!! You get tired of them after the 12th.

Then I went into this, Kiwami 2 and wow, wow.... where do I begin:

I've placed spoiler tags for story related stuff, in case someone reads this and hasn't played the game etc. Spoiler tags are present :)

Pros:
- Goro Majima
- P H Y S I C S
- V I S U A L S
- Characters + Voice acting
- Soundtrack
- The combat
- The mini-games, for the most part (except UFO Catcher, that's my least favourite.. Only in this game, 0 was fine)
- The way this game goes from stupidity to serious in seconds
- The sub-stories: a few that stick out are the [spoiler]toylet mini-games which apparently is a REAL THING[/spoiler] and when you're [spoiler]taken into this baby day-care thing and you gotta fight grown man that are being toddlers... what the ....[/spoiler], there are a handful but those two stick out to me the most just because it's mad and funny asf

Cons:
- The Majima side-story thing was very short, I did it in like a couple hours maybe less, I wish there was more to that. I wanna play as Majima :(
- [spoiler]Haruka only being in the last leg of the game, but very worth while when you see her[/spoiler]
- A majority of the animations: When I was doing the Majima story-thing, every time I hit someone, it takes him like 1-2 seconds to get out of his animation so I can move and not get battered to hell. Though, this didn't happen as much in the main story. Annoying but not game breaking.
- The phone/email vibration... In the settings it says you can have it as ""Vibrate"" or ""Sound"" but it vibrates no matter what? Is that only for emails or am I just stupid (second one probably)
- Lack of the dog except [spoiler]when you have to give it to the Sunflower woman for the sub-story. Plus a neat achievement for donating a million yen via ATM[/spoiler]..
- Controller binds, 9 times out of 10 when I'm running there's a small chance I hit something like a vending machine or hit ""A"" to talk to a character and it interrupts my running, though usually happens when there's a character with me for a mission but, not as annoying. Another thing, every time I want to grab someone and launch them, I keep on picking shit up that I don't want and is very annoying at times when I wanna launch someone, for example for one bit of the story you [spoiler]go see this mahjong dude and you gotta fight him and a multiple others in a small ass room[/spoiler], 99.9% of the time in that fight I keep picking items up instead of grabbing people.. Really annoying
- This one isn't as much of a con, if it wasn't so annoying at times: This game 80% of the time forces you to have a character with you for the story and, for combat it's actually useful but there's been times when I've wanted to throw someone into a building or just launch 'em but the person I've got with me likes to kill them before I've thrown them or just ruin everything",1596358530,1596559347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It looks spectacular, more often during regular gameplay and not during the showy cutscenes. Animations still seem to be getting the short end of the budgetign stick, but they're as charming as alwways. My only gripe with the updated engine is that they added that heavy sense of momentum/locomotion to Kyriua, which makes maneuvering him in corridors or other tight spaces tedious becase he reacts to geometry and breaks his speed.

That said, I'm having an absolute blast. I've finished all of the Cabaret content that I could and I was surprised by how much depth and characterization the different hostesses were given. A lot of love and care went into creating them.

Just landed back in Kamurocho after a short stint in Sotenbori. Can't wait to see what comes next. Lookign forward to seeing how Kyriu's relationship unfolds with Daigo, Ryiu, and Kaoru.

Final Thoughts:

An excellent installment in the series. Biggest highlights for me include the new Dragon Engine, which looks stunning, especially during the night time. I loved the VO, the heart and charm behind the characters. A lot of Makoto fan service in the side Majima story section (though that felt very rushed and slapped on, felt super railroaded and linear). Kaoru is a great character and it was fun seeing the story's twists and turns as you learn about her family and that of Ryuji.

Weaknesses: the game felt markedly easier and less skillful than 0 or Kiwami. I felt the Super Saiyan form Kyriu enters is WAY overpowered and trivializes any combat encounter. Also, there's only one fighting style, so the game relies on added Heat takedowns to spice things up. That said, after acquiring some movement upgrades, Kyriu feels much more nimble and less sluggish.",1596067789,1596067789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is easily one of the best games I've ever played, just like Yakuza 0. Not only because of the story and the characters but how they renewed the fighting system and how alive they made the atmosphere feel on this one, it's crazy.

First of all, the story is incredible and reaaaally interesting, a lot of new characters you'll fall in love with, a lot of characters coming back and some really scary people.

Second, the atmosphere that SEGA achieved in this game is something else, a more lively city with more lights, places to go and the simple touch of not having to load every place you enter (pawn shop, poppo, restaurants, etc) makes it even better.
You'll FEEL like you are really walking down the streets of Kamurocho/Sotenbori

Third, the fighting system, this is something people coming from Yakuza 0 and 1 will struggle a little with. Atleast I, when I started playing, didnt like the new fighting system at all until I got used to it and I ended up reaaally liking it, it renews the whole formula and makes you try something new and fresh.

Fourth, You'll get to visit Sotenbori too not just Kamurocho and you'll have a looot of stuff to do there and a lot of people to meet

Fifth, just buy the damn game.

Only thing I didnt like (it doesnt affect gameplay, its irrelevant) its the ragdoll system. When you are fighting, you and your enemies will enter ragdoll mode when they get hit and makes it unrealistic af, not like Yakuza 0 and 1. But It wont affect the gameplay or anything.

To provide some perspective, I'd never played a Yakuza game before I picked up Yakuza0 for the PC.
I'd heard they 'were good' and after a bit of adjustment to a ""smaller open world"" loved zero to bits. Fun brawler, with some ott melodrama and side-missions that are always there to provide light-relief and a few smiles.
Kiwami 1 felt like a bit of a leetle bit of a step back after zero. I definitely enjoyed the game and the story (especially how it works if you played zero before this first game) - but  did feel like a remake of an older game. Graphics were a bit worse. Mechanics were a bit worse - still good, but ""everything was a bit worse""
Kiwami 2 though is fantastic. First off it seems to have made better use of the updated Dragon engine than Kiwami 1 and looks like 0. Secondly, it's had new content pumped in with Majima in the main game (and a brand new Majima DLC, that ties up some 0-ends).
No idea if it's Sega wanted to focus more on tidying up the first trilogy with this game, or the different dev in QLoc - but (and this is maybe the point I'd like to make) - If you liked zero and didn't like Kiwami 1 as much, you're right - but push through and stick with it. Kiwami 2 is f'in great.

This game is pretty good, the change to the dragon engine was worth, perhaps the combat could be improved but to be honest I know why yakuza 7 went full jrpg. Content wise is close to zero than to kiwami, now it took me less to get platinum since I know how to play yakuzas games but it was mostly due to UI improvements, less jarring UX.

While I think Yakuza 0 had the strongest story this game is good enough despite all the holes. Playing Kiwami 1 first is needed story wise.
However the story over the two games is somewhat predictible and full of facepalm moments.
[spoiler]I mean Kiryu could have stopped the entire story line early if he didnt do the hollier than the pope act :P[/spoiler]
Do yourself a favor if you pick up this game. Make sure you play the cabaret story arch in Yakuza 0 first, then finish the cabaret arch in this game. You wont regrett it. Good story with lots of humour.
The cabaret story is worth the thumbs up alone.

Besides the story this game seems to be stabil as I have not had any issues at all playing it. It also looks good. The combat is still somewhat clunky but fun. Also full of different mini games where some are fun and others are just weird. Playable with K+M as I have played the entire game using it altho there are a few mini games where you need controller. Im looking at you Virtua-on.

I recommend the bundle especially if it is on sale and all three games ties together.

Performance : If you're running modern hardware I don't doubt you're going to be able to run this game well. The technical issues are small but there's a lot. I'll detail a small fix for each one below.

Physics are tied to framerate - Cap to 60 FPS using Rivatuner to fix this.
In-Game Framerate Cap is Broken - Install SilentPatch (fan patch of the game)
Mini-Games running at 60 FPS instead of 30 FPS thus not working as intended - SilentPatch
Realtime Reflections causes problems for some - Turn off
Depth of Field causes heavy aliasing - Turn off OR set Anti-Aliasing to SSAA 2x (if your FPS can handle)

[b]Yakuza Kiwami 2[/b] is an action-adventure game developed by [b]Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios[/b] and is a complete remake of the PS2 version. The game has improved gameplay from [b]Yakuza Kiwami[/b] such as the improved [b]Dragon Engine[/b] that was used in the sixth installment. The graphics have also been improved and look as beautiful as ever and a new edition is the [b]Majima Saga[/b] that is about three chapters long and is a prequel to the main storyline.

[/list]

[h3]Cons[/h3]
[list]
[*]Kaoru Sayama is mostly bland.

[*]The soundtrack is ok for the most part.
[/list]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story takes place one year after the events of the previous game. The [b]Tojo Clan[/b] is failing apart since the passing of [b]Akira Nishikiyama[/b] and because of that, eternal power struggles have been happing. [b]Kiryu[/b] was asked by the Fith Chairman [b]Yukia Terada[/b] to bring peace between them and the [b]Omi Alliance[/b]. However, [b]Ryuji Goda[/b], the dragon of [b]Kansai[/b] wants a war with both clans and stops at nothing to achieve his goal. The Fith Chairman is then assassinated and it is now up to [b]Kiryu[/b] to put a stop to it all and save the [b]Tojo Clan[/b]. [b]Tokyo Police[/b] sends a woman named [b]Kaoru Sayama[/b] to put [b]Kiryu[/b] into protective custody. However, her real goal is to get close to the [b]Tojo Clan[/b] to learn about her past.

The story is presented very well and is the best part of the game, every moment had a lot of hype put into it. The twists that the story shows felt amazing, especially near the end of the game as everything unfolds. The story has it’s charm and the characters are crafted very well like always, however, one character, unfortunately, does not stick well enough and that is [b]Kaoru Sayama[/b]. Now [b]Kaoru[/b] is not a terrible character by no means, it’s just she is not presented very well. The only thing that [b]Kaoru[/b] really wants to do is uncover her past but she comes off as very cold and off-putting. Her character does develop as the story progresses and does have a sweet side but she just does not do it right and at the end of the day, she is just is not likable to me. [b]Haruka[/b] who only appears in a few chapters has more character development then [b]Kaoru[/b] and is with you for the whole game. [b]Haruka[/b] is [b]Kiryu’s[/b] adoptive daughter and is willing to stay with him no matter what happens to her, despite having a father who used to be with the [b]Yakuza[/b].

[h3]Majima Saga[/h3]
The year is 2006 and [b]Yukio Terada[/b] will recruit someone new so the [b]Tojo Clan[/b] could be rebuilt since the 10 million yen incident from the previous game. [b]Terada[/b] states that the person to have deemed the most money would gain the spot. The two individuals who are trying to get the position are [b]Goro Majima[/b] and [b]Akinobu Uematsu[/b]. 

The [b]Majima Saga[/b] is quite short as it’s only about three chapters long. That being said, it is very enjoyable and I recommend doing all three chapters at the same time. To get the chapters you will have to progress through the game normally to get them.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game uses the new [b]Dragon Engine[/b] that was used in [b]Yakuza 6[/b] and the gameplay is completely different, the overworld has been improved completely. The entire map is a giant world where you can interact with many things. There is also a new way to upgrade your moves in the game as you don’t use the money you get to upgrade them instead, you must eat food. [b]Kiryu[/b] won’t get any upgrade points if his stomach is full however, so you can only get the upgrade points on an empty stomach. There are a bunch of wacky sub-stories for you to do and they are quite interesting for you to do as they break away from the series tone the story goes for. There are lots of mini-games for you to play like [b]Mojang[/b], a crane based game, and going to the [b]Batting Ranges[/b].

The only issue with the upgrading system that the game has brought in is that it is now easier to upgrade than before. Now [b]Yakuza[/b] did hand you a lot of money in the first two games but you did not have to go to restaurants. [b]Kiryu[/b] will get hungry if he gets into fights and getting into fights also grants you upgrade points as well so upgrading is pretty simple to do and can make the game easy if you farm a lot. I was playing on normal difficulty and you can increase it to make it harder. 

[h3]Combat[/h3]
Combat is different with the new engine and you can smash enemies through windows if giving the chance. Now I should note that when [b]Kiryu[/b] grabs people, he won’t be able to use his special moves as he would in the first two games instead it is just a normal grab but he can do pretty much every move. [b]Kiryu[/b] does not have his other fighting styles as he had in the first two games so he only has [b]Brawler[/b]. You can still grab weapons and other stuff and use them to help fight off the enemies. You will also have a partner with you for a large majority of the game and you can pull off combo moves to deal more damage to enemies.

The only issue with combat is that thanks to the new engine it may take some time to get used to combat. So if you just got done the first two games then you may have some trouble at the start of the game.

[b]Goro Majima[/b] is a water-downed version of [b]Kiryu[/b] in terms of combat and that’s not a bad thing as the chapters are new to the game. He does not get upgrade points like [b]Kiryu[/b] and he can only heal at restaurants but does carry the health and items that [b]Kiryu[/b] can get in his story.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics in the game are honesty beautiful and have improved from the first two games, you can see the detail that has been shown in the overworld, especially when night comes. The graphics also do not change when it comes to the cut scenes which is another improvement that the game features.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2107886126

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
Unfortunately, the soundtrack is not as good in this game as there are not a lot of memorable songs in the game. The only song that was worth mentioning that was actually really good was [b]SiM-A[/b] which is from an actual band and tells a story about a guy fighting off the Yakuza so it’s fitting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdf7gIW_hls

[h1]Preformance[/h1]
The game was tested with a NIVIDA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, 16 GB of RAM storage, and an AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50. The game runs very smooth and I had no issues while playing the game at all, you may need a decent computer to run the game as it is demanding on the graphics.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]Yakuza Kiwami 2[/b] improves on a lot of things the first two games had while bringing something new to the table. The game may be a little easy at times and the soundtrack is not the greatest but it’s a great [b]Yakuza[/b] game to play and is perfect for any [b]Yakuza[/b] fan.",1593418656,1594600495,True,18,0,0.670679152011871338,2,True,False,False

1. I was so disappointed that they remove all other fighting styles in 0 and kiwami, there was so much fun in that. In 0 and kiwami, every combat can give you different experience since you can use different fight styles and different combos, but now you only have one style left. I dont think its necessary to remove all other fighting styles, maybe they should add some option or even put them into the skill tree for player to unlock them through the story, I think that will be much better. 

2. Boss battle is terrible. Especially Ryuji's fights in the final, it's a f**king joke if you compare it to Nishiki's in Kiwami or Shibusawa's in 0. It feels like fighting Shimano in Kiwami but only with a bit more QTEs.

3. The plots in the final few chapters is so campy that I can't even. I think they wasted a good character such as Ryuji. (Terada : I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a comedy.)

4. [spoiler] Kiryu get tired of Haruka treating him like a tool so he killed himself. [/spoiler]


Things I liked : 
1. You can play as Majima ni-san again
2. Jojo reference  [spoiler] YES!! You can fight DIO in Yakuza [/spoiler]

OVERALL: The cinematic are way more interesting than the previous ones for me!!! Look they're almost the same gameplay don't tell me I should go to the yakuza 0. I mean the cinematic were way more well done than the previous two because it was released on 2017.

EDIT: Before Finish this game I'm going to point out some important things. I recommended to buy only Yakuza kiwami 2 over the bundle cause there were loaded previous cut sense at the very beginning chapter where kyuri with the little girl went to visit the graveyard. U can keep on remembering the past which basically means u'll understand what was happening in the past so u will going to continuous the story without not knowing everything. Second, yes I did already mentioned the graphics&cinematic are way more well done then the previous two. Third, u'll find some weird grammar&grammar mistakes in this game I didn't say my English is good tho plus I'M AN ASIAN still learning English no doubt. But there was a few lines such as (u're serious/u're sure) which doesn't correct when a ASK b the object and wants a double confirm but failed and turn out direct confirm if u know what I mean.

ALRIGHT WITHOUT FURTHER ADO
LASTLY, the game was really fun at all time and when u started boring there will always be a sub mission pop up which u'll get  ur mood back on and keep playing it. Also the story getting intense at each chapter that will literally hit ur personal feeling and u'll want to find out more and more. Yakuza is by far the most beautiful japanese game I ever played but I heard this game gets so underrated. But man hey they still had some master piece game on ps2 such as onumusha if I'm not mistaken the name.

OVERALL: Definitely worth a buy guys...I hope there will soon release yakuza6&7 for pc can't await.

But I won't recommend this to other players.

I liked Yakuza Kiwami 2 until the final boss fight, where the final hit is a dumb Quick Time Event. If you miss, you instantly die and have to redo the fight all over. And the fight is boring and easy. 

I personally detest any form of QTE but this time I felt true hatred. It messed up the entire movie-enjoyment I had for this game.

I did not like Majima's role in this game as a construction boss. He should fight Kiryu.

Story: Great. Still falls victim to the same issues prevalent in the writing of Yakuza 0 and Kiwami such as abruptly cutting to side stories that vary in quality. Generally, the newly introduced characters are very interesting and are written pretty well. The plot is very interesting if not a bit all over the place. All in all, not enough Majima, but still good.

Gameplay: Unga bunga. I mash light attack and occasionally heavy and the enemies ragdoll all over the place. Almost impossible to ""master"" the combat in Kiwami 2 besides the parry and Komaki Tiger Drop. Most boss fights are laughable stat checks that are only challenging if the challenge is self imposed ([spoiler]For example, during the final fight in the game, I challenged myself to a bare-knuckle brawl with no healing items or weapons to make the final duel of the dragons more impactful[/spoiler]) The combat is much less skill based than the style system in the previous two games I played, but the ragdoll makes me laugh, so all in all, eh.

ill leave my first review here.

the acting in the game is amazing(other anime games need to copy this)
other video games need to see how they did it and copy it
everytime the main char started to talk it felt amazing the way they talk and the voice acting was amazing.

the gameplay was ok
you get a small city that you can walk freely but other then stores or mini games the city feels alittle meaningless

the combat is bad
i hated the combat in the game its just a button pressing and nothing amazing
the boss fights are bad
bosses are annoying to fight
you can auto aim them and they use their evade freaken alot andunless you come super op to them you will have an annoying fight.

the side quests are bad.
lucky for us we can skip most talks.
its start off nice but then after 2 or 3 side quests you will just start skiping them and move on.
there is no voice acting just ah oh aha...

Kiwami 2 is the first Ryu Ga Gotoku studios game using the new Dragon Engine that we got to try here on the PC and, as such, new small issues have appeared, and I want to start this review commenting a bit on those, and the overall quality of the PC version that QLOC has made.

Firstly, this new engine is obviously more advanced, everything looks a lot better, with more complex shading and lighting, character models also look better, etc. NPC density on the streets of both Kamurocho and Sotenbori is amazing, and overall the game runs quite well if we meet the recommended specs, at least for 2160p all maxxed, minus of course the very taxing Super Sampling.

Now, on the subject of Aliasing, this game is one of the worst in recent times, since the standard FXAA or SMAA barely do anything to make most complex surfaces look smooth, it’s the opposite: lots of the geometry in the game have an insane amount of shimmering and jaggies, even when doing 4K dowmsampling. I’ve read it has to do with lighting effects and other stuff, and it’s on the developers’ side to fix that, if they ever. Not even SSAA at max removes the annoying jaggies and shimmering completely and that’s a shame, because the ports of Yakuza 0 and Kiwami were excellent on this regard, the image looked clear and smooth, and the SSAA worked as intended on those games; granted, it was a different engine, and also a different studio doing the ports (Lab42), but well, it is what it is.

With that out of the way, well holy hell, this game is AMAZING. I still consider Yakuza 0 more complete overall, since the Kiryu/Majima stories are very well developed there, it felt like two games slapped together with a lot of character development for both characters and, for me personally, it was the 4th contact with the franchise, as I didn’t play the original.

Kiwami felt a bit lacking to me, but I expected it, being the very first game but with the new engine and some additions. The story was solid, intense but the game was considerably shorter…still a blast to play.

Now, Kiwami 2, it’s like in between those two for me, It’s an excellent game, there’re lots of improvements for sure, especially graphical ones, but I think I enjoyed the combat in the previous two games a bit more, with the style switching and all that. We can still do a lot of what was possible before, now in Kiwami 2, but it’s simpler and more streamlined, which to me is a little bit a step backwards, but nothing off putting, really.

Characters are a forte on this franchise, and Kiwami 2 has very interesting characters, some new, some old, and still quite a lot of character development for some of the oldies, while also introducing us to some new interesting faces that surely will play important roles in the future of the saga.

The scripts are well written, the expressions and animations on the characters are top notch, and it’s obvious that the Ryu Ga Gotoku studio know how to do their stuff.

Performance as I said earlier has been fine on my i9 9980XE and my rtx 2080 ti played capped at 240 FPS and 2160p, all maxxed, with SSAA, no slowdowns ever, in general pretty smooth.

There have been a couple patches that have ironed out some of the initial launch bugs, and it’s possible that there are still some to come, who knows. The game is fine right now, except the Anti Aliasing issue, so if you can live with that, don’t miss this amazing game and story, it’s another great chapter for this saga.

And of course…mini games, yeah, not much to say there, they’re addicting, some of them still too complex since I’m not familiar with Japanese games, but there sure are a lot of mini games, so we can spend a lot of time enjoying them, doing side quests, etc.

All in all, more Yakuza greatness on the PC, and again I thank SEGA for making it possible to enjoy these games on the PC, and at decent prices too. An amazing publisher, and I hope the trend continues, I’ll keep supporting these good games as much as possible, for sure.

Solid 9/10 and not 10/10 because of small technical quirks related to the Dragon Engine, like its terrible Anti Aliasing...other than that, simply amazing",1593702140,1593702251,True,24,0,0.736231386661529541,0,True,False,False

While I like most of the new characters introduced, story is quite incoherent and does not leave memorable impression.

Pros:
Graphics are phenomenal. Love it. Absolutely blown away by it.
Soundtrack is awesome.
Story line (even though I haven't completed it yet) is rich and stunning.
A good time filler that doesn't require much thought than to smash some buttons and do flashy moves when the right button pops up. 

Cons:
I've never played the previous 2 games. Therefore, I did not know every cut scene is like a long movie and its good for the story but holy cow it takes a long time to just play. 
The combat system is okay. Coming from Dead Souls, Batman, The Witcher, etc; what irks me the most is the spotty dodging time. It might just be me needing the upgrade the perk but its so inconsistent with the rest of the combat. Blocking or dodging isn't quick, its spotty and frankly unusual for my test.

Other than that, its a good game and I'd score it on first glance a 8/10. Got it on the summer sale here so $15 isn't bad.

Coming from Yakuza 0 to this game may be a jarring experience for some. The game does ditch styles in favor of one.

There are nearly no loading screens, and fights can be had almost everywhere. One time, thugs followed me into a convenience store and after messing it up they refused to sell me anything. My only critique is I do not like the look of Kiryu's face, he always looks really sad.

The director of the Yakuza series has always described it as a ""human drama"", but the attempt at Greek tragedy in the previous game was poorly executed and needlessly abstract; at least, compared to how Yakuza 0 does the ""human drama"" element. Yakuza 1 PS2 succeeded because it was backed by the setting and the audience was left to imagine and interpret events as they went, allowing the seemingly flanderized elements shine through as creative, deserved escalation and interesting.

These elements, however, did not age that well. Especially not with the pace of Majima Everywhere. If you've found yourself taking more breaks playing YK1 than Y0, this is exactly why.

Enter Yakuza Kiwami 2. This game also nearly identically follows the plot of Y2 PS2, except with more sidecontent and a new combat system. Plot-wise, it's meanders similarly to Yakuza 1 but the elements it introduces are more focused and the presented stakes are more meaningful. It's generally accepted as better.

Gameplay-wise? Well, thematically- or in gameplay vs story relations, it makes sense. By the endgame, Kiryu is a heat god, spamming heat actions ad nauseum, seemingly unkillable a fraction of the time even without remaining HP, and his moveset is purely built for relying on raw stats and anti-crowd combat.

It also LOOKS nice. The ragdolls are hilarious and sometimes really satisfying. The attacks blend really well and compliment the nature of the new Dragon Engine's prowess in effects and physics. Kiryu behaves in a lot of realistic ways you'd expect, making the times he lands attacks feel impactful, and the nuances of his kicks have strong presentation.

To PLAY however, it feels bad. If you're not spamming heat moves and relying on your raw stats, you're doing it wrong. Trying to play this game with technique is frustrating, it's really nothing more than a glorified RPG at times because of how certain combat can play out. This can only be escaped if you get lucky or happen to be well-practiced enough with a section after many bad attempts to do it just slightly better.

Kiryu's moveset is built for physics finishing hold spam and mashing out heat moves. That's it.

The enemy design is built for physics finishing hold spam and mashing out heat moves. That's it.

It's very disappointing, because Yakuza Kiwami 1, for all of its outright offensive enemy design, had really good design sense in at least designing Kiryu's moveset. It gave you unparalleled mastery over at least his moveset, and the skill ceiling and depth was really high. It was rewarding.

Here? The only thing standing between you and failure is some EXP, and copious abuse of a few go-to mechanics. Charge attacks, finishing holds, the guard-parry evade and some management of Extreme Heat Mode are all you're expected to know how to do. In lieu of realism, the tech of flanking and outplaying opponents is gone. Kiryu can still be flanked and cheesed, but no enemy in the game works like this anymore.

While this loop is satisfying for a little while, it obviously does not hold a candle to the depth Y0 and YK1 exuded ultimately. While the moveset you're given here is a cute homage to the moves Kiryu had in Y0 and YK1 in the various styles, it's very style over substance. Where it lacks in single-target you're supposed to make up for in raw stats. Who cares about outplaying the opponent if your numbers are just bigger than theirs? And, in a way, while I can tell they wanted Kiryu to play powerfully in this game, since it was technically their last game with him as the mai n character, he really doesn't feel powerful to play.

He feels stronger in YK1 with the fully realized moveset, and with a few modifications made to the game to make it go down easier with the enemy movesets. All of that together blends together supremely. Here? Unless you play exactly as the developers intended, and even then, Kiryu's options are very, very limited, and he will see no success with any other strategy. Fights are a thing that happen, and you can't say they don't happen, but there's really nothing to write home about for this game's combat. I guess a well-placed Tiger Drop or two or a cool end of battle freeze frame are really the most spectacular things you'll see here.

That said, I still think it's worth at least one full playthrough of the story. Kamurocho has really never looked this beautiful.",1592932601,1592932601,True,38,2,0.718835234642028809,1,True,False,False

While I did enjoy Tiger Dropping the shit out of people repeatedly in Dragon Style and it felt a lot more powerful in Kiwami, I really liked how smooth the combat system felt. Playing at a wider fov and having some manual control on camera angles and style definitely led to a lot of creative ways to attack the enemy, especially when playing on higher difficulty. It just feels so silky smooth when setting up combos and parries and dodges to counter and move around a bunch of opponents. Regretably, I haven't been able to play the Latter of the Yakuza series as I am bound to whatever releases on Steam, but if it actually kept this system I'd be very happy with that. 
I enjoyed the story a lot and felt there were a lot of memorable moments and some good drama. I personally thought 0 and Kiwami were better from a narrative and emotional standpoint, but it does bring some interesting ideas to the table and introduces some great characters. The fight scenes stick out especially; fighting Majima gave me chills cause he's just so awesome. I was dreading getting into the Clan Creator mini game but I actually really enjoyed it. It definitely gets harder at the end of the section but I honestly didn't have too much trouble with it. 
There was recently a huge sale on this series not too long ago. I bought the bundle about a week before the price dropped significantly. Since this is a $30 game, I'd suggest waiting to buy it at a discount; I think it was during SEGA's Anniversary Event or something similar. Just keep an eye out whenever the price drops, and I'd strongly recommend getting this after you beat the first two.

I don't mind losing the other styles as much as the Dragon Style at the start of the game here is just as barebones as when you start using it in Kiwami 1, and even after multiple upgrades it doesn't feel good enough. I'm lacking half of the heat moves I had by default in both Yakuza 1 and 0 and 4, and bats and golf require you to spend way more time than their minigames can remain interesting to get new movesets and a fucking heat move for either of them. Extended minigames like Majima Construction is probably the first actually interesting one in the bunch, meanwhile club cabaret still goes on for far longer than it can remain interesting. Anything that asks for you to pickup weapons is a joke. I hope you like an enemy kicking a barrel 30 miles which hits you for 1HP and causes the weapon you're holding to break. Bosses are still arbritary, constantly countering you or dodging, which breaks your lock, and Kiryu has worse tracking than older games.

The only downside to this game is the rag dolling in the fighting. Don't know why it suddenly showed up here in this title when in the previous 2 no such thing existed. It's not like you can really time a combo or something when you bounce them off the ground or something without doing a heat action. This wasn't a deal breaker, just annoying and you get used to it.

Otherwise, I enjoyed it and loved the fact they brought back some stuff from 0 and Kiwami, like the Cabaret Club.

Story is great, and Kiwami 2 features a second short campaign for Majima that ends in some closure for those who played the prequel to the series Yakuza 0.

Combat wise... I wasn't feeling it. Its alright but it is a bit ragdolly. I much preferred 0 and kiwami engine combat. Theres a neat upgrade you can get after beating the optional super boss that lets you reset durability for weapons just by swapping them around, no more repair visits needed.

Inventory is much better. You can only carry 10 of any item but you can now store a warehouse of items on you. The gear and weapons have their own separate inventories, that are limited like the older inventory systems. You also can only sell and repair items that are in your actual inventory, the game won't let you fix things that are stored like in Kiwami.

The minigames are alright, though the UFO Catcher feels somehow worse, some machines don't even get a side view. They changed baseball, instead of just aiming where you want the ball to go and guesstimating the timing to hit, theres now a grid you need to line up your cursor with. As a result baseball feels much harder, until you unlock the serene bat anyway, gives you a giant cursor and makes it piss easy. Darts is MUCH easier, all randomness has been removed!

Storywise, it's no Yakuza 0 but it still has that good ol' hard boiled Yakuza story. Unfortunately most of the sidequest are subpar (although given it is a somewhat faithful remake of a PS2 game, this is to be expected). Finishing all of the sidequests might be tedious but some of them are still fun and well worth your time. 

As for the gameplay, the combat here is much more fluid than Yakuza 0, or maybe any Yakuza games with older engines. However, Heat Actions are not as over the top as what I initially expected (I think it's because the game still uses lots of Heat Actions from the original Yakuza 2). Aside from Heat Actions, this game's combat is a definite improvement compared to previous titles, it feels more responsive and the animation flows better.  Instead of buying skills using your money, this game uses experience system. You will get experiences mostly from eating at restaurant. This can get boring after a while but it also manage to make you try lots of foods to figure out which can give you most exp.

The Combat is not as good as yakuza 0/ kiwami, however it is improved over Yakzua 6 that uses the same engine, moves feel faster and there is a satisfying weight to heavy strikes and overall combat. This is however weighted down by the physics engine that has unreasonable ragdoll physics with annoying and bulky stumble/ topple over mechanics, just doesn't feel as great as it could be.

It picks off one year after 1/Kiwami 1 and quickly throws the player right in the action. The story can be a bit predictable when some characters and plot points are set, but there is enough drama, action and twists to keep you interested.
The game uses a better engine than Kiwami 1 and 0, making the game have far more detail, but also needing a better spec to run it.

The combat flow is far better than 0 and Kiwami, but the style switch system didnt return, which is a massive loss for me.
Kiryu now uses a mix of all his styles, with a few hints of Dragon and Beast when using the Super mode.
While really fun, it can get a bit repetitive to do the same moves over and over. This wouldnt be a problem if you could unlock new moves or change them up, but sadly most upgrades are related to increasing damage, using some heat actions or boosting stats.

That said, the upgrade system is NIGHTMARE. Gone is the universal xp from Kiwami (or the money system from 0). Now you have FIVE different xp types, where most skills need two or three of each type to be purchased.
Apparently, Kiryu forgot most of his moves in just one year between the games, along how to use Kali sticks and tonfas. While it makes sense for the gameplay, most skills arent that broken to have at the start of the game, Tiger Drop isnt the insane instakill that it was on 0/Kiwami.
It wouldnt be a problem since you get quite a lot of xp just playing, fighting and eating, but lots of skills (and good ones) are locked behind grind (like baseball) and insane hard challenges (All legendary Bouncer missions).
Not only that, even after you unlock the skill, you still have to purchase it.

Kiwami 2 is still the completionist hell like every other Yakuza game is, so you still have most minigames from previous games, but excluding a few like Bowling, Dancing and Billards, which is also a great downside.
Batting is changed once again and its quite easier than the previous games, but that is ""balanced"" by having to play 30-ish games in the hardest difficulty to get the skill unlocks. Darts is also better to play without the weird ""precision"" from the previous games.
Japanese card and board games are still there (like Koi Koi and Shogi) and there is an entire subquest related to Mahjong.
Virtua Fighter 2 and Virtual On are the Sega arcade games, but the AI is arcade hard.
Karaoke is still here, although Kiryu doesnt sings Bakamitai and Majima doesnt sings 24-Hour Cinderella on this one.

Other Minigames include the return of the Cabaret Club, with the return of some familiar characters. Its exactly the same as the one in 0, but with worse music in my opinion.
The other minigame is the Clan Creator missions, which is a simple RTS/Tower Defense game related to Majima. Its really boring and the story is pretty much the same as the Real State missions from 0.
They are not really worth doing aside for more money, a bit of unrelated story and gameplay, but the Clan Creator missions are required to unlock a new Coliseum tournament, which is required to unlock a skill.

Talking about money, the most you use it is to buy some weapons so you can sell them right back. One of the vendors (the fat weapon manic guy) sells more stuff the more weapons and armor you sell to him, but the game never tells you that.

The game also includes the Majima Saga, which is a massive lost opportunity. Its REALLY short, less than 1 hour (unless you spend time to defeat some random thugs and gather money to donate to Kiryu for the side mission) and Majima cant learn any new skills or boost stats. 
He is the one that feels the most impact of not having the extra styles, as his fighting moves are really limited and not as good as his unique moves from 0.
The story is about what happened to his family between the end of 1 and the start of 2. While pretty much no characters matter for the story of 2 AT ALL, there is a really nice closure for one character, which makes playing it worth it.

In terms of graphics in mostly improve with slightly worse fighting system compare to Yakuza 0
Mostly this game consist more of plot twist and designed for single player
I've been playing this game for a while during WFH time, which make me speed up the main story

To be honest their graphics improve significantly with very few loading screen and better camera angle.
Their fight is quite dumb everything like made from metal scrap. It is bad and there no more 3 or 4 fighting style like Yakuza 0.

Does it worth your money? [b] Yes, it is worth you money. [/b] .
No need to wait for discount for this game.

Their money harder to gain compare to Yakuza 0 yet mostly all the items or goods are way cheaper compare to Yakuza 0.
[strike] Do not forget the Hostess minigame and do not forget all the platinum hostess are based on JAV idol except duo Yuki :)  [/strike]
You do not need huge chunk of money to upgrade your skill. Yet you need 5 currency (experiences) divided into 5 color : Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, and Violet. Do not forget to eat in order to get additional experiences. 
Different food = different result.

Their main story maybe not as strong as Yakuza 0.
Yet, there are some good story especially during Majima Saga
[spoiler] Yes, Majima met Makoto again in this storyline. This is one of the best moment in game [/spoiler]


Overall, It is Yakuza game with huge storyline and plot twist. With much more easier enemy compare to Yakuza 0.

The game has a ""mini-games"" which are things that yakuza usually do in their daily life, and so it makes the game really realistic about yakuza ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). So if you bought the game, you just have to play all the mini games to experience what's it like to be a real yakuza........

inside the game you will stumble upon many ""sub-story"" which mostly brings you to do yakuza-like things.

a boxer can challenge you to a match since you are popular in boxing. The boxer will use fist to try to destroy you while you can use guns and they will actually survived to a cut scene... pew pew

In just about every way possible it improves upon what was established from the game it's a remake of. Yakuza 2 is a perfect fit for the Dragon Engine and it's combat engine. The game doesn't just stay consistent to its source material, it changes up a few segments to keep veteran players on their feet or help streamline some of the clunkier elements of the original game (e.g. the mandatory Shogi from Yakuza 2 being thankfully removed and that segment being completely revamped in Kiwami 2). 

Mini Games from the original are ultimately kept mostly in tact, with Mini Golf notably being just as enjoyable as it was in the original game. That said, some noteworthy side content from the original isn't present in Kiwami 2 (notably Host Club Adam, although it's location is still there). Kiwami 2 instead condenses that club along with several others that are now missing into a single Hostess Club you can manage which acts as a sequel, both in narrative and in terms of gameplay, to Club Sunshine from Yakuza 0. I see this as a positive and a negative: While managing Four Shine is fun and a great way to earn Yen while dealing with completion, and the new and familiar faces from 0 have an enjoyable story line, I wish the clubs from the original game could've gotten the same love. On top of that Four Shine's forced inclusion into the main story is tedious and leaves a bad first impression for whats to come, especially to someone looking for a pure Yakuza 2 experience.

Equally conflicting is Kiwami 2's other major mini game attraction: The Clan Creator. Just like Four Shine, The Clan Creator leaves an immediate bad impression by forcing itself sloppily into a somewhat arbitrary part of the main story. Unlike Four Shine, the rewards for doing the Clan Creator are middling and it isn't worth bothering with outside of the time you're forced to play it if you don't care about completion at all, even if you're a fan of Majima.

Aside from those two big new additions, this game almost exclusively draws from Yakuza 2. The Main Story is based on the original Yakuza 2 which is, in my opinion, the best main story in any of these games. For Yakuza 2 alone the development team at Sega's Entertainment Division brought a japanese crime novelist named Hase Seishū in to write for the game and his unique writing style absolutely bleeds through this game and Yakuza 2's script. This is a Yakuza game whose main story takes itself far more seriously than usual. The stakes seem grander, the new characters more cold and cunning, or even outright vile at times and the story just manages to enrapture you with constantly developing plot points. Yakuza 2 has been critisized of having too many narrative points going on at once, but for the most part I feel that just makes repeat playthroughs even more enjoyable: Yakuza 2 and Kiwami 2's story is a well cooked steak dinner that will leave you chewing for a long time, but every bite is even more delicious than the last. There are some low points to the story however, notably the chapters involving the Colors Gangs and Takashi aren't so great (their appearances made even more baffling due to the fact that their stories seemed over with in Yakuza 1/Kiwami 1) but overall the good parts of this games story FAR outweigh any negatives.. The Sub Stories work from the same script as the original, with the added benefit of updated graphics and unique camera work which give what are some of the quirkiest sub stories in the series even more personality. The Music is entirely based on the original excluding hub world themes like what you'd hear inside restaurants which are ambient versions of now series staple songs like Baka Mitai that manages to sell the idea of whatever establishment you happen to be partaking in effortlessly. In general, you can tell a lot of love and care went into getting the games soundscape perfect, and it shows. Another thing that obviously had a lot of care put into it was the games visuals. Yakuza 6 was already a showcase of just how beautiful and accurate to life the modern Yakuza games could be with highly detailed cities and the ability to seamlessly go between buildings and the world outside, and this game goes further with that. Kiwami 2 lovingly recreating areas from Yakuza 2 down to little insignificant details, and even some details that would later be added to Kamurocho (such as the underground and shopping center by the coin lockers being present) and certain locations that 0 added to Sotenbori.

In summary, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is what every remake should strive to be: A direct improvement on the original. It doesn't invalidate Yakuza 2, but it simply improves upon it in almost every way possible. There are a few rough patches (namely Four Shine, The Clan Creator and their forced story inclusion) but they don't detract from the overall experience and are quickly forgiven. The effort that was put into making Kamurocho and Sotenbori as convincing as possible makes Kiwami 2 extremely easy to get entrapped by. It's one of those games that pulls you in to it's world and makes you forget you're playing a video game. Yakuza Kiwami 2 is easily my favorite Yakuza game, a title that previously belonged to the game it's a remake of.

Amazing game. Gone through for the 100% on my first play-through and it has been fun. 
Absolutely love the Yakuza games. Taken me 84 hours to get all but Mahjong done. All the Yakuza games are worth the money. So much content (especially for 100%) and a great story.

[u]Pros:[/u]

- Yakuza Kiwami 2 has got a far better story than Kiwami but on-par if not then below Yakuza 0.

- I personally love the Dragon Engine but also miss the varied fighting styles. 

- The music is great but nothing compared to Yakuza 0. 

- Fun as hell Mini-games like Majima Construction, Toylets, Virtua Fighter, Darts, Poker and Blackjack.

[u]Cons:[/u]

- Repetitive fight music and most bosses don't have their own theme.

- Way too many Bouncer Missions

- Mahjong Competitions

-----------------------------------------------------------------

[spoiler] I love Majima. One of my favourite characters in the franchise. But Sega did him dirty by making his story that short and rushing his side of the story to why he left the Tojo Clan. They at least could have had 6 Chapters instead of 3 and maybe added some basic skills to upgrade along with a few sub-stories for completionists. [/spoiler]

[u]Just some advice:[/u]
Play the game on Hard straight from the start if you want a balanced challenge. Same goes for Y0 and Kiwami. Normal mode is way too easy and thus I would say go straight into the game with Hard difficulty like I did.

[u]Just to point out for 100% players:[/u]
Some annoying things about this game though is how there are so many bouncer missions and all of them besides the 3 last Legends are really easy. And f*cking Mahjong. I played it in Y0 and this. Many, many , many hours spent playing that bloody minigame and yet still I cannot understand it. Even if I did, why so many Mahjong Completion quests instead of more Shogi, Koi-Koi, Poker, Blackjack or Oicho-Kabu.
