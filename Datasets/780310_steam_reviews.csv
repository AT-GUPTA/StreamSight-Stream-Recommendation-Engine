Build a base, defend it, find materials and upgrade.

Unlike other games of this type, you are doing less production of materials and more exploration of minerals.
Gathering these minerals allows you to research your next upgrades, be it weapons, buildings or utility, and its actually very fun, but you do hit a bit of a repeat-loop after a while, especially when going to other sides of the planet to find the next new mineral that isn't part of the base set.

So, when you first start the game you land in zone 1, this holds all the base minerals you need, when you have reached a certain upgrade point you are then allowed to move to zone 2 to find the new mineral you need.
In zone 2 (and forwards) the loop is as follows: Spawn, Explore map using radar (which is on cooldown) go to Points of interest marked with a ""?"", use your Scanner to find hidden things, Destroy nests to get a chance of unique items/base cosmetics, rince and repeat for all zones, it does get a bit tedious, its a cycle i couldve done without and maybe there is a way, but this is basically how my playthrough went.

I did notice on maybe the last 2 hours that you could cultivate things, but i had no idea how to do that at first (if there was a tutorial for it, i missed it), i pretty much accidentally clicked the center button of a cultivator building and this massive list of plants showed up that allows you to litterary make farms, kinda wish i discovered that earlier in the game, but ill remember it for the next time i play the game, because its absolutely worth a revisit.

I think ill leave it at that, so my enjoyment score for this game is a solid 86%.

Its very fun to run around the maps with your rig, either cutting down trees or fight monsters, its also fun to build a base and design it for defenses, i also like the slow climb in horde attack difficulty.
The last couple of attacks my base was still pretty much level 1 cause i had forgotten to go back to my base in search of minerals, so when i finally did, i almost lost to 50 boulder-walking-dudes that just demolished all my little towers.

This game is stable unlike any other games. It just doesn't crash. It works. I saw some games crashing even they are 2D, made with major engines like Unity, Unreal, etc. And I cannot be silent about Diablo IV, MW III, they were nightmares and headaches.
I'm telling that those kinds of games are crashing like Hell, often, not just sometimes.
Actually Diablo IV was better than its released version. It just had to stay as an early access.
It's hard to see normal, standard, sane games these days. So many games are crashing, they don't work with controllers, they've got errors, bugs, faults, and they are too many, and they got paid, they keep selling. Oh, how on earth they get money with those products with so many errors!
Even NVIDIA's RTX 4090 flickers, blinks, especially with G-Sync.
Yes, it's a future we dreamed about yesterday, but is it really better than before? Cutting-edge techs, better looking, but they've got so many bugs, errors, faults than before. And it causes crashes. They cost more, they provide more errors. Is this common sense? Is this sane?
Some people said ""They are blinded, they are crazy about money."" I didn't agree, but now I agree, because I can see this, I saw.
Oh, RTX 4090 flickered again. Gotta turn off that stupid G-Sync again.
Oh, I bought ultimate editions and I haven't played Diablo IV, MW III for long time. It's OK, there are plenty of other games like 'The Riftbreaker', they don't give headaches, they don't waste players' life, time, energy, they don't provide many errors, they can be enjoyed, playable, they don't hurt, harm.",1634422358,1708622558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The thing is, only the first wave on any difficulty is hard. Once you get past it the rest of the game is extremely repetitive. Even if you make it as hard as possible its an EXTREMELY easy game. You have to download mods to make it have any sense of difficulty. Even just placing one of every tower behind a single wall is enough to defend against everything. 

Every wave I've seen with the DLC cannot even touch me. The DLC does have something in it that is very unbalanced however if you play with max damage taken. It makes it very tedious and anti-fun as i've seen my mech be one shot during a forced un-skippable cut scene. 

There is just no balance. The fact that you get so many outposts is broken. They keep adding in more outposts with the DLC's but it just makes you stronger then you need to be with near infinite resources. Once you get past the first wave resources stop being an issue. Nothing is an issue after the first wave, and that's only hard because you cannot research strong enough stuff yet till the first HQ upgrade.

The game freezes every 5 or so minutes and i think its because there's too much going on, which is really fucking bad for a tech game. It should be expected that the optimization is caught up to the point you can play without it freezing so much. Maybe I'm playing weird but i don't think its super duper odd to have 50 solar panels on your base?
The worst freeze I had was when i was in the middle of a swarm and I froze for a solid 5 minutes. I had a timer up. I know its five minutes.
And before anyone says its my pc thats a potato, my pc is pretty good, actually. 0 problems doing anything else. And this game isn't even using all my processing power, its just freezing because it feels like it or something?
I cant say much more because i haven't really progressed that far because whenever i sit down to play the first thought on my mind isnt ""lets play riftbreakers!!""

___Conclusion___
Cool mix of strategy, tower defense and top down shooter. For me it's a great game with a cool story, nice graphics and interesting game mechanics.
In my opinion, the combination of different buildings and worlds is very creative and exciting. There is a lot to explore (different areas, buildings, etc.) and to learn, and fighting with monsters and ""giant"" enemies is also a lot of fun. Campaign and survival mode are both made varied and exciting. 
I would recommend this game to anyone and would buy it again and again!
For me one of the best games out there!


___for DLC (Metal Terror):___
The first dlc ""metal terror"" brings new maps, new creatures, new weapons and new buildings. 
The maps are beautiful and rich with new resources, the enemies are beautifully designed and the weapons are fun and do a lot of damage! Many new types of plants through which planting to obtain resources takes on a new importance in the game, which is a very good thing in my opinion. This makes the game mechanics much more dynamic and varied! 
Clear purchase recommendation! I really enjoyed it to play! :)


___for DLC2 (Into the Dark):___
The DLC is played in a cave system.
There are new weapons, collecting tools and a few new buildings. Personally, I don't think the DLC is bad, but I think the content in the campaign mode is too short.
The worlds in forests or ""not in a cave"" are much more appealing and beautiful for me but ok, that's a matter of taste in the end.

In addition, you can or have to dig through walls in the cave system to uncover resources or paths, I don't really like this mechanic and in my opinion it is also unnecessary and some enemies can shoot through these walls (but some of our weapons, same), others blow them up, which unfortunately left me with an ""unfinished"" impression for the first time in this game.

Overall, I don't think the second DLC is bad, the world is beautifully designed, there are useful new buildings and weapons, the new map is beautifully designed, the new enemies are varied and at all cool and strong, I had fun playing it.

However, I think the main game and the first DLC were significantly stronger, so I would only recommend the second DLC(""Into the Dark"") in particular if you have already played the game for a while and would like more content.",1655249680,1705891459,True,9,0,0.559862196445465088,0,True,False,False

Coming out of 2024 and all the amazing RPGs that came out last year this RTS action RPG is a great refresher.  There are TONS of towers, weapons and mods to equip.  

The thing I love the most is that this is a survival game you can play at your own pace! You are not rushed by objectives, or timers that you have to rush to beat.  It warns you when you are about to advance and make the game harder so if you aren't ready, gather more resources and build till you're ready.  

Also the QoL features are wonderful with my OCD lol.  You have the tools to easily make the most beautiful base you could ever dream of with a simple click and drag.  An intense wave destroyed half of your sector? Two clicks and everything is rebuilt, as long as you have the resources of course, a strong economy is key in these games.

Unfortunately there's a few issues that chip away at the game's overall feel and fun factor (most inconsequential).
The dialogue at some points between the characters drags on much longer than it should.
At points there are some minor dialogue inconsistencies between the audio and the UI.
Some mechanics/keybinds are not provided in tutorials and are not explained. (Google quickly beomces your friend, I could also just be exceedingly stupid)

Apart from that, the Story as it is presented is easy to follow and you are able to continue at your own pace.
The weapons and mods systems are easy to understand and use.
Combat is fun and movement is very responsive. 
Graphics are very impressive for what this title is.

All in all, a fun experience with a great deal of replayability.

The main issue I have is that I don't understand the core gameplay loop. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing to achieve the quest goal in front of me. Should I turtle and passively gain resources? Go stand on a carbonium node and mine manually until I have enough? Should I be running afield with the scanner to gather items? There's a lot of confusion as to what is actually important and that makes you end up waiting around for research to finish and resources to accumulate because you don't know what else to do.

Combat, unfortunately, is mostly a punishment. Big waves come and wear down your base such that the resources you saved get wasted on rebuilding and repair. You gain resources from drops, but not enough, and it doesn't feel rewarding. Something as simple as adding an experience bar would go a long way to solving this. It could add a separate development for the player, maybe a pilot talent tree or bonus stats, or it could do something less grandiose like grant a burst of research points or something of the like. 

I like this game, but I want to like it more than I do and I can't.

The addition of the player controlling a mech to interact with the environment is a stroke of genius over other base defence games, where you simply control everything from a top down view without having a presence in the world.

It's not without it's faults. Some bright spark tried to shoehorn in a female protagonist and I suspect a significant chunk of the install size is the voice files of her and the robot suit's constant inane, pointless, cringe-worthy, and irrelevant chatter. Fortunately though you can just move the dialogue volume slider to zero and completely forget about them, it has no effect whatsoever on gameplay. It's also worth noting though unlike other games you're not forced to sit through cut scenes or wait for dialogue. You can just play the game uninterrupted.

There is also the very slimy business practice of in-game ads for their shovelled out mid-tier DLC, and then altering the base game so if you want to fully complete it you have to buy them. One example is there is a game mechanic where you scan flora and fauna to increase familiarity, but unless you buy the DLC you'll forever have ??? symbols cluttering up the discovery window. Same with research trees: the base game research tree has unobtainable items in it endlessly taunting you with ??? symbols....unless you buy the DLC.

I really like the freedom of base building, as well as the extensive research tree. The top-down shooter aspect is simple and highly dependent on what weapons you've researched and built, and building resource outposts for special resources feels completely worth it. 
Even after so many hours and reaching the main storyline's 'ending' (sorta?), it felt too short, and left me wanting more. 
Part of that is a poor storyline, a preachy and prissy hypocrite of a main character, and a side character that I don't actually care for. Honestly, the storytelling is the worst part of this otherwise awesome game. I agree that it needs that story, and the concept of the story itself is good, but whoever wrote it flopped. 
I mean, for goodness sake, even a shallow wannabe like Cygnus Enterprises at least allows you to create your own character, complete with voiceover in cutscenes. Do we really need to put up with that Ashley? I get that pre-set characters with a rich background has advantages, but at least give us options, like Beyond Contact. 
Despite its MC, I'd still recommend this game based on the base-building, research, mech outfit and top-down shooter aspects. Also, I appreciate the devs interaction with players and their updates and feedback. Still having fingers crossed for multiplayer, even though it's too late since I already finished the game. But hey, there's basically endless potential here, and once it's grown enough, I might just go for another round.

I like the music too.
Controlling the mech feels weird at the beginning because it moves with wasd keys relative to the map bug faces the direction of the mouse. But I got used to it. Possibly is better for controller players too. The mouse cursor is not always easy to notice but I can live with that.

There is one issue which is really frustrating.
When the base is under attack, in the heat of battle, I need to repair buildings, towers and walls. This is easily done by pressing 'R'. The problem is that this switches to a ""build mode"" which is 2 levels deep and requires pressing right click twice to close it.
The right mouse button is by default mapped to the right hand weapon. Has nothing to do with closing the build menu but the developers noticed that this is necessary and hard coded the build mode closing action to the same event, but only step by step, so it needs 2 presses in this case. I cannot get used to press twice. However this makes me sometime use the RMB even if the build menu is already closed and I just throw a nuclear missile, wasting valuable ammo.

Often I press it only once because that's how toggle works in other games and I keep walking through enemies without being able to attack them, as the build mode is still active.
It is also possible to close the build menu with LCTRL or ESC but feels unpractical.
I found no way to configure the keys in a better way and I also played 104 hours and I am partially used to these bindings.

Another complaint I have is that mining will collect resources until the storage is 100% full. If I want to reconfigure base fast before being attacked, I need to sell buildings first (vulnerable resource collectors outside the base) and build something else (defense towers). But storage is most often always full and I lose resources. There should be a way to configure some storage buildings to function as temporary overflow buffer, accepting resources only when deconstructing.

Base management could be improved too. If I want to turn off resource collection, the mech has to move to each factrory.
I have not tried yet to micro manage this, especially that moving to other colonies requires loading the map and it takes time.
Recognizing buildings is possible only if I enter in build mode.
Finding the tower I want to build fast is not easy with the current system. Possibly the menu is optimized for controller people. And there is no search option!
Sometime I want to check what weaknesses some creatures I just killed have but one must recognize the creatures before he kills them. 
Some maps have to much scanning and getting the basic information takes time.
I would like to have a zoom in function too and ability to see what is happening in a different area of the map, not only around the mech.

I found some minor bugs too.
The steam forum should have subforums for bug reports and suggestions, as I prefer to post there instead of joining their discord server or creating topics in the main discussion area.

Regarding gameplay balancing.
Seems to be good for the normal difficulty level.
On hard mode I was able to defend against the the first strong attack too after upgrading the headquarters without losing defense towers.
Issues can happen when visiting maps after long time, where the base is not upgraded. But those can be solved too if the player has a stash of resources, to upgrade the base fast. I like that the resources are shared between colonies.

I tried the hardcore mode too but does not seem to work after restarting and loading the game. The mech is created again.
Now that I check all menus, I see that the game has an integrated bug report feature which I missed before.
There is also mod support but I didn't used any yet.",1704266580,1704266580,False,11,0,0.604430735111236572,1,True,False,False

2023 Still no Co-op
---------------------------
2 years later !!! From thumbs up to thumbs down
I bought 2 DLCs and still no premium co-op feature

Now they will release a 3rd DLC
guess they don't have time to program a feature they did promise to there fans
Lucky for us they did explain in 4000 words the evolution of co-op :)
That they are working on  for 2 year already 

but they did have time to release 3 DLCs of content 
well its the same content you only look at a different biome and have a other monsters to fight

Zero new mechanics zero new weapons unless you mod everything
And lucky for us the game has some awesome Modders that make more progress in 1 month 
then Rift-breaker makes in a year 

NICE !!! won't buy any other DLC or any Game from EXOR Studios after this ordeal 
Until we get our Co-op and i can finally play with my friends

Lucky for us co-op freaks 2024 has many games in this exact genre coming so I am happy that I can let go of this game - until co-op is finally in",1636647059,1703659583,False,0,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Great fun game. This is a ""small"" game in the sense that the mechanics are all pretty simple, don't expect Factorio this is more like a very advance tower defense game. It's great for what it is, it's a bit more chill than Facotorio but suffers from similar issues specially around exploration which can be tedious and time consuming. Overall I would recommend this games if you are looking some something to smash a bunch of monster with very satisfying weapons.

Original review:

It looks like there is a common bug that causes the game to be unable to save: https://www.reddit.com/r/theriftbreaker/comments/rc7sgt/ive_been_getting_this_error_a_few_times_now/

In that current state I wouldn't recommend, I've lost progress because this bug happened a while in my first session, went away after restart, the second session was ok and now 3rd session it started doing it after 30 minutes or so and now it just won't save no mater what I do.

Update: I actually found a fix to this first problem only to run into a different saver error 30 hrs later as was on the edge of finishing the campaign (""The file exists.""): https://www.reddit.com/r/theriftbreaker/comments/ria5ji/the_game_cant_save_part_2/

This game is alright, it's pretty shallow but so don't expect anything close to Factorio. The UI can be a bit confusing like with what buildings are doing for instance, you can click on a factory building but there is no ""progress bar or anything like that"". With that being said, it's very pretty even though the towers/wall look kinda lame. The action is lot more fun than factorio though.

No other TD resource management game comes close in my opinion. The only thing I'd say could have been done better or perhaps fixed is a few tweaks to quality of life, such as being able to shift drag a straight line or create a box made of walls with a cmd drag.

also some items in the game are not very intuitive at all. whilst prepping the big rift, I was scratching my head as to why I couldn't fill the supercharged plasma and water needs, finally figured out I had to buffer it with storage tanks before hand, made me think AH I could have applied that to so many other items earlier to make my life easier, yet I still beat it not knowing how fluid buffer and storage worked.

Also didn't have to use very many late game turrets other then the sentry and artillery lvl 3 to wipe waves, other turrets kinda obsolete or not necessary although there are many types.

::Synopsis::

The game is solid. It does the tower defense base building rts style hoard game justice. The art is beautiful and feels so much smoother than games like factorio. Don't get me wrong factorio is a great game but this feels smoother.

At any rate the story is - well it exists. The big draw is map warping through rifts and exploring large chunks of the planet through rifts. The game supports modding unless you do choose to run experimental. 

Something with large hoard absolutely tanks fps. CPU or GPU ... don't seem to be hit at least with Ryzen 7 3800x and Nvidia RTX 2060 12GB with 32GB In fact it seems to take less resources.

12-19-2023

This game is great ignore people who complain about buying a game for a feature that does not exist people like that are lacking brain cells. At any rate even if coop does not come out the game is great and I spent a wonderful many hours playing it. The studio is very transparent like its refreshing especially since it feels AAA without being AAA If you enjoy micro management base building tower defense high paced combat with modding and a refreshingly helpful community get this game!

Original thoughts 6-6-2022

::More Lost Potential::

For now I a cannot recommend this game at all. It is definitely not a release ready title. The key issue is it lacks performance. At first everything seems fine and the game has polish but I swear to god the developers have no interest in the slightest to focus fixes with fps drops. You will greatly loose fps later game and if you look at task manager not only does the game not try and use more power to compensate but it also doesn't give you the ability to force it to use your pcs power.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sad part is like 'The Binding of Isaac' the game is great but is marred by terrible optimization choices. I noticed a terrible trend with LUA based x64 bit games and x32 bit games and honestly it sickens me. What is the point in having a powerful rig if the game you make only uses 2% of the power but suffers performance drop? That is just purely stupid. This game is great if you like power-point presentation once you get to a certain point. This is a x64 game but acts entirely like a x86 game it does not seem to utilize parallel processing and also seems to never want to use more than 4096MB of ram.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This whole game is a time sink in the right way but after a certain point it just drops to nothing in performance. I have tried stable exp survival campaign and it just suffers this issue. I tried raising priority but it appears this issues is in the bones of the game. Like all ******* lua based games it just does not cleanup things well causing a kind of permanent memory leak. I wish that this had been made solely in unreal engine because then at least I could force it to optimize better. Its a shame because this game really shows promise.

Perfect graphics, nice destructible environment, nice base building with tower defense and thousands of enemies per wave like in games THEY ARE BILLIONS etc with options to make your own custom difficulty, absolutely perfect.

But .. this game is about management and looting. Yet managing the loot is none existing.
You have tiers of loot .. white, blue, purple and red .. basically common, rare, epic, legendary.
You have limited inventory and you are allowed to delete item one by one only .. try deleting hundreds of items one by one to make a space.

Your craft menu has the same problem.
The more you research, the more you can craft .. but after a while your menu is ..
Craft item 1 in white
Craft item 1 in blue etc .. 
Craft item 10 in white
Craft item 10 in blue etc .. 
Craft item 20 in white 
Craft item 20 in blue etc 

There is no filter .. instead of just showing one the item and then selecting what quality you want, you see all of them all the time and when you want something, you scroll thru hundreds of items and when you craft something, menu jumps back to start so you have to scroll down again .. absolute nonsense.

You cannot hide the lower tiers .. you cannot trash all inventory based on the tiers .. you cannot combine the lower tiers into hier tiers .. you cannot drop it .. nothing. 
Just nothing .. absolutely no options whatsoever .. except for the click by click one by one. You cannot even confirm the message with enter, space. Absolutely no way to speed it up. It will take you few hours .. and then there is another enemy wave attack in 2 minutes, another 10 000 enemies and your inventory is full again. Thats a no.

Adding an option to trash everything based on tier is easy .. i dont even need to get resources for it. I just want to get rid of it so I can use what i want and not scroll thru THOUSANDS of mods every single time i want one to use.
Also .. the mods are not even organized. You have the same mod for damage at the start of list and in a mid of the list, in the end .. its big mess.
Just wasting our time.

And I am not even using any extra mods to increase the drop chance. Its really bad and stupid.
This is a must update and for 4 years, still nothing.

UI needs to be fixed too.

However it seems that this company is taking the paradox route and starting to add things to their DLC that really should have just been in the base game. This is setting a commonality that i notice companies just continue to release unfinished games and then we just plug our banks in a pay for whatever butt tickle they have. Overall the game gets to be boring and repetitive. Mainly the AI isn't complex enough to make the game entertaining. Its got about 100 hours of fun play time till boredom strikes. Multiplayer wont help it will be the same thing just 2 people(so fancy). In this economy and how much the common people are hurting these days its sad to see yet another company trying to suck us dry for half ass content that really should have been an expectation ALREADY!

Partially because of the mods which were previously published on nexus and now can be installed right up from the steam workshop. Fairly vigorous  mod developers have already come up with a variety of modifications that will definitely enhance your game experience. Do not hesitate exploring the whole list of them and tweak the game the way you want it to be played. Nonetheless, the vanilla version delivers just fine. The combat, base-building, textures, interaction with objects, animations won't disappoint you, trust me.   
Also want to mention their discord community where you can receive DIRECT answer from the developer if you face any problem playing the game. ""Ordinary"" players will also gladly help you. 
Even though the DLCs might seem some kind of lacking in new content and variability, I'm sure we should appreciate EXOR Studios's effort. The guys never stop implementing new technologies as they master them themselves, provided that they are indeed a small indie-company with low budgets. Also, there's a CO-OP being developed and is said to come up in some time for FREE. It's definitely a sign of dedication, selflessness, and faith in your own product. In the world of today these aspects are quite rare to encounter and thus very much admired. 

P.S. Do not compare this game with Factorio. They are too different and their comparison is irrelevant. Try looking at this game as base-building Alien Shooter. Ingeneering in Factorio is advanced, in The Riftbreaker it just ""lies"" on the background. It is fairly primitive but complex enough to make you use your brain cells.

I think it is no longer fair, since the game has changed a lot. With official mod support and massive user interface overhauls the game is actually fun.

Oh boy - what a bad game design.
First: Shooting is fun. That's the only positive.

- Weird pacing
- Cheesy writing
- Messed up game balance
- Clunky user interface
- No replayability

I wish i could zoom out a little bit more, or tilt the camera a bit more, but that's almost it.
I have seen the latest progress note tho, that is causing the ''almost'' .
Please don't cut holes into the rock textures, to see at all times.
It is destroying the look. You do so many things better than others,
you don't need to look at, what others do, and copy it.
This is how every game became the same basically. And yours is kinda unique.
The world looks so nicely detailed, and cutting the textures,
for making them seethrough in some situations, destroys, how this world feels visually.
I WANT the rocks to block my sight, because that is natural.
I have to pick my spots to fight, where i see better then. There is no problem about that.
A better solution would be , making the camera be able to rotate, but stay top down view.

I guess you want it to stay a top down view game in general,
but also because displaying a whole world, all the way to a horizon,
would cost way more performance, plus textures of then way nearer objects,
would have to be a way higher resolution. 

Yeah , that's the 3 things i would ask for, a slider to just zoom in and out a little bit more.
A slider to tilt the camera just a little bit more, like,
a tat more angled, less top down, as an option.
And maybe , a horizontal rotation of the camera only, to keep it top down view.

The first is Co-op mode which I really wished that they have included on launch. They are currently working on it, and it seems that it is going to take them about 6 to 12 months. It makes me feels like that I have something I really really want to share and enjoy with my friends, but I cloud not. I have to wait for a year or half. I can’t promise that it will still have my attentions after that much time. This game would sell much more with co-op on launch. I myself would buy few extra copies just so that my friends could join me.

The other would be a true endless mode. I want to build a base and being able to travel to different biome while defending against waves of enemies that steady increasing its strength and amount. Without campaign missions but pure building and defending. The survival mode the game currently have does not cut it. It needs much more tuning and balancing for a true endless game to work. It also lacks the options for a lot of random events. Survival mode seems to be a big part of this game, but what I want is infinite survival not a few hour quick rush. I want to play this game in a ""Factorio"" kind of way. 

It is over all really nice game. Would come back if co-op and true endless mode was added. I will give this game a thumb up, but I am not fully satisfied. I would say that this game is overpriced without co-op and endless mode at $29.99..",1634708598,1701074272,True,33,2,0.733916044235229492,3,True,False,False

Least they can do is allow us to play the most recent version that did support Windows 7.

Absolute shame, these developers had promise. I guess it's too much to ask for another Wube Software.

Unprofessional conduct aside, some issues do exist still back when I played when the game had just launched on Geforce Now, now that I have a computer on the worst Windows able to also run it.

Issue 1: Game has click recognition issues, when I click to place a building, it will sometimes ignore the click, it usually does this when the game hard lags to autosave the game on day turnover and you click during this period, You guys need to fix this before implementing Co-op completely.

Issue 2: Volumetric Lightning makes the game borderline unreadable during night time because of unecessary lighting effects, this is fixed by disabling it.

Issue 3: I would like to zoom out 20% more without modding the game to allow it.

Wish 1: I want the experience of Campaign in having to build a Rift Gate and fully power it, without the time constraint of Survival or the campaign mission design of Campaign. So... basically a free play mode. Think AoE2 Skirmish.

Wish 2: I'd like a readability pass on the game's graphics. It looks good, but it doesn't play as well as it is pretty, unfortunately. Alot of unpathable terrain does not visually stand out from a lot of surrounding terrain and foliage.",1634829428,1700873989,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Okay so, the FIRST thing that comes to mind when I play this game is like ""What would it be like to fight the Beta war in Muv Luv."" some of you may get that haha, it totally reminds me of that!  Cross Promotion, talk to them devs!

The game is a twin stick shooter and base/defense builder.  Decent replayability.  Research seems long at first, but you'll be so distracted doing other things it's just a natural thing that passes.  Game does begin to slow down a bit on brutal mode just because of the sheer amount of mobs that will swarm your base.  Game is pretty balanced. 

I'm not even sure if I've ever run into a bug TBH.  I originally played this on the xbox app and bought it on steam to support the devs cause it was that good.

Game is totally worth the price of admission.  DLCs are pretty decent.  Dev's are still adding more content and multiplayer.  Great voice acting between the main and your mech suit.

There are mods that help change some of the aspects the game to help replay value (technically cheats, but in the sense that it makes the game more fun without you feeling you're just a big cheater!)

Edit: Still waiting on coop mode to play it again with a friend and damn is that taking a long long time.

The game itself is simple, set up a base, defend it, expand to other zones and repeat. Therein lies the problem. It is a rinse and repeat using different terrain and enemy challenges but its basically the same at the end of the day. The game itself has the flaw that it is simply rinse and repeat multiple times. Dig up a red resource or a yellow resource or a green resource in a new map. After 1 game, you have experienced all the game has to offer. Harder difficulties just mean more mobs that have higher hp pools. When you are basically playing a game of wack-a-mole and its damn near impossible to die unless you stand still, it just means you can run and gun and win without issue.

As for building up a base, well, I like doing mega bases, this game lags to high hell the bigger a base becomes. My idea to combat this was to create a small main base and then use the other zones to build mega bases that farm the resources but its slow going and to be honest, it gets really boring.

Scanning for resources underground or using a bio scanner are also just so insanely boring. Especially the bio-scanner. Like mousing over a tree for 5 seconds while holding a button in to get 1 scan and you just lose your mind cause its like 'do this an infinite amount of times still.'

However its a base building survival game that is fun the first game. I would say if you are interested, go for it, if you are on the fence, listen to your instincts and don't. 

As for proper cons.
The sound files seem to not always be properly done. So my robot sometimes just sounds like some guy with an accent.
Lag issues.

I only have a few complaints about the game; including minor ones like having no way to disassemble multiple mods at once or not having access to blueprints for layouts I already made - which would be ideal on higher difficulties. My only major complaint is the character we have to play as in campaign mode is insane and your robot calls you out on it. Your mechsuit has a personality and your character has her own - and they clash a LOT - but imagine Thunberg if she was nuking the seals while screaming ""LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!!!""

The Riftbreaker is insane amounts of fun.

[h1]Good:[/h1]
+ The game looks great. Vibrant colours, unique biomes, flashy lighting effects
+ Audio is well balanced and crispy. Alerts have distinct cues that are recognizable amidst the chaos of battle
+ Enemy variety is good. They've got over a dozen unique alien types and they all feel distinct. There's even boss-type enemies to contend with
+ There's voice acting in this game. I won't say it's stellar, but it's clear they put effort in here
+ Base building is mechanically deep, but simple to grasp. There's a lot of structures for you to build, and so far all of them are pretty useful. There's almost no ""useless"" or ""worthless"" structures that I'd avoid
+ Automation is stripped down, but still fun. You won't have complicated conveyor systems like in Factorio or Satisfactory, though liquids still require pipelines. Materials are automatically added to storage to help simplify the base building.
+ Customizable mech that holds up to 6 weapons, 8 equipment items, 4 upgrades, a movement skill, and unique paintjob
+ Weapons and turrets can be modded to tailor their performance to the situation
+ Lots of QoL features, like temporary portals that save your last jump site, or a repair tool that lets you instantly rebuild a destroyed section of your base
+ Lengthy campaign with tons of objectives to complete
+ Multiple biomes to hop around, each with their own unique hazards and enemy variants
+ Ground scanner to help you find hidden, buried treasures around each map
+ Huge research trees to go through, separated into buildings, mech and a hybrid tree for organic research
+ [b]Massive[/b] hordes. The game really does not hold back in the higher difficulties
+ The game slows itself down in order to preserve framerate during intense swarms. I like this system, though regrettably it may have to be removed when multiplayer comes out

[h1]Bad:[/h1]
- Crafted weapons come with randomized stats. I understand why they did this, I just think it's a poor design choice both mechanically and thematically. It's not like I'm crafting this using experimental magics or anything. It's a blueprint that I researched. Why would the results be worse than expected?

- Mods and upgrades are not very well explained. Nowhere is it stated that the element of a mod overwrites the weapon's base damage type. It is also not stated that the craftable upgrades come with 2 random mods each, so you have to craft them until you get the perfect one.

- Having dropped upgrade blueprints be random is kinda anti-fun. I'd rather just research all of them myself than have to grind horde after horde to get the exact elemental dash that I want.

- Scanning in this game is, horrible. It's my least favourite thing to do. The scanning by itself is fine, but the sheer numbers of scans you need to make on flora and fauna are insane. Scanning a creature takes about 2-3 seconds. Each group of creatures will contain 1 or 2 scannable ones, so you need to find about 70-80 groups of these creatures to max out research on just one enemy [b]variant[/b]. Of which there are multiple variants per enemy type. After you finish this obnoxious grind, you then get to do the same thing with [b]FLORA[/b]

- Multiplayer is on the backburner, since they're putting out DLC content first. I can understand this decision, I'm just not happy about it. I'm dying to play this with my mates.

[h1]Overall: 8/10[/h1]
The Riftbreaker is an awesome game with very few shortcomings. It's the perfect blend of automation, base building, ARPG and tower defence, with a great campaign to boot. There's little to no story in the game, which is fine since that's probably not why you're playing this, and that's one less thing to distract you from the intensity of defending your base from the xenos scum.

On the downside; the game can be fairly repetitive, especially when it comes to getting these new resources and new biomes. You have to go them several times, face its dangers as you roam about for objectives to scan or mine, then come back until you finally unlock the technology to make a permanent outpost.

The fully voiced story and banter between your character and the mech you use are engaging enough to keep you interested in the story.

The idea in terms of base build to play with energy and the minerals is cool. I dislike a little the reliance too much on energy and the need of big areas to make them work. Plus, when you play +7 hours minerals run out and you rely on energy for minerals. So, you need more space, for more enrgy, bla bla.

The game it's pretty cool, enemy variant is nice, turret also and also the resources you gather it's interesting.

I wold love to be able to zoom out a little more, specially on mid and endgame.

The only thing that i dislike is the research mechanic. It's a little too annoying, slow and the tree is ISANELY huge. 
Maybe you can combine all turrets in one, all resources in one and so on. And you just limit the materials on each map so we don't have insanely strong turrets on early game.


1 suggestion to add: players could force a swarm, or something like, to gather materials. Like, i plant a drill on a specific place, get like 1k,2k of materials and there's a wave of enemies.

So, you let me put the drill, let me build on that area and then a swarm comes. Or, for example less materials for a drill inside my base, anything works in that matter.

I dislike campaings on any game, so no comment there.

However since purchasing the expansions and completing the game again I feel there is more hope. The game is still changing and that I believe gives it hope. Like many RPGs you build a base, gather resources, and attempt to stem the tide of varying aliens intent on destroying your base and you. Whether playing Brutal or Easy modes the game is easily beatable with proper planning. Survival adds another layer of challenge to the game and in my opinion is the only real challenge in the game. I'm hopeful in the future the creators will find more ways to make the game have a better replay value. But at this time I'm sad to say that is what it truly lacks.

Overall look and feel: very-lite-Factorio-inspired factory building without micromanagement, focused on tower defense (very nice tower defense btw), with some minor aspects of Diablo-combat (especially in the first hours on the map). 
Nice Graphics, very good flow, and good addictivity. Good OST and sounds.

The campaign is good, but pretty easy and unbalanced in some points. I would expect ""much harder experience on Hard"".

So the campaign is more of a tutorial that takes time for many game mechanics (but not for all mechanics!).


Small drawback for me: the game is designed for short 1-3 hour sessions, and there is no place for 500-hour runs. But this is only my taste, I fully appreciate the decisions of game designers. Long runs without micromanagement would be very unpleasant and unbalanced. The research also seems somehow pointless for 1 and 2 hour sessions, it is more for 3 hours and unlimited game.

I would wish some long-term goals on the endless map with campaign-like outposts in the survival without timer.

Edit; 8-06-22, the game appears to be fixed. Zero game breaking bugs. Reviewing this game has been a roller coaster for me. Went from very fun to game breaking bugs and back again. At this time, it's well worth the buy. The DLC ""Metal Terror"" for 9$ is a great price and adds a new fun element/maps/buildings.

[strike] SUPER EDIT (game's fixed); There're so many bugs, skip this game for at least a year. Devs have some work to do... Initially enjoyed the game, but as the bugs set in my experience became negative. Farms reset every time you use their debuger. Powerlines that stay highlighted even after building them. Powerlines that refuse to connect to buildings. Buildings read as if they have power when they have none. Buildings that can't be deleted without the debugger. Not worth a buy in my opinion. [/strike]


[b] INITIAL REVIEW [/b]

For 30$, this is a good game. The story is not engaging, and the gameplay is only so-so. You run around destroying and building. A good time waster and nothing more.

Pros; 
- Graphics are good
- You can fill up a map with buildings without slowing down your PC
- Gameplay is the only reason you should play

Cons;
- Story is not engaging
- There's very little direction or incentive to progress in the game. Frankly, once you do it doesn't get better and is a bit tedious.
- After 30 hours I'm invincible and have no idea how mods nor the perk tree works.
- There seems to be 2 different maps; jungle and desert. Nothing else, map variety is poor.

I could hate more on this game, but I had lots of fun. I recommend this time waster.


[b] Edit; 8/20/22 [/b]
At this point I'm just using this section for notes on things I would've liked to see. Buy the game, it's a good game.

- Announcements are made about high winds blowing loose objects away. But no loose objects blows away, it's merely an announcement notifying extra energy available via wind turbines.

lets just straight to cons
- this game has so much bugs that are annoying and break the gameplay immersion
- this game is very not optimized and very laggy when theres to much active objects in map (turrents, drones, aliens, huge floating factory numbers specially across outposts), and will very likely to appear glitches and bugs that completely break your progression
- the gameplay is messy and cringe, like the devs not even know what they're doing and what to achieve with their product
- they follow most indie developers common mistake (buggy game, but release more contents that adding even more bugs, for a sake of ""consumer buy rate""). no one want to buy an empty food box or plastic toy foods when they're hungry
- when they first release riftbreaker, this game is already ""full game"", to this day, the game condition is like an early access game, so many important features missing, also again... buggy, and unoptimized 
=
this game should hv been early access, not a completed game
devs should just stop listens to 5 y/o childrens who stuck on 50 y/o body that also homeless, jobless, moron, and useless who forced them to break their game for their wishes, and began to actually making a true product that are working, valuable, revolutionary, and in-line with devs goals",1634974334,1698143610,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A game of scale, not micromanagement. It is a mix of Diablo and They Are Billions with a hint of Supreme Commander.

Do yourself a favor and play on Brutal from the start, as the game is too easy otherwise. The Campaign final battle on Normal was very disappointing. I expected to be swarmed by screen-fulls of enemies, like in They Are Billions, but it was only a trickle, not even comparable to red resource caches at any other point in the game. I wiped out everything and had to wait 2 minutes in bored silence for the portal back to earth to finish charging. Given how big the map is and how much the game emphasizes preparation, I expected 10-50 times more enemies.

In my exasperation, I tried Survival on Brutal. It warns that ""you'll be constantly under attack alien hordes of epic proportions"". Well that was a fucking lie... It's not constant and the enemies are overleveled, but not at all epic. Still, Brutal's final wave is quite good. About a third of what I would've expected on Normal week-long Campaign, but good enough for one-map 2-hour-long Survival.

It's kind of similar to Factorio, with the balance between combat and base building is entirely mirrored: Factorio has about 10-15% of the game focused on combat aspects, while Riftbreaker has about 10-15% focus on building and management, and everything else is about combat.
Overall, Riftbreaker devs did a fairly good job, but unlike Factorio, there aren't a lot of challenges and game scales poorly. Base in Riftbreaker can be extremely basic and simple, even on hard difficulty, as long as there's enough infrastructure dedicated on weapons and ammo, because the player is a one man army. The combat is versatile enough, and compared to Factorio, there are more biomes, more enemies types, and much more different damage-resistance-vulnerability combos to explore. 

The reasons why I chose not to recommend this game are (from biggest impact to lowest):

1. Boring grinding. There are two basic resources that can be mined or synthesized. That’s fine. 

There are three rare mineable resources that can be mined after a series of repetitive quests. That’s OK too, especially since it’s up to the player to select the order to unlock these. 

There are three more resources that are needed for advanced weaponry, and that’s where things get convoluted. Not only does that seems a bit excessive, but these additional resources cannot be mined, they can either be found through tedious stash quests, farmed from enemies at a snail’s pace or farmed from weeds, which is even slower. There's nothing enjoyable in either of these activities, and the game kind of forces you to do them if you want your avatar to be powerful enough. 

2. Repetitive mechanics.  Developers are making players do the exact same thing WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too many times. There is no real threat or sense of urgency behind any of the gameplay, basically, at about 40% of progress in the game you can safely say that there will be no new actions for you to do in the game, and you won’t see any new enemies. 
The endgame has little to no difference from the midgame, except the fact that your avatar is overpowered and things are easier. 

3. Lags. The game becomes up to two times slower even with low settings on a quite powerful PC, every time there's an ""invasion"" event going on (that can be quite frequent). It does actually make battle even easier, but it's tedious to wait through. On my main map, at the first location, the FPS is rarely above 10, even without any events going on. The game is fluent even at low FPS, but it’s just boring to play like that. 

4. The game is way too easy. I’ve started on “Hard” difficulty, and was able to fully clear the starting map without any major upgrades - elite packs and all.
Just to get at least some sense of threat, the last battle, the toughest of all in the game, I did without any defense towers at all - just by myslef, using warp gates across the map. Won at first try, my base wasn’t destroyed.

5. Combat isn't satisfying. Most of the time, you just feel like a small meatgrinder. Some enemies are just cannon fodder, some - bullet sponges. After you upgrade all your weapons, everything dies within seconds. The weapons are poorly balanced, some of them have laughable DPS compared to others of the same tier. You get the kick from feeling all-powerful, but that gets old fast. 

I was curious to see what the payoff would be at the end of the game, and it’s really disappointing - you are either given a choice between an abrupt end, or left in a sandbox with nothing to do.

UPDATE:
I kept seeing all the constant updates with improvements for this game (hat's off to developers for actively improving their game), and after about a year and a good upgrade to my PC, I've been tempted to give this game another chance. 
I started a new game, and just finished it. The developers definitely made plenty quality of life upgrades, such as mass upgrade tools, liquids teleportation between biomes, more interesting weapons and abilities - nothing to complain about.

However, at the very core, the game is still the same. It's still grindy and the combat is still ""wrecking ball in a glass shop"", with every monster being fragile, bosses being lucky to live longer than two seconds under concentrated fire.
This time I've cu a lot of corners and knew game mechanics, my base was optimal, my production was paralleled, and the final fight was done by turrets only, I haven't lifted a finger (monsters barely scratched the wall perimeter). 

Overall I can say that the game has considerably less performance issues (except for cases when large pipe system is being changed), and Metal Terror refreshes it a bit. It isn't in any way a bad game, but I do regret that I spent a lot of time on it.",1649612353,1695842552,False,11,1,0.554283857345581055,0,True,False,False
780310,147117523,76561197989379437,0,48,228,0,124,1695998390,"The game plays a lot like Factorio. With a much heavier focus on combat, and less on automation.

For example, you don't need conveyor belts to transport stuff. You can however, research a ton of stuff related to combat, but not only.

Your Mech Suit has 2 arms with 3 slots for weapons each, and 8 slots for equipment such as repair kits, grenades, mines, etc... So there's a lot of customization going on.

Just like Factorio you will regularly get attacked and will need to defend yourself while slowly but surely upgrading your base from a tiny settlement to a massive ""city"".

The graphics are amazing, and the game runs very well so far on an RTX 4070 TI. Stable 165 fps. Can't say how well it will run when massive swarms of enemies will come though, but we'll see.

If you enjoy ""factory"" games, such as Factorio, Satisfactory, etc... Then this game is a must, it's super well made.

The ONLY flaw, is the lack of co-op. They said co-op is coming, but it's taking a very long time.

When the game gets co-op, it will be a pretty serious rival to Factorio. For the time being, Factorio reigns king since you can easily play it with 50+ players at the same time.

That being said, don't let the lack of co-op discourage you from buying the game, it's worth every penny.

There's a prologue you can play if you're unsure about the buy. It's basically a small tutorial that explains the basics of the game and gives you a bit of combat to try some weapons. Will take roughly 1h to complete so it should give you a pretty good indication about whether you like the game or not.

Overall, highly recommended, well made game, and of course, eagerly waiting for co-op!

Thanks for reading.

Your robot/mech is a powerhouse who can do battle with numerous guns and melee weapons.  You are base building and collecting resources.  And you are building walls and towers to help defend your base.  You start out on one map where you set up your headquarters but you can eventually portal at will to other maps to set up other bases, usually to collect rare resources.  I very much liked being able to portal to other maps to set up outposts there.

I only played the story/campaign mode and I had a good time with it overall.  I enjoyed the base building and upgrading my mech.  There are a huge amount of upgrades you can research.....maybe too much.  There were a lot of defense options in terms of towers but I had a hard time setting up a solid defense in the mid to late game.  Once I started getting waves of very large aliens or aliens that bombard from afar I was basically having to rebuild my defenses all the time.  I think I was doing numerous things poorly.  I also wish waves of aliens would come a little less frequently.

I did not finish the campaign mode.  I got to a point where I finished a long term goal and then a huge wave of aliens hit my headquarters and wiped out a lot of it.

So neutral review to some degree, but the negatives do outweigh the positives.

- The Campaign is not good (bugs, pacing, messed up voice acting, same-same collector missions)
- There is a significant amount of game breaking bugs.

examples.

Left a mission zone at low health. Repaired and returned. Mech exploded upon return. Reload, Restart, same result. Had to start over.

Game decided my 100k energy base had 0 energy instead. Had to rebuild entire base to get it working again, reload and restart had no effect.

Game decided my headquarters had no connection to rest of base. Non-fixable. Broken game.

Game decided the rift did not detect the 1mio energy that it needed. Had to sell rift, then collect 10K of each resource, which is to say repeat most of the campaign) then rebuild, then power it. 

All said and done the game wasted around 1/3 of the playtime on what the *bip* things.

Whatever other virtues the game has cannot make up for that.

Recommend on sale and if you only plan to try the survival scenarios.

Some things I REALLY wish I knew first. 
- Scrapping weapons gives you half resources
- Cultivators have a center ""Mod"" Button that lets you select what to plant. This is how you get unlimited resources. (Same way liquid decompressors work)
- The rift building builds its own expansions, they are not separate buildings
- Higher level buildings produce more while using the same amount of resources. Recommend not making plasma until you get 3rd level of plasma generator.
- Weapons and compressors use plasma even if you are not using them. Recommend simply storing it in a liquid storage container.
- Wildlife does not spawn under radar coverage
- Wildlife goes to closet building, has NO advanced pathfinding (will not go around walls, target weapons, ect...)
- Wildlife will spawn off edge of map, even if you have walled area off
- The waves get harder after each resource base you build. Make sure you advance your research after each unlocked resource (cobalt, titanium, ect...) Waves also get harder the longer you are in an area (to a cap).

The locked camera in birds eye mode felt primitive and some of the reviews said the balancing and difficulty curve needed some quality of life changes. But I just picked this up on sale a few days ago because it looked like all those quality of life changes had been made. The locked camera still feels primitive but is necessary for the building aspect of the game. You can't have all these buildings you create blocking your vision to empty corners you may have missed or something. Also your character is spinning around all the time to shoot things in different directions so not locking the camera would be a bit disorienting I think. This game looked like a basic automation game like factorio or dyson sphere program or what have you, but wow was I wrong. This is not an automation game. This is a colony survival game. This is rimworld where you only have one character and you control him like you would a MOBA character. You can change your equipment loadout to a ridiculous level of detail and depth. There is a lot of cool stuff to research and unlock. And the aspect of having to research the aliens around you to unlock some of the new techs is also very cool. There are some flaws in the game, but many of these are altered by mods you can find on steam already anyway. All in all this is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. I have already failed to win the logistics battle in less than a few days of play and had to start over and, even after knowing I will have to do hours of gameplay again in my new playthrough to get to where I was, I can't seem to put this game down.

- I love exploration, but after running around the entire map 10+ times in the main campaign and try to scan for literally everything, I'd say it gets repetitive, and I just basically do that to unlock cosmetics. 

Story:
- The main campaign is kind of mid about story telling, if you don't want to say forgettable. 
- The DLC, however, is a little bit more interesting, though I won't say it's impressive enough.

Is the game good? Yes.
Are the graphics good? Yes.
Does the game stutter and hitch like fxckin Crysis? Yes.

Note, I didn't say ""awesome"" or ""amazing"", I just said 'good'... because that's what it is, just 'good'. But the hitching is a serious annoyance to the point where it feels like you're playing Crysis or some other game with spaghetti coding. Another thing that is a serious irritation in the game is the fact that loot disappears after a few seconds, which I absolutely hate, and ontop of that, loot isn't displayed on the mini-map at all. The devs also limit the amount of planets you can colonize to a hilarious 8... why?! It just doesn't make sense, but fortunately there's people in this world who actually care about making games good, and they're known as 'modders', so you can remove the hilarious 8 base limit thanks to modders AND you can even make the looting range way more so that the disappearing loot isn't such a big issue. I seriously don't think the game is worth $30 with all of this bs. Maybe $20, but not $30. Also, the regional pricing of the game is pretty bad (Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Turkey, all have bad pricing) plus the game is for sale in ruzzia. If you're looking for a TD kinda like this game, then rather play Lumencraft... it's cheaper, more fun, and doesn't hitch & stutter like you're playing Crysis on a calculator.

- Gameplay is fantastic. There is nice turtle-ing base building, fun ARPG lite style roaming, a shooter feel at times and some fairly chill crafting & customisation of your mech. World has a mix of gameplay mechanics to keep you engaged.
-  Graphics are LUSH. I am running this on a reasonable system but it is a very interactive destructible world, lighting is amazing, really varied world design.
- I enjoyed the story. Sue me.
- DLC are both great.

Might get back to it again at some point.
* Game-breaking bugs that's been around for 2 years that's still not fixed (finding titanium). I had to go to the game console to get around it.
* Some tedious missions. Usually scan a ton. Relatively few actually connected to base building.
* Attack wave intensity on normal that's just stupid. If you think you got a good defense they'll just trample over it like nothing. Entire screen filled with mobs instantly stomping everything. Any mining outpost with some defenses is just gone immediately. Maybe it's just me being bad a building defenses, but there's not any reasonable scaling to where you notice it's a bit behind and needs reinforcing. No, it's just gone immediately.
* Artillery mobs that seem to out-range any artillery of your own, or it's just overwhelming the defenses to the degree that they never fire at the enemy artillery => dead defenses.
* Mech feel quite weak against the huge waves of enemies so you can't support the defenses that much either. You can try to strategically kill off some mobs, like the artillery ones but there's no way you'd handle an entire wave of your own.
* If you die, you'll drop a weapon which usually makes it even harder to try to defeat a wave until it can be retrieved again.
* Waves doesn't trigger if you're not on the map, which I believe is part of the above problem. You'd be on other maps fixing things etc while researching. That seems to increase wave difficulty so when you get back you'll be met with a crazy increase in wave intensity.",1691440593,1691440593,False,1,0,0.46756899356842041,1,True,False,False

Campaign is now out, 2 DLC's and with alot more coming. this game has blown all expectations out of the water I am probably only halfway thru the campaign and its really well done, you can go at your own pace and tackle the objectives on your own time, it kind of reminds me of progressing in satisfactory. 
i went in just expecting a they are billions clone with mechs but its so much more its basically 2 games in one with a tower defense base building side and a mech upgrading/exploring side. 

my only gripes would be : 
-wish there were more/alternative voice lines for when something is constantly happening(Nests, Bigger enemies, etc..) 
-minor audio glitches (sometimes a loop breaks or music has cut randomly but always restores)

Story : 6/10 (not finished but seems to be alright, its giving you a background to the settings/lore)
Audio : 8/10 (Game sounds great just minor bugs, redundant voice lines)
Visual :9/10 (1440p maxed out looks great, solid 125fps, AMD 5700xt) 
Gameplay : 8.5/10 (campaign loop is great, survival is fun, coop is coming)
Price : 10/10 (i think i got it for a little bit cheaper than what it is now but id pay full price)

Overall : 41.5/50 or 4.2/5

Yes the bases the plural word because you need manage your resources in + numbers you cant creat one big base and step by step push your walls deeper and deeper in enemy teritorry, well thats not quite possible you will mostly f*cked up your energy and unique resources upkeep so you must creat on strategic places many small bases. Yes there is possibility of small teleports but when i was deep in enemy territory on exploration and game tell me: hey we detected massive group of enemies in opposite side of map grouping around your base, you have 40 secunds to prepare before the wave come, well f*ck me. And the waves as i learned after 2nd wave are brutal, they dont get a sh*t. So yes even that the game have solo campaign the co-op is not exactly option but you need it, at least 1 extra player where one care about base managing and the other with exploring. And no the exploring is not exactly the easier, yes you do not need manage 50 things at once like in base but surviving outside the perimetr is not easy, not even fair. Even after unlocking 1/5 of research tech i dont found nothing to rise my shields/armor/hp only tech for better weapons and new buldings and tools.

I overdid everything by a huge margin and completed the game in 20 hours. I had insane quantities of all resources.

Weapon mods are a nice touch, but a light one. I don't feel that they have a big impact.

I just spammed whatever turrets, the main thing was to add artillery turrets to kill ranged enemies, and to use flamethrowers in acid biomes and acid throwers in lava biomes. I guess the game tries to give you many tools for the same job. So that you can build the thing you fancy.

Some stuff requires too much fiddling, like the liquid packing/unpacking system. But I guess you aren't supposed to build that many of them. By fiddling I mean that you build the building, then you set the recipe. There's no way to blueprint stuff. You can ""copy"" buildings, but it doesn't copy its settings. Like what liquid the liquid unpacker produces.

Also, the system of how the liquid packing/unpacking works seems quite weird. I think you create hard links between two places. So you can't split 1 packer to 2 unpackers.

I wish the game gave you harder challenges where you need to come up with solutions using limited sets of tools. But hey, I finished Factorio Space Exploration mod solo so maybe this is not the game for me. 30 euros is too high, get it when it's on sale for half of that.

- From the clunky UI, to the (less than stellar) voice acting with a side order of dad jokes, the game has no intention of hiding this 2001 feeling factor, and they really they nailed it. You either love that 2001 smell or you wish it would burn with your old CD pile still in your desk.

- Combat is as you would expect from trailers, you survive waves of ever increasing and worsening enemies on an alien planet as you work with a limited resource pool and ever expanding base to create eventually a rift portal. While the game play may sound redundant of other tower defense games it's unique factor comes into the form of just how much you can pile on the screen, and how many weapons are at your disposal. 

- Enemies come varied, from your mud horror abomination to your Starcraftian Protoss Invsia trooper, and even rocks that just up and decide that you ruined their day. They all have different resistances and means to make your day a mess, and they will in fact do that. The sheer scale of and variety of enemies leave your ever expanding base and demand on a razer thin line between being swallowed by these said horrors and keeping things nice and tidy.

- Your arsenal is just as varied. To avoid spoilers the best I can, I think summing it up to say you start with shotguns, and end up with black hole generators gives you a pretty good idea just what you can play with in between. You can also customize with mods, and upgrades, skins, and combinations.

- Graphics as well are fantastic, ignoring the UI and Menu choices. You can even turn on ray tracing if you feel brave enough. 2023 graphics package inside a 2001 game.


So if you bothered to read all of that, good job. I really think the game has clear potential and promise. The devs are listening clearly, attempting to fix and incorporate plenty they and their community want and love, and all the while the game is very much kick ass in what you'd expect from the trailers. 

The only reason you might not want a game like this is if you never lived back in 2001, or hate 2001, or hate things older than 5 years old. Other than that it's a fantastic buy.

It was a lot of fun with really cool graphics. Shredding tons of Aliens with a double minigun equiped walking Mech while the Artillery of my base covered my back was awesome.

But now with official release they made some changes I really don't like, for example the ammunition storage cap. It was meant as balance, so you can't technically have unlimited Ammo. But they decreased it way too much, it totally killed the fun to be a walking Lead Dispenser.

Also the research system is so incredible boring. Place down labs, upgrade them and then wait ... wait and wait. Wait even more. And it takes so long (since labs are also limited now) that sometimes you don't even finish 2/3 of the research before the map is over.

And last but not least, the game sadly becomes repetitive quite fast. It totally lacks on replay value. There is really some sort of bounty system missing thet keeps you playing for the reward. Like permanent upgrades, or that you can carry over some Mods for the next run etc.

So ye, sadly, but I really can't recommend the game yet. Maybe they will add something later to fix these problems, I would really wish they do, because this game has potential.


[u]Update: 07.09.2023:[/u]

I replayed the game after two DLC's got released to give the game another chance.

Some things got better, some not. Technically they added a bunch of weapons and enemies, so you have more variety now, but tbh, they overdone it. There are SO MANY Weapons now in that game that you don't know which one to pick. I mean, who needs 3 different Flamethrowers that more or less do all the same?

A little positive Aspect now is, that you can search for special Alien Nests. When you trigger them and survive the incoming Alien Wave, there often drop various little Gadgets like placeable turrets or Miners. And those Gadgets are permanent. So when you start a new game, you allready have them available after you build your first critical base buildings (like Laboratory, Armory etc.)

So you have at least ""some"" sort of bonus system that may increase the replay value.

It still is heavy repetitive and the research system is still the same. And now with even more research options due to the DLC's, it takes even longer to research everything.

I really try to like this game, it's not bad, but also really not good.

The whole UI is fiddly and feels like you're playing a game from 2003.

But the worst part after playing the campaign over and over again is the dialog between Ashely and Mr. Riggs. It's like a grammar School Conversation and becomes heavily annoying. Especially since you get notifications and tips over and over again, no matter how long you are allready in the game.

So I still can't really recommend the game.

But hey, Coop is on the way. Everything is more funny if you can kill each other by ""accident"", right? Right.

So I will check the game out again after Coop-Mode release.",1657960913,1688927770,False,18,1,0.611142158508300781,0,True,False,False

If Factorio, Alien Swarm had a beautiful, epic baby, it would probably be this game. It combines elements of factory games, resource management, tower defense, and top-down shooters all into one package.

[b] Gameplay: [/b] This game manages to balance both base building and combat in a way that makes both feel satisfying. Building your base is about much more than constructing defensive towers; you have to build a power grid, harvest resources, and explore new areas if you want to survive and ultimately beat the game. The game does a good job of making defenses feel useful, while also ensuring that you won't be able to simply turtle behind your walls. If you want to prevent significant damage to your base with each attack, you'll have to venture forth and engage the enemy directly. 

When you aren't building your base, you'll be blasting waves of aliens to smithereens. The guns and weapons are all immensely satisfying to use, and the game's clever ammo system means that you can't simply spam your most powerful weapons endlessly. Every engagement requires careful thinking, and good ammo management. The game also offers a variety of mines, traps and other defensive tools if you want to set up an ambush for your foes. 

There's also an EXTENSIVE crafting system, allowing you to create a wide variety of weapons, and equip them with various add-ons found throughout the game. These are usually dropped by enemies, encouraging you to head out of your walls and explore to see what you might find. These add-ons are far from an afterthought; many enemies have resistances or vulnerabilities to particular elements or ammo types, meaning you may need to customize your weapons load-out to meet approaching threats.

And I haven't even mentioned the fact you'll be required to expand to various new areas, independent of your home base, to collect new and rare resources. Most of these are required to beat the game, while others provide some other benefit, like new weapon types or power options. 

Honestly, there's a HUGE amount of stuff to do in this game, and I'd be here all day if I tried to cover it all. The gameplay is fun, satisfying, and leaves you with plenty to do if you want to beat the game.

[b] Visuals: [/b] This game is an interesting mix of realism, and cartoonish, hulking aliens. The world is full of lush vegetation that dynamically reacts to your actions. THe various particle effects all look pretty awesome, especially the weapons. Be warned: this game can be a bit of a power hog. If you don't have a VERY beefy computer, cranking everything up to ultra is likely to cause frame-rate issues. However, the options menu comes with lots of options for dealing with this issue. There are various AI upscaling technologies that allow for minimal quality loss, while improving frame-rates significantly. Naturally, there's going to be a bit of quality loss with these options, but when you're being charged down by a horde of aliens, you'll take the extra frames over a little extra polish.

Overall, the game looks great, and even low-end machines should be able to run it on low settings. 

[b] Audio: [/b] The SFX are excellent, and help the various weapons feel very satisfying. I also enjoyed how each alien type had particular sound effects associated with it, making it easier to identify who you've managed to kill when a vast swarm is running you down. The soundtrack is a bit less memorable, but still appropriate for the feel of the game. 

[b] Overall [/b] It's hard to find much to complain about in this game. I have a few little nitpicks here and there, but they really are just nitpicks. I've found myself coming back to this game periodically and even playing the DLC. I personally think it's great value, and I've had a tremendous amount of fun with it.

Combat is great, thousands of monsters pushing towards you at a time that you can easily get lost just running around clearing them out. The variety of weapons is great plus I see they will be adding even more weapons. Can go in swinging some hammers or lay down a bunch of mines. My favorite is running dual mini guns, but there are monsters that do not take damage from physical damage, so you always have to switch it up at times.

Base building is nice on how you can just throw up a crazy defensive base anywhere at anytime on the map, if you have the resources obviously. Only thing I can complain about here is early on you have to spam hundreds of each building to have enough energy/storage/resources. For example if you need a thousand energy to run your base, you need to put down 50+ solar or wind turbines to sustain the energy cost. Even getting to the end of the campaign, you get opened up to other energy resources, but they all require crazy resources to run that are not on certain planets, so it is hard to utilize those new buildings. Also, the storage to hold your materials starts off at 200 per building and you fill that up in about 5 seconds, so literally half of my starter map is just these buildings and nothing else. I thought for sure you would see one hold like 5,000 each, but that is not the case they only go up by 200, so I am on tier 3 of this building holding 800 each.

Other than the building issue, the game keeps me coming back for more. They even have a crazy mod community to expand on the game if you are into that kind of thing.

for the rare resources required to complete the rift gate, I went to a volcano world... very unfriendly: magnetic rocks prevented radar, numerous enemies but no 'new gameplay' was sort of boring. after i unlocked Titanium, the game was like ""now go to a NEW location and do it all over again!""

My issue: i built up my home base and maxxed out techs there before starting the main quest. There was no pacing cues. I learned all the game tricks from the main quest long before i left the home map. that's my bad: but the game really oughta encouraged going to other zones earlier. 

and since the first mission was 'find 100 titanium' instead of 'fine a titanium mine' it seems like a very basic fix would be on the home map to ""collect 10 titanium""

At 13:02 I reported a bug in the discord server. Patch rolled out to fix it at 13:35. I'm not even sure how the heck is that physically possible.

Now, for the actual game.

This game is a gem. Genuinely. The story is that humanity needs MOAR resources, so they send out specialized scientist-commandos called Riftbreaker via extremely long range one-way teleport. You are one of these scientist-commandos on a mission to Galatea 37, to prepare it for colonization.  You must construct a teleport gate on planet, or you'll never get off that rock. Aiding you ever faithfully is Mr Riggs, the mecha-suit (technically, a power armour frame with an advanced AI, but ehh, details), weapons- and sensor platform, advisor and construction vehicle.

The game is a topdown perspective basebuilder, with RPG elements. You build your base, defend it against the locals, extract resources, and conduct research.

Building the base is pretty straightforward, but there are some twists. One is, that different defensive turrets deal different kinds of damage, and certain enemies are immune to certain kinds of damage. And even on easy there are enemies on the starting map which are immune to the basic tower, which means they can wreck your entire base, if it's left unchecked (you can build more kinds of towers than you need). The other comes WAAAY later in the game, when you start piping. Now, unlike in Factorio, you can't just put the pipes underground, these must be above ground, and you can't cross the pipes in any way, shape or form. If, say, you have a mud pipeline surrounding a clean water making building, well, you either won't have access to that cleaned water via pipes, or you better start improving your plumbing, because you screwed something up. Notice I said ""won't have access to VIA PIPES"". That's right, you'll have access to it through a building called ""Liquid Compressor"", which essentially teleports it, even across different maps.

The starting map in campaign won't have access to all the resources, which means you'll need to find the rest. To be honest, the ""scout for titanium"" mission is pretty damn annoying, the other two scout missions are tolerable, but certainly a weak point in the campaign. I suggest crafting the best sensors you have access to before doing them. Getting access to different resources happens once you unlock travel across the globe, then you get access to different biomes, each giving you access to another resource. Well, technically two resources each, but I'll get back to that. You need a lot of resources. However, resources on a map do not run out. If you manage to stripmine a location, new, biome-appropriate resources will spawn via two events (earth quakes and meteors) even before that. So don't worry, mine to your hearts content. Each biome also has different flora and fauna, which you can and should scan, for two reasons. One, the animals you see are NOT afraid of your 4.5 meter tall hot lead spitting mobile genocide unit, in fact, they find it looking extremely submissive and breedable, and you have to persuade them of the error of their ways by sharing with them your ammo. Straight from your barrel. Two, the plants can be cultivated and harvested for any resource you wish. I mentioned each new biome gets 2 new resources, well, one needed for construction (cobalt, palladium, titanium, uranium), one needed for your equipment (hazenite, rhodonite, ferdonite, tanzanite). Apart from the basic resources (carbonium and ironium) which are available everywhere. Also, some research is locked behind getting samples (scanning with either your bioscanner or shooting them) some of which is essential for progressing (like the cryo station, which is required for titanium mining at any significant scale) or just too fun to not do (we'll leave the wildlife of Galatea 37 mostly intact... as long as they can withstand the nukes, which I use to pacify the area with).

Your equipment falls into two categories, weaponry, and armour. You can equip 3 weapons on each hand, and you can switch between them, and you can have 4 armour modules, which do stack. So, if you, say, want to be a damage mirror, 3 reflective armour panel and 1 repair protocol is my suggestion. For the building part, equip 4 maintenance protocols, which reduce both building speed and cost (for example, a full set of maxed out maintenance protocols reduce your building cost and time by 64%, that's massive). I won't go into details on each weapon, because, there is JUST SO MANY OF THEM. Swords, laser swords, hammers, spears, pickaxes, power fists, small machine guns, crystal shard guns, miniguns, burst rifles, large caliber rifles. plasma guns, laser guns, missile launchers, nuke launchers, grenade launchers, multiple acid spewing weapons, etc etc etc. I'm 98% confident that your weapon of choice is handled by the game.

The only two minor criticisms of the game are the annoying titanium sample mission and that some descriptions are so technobabbly that they make no sense whatsoever. The Laser Gattling Tower (not to be confused with the Laser Tower [yes, there are two laser based towers in the game, because, lulz)] by it's name, should be a laser tower, but the description says it shoots plasma bolts. Now, from the game's perspective, both are energy damage, so it's not really that big of a deal, but that's all kinds of funny for me.

Overall 10/10, the good parts overshadow the bad parts so hard that those two minor things do not take away from the game. Go buy it.",1687803307,1687803307,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

I simply upgraded them and never had to rebuild them or put a lot of thoughts into their composition or arrangement. I only built the defenses that you unlock later on other maps, and I didn't feel like I had to add any of them to my main base. If the waves get stronger over time, I didn't really feel it. They should grow more significantly in strength, and there should be some system to anticipate what you need to build to defend them. Plus it should be harder to gather the ressources to match the defensive requirements, at least in hard mode. Then there are some other weaknesses of the game such as the 2dimensional map layout with no way to cross pipelines. The complexity of resource management is too simple. Gathered minerals are magically available everywhere, even on other maps, without a transport system. At the same time, fluids need a pipeline system. And the pipelines cannot cross.

You build up a base, harvesting all kinds of different resources and converting some into fuels or other substances. There are biomes, several big research trees, it's an awesome experience. I've played dozens of hours and I feel like I have dozens more left, and I can definitely see myself coming back to this game in the future.

Puedes mejorar el personaje principal con gran variedad de equipo y combinaciones, ya sea para atacar, defender, construir o hacer un mix de todo. No es el típico juego de estrategia y gestión que te obliga a hacer las cosas de una única manera con un determinado recurso, aquí puedes ser más creativo y recurrir a diferentes opciones para conseguir tus objetivos: ya sea por investigación y recolección; o construyendo estaciones mineras; mediante automatización de cultivos; etc.

Con una mecánica de salto entre pantallas que aporta mucho a la economía de toda la campaña, y la sensación de que cada paso que das y cada estructura que construyes cuenta para el evento final. Un punto que me ha gustado mucho es que siempre puedes volver atrás para modificar o mejorar lo que has hecho en cada mapa y así aumentar la economía global de la campaña.

I have been comparing it to Satisfactory and Factorio (because I'm a monkey with no metrics of my own). The way I'd describe this game is a much easier to digest version of Factorio, particularly without the logistical nightmares. The base building feels smooth, yet still has depth. The banter between the characters, Mr. Riggs and Ashley is entertaining, and the enemies feel dynamic, instead of slightly different shaped goons. While there is a lot of 'run n gun' to this game, I'd recommend a bit of caution if base building isn't your thing, because it is unavoidable. That being said, the combat is satisfying and the sheer volume of weapons and tools actually lets you fight how you want to.
 
Which brings me to my only remaining negative about the game, which is also one of the highlights: the hordes. While the whole point of the base building is to fend off giant hordes and mow them down with sci fi pew pews, it is a bit off-putting when, at what should be the most fast-paced part of the game, it actually becomes the slowest, literally. While the game never drops frames, it does slow to a crawl at later horde stages. I'm not personally concerned about this, as the fixes for it are relatively simple. They Are Billions mods are a perfect example of this. I'm not entirely sure if that is true, as these are actual 3d assets, but I don't see it as a dealbreaker regardless.",1686438590,1686993685,True,0,0,0.534220576286315918,1,True,False,False

On higher difficulties, it becomes a survival management game as you are rushed by hordes strong enough to wipeout nascent outposts and keep them gone until you get strong enough to get the breathing room to rebuild, hoping you have enough resources and time to do so.  Having played at the initial release and after some time when the DLCs became available, I am very pleased with the interface evolution that has occurred, making the game more accessable in a time management crisis environment.

It's a pretty good base builder glued to a pretty good twin-stick shooter and much more freedom than I expected. I was very surprised when I found out I could build as much as I wanted, no limits (more on this below).

Shoutout to the very welcome customizable difficulty settings.

My only issue with the game is that the more you build and the more enemies show up, the more the game slows down. This only became a real problem at the very end (when I had built over 80% of the map) and I started the final defense of the campaign. The game got ridiculously unplayable in certain sections of my base.
However, as much as that sucked, which it certainly did, it wasn't enough to ruin the previous 43 hours I played. 
With this in mind you may want to limit the number of structures you make: this is not like Vampire Survivors where ""I can't tell what's happening"" is an expected part of the endgame.

It reminds me of a few other very similar ones but with simpler logistics (sometimes painfully so) in favor of more exploration and personal contribution to combat/defense.

The prologue is amazing, balancing the story, characters and the actual tutorial well enough that I got the game after the demo. the opening cinematic is also quite impressive (even if ANY contact with 'Huston' would be outright impossible given the supposed distance (yes I had to say that)).

I like the inclusion of all previously heard dialogs in a log to listen to them again, a few more filtering options would be nice but it's not a big deal.
The voiceover is helpful, all annoying notifications (like full storage) can be disabled individually.

Building and expanding feel dynamic, allowing a very fast setup of secondary outposts. Ammo management and general construction are a breeze with the resources being shared across the entire map (and later maps) in one inventory (the only exception being power, but that can easily be solved with a single building).

Combat feels great with many enemy types that are resistant to different kinds of damage or are dangerous to handle 1 on 1 early on (but some weapons allow you to be a full on one man (woman in this case) army).

One gripe I have is the really flat descriptions on some items, copied over and so generic that they are less than helpful, ""upgrade for X bla bla"" without any info on what it does (it IS listed on the stat page) or some game world related explanation of the technology. A missed opportunity but not a big deal.

The description issue gets much worse with complex buildings where the stat difference can only be seen after construction. the lack of some stats like deployable turret lifetime is very noticeable and the lack of standard order for stats for said turrets makes comparisons impossible. also, turret ammo consumption, storage and production use inconsistent units.

The game is... enjoyable, sure. but it FALLS apart as soon as you try to optimize something and that's a huge shame.

The level based buildings are a simple way to condense buildings with limited space when bases become too massive to power themselves, Power is somewhat simple but as with most problems can be solved with the simple approach of ""JUST BUILD MORE OF IT"" until it works. It'd be nice to have more dynamic weather impact on the solar or wind instead of working with only drastic changes. Also, solar is shown as 100% at night, which is a bit weird. New research often results in obsolete gear still appearing in the build menus and crafting manues without a way to filter them out, the upgrades are a DIRECT improvement of a higher grade yet the old item still clutters the list, that decision is a mystery to me.

Overall, the game is nice but the more I play the less interested I become in having a base at all, preferring instead to set off alone to a new map while leaving the HQ to handle itself and produce ammo.
The game feels oddly unpolished for its age. I cannot overstate this, the level of polish on the UI elements and the texts feels like its an alpha build, not a 2 year old 'released' game. but shitty ui dosent ruin the fun sand you dont have to interact with it much so its still ok-ish in my books.",1685707887,1686860594,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every time i try to go to a different zone the game tells me access is denied to the savefile, and therefore i cannot progress because of that.

This has been an issue even before launch and it STILL persists.

I've already given the exe admin rights and disabled google drive sync. 

I will wait two weeks and try to solve it, and if i dont find a solution its getting refunded.


Damn shame too. I was enjoying the game

Edit: Both the launcher and the game's exe has admin rights, i've changed The Riftbreaker folder in documents to NOT be read only, i have turned off windows defender, i stopped google drive from running altogether, gave exclusions for both exe files in windows defenders exclusion menu, and turned off controlled folder access in ransomware protection and access is still denied. I've even created a symbolic link to make the game think the files are in the documents folder, when in reality they arent. Im done.

Fuck you for letting this be in the game for years on end, i was having fun you dicks

Edit: A year later, issue still persists. I am not rebuying the game until it is fixed.

shotgun having more base damage a larger cone and no charge with a slower fire rate to compensate
missile launcher having a set fire rate rather that a charge function
slightly faster tech times and mining speeds waiting seems to be most of what you do in this game.

The Riftbreaker is a fantastic mix between three genres, Factory Management/ Hack and Slash/ Tower Defense. 

After playing Starcraft for so many decades and comparing the two I can safely say this one was crafted with much care! The City building aspect of this game is quite deep and requires maybe a dozen of hours to get the hang of it. 

Controls are a nightmare to begin with so right of the bat I will suggest you take your time and customize it while you learn the tech tree. The game asks you to make a variety of actions many times during a match and the UI is not perfect. I've found myself having to customize my hotkeys once in a while even after many hours of gameplay.

Music unfortunately is where this game airballs for me, oh wow that's heartbreaking, music gets repetitive before the refund button becomes unavailable, this is dangerous for any game developper, I'm so sorry the music is very bad, so I cranked a Steve Jablonsky and gave this game a chance. The game is so well tuned and balanced and plays so smooth it feels like it needed more investment from the devs in this area. You can tell they paid a small studio with over simplified tunes who would not deliver a product with the same love as the rest of the game. Music is important to me, it just doesn't work. 

Action packed, The Riftbreaker is a game for those who want to not breath, that being said even if it's a Tower Defense and HacknSlash combo type of a game it doesn't help you multitask, the camera is fixed on Ashley all the time, and enemies just deal a bunch of damage so you blink and you die, somehow it works very fine.

Replayability is exactly what you expect from a game like this and the long list of perks and paths you can go make it fun everytime. Survival mode is where this game shines, it's a big yes!

Few bug bears first : 
Firstly, I've seen a few people say its like Factorio It isn't and also more importantly its not trying to be. 
There is no real logistics or automation which does slow it down a bit.

Secondly, tower ammo storage is limited but production has no building cap.

Thirdly, There is no way of crossing pipes which forces you to use the resource teleportation system or designing bases around it.

and lastly, I have had aliens spawn in my base a few times... ontop of tiled floor, literally a few spaces behind the wall.

biggest feature suggestion : 
co-op would be amazing but really a copy-paste or blueprint like system for placing things would be game changing and improve it massively. Building huge wall sections and bases is monotonous, rushed and quite messy because this is missing. I'd easily play for 1000s of hours if this was in the game

Adding this removes so much boring toil and take it easily to the next level.

The above does not effect the actual playing of the game.
This game is so much fun. If it was compatible it would be IDEAL for the steam deck.
1 - Massive upgrade trees because everyone loves research
2 - Huge variety of melee and ranged weapons with just as many mods to match
3 - loads of items and abilities from small deploable turrets to orbital ion cannons
4 - game is really stunning which makes it a real pleasure to play.
5 - loads of different alien classes with unique damage type resistances. 

Totally cannot recommend it enough.

The dialogue is pretty wooden, but that's excusable as one of the main characters is literally an AI. Core game-play loop of the campaign is very fun and satisfying. Strongly recommended. 

Only one real major issue. Survival mode is VERY poorly balanced. On its surface, it seems like a GREAT way to enjoy the satisfying and rewarding game-play that you get in the campaign, in a bite-sized version. To a degree, it is. However, the end-game wave will throw huge volumes of the game's most difficult enemies at you, but the nature of the tech tree and the time-constraints of research make it so that you can't really climb the weapon tech as hard as you need to, unless you neglect all other tech research. Locking the ability to research at all behind the Level 2 HQ building is even worse, since that really kills about 15-20ish minutes of your ability to climb the tech tree for a 90-minute game mode.

I think this game is an excellent blend of FPS and RTS genres. If you love building bases, you'll love this game. It has multiple biomes that present different challenges, lots of different resources to mine and grow, and LOTS of space (in most biomes) to build and build and build. 

Note that your entire base is mechanized, so if you're looking for a settler-type game about managing colonists, this isn't it. Your main upkeep will be energy, and you'll mine and grow resources to build structures and upgrades. The entire interface is centered around your hero from an isometric perspective, so you'll need to move them around to build stuff. Luckily, portals are cheap, so you can easily set up a network that lets you quickly move across the map. (Note that you'll still need to connect stuff with pipes and power connectors, but the DLCs help with that issue)

If you want weapons, the game's got you covered. Flamethrowers, rocket launchers, miniguns...and if you like getting up close and personal, there's swords, hammers and power fists. And as Billy Mays says, there's more! You also get to throw grenades and use abilities and be the one-mech murder machine you were made to be. 

If you like building bases with tons of defenses, this has a huge variety of them. As enemies vary in each biome, you'll want to change your defense setups, and all of them can attack your Headquarters eventually so you'll want to field a variety of it. 

There's a lot of great mods for this game, and the developers are also kind enough to let you make your own custom difficulty which can make it ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard as you like. As an RTS junkie, it's got me hooked for days on end.

Research only has you keep up bigger guns to fight bigger things on somewhat equal footing, with no actual edge to be gained by any of it which can prevent larger units from walking right through defenses barely touched or ranged units from staying outside of view and continuing to volley the base. Maybe in the highest levels of development there are some solutions which are provided to help, but so far for a game with so many moving parts, it still just feels like the player and enemy beating each over the head with rocks and whoever had the biggest rock wins.

There are vulnerabilities and invulnerabilities to consider, but the turrets have no discrimination and waste their time firing on enemies who are unscathed by their attacks, damage which could be applied to other units which would actually be damaged by them. At the end of the day, only the player and the mech really matter, with even the best turrets only serving as support. There's so much potential in making the automatic defences better and more effective.

Resource management is a sick joke. For an enviromentalist, or so the diatribes spewing from the MC constantly would insist, there is no tangible encouragement or reward for using renewable energy sources, or using farmed/synthetic/synthesised materials rather than just strip mining the planet to a crisp. Let's just burn Fern Gulley/Pandora to the ground in a gas furnace, grab the crystals that grew on them, and toss seismic charges at whatever's left for good measure. Absolute backwards, contradictory priorities and tech development.

Overall, the game completely lacks a coherent MO, thought process and gameplay, as well as reward for thoughtful planning and strategy. Are you supposed to be a scientist trying to minimize their footprint on the world while exploring it, and preparing a clean eco-colony for a new humanity? Because it sure in the hell doesn't read or play that way.

В игре есть один минус, но разработчики с ним хорошо справились - очень много разных исследований, которые полезные, без +1% к урону, но которые отнимают много времени. И в тот момент когда вы в принципе просто ждёте, когда натикают часики вам подкидывают миссию на другую карте, где есть чем заняться. И так много раз.

The player will control a mechanical unit which have lots of weapon to choose from. Each one is quite unique. In fact it encompasses all of the weapon variety which ever existed in all FPS/TPS games. So you'll get a strong feeling of Third Person Shooter experience.

The player can also build a base, just like any RTS game. You gather resources and then distribute them to buildings which need them and then produce some output, which can then be used by other buildings in the game. It doesn't have a long production chain like Factorio or Satisfactory, but it has sufficient depth which can be equivalent to The Settlers.

Of course, like any TD game out there, the player can produce a wide variety of towers to fight of incoming waves. I chose normal difficulty and it already given me hundreds of enemy units from multiple directions. I can't imagine if I had chosen higher difficulty. Perhaps a swarm of thousands of enemy units will be very cool to watch.

The research tree is so vast that will keep you playing for tens of hours just to get all items discovered.

The map is gigantic and have a wide variety of creatures, both plants and animals. Terrain variety is so incredible that it will surely keep you interested in exploration. In fact it's not only 1, but many maps with different environment, creatures, and resources. So yes the maps do have sufficient variation which will force you to approach it with different play style. It does have significant replayability aspect to it.

The graphics quality is phenomenal as if it was made by Unreal Engine 5 or Crytek engine (Crisis game series). Playing it with the latest RTX will definitely be an unforgettable treat for your eyes.

This game just scratches that itch that no other game has for me quite yet, and believe me, ive tried them all.

I originally played through the game, and first DLC via Gamespass + a fee, but seen as its no longer on Gamespass I couldn't play.

I genuinely did not hesitate to buy the game again, but this time on steam, and both DLCs.

Great job devs, keep up the great work, and hopefully it wont be too long for some more content, including that extremely highly requested, often hinted at, online + local co-op.

Fighting is holding a button while walking backwards, base building is tedious structure spam with little thought involved, and the research mechanic is literally waiting for a timer to tick down.  I can't even recommend it for the story, which is very low stakes with characters that are uninspired exposition machines.  (""Earth is dying and we're here to claim this planet for humanity!

Other cons,
It is not very difficult, it becomes rise and repeat in new biodomes with slowly increasing difficultly. I might restart at top difficultly.

But you already have hundreds of other reviews to let you know what this game is about, so let me tell you how good I think it is, in a very simple way.

I finished this game. And then I started a new game the minute I finished it.

Doesn't sound like much, eh ? Well... It actually is kind of a big deal. I have been gaming for 30 years or so, and there are very few games that I have actually finished. Somehow, I will play a game for a while, a few hours or tens of hours or more, but I seldom finish a game. Even exceptionnaly good games, I rarely finish. Somehow I slip out of it. Judge me not, I am weird, but that's how things are.

It takes a really exceptionnal game for me to finish it. Final Fantasy 7, back when it was new. Every Deus Ex game. A few Tomb Raider games. Skyrim. I would have finished Morrowind if I hadn't lost my save. Fallout 2. Justice Sucks. There aren't many more.

So when I tell you I did finish The Riftbreaker AND that I immediately started a new save, it  really means something. Your mileage may vary, of course.

Also, you might want to check X-Morph, another game from the same studio, a great blend of tower defense and shoot them up that served as the inspiration for The Riftbreaker's first DLC. Just so you know, I also finished that game ;)


[Edit] Apparently my review is marked as very useful for now, so I'll add a few more info for you folks to read. You might have noticed some negative reviews with only a few words about ""no coop yet"". So let's clarify.

I've been followig this game long before its release, and it was never intended to have coop. It was thought out as a solo game. But the community asked for coop, and the devs said they'll oblige. They never said it would be quick and easy, though, on the contrary. It's really hard to add multiplayer features afterwards.

They've been working on it for a while, providing us with information about their progress now and hen. They've streamed work in progress coop gameplay, prettyrough around the edges, but somewhat functional, and explained why it really wasn't ready yet. It's not there yet, but it's on the way.

So, the people who say they feel cheated because they were promised coop soon seem to deeply missunderstand the situation. The people who claim that we will never have coop are either liars or very missinformed.

And the people who leave negative reviews for the sole reason that coop isn't there yet as an attempt to review bomb a most excellent game, just because something really not easy to do that the devs are working on without getting paid extra for isn't fast enough for their liking... Well, I have no nice way to express what I think of those, so I'll rather say nothing. Let's just say that I strongly disapprove of that behaviour.",1685037405,1685572759,True,216,5,0.922700405120849609,0,True,False,False

Unlike Factorio, there's no optimization to be done in the fields of resource flow and space management, just the maximization of production directly into a global inventory.
Which isn't a deal breaker for me, as I can enjoy romping out on expeditions with the mech suit just to enjoy some hack 'n' slash exploration... Only, portals are available from the start, cheap to build, and free to use, so there's absolutely no stakes in it. On top of that, I really didn't get the sense that my main base could ever be made ""safe"". It seemed I would have to be babysitting it constantly with ever-increasing aggression from the fauna. Coupled with defense of outposts, and limited resource deposits mandating constant outward expansion, the air of tedium took hold fast. When I know that all I'm working towards is new toys from a tech tree with limited novelty in their deployment, I'm probably not going to enjoy my time.

The REAL kicker for me was being incessantly proselytized to by the unlikable player-character avatar about environmentalism, and in the worst voice acting I've ever heard, no less. From the very beginning, it was constant bickering between her and the mech suit's AI, which was much more reasonably solely concerned with their survival in fighting off the waves of hyper-aggressive fauna.
When the premise of the game is extracting an alien planet's resources while blasting back hordes of zerg, I don't enjoy being passive-aggressively lectured on how what I'm doing in the video game is wrong.

The main campain is to short and the DLCs are way to expensive for what they offer.

It is a fine tower defense game.
Where it stands out from the billions of others is the fact one jumps between maps while reccources are being collected automatially. Not like factorio for example.

Gameplay wise it is fun. The weapons feel decent and most have a purpose. Same for the turrets.

The dialogue is written authentic, but the line delivery of the lady is... worthy of improvement. It is better than the avarage game, but still not good. She does not feel natural. Almost like she is reading the dialogue.

The story is actually good. I am so sick of having a ""real"" antagonist.
This one is just a colonisation of this planet while the ""antagonist"" is the enviroment.
It is fine. The stakes and goal make sense and are well communicated.

Survival is exactly what you would expect. Nothing more and nothing less.

The DLC is really short and the writing is not as good. I hoped for a style similar to the Protoss from SC2. They attemt of having a hight lvl of speech, but it is clearly not researched.
I would not say Metall Valley is a waste of money. I did not regret the purchase, but would not reccomend it for the full price.

Now what kills it for me:
It is buggy. Enemies and the player can glitch through some walls. Sometimes walls are just passable.
Liquids still do not work properly. Looking specifically at the Gas and Liquid compressor/decompressor.
Energy connectors do rearely not connect. Recources are not correctly calculated or even at all by the harvesters. Really wanky.
It opens a Web-Helper that plays teh trailer on repeat. Affencting your CPU.

I would love to see an ""endless mode"" (survival is just boring) where one has to protect and prvide energy and water to the human colony that arrives while it slowly expands.

If you are Intelligent, tactical, like strategy, fast pace, top down action shooter, melee, tech trees, building amazing def, sandbox mode, with almost unlimited replay value, with a a crazy amount of variables, then this is the game for you.  try it on easy mode, try it on hardmode, try it with unlimited resources, try building the perfect defense and sending endless waves crashing on your def.  Cheat and use codes to be god.  Don't cheat, man up, and grind out tech, and balance income / exploration, technology, and power resources.  So many options.  Try a def with all flame, all basic towers, all lightning towers, all weird advanced AI def.  Try no def and just YOU be the def, your Mech.  How could you not like this game?  Add slow waves so you can chill and rebuild. Add fast waves so it's almost death and chaos always.  Add no waves so you can just peacefully look around and hug trees and bugs, and build a nice cupcake base.  In my humble opinion, it is a very very fun game, and the developers literally stream a lot and constantly try to make it better.  What more could you ask for?  Well i guess Bacon.  You could always ask for more bacon.  But not Soggy Bacon, or too burnt crunchy bacon.  That spot just right between not fully burnt, but not too soggy, MMM.

First off.  Its very unclear when I'm in controlling the bot vs build mode.  Doesn't do any damage to the buildings, but damn if I'm not unloading a lot of ammo on my own stuff and have to scramble to figure out how to get into base building mode.  Even after playing an hour I couldn't say, I just hit a lot of common keys.

Next, shift is commonly use for ""multiple of the same thing"" in a base builder but s instead used for some kind of ""launch to the other side of the screen"" thing which is totally unexpected.  Remapped that ASAP to a key I'll never ever use.

Last and possibly the worst.   I wish I could prevent the admin console from EVER coming up - or at least bind it to some very esoteric place.

Research takes too long, it takes too long to upgrade your mech.

Needs more tutorial-like resources to bring the player up to speed quickly. Things happen slooooowly. Therefore, don't make the slow speed worse by slowing the player down by not explaining things.

It takes too long to upgrade your mech or anything else. There are some cool weapons and towers, but I'm not unlocking them anytime soon. My mech is too weak and can't be out for long without needing repairs. Perhaps a better research curve where there are some quick things to begin with but things start to spread out and then you have to build more research facilities to keep up the pace, etc.

The two biggest issues with this game, that thankfully have bypasses available via the console, are that missions just sometimes break. There is a mission in the game to get a resource called Tanazanite, and that mission seems to break for a lot of people, myself included. The other is there simply is not enough information present in a lot of places. Wonder why a building isn't working? Tough luck. Google it. What is the ""campaign objective"" needed to be done to do some research? Pffft. No one knows. 

Otherwise, you are put in interesting locations and have some interesting problems to solve throughout the game. The combat flows very nicely and there are just a ton of weapons to use.

This simply is a breath of fresh air and easily separates Riftbreaker from the rest of the dross. 
  And bizarrely enough, the above comments are only based on just how enjoyable the playability of the game is and nothing more. 
  However, when one also considers just how beautiful the alien worlds, their fauna and creatures are; you really have a shining example of how to make a game that just lets you escape from real world challenges and difficulties. That is not to say that if you do want to give yourself a challenging fight for success, the game can't provide that... oh no. The ""Survivalism"" mode can do just that and then some, turning an easy going exploration into that of which great strategic command is compulsory to ensure your victory.

  Quite simply put... Riftbreaker is essentially:
Tower defense + Base building + PVE + Exploration, with a vague sense of RPG (if you consider the Mod drops from enemies as loot), which ultimately gives you an awesome casual escapism game.

It shares similarities with Factorio, but with a stronger focus on base defense. There are several positive aspects, such as the presence of impressive buildings, a storyline accompanied by voice acting (though occasionally cringe-inducing), and a variety of melee weapons. However, there are areas that could be improved. For instance, I often find myself constructing the same defenses around my base repeatedly, and it would be beneficial to have a blueprint system to streamline this process. Additionally, a search function within the tech tree would be helpful, as sometimes I am uncertain if I have already unlocked something important for the story. The inclusion of different biomes adds a nice touch, but the long loading times disrupt immersion and make the new areas feel disconnected from previous gameplay. Despite the abundance of weapons, it feels as though the choice of weapon type doesn't significantly impact gameplay as long as you cover different damage types. The cultivation of minerals should also be better explained within the game, as I wasted a considerable amount of time pursuing ore deposits instead of utilizing cultivators. In summary, this game builds upon successful ideas from its predecessors while offering its own unique gameplay elements. It diverges from Factorio's logistical focus and instead emphasizes combat against monsters in action-packed sequences reminiscent of top ARPGs. The satisfaction derived from battling monsters is unparalleled, and the game excels in providing intense defense scenarios akin to Dungeon Defenders and They Are Billions. The campaign resembles the overworld of Anno 2205 or a collection of Terraria world saves, allowing players to teleport between maps with diverse biomes and establish bases while completing quests. Rift Breaker represents a sophisticated amalgamation of concepts rarely seen in AAA titles, embodying innovation and a fresh approach. While some may argue that Factorio is superior or that Riftbreaker has been simplified, these claims stem from a misguided need to prove superiority.

It can also be frustrating to deal with the constant attacks, comets, events, and everything else when you are trying to build a supply chain. It often feels like you are being interrupted to deal with some annoyance.

I'd recommend making good use of satellite bases and keeping your construction small and efficient as possible to minimize the area you need to defend.

On a serious note, the game is awesome, a mix of base bulding, top down shooter and strategy game. I love it. The only thing I can point as ""bad"" is that Exor Studios really (REALLY) loves Bloom Efffects and Shiny lights. They should start to turn it down or put a specific option for people with sight problems, with out compromising the quality of the game.

Another thing is that they are pumping DLCs (or Ideas for it) really fast. More content it's always great, but no if you push it just for the sake of money. Somethings can go easly as free updates.

You essentially get 2 very different games with the Campaign and Survival mode despite having just one sprawling set of mechanics just because of the huge pacing difference. And as I've often seen on YT those attract very different crowds.


Campaign:
Basically Valheim with a more agile Supreme Commander ACU as your player controlled character. And all the bells and whistles that come with that sci-fi setting. Power management, supply lines, tech research & NUKES! :D
Don't neglect to defend your base from the occasional alien (uhm technically local) hordes, but you are free to explore, expand, decorate and optimise at your own pace hopping between different interconnected maps on the planet.
Story is not much just a framing for more exploration to ensue, but Ashley (you) and Mr. Riggs (mech suit/ AI companion) are charming.

Survival:
A more condensed experience, action aspects crancked up to 11 with shorter research time. Instead of the local fauna's attacks being scaled to your progress as the campaign, your economy and defence have to keep pace and hold the line against ever larger hordes until Riftbreaker Command can get you the hell outta there.
So the tower defense and ARPG combat elements become the dominant aspects defining the gameplay. Even the procedurally generated map turns from a ""wonder what gorgeous land do I find next"" to a frantic look for key resources and defendable strategic locations.

Both modes are also very customizable besides the preset difficulties with many options regarding enemies, resources, research time and more for a personalized experience.


Also the 'paywall' structure - if I may use a dirty word to praise the studio's customer friendliness - is great:
Prolouge(tutorial level) is available as a free demo.
Once the DLC dropped, many QOL additions were added to the base game as a free update, even the new biome is playable for survival, just it's campaign integration left as the paid DLC.",1679921732,1679921732,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Any event that happens has at least 3 separate audio sections, which get annoying quickly, as things are happening almost constantly. For example, rain: ""It's going to rain soon!"" (wait 10 seconds) ""It's raining, our solar panels are less effective!"" (60 seconds) ""It stopped raining, our solar panels work again!"". Events like this happen constantly and have a lot of accompanying audio alerts with maybe 2 dialogue variations. I would turn these off, but turning off audio alerts also turns off alerts like when your base is being attacked. An entire defensive line can be destroyed and you won't notice. At a minimum, event audio alerts (rain, fog, etc.) shouldn't be grouped in with important alerts (base damage, earthquakes), and there should be an option to reduce the amount of dialogue contained in alerts so you don't get tons of dialogue for every little event.",1679877499,1679877499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Introduction[/b]

Fellow Decepticons, as we all know, our quest for energon has taken us to many different planets. But have you ever considered what it would be like to [i]build[/i] a base on one of those planets? Well, that's exactly what you get to do in Rift Breaker, a game that takes the classic tower defense genre and adds a healthy dose of resource management and exploration.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

In Rift Breaker, you play as a powerful Decepticon tasked with establishing a base on a planet rich in energon. The catch? The planet is overrun with pesky organics who want nothing more than to destroy our efforts. But fear not, fellow Decepticons, for we have access to a wide array of weapons and defenses to fend off these nuisances.

The game's resource management system is particularly impressive. Every action you take - from building structures to researching new technologies - requires energon, which must be harvested from the planet's many deposits. It's a delicate balancing act, as you must prioritize what structures and technologies to invest in while also defending against the constant onslaught of organic attackers.

[b]Graphics and Sound[/b]

As a Decepticon, I demand the best of the best when it comes to visuals and sound. And I must say, Rift Breaker delivers. The game's environments are stunning, with richly detailed terrain and vibrant colors that truly bring the planet to life. The sound design is equally impressive, with powerful weapon effects and ominous organic growls that really sell the danger of the situation.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Overall, I highly recommend Rift Breaker to any Decepticon looking for a fun and challenging tower defense game with a twist. With its satisfying resource management mechanics and gorgeous visuals, it's a game that will keep you coming back for more - especially if you're on the hunt for some energon. So, fellow Decepticons, go forth and conquer!",1679553847,1679553847,True,7,3,0.552626073360443115,0,True,False,False

In addition to its numerous aforementioned merits, The Riftbreaker boasts a superlative economic system, seamlessly interwoven into the fabric of the gameplay. This astutely designed component further enriches the player's experience, as they deftly navigate the intricacies of resource management and strategic planning.

In conclusion, The Riftbreaker is a veritable magnum opus, an enthralling amalgamation of ingenuity, stimulating gameplay, exceptional community relations, and unparalleled economic acumen.

It's a building survival game meets tower defense, meets survival, meets resource management, meets RTT/RTS, meets action RPG, meets hack and slash. The genre mix is nice but sadly makes a PVP/versus multiplayer games close to impossible.

The campaign is great, the lore and story aren't super new and unique, but very interesting nonetheless. 

The environment are very well made, the visuals are clean. It feels good to face the sheer amount of zerging enemies on the map, and relatively easily wiping them out but I'm sure someone (who doesn't have an RTX 3090) might face some fps drops with a lot of building and zergs. But design wise and diversity of fauna and flora are very impressive. And those highly affect your energy harvesting, defense dependency and weapons immensely.

Sometimes the game slows down when there are a lot of enemies to fight or some chaotic environmental event. I believe this is intentional.

The DLC only adds an hour or 2 tops top the game.

Finally, I highly recommend the game because first it's very well made and second, the indie studio very well deserves thumbs up and support.

Oh, one last thing... When in doubt, run double Mini-Guns!

What more can I say about this game than that it is the future of real time strategy games. Long have I been in wait for anything to stand up to the juggernauts that are the building blocks of RTS games, Warcraft 2, 3, and Starcraft 1 and 2, and yet nothing else seems to scratch the itch quite the same. True there are others that are great, but none so defining, none so redefining and trend setting as those, until The Riftbreaker. 

This is by no means hyperbole, although it is strictly my opinion, but regardless, if you are on the fence about this game where I was at, wondering if it will scratch the itch that Blizzard so harshly has turned itself away from, and the wait for the myth that is Stormgate feels too far off, double down on picking this absolute beauty of a game up.

A word on the co-op, or apparent lack there of thus far as of writing this review; it will be amazing, and it will add a whole new layer of depth to the game, and I am looking forward to it, whatever the end result will be, but I imagine an endless survival mode with a friend in this being like an RTS hoard mode/ roguelite that will keep me coming back for more. This game is a 10/10 without the co-op. Again, I thank Exor gaming for taking the time to make an immaculately polished single player experience that stands alone as a solid enough reason to play this game, but the co-op will accomplish the impossible and make this an 11/10.

I went with thumbs down because I don't really feel the game lived up to my expectations, and because it seemed like it was trying to do or be too many things at once, and as a result, did and was each of those things to an inferior degree than it could have.

To start off, the central question: Was it fun?  Yes.  Yes it was.  I enjoyed it well for the several dozen hours I played it, but it probably won't be earning much more than that in terms of gameplay time from me, sadly.

The core issue is what the game is trying to do or be.  On the surface, it seems a bit similar to Factorio (or perhaps Satisfactory).  Procedurally generated map, set up automated production, defend against progressively worsening AI attacks.  But unlike Factorio, the [i]automation[/i] side is limited to just automated mining, with very limited automated production (which is really just, slap down a sufficient number of the dedicated building for that purpose and call it a day).  There's no transport logistics at all for solids, and for fluids, you basically just have water and plasma, and precious little reason to mass-produce either (and for plasma, the late-game Fusion Power Plant just gives you astronomically more than you'd ever need [i]in addition to[/i] power), much less in a centralized location that would require the ""pipe spaghetti"" of Factorio or Satisfactory.

However, layered on top of that is the mech suit you have, which is both massively more powerful and substantially more customizeable than the Factorio engineer.  In fact, the central driver of the tech tree is focused on two things: making [i]you[/i] more powerful (or, rather, your mech suit), and making stronger defensives, with the former generally being a larger presence than the latter.

And that, tbh, is where the major crack appears.  See, running around in a super-powered mech suit blasting everything that moves is, to be honest, incredibly fun.  But the game itself seems to be oriented around making these large megabases in order to support the [i]economy[/i] you need to make yourself super-powered.  To an extent, it felt a bit like the only reason to have that base element, the automated mining and (limited) production and everything that went with it, was to give you something to defend, some objective you had to nanny.  And to be honest, it's silly easy to build up your base and overdefend the perimeter wall and literally never worry about hostile wildlife except when you need to go venture around for a new output. Which is actually really sad, because the mech combat piece is, imo, the most fun part of the game, but it's far too easy to avoid it entirely.

Now, in Factorio, the Biters were a limiting component on your expansion size and industrialization.  They directly scaled with how much pollution you were outputting, and remote outposts needed to be heavily defended because it would take you so long to get there to help.  Not so in Riftbreaker.  Not only can you instantly teleport anywhere on the map that has a teleport beacon (which cost essentially nothing to place, and both can be and are [i]openly encouraged to be[/i] by the game help text to be peppered literally all over your base), but you also get additional maps spawned through the orbital scanner, in any of 4 biomes (the base jungle, a poison swamp, a volcanic lava crag, and a scorched radioactive desert), and can have remote outposts on up to 8 of them.

However, outputs and maps (including your main base) cannot be attacked unless [i]you are on the map[/i].  Whichever map you're on (with one exception, to my knowledge), will have periodic attacks against you or your base, but none of the others will.  So your outputs don't [i]need[/i] all those defenses.  You really only need sufficient defenses for the period you're there setting it up, and for any time you spend there expanding, and those ""defenses"" can just be stacked walls and your own mech guns.  So your ""main base"" can be tiny and incredibly heavily fortified, and with your outposts doing all of the heavy lifting in complete safety.

In addition, the enemy attacks don't scale to your industrialization, instead scaling to your progress (though the specific trigger or metric for the scaling isn't clear).  And this is [i]super weird[/i], considering a [i]central theme[/i] of the game is the ethical contention between efficiently strip-mining the world and its resources (which is explained as making the wildlife angry), and seeking to co-exist with nature.  In fact, the game has two entirely separate resource generation models, one where you find ore patches and stack miners on them, and one where you instead set up farms of Cultivators and Harvesters to grow plantlife that provides those resources.  And the farming side is [i]overwhelmingly superior[/i], too.  Not only is it [i]infinite[/i] (unlike ore patches), but it also allows selectable resources, and can produce 4 super-rare resources that otherwise can only be gotten by doing hot/cold scavenger hunts with the Geo-scanner, or finding and killing specific types of plants or wildlife that drop them, and both of those have crap drop-rates.  And yet, even if your base is entirely devoted to sustainable production using the plants native to that planet, the wildlife still attacks you just as ferociously.  Some lesson.

Lastly, the game just wastes your time in many cases.  You need to bioscan things using this green laser beam to build up ""familiarity"", and the game makes a point of ensuring you understand (multiple times, no less) that the bioscanner is way way more efficient for gathering those biological samples than killing enemies for a random chance they drop the DNA (~10%, in my experience).  But the bioscanner requires around 4s per target to scan, and you need dozens or even hundreds of DNA samples to rank up.  Ranking up familiarity unlocks some research (though I didn't notice any that required more than familiarity 2) and the ability to farm that plant, and increases the yield you get from killing those creatures or destroying/harvesting those plants.  And yet it takes [i]forever[/i] to scan all of the things you need for that, even when you get the predator cloak and can run around entirely invisible to scan hostile wildlife.  This is literally hours of time that the game wants you to spend that's [i]not[/i] building up your base and also [i]not[/i] roaming around in a superpowered mech suit slaughtering masses of enemies.

You also have random events occur that deal damage to either a portion of or all of your base simultaneously, and the existing repair tool is simply a ""drag over buildings to instantly repair them, one by one"".  There's automated repairs, but they're both expensive and limited range, and thus not practical for repairing an entire map worth of power connectors or an entire base worth of buildings and walls and such (especially since, as above, you don't [i]need[/i] those defensive repair buildings at outposts that can't be attacked).

Basically, it's a fun game, but it's trying to do too much and as a result doing all of it worse.  If the game had firmly decided to be a top-down twin-stick mech shooter, where you murder plants and animals for resources to upgrade, it'd probably be even more fun.  If it'd tried to replicate the Satisfactory or Factorio logistics style, could have as well.  But trying to do both, you end up with each element not feeling fleshed out or deep enough, and the various elements often competing with or entirely eclipsing each other.  It's fun for a spin, but by the end I found myself wondering why I wasn't just playing Factorio, Satisfactory, or maybe PoE et al (which is, to an extent, what the mech combat felt like, except twin-stick style controls instead of click-to-move).",1648473915,1678393054,False,87,5,0.753848373889923096,0,True,False,False

On top of that, there's a poor balance between resource requirements, defenses, and what you're actually supposed to defend against.  I've been building all over the map, trying to keep my base powered, full of resources, and well-defended.  But you can't do it.  Everything has to be well-defended against enemy attacks, but between the mineral cost, power output, and the AI hubs, it's physically impossible.  Yes, there are ways to upgrade all of these things, but in order to do that you need to spend entire hours researching all the prerequisites.

Having played the prologue before release I was absolutely stoked to see it come to fruition.  The game itself is an enjoyment and you'll find the initial offerings and time spent rewarding.  For such praise, you might be surprised to see a negative review here; the problems that the game has as it progresses change an enjoyable experience into something very different.  

To begin with, the crashing has been a bit of an issue for awhile now.  It comes and goes, but it can be exceptionally frustrating when it happens.  That said, if this was the only issue, I could look past it.  
The biggest problem for Riftbreaker is its' combat balance.  The game will fluctuate from easy to challenging to manageable... and then your base gets wiped.  I'm not even kidding there, I went from holding my own to completely bulldozed multiple times.  If I understand what's happening correctly, after you open certain other areas, the game incorporates the monsters you encounter there into the mass waves that attack your primary base; this isn't done with the mindset of your tech, and as to whether or not you have the tools/weapons to fend off mass numbers of these new creatures.  They are coming, and if you aren't prepared, (didn't open the right areas in the right order, or prepare for the massive spike in difficulty before the wave shows up) your base will be annihilated.  

In games where good design for challenge falls short, internal exploits are used to create challenge instead.  
I call this, ""artificial difficulty.""  It would be something to introduce a rarer variant of monster that takes more punishment, it's something else entirely to spawn 50 of said "" rare variant"", and throw them at your base over and over again until you finally develop the tech to repel them (assuming you survive).

Too hectic for my taste. Can't focus in the game you constantly need to go and do X and/or Y event is also happening and/or Z is happening and your base that isn't really even completed doesn't even have walls is being destroyed by mother nature.
Pretty graphics but they also feel a little overwhelming of particle effects, flashy lasers and explosions and its rather hard to see anything at all in combat. Hard to tell how much ammo your towers have and how hard the enemy is actually going to hit you, not to mention where they will do it.
 Maps are random so sometimes its nearly an empty wasteland where you need walls everywhere and sometimes there are nice chokepoints and then no resources in the safe areas.
Tech tree is extensive, except getting things out of order = death.
Not to mention how the game actually works. You have walls and turrets? Get ready for ranged enemy spam that out-range your turrets on all flanks. You build the long range turrets to stop them? Get ready for tanky mob spam that your artillery turrets will all fire at before they hit the ranged. Only solution is to manually go out and kite enemies yourself so you don't get rolled; except your mech is so powerful you can just fight the wave all by yourself so why did you build these useless defenses that do nothing slow down the enemies, just spamming enough walls to give yourself enough time to go around the whole base may be a better option...",1676495951,1676495951,False,9,3,0.46145203709602356,0,True,False,False

Not because I hate it, but because I've had my fill (for now) and I've seen pretty much all there is to be seen about the game and its first DLC: Metal Terror.

The good: 
Visually the game looks amazing and it doesn't take much fiddling to run it at solid 90+ framerates on my old trusty GTX 1080, the soundtrack is pretty good and changes with the tempo and the whole game is narrated and explained properly. 
There's multiple aspects to the main gameplay loop, and they're all played through from your trusty mecha-suit Mr. Riggs, there's an enormous amount of basebuilding, exploration and gathering of resources to expand, upgrade and maintain your base. There's three enormous techtrees to research and unlock weapons and equipment, building upgrades, mobility skills and the stuff you require for the main quest or make your life easier.

Now the main ""meat"" of the game is in the combat, and there's a lot to talk about there, there's different types of damage you can deal and a lot of ways to deal them, this ranges from the basic sword and rifle dealing physical damage, to a railgun and nuke launcher combo that deals electrical and explosive damage in a wide area.

Additionally there's all kinds of mods you can find which improve multiple aspects of the weapons. You'll need them too, as the game likes to unleash massive hordes of enemies into the map for you to slaughter. There's a large variety of enemies in this game and some more in the DLC, all with different strengths and weaknesses that require the use of different weapons to kill, some indiscriminate use of excessive firepower is recommended.

The bad: 
I'll list some small issues I had found, none of which were game-breaking: 
Some visibility issues through large decorations (though they're working on a fix it seems)
Trees that kept respawning through metal floors, only stopped respawning after building something on it (weird)
In every map there seems to be a weapon of sorts on the ground pointing north, can't pick it up (weird)

Now I did run into something game-breaking, but it occurred in the Metal Terror DLC, at some point you need to connect a pump to something and it just wouldn't register as being connected, rendering me unable to resume the quest line for the DLC. I did manage to fix it myself by restarting the map through the console, but I doubt everyone would've found that.

I do have some gripes with the game though, and that's with the way it will never just let you build your stuff in peace, there's always some random event going on to interrupt your ASMR basebuilding experience, especially if you don't have your defenses in order it just gets a be little too much. There's some problems with the damage scaling too, I'm not sure what affects the tiers of enemies coming after you, but I've often noticed a ""spike"" where enemies suddenly became much stronger and more plentiful. The second time around it didn't affect my as much as I knew what upgrades to take.

The last point would be the narration, though it's done well and is very functional, they just keep talking forever, during my last few sessions I turned off narration, I wish there was an option to just get the essential notifications.

Conclusion: There's a lot to this game, and if any of the above sounds good to you you definitely can't go wrong for €30, it has a lot of content and a fairly high level of polish, (haha) it's still actively being worked on and runs well on my system at least.

Edit as of 2023/02/12: after giving the game another go, having seen some changes to some problems (such as the farming of resources anywhere being fixed...sort of, as you still can just farm your resources on biomes not meant to be housing them en large) I have come to understand what one of the problems was when I played the game in the past: namely pacing and what you choose to do

the thing is in this game you can either go forward by farming existing resources (as in, making more, not the literal definiton of planting farming) and thus expanding your infrastructure, researching better things and getting better that way, or you can go to aquire the 3 rare resources (palladium, uranium and titanium) in order to improve some existing things (gas power requires palladium, geothermal requires titanium) or make entirely new forms of buildigns (shield generators, fusion generators, super artilery), and if you only focus on aquiring the basic resources (carbonite, ironium, and i count cobalt in it too) the game will not be as fun

in terms of strategy there is not much, but the thing that i have been neglecting in the former playthrough was just enjoying the moments of slaughtering hordes and enjoying the visuals of them being spread everywhere as well as actually getting out into the world and visiting the new areas rather than just base building at the main base

in adition, having spread out over both the desert and the acidic swamp, combined with doing the missions to aquire the special resources for the weapons, I have actually ended up without any fancy toys and just with upgraded basic weapons, with fights being a chore stopping me from getting the resources I wanted via cultivation. however, now that I actually focused on one resource and got the things associated with it, getting some of the (maybe not best, but the flashiest) weapons, I started to (somewhat) look forward to fights, which made me feel like a smal deity raining death in all forms upon everything on the planet

so, ultimately, what I would say the game's biggest flaw is is not that it actually isn't fun but rather that it easily allows a player to optimize the fun out of their game, not stopping them from being a d**b*ss, though if there were things put in place to stop them it would take away the freedom from the player, so I guess this is just something that has to be accepted (the devs did however already make it better in that regards)

my opinion: buy the game on sale, and enjoy what is effectively speaking a binge day or two of playing the game with it's stunning graphics. do not expect a complex game, but rather try to look at it as something to play with less tactics or sweaty gaming in mind (unless that is what you want, there are difficulty modes as well as hardcore so you do you) and more with just enjoying the scene unfolding, with a side of base building",1637944199,1676161822,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the game is good, there are a few things that I didn't really like about it, hence it sadly isn't going to move to my Favourite's list. And look - if there's a lot to say about the game that you enjoyed playing, it means that it left an impression and very few games do leave an impression on me these days.
I do however hope that we'll get to see Riftbreaker 2 or a similar game from EXOR Studios. Well done!

What I really liked:

* The core gameplay loop is great;

* There's always something going on and there are a bunch of things to do around the map;

* The sound design is qutie good and the music fits the game as well;

* I really liked the idea of establishing outposts and mining stations around the planet that have different resources, and that all the resources are then sent to your HQ. Each ""zone"" is unqiue in resources and enemies;

* The game probably runs on black magic - even when my screen was packed with enemies, my FPS didn't even drop by 5 FPS. Or at least I didn't even notice that the game would slow down. It's insane how polished this game is;

* Building, connecting buildings and figuring out what goes where is real fun (when you do it right, of course);

* Moving, shooting, slaying enemies feels responsive and smooth;

What I didn't really like all that much:

* The game doesn't explain how to do stuff, so I had to resort to finding things out on the internet. And there's been a lot of things that I couldn't find answers to within the game, like:
- How do I equip mods for weapons? - Aha, you need to upgrade a weapon of your choice in the Research tree and you'll be able to craft a better version of it. Only then can you add Mods to it.
- How do I connect this water producing building with another one? - Ah, you need to build another building, then another one and then connect them with the pipes! Ok, got it.
- What does this green symbol above the building mean? - Storage is full. Ok.
- Why can I not research the Alien stuff? - Oh, I totally forgot to build Alien Laboratories. Would have been nice if the game has reminded me to do that!

You see, there have been a lot of things that I just struggled to understand because the game didn't show me any tips, warning signs - nada. I'd have enjoyed to have a guide like ""Frostpunk"" (with pictures and descriptions), which I can look up at any time and understand how stuff works. How to connect different buildings (for example with pipes), how weapon upgrades work, etc.

I understand that I got to figure things out since I'm all by myself on the planet but optional in-game guides would have been awesome. I also struggled at the end of the game and spent like an hour or so trying to figure out how to get something done. It was frustrating.

* Dialogues. Too many dialogues really about nothing during the first half of the game. Fortunately, that slowed down in the second half of the game.

* I'm not sure if I'm a fan of small patches of resources scattered around the map. There are no infinite sources of Carbonium or Ironium so I have to run across the map to build mining stations, build solar panels and wind turbines, and have them destroyed by an enemy wave unless I spend even more resources to build the defence towers. It just started to grow old on me in the second half of the game. I'd have preferred to have at least those two basic resources be inifinite (so I could mine them up to X speed) at the base and if I wanted to get the resources faster, then I'd go an explore.

* While I eventually got used to the UI, I do believe that the Research Tree could at least benefit from ""Ctrl+F"" function. It's not that easy to find what you need.

* Building a whole lot of buildings is fun but I would have preferred that I could merge mulptiple buildings into a big one (like solar panels or wind turbines) or have the option to unlock like a ""master building"" that could take the same amount of space as multiple buildings but function as one.

Myself, I am more into the twin-stick shooting part, not so much into the tech-treeing part... this is barely about the maximum amount of ""terraforming"" that I can tolerate.

Straightforward game, action-packed, doesn't take itself too seriously. The scientific names of the alien species are hilarious. It has modding capabilities and people use them.

It has built-in benchmarks, which is more than most AAA games offer. Technically, it does most things right. The game engine brings plenty FPS in my Ryzen 5800 on the benchmark, and delivers all the blood and explosions that Age of Empires 4 didn't have. Hundreds of thousands of kills, and that is not counting the towers! This game is just a rampage. I mean, this lady and her mech put the Doom slayer to shame.

What is not so good:
- Not quite good for a handheld or controller. It's almost there, but too many options, and you will probably want a mouse for building placement (build walls quickly, build a bunch of towers in less than a minute...). This game is actually a good fit for those half-keyboard-controller hybrids with a thumbstick.
- Performance remains stable since launch (on DX11), but still has some crashes. Performance on DX12 got a bit worse since the big patch.

It looks good, some of it is fun, but the meteors and hail storms just make it into a tedious pain in the ass. Not because these events cause damage to your entire base, but because your repair tool is awful, and there's no game mechanics to alleviate the issue either.

The repair towers are too slow, and if even feasible, it will be a long while until I can spam anywhere near enough of them. 
The gameplay has turned into running around like the janitor of dumbfuck nowhere, and the exploration becomes meaningless repetition. I'm supposed to push out towards the next objective, but I'm just annoyed and still trying to fix this stupid bit of fence.

I'm going to play Factorio instead.

Edit 03/02/2023: 

Gave it another go.
They fixed the repair tool so it's less of a pain in the ass, so it's good to see they work on the game and improve it. However, I'm just too bored with the overall gameplay to even find out if they improved anything else.

After finishing the main story I do have a few things that could be improved in the Quality of Life area. 

- Easier defense setups with blueprints
- The whole liquid compression/decompression was a bit cumbersome. 
- Some buildings don't seem to have a point. Like the bio harvester. 
- Redundant energy grids aren't possible as the connector won't snap to an already existing grid with more than one connection. So sometimes if during an attack one of your energy nodes dies it's hard to say if there is a backup or not.
- maybe an alert when resources run out in other outposts

I did have to watch a few videos and look several things up before I was able to beat the game on Normal difficulty. 
Half way through the game it gets much harder if you don't do specific things.
Towards the end game it gets pretty impossible unless you know some tips and tricks. The waves are just too insane compared to the first half of the game.

Here's a couple big tips I learned.

The game scales off of the level of your main Headquarters building.
Every time you level that up, a much larger wave of enemies come very quickly, and all other waves are now harder than before. Make sure you're ready before you level up your Headquarters building. Level 1 and 2 of your Headquarters aren't too bad, but by level 3 you'll notice a big jump. By level 4 you really need to have your defenses in good order. Don't be afraid to take your time. I spent alot of time in other locations while researching everything I needed. 
You don't have to worry about enemy attacks when you're in different locations. 

Once you can afford it, build your walls two layers thick. At mid game I had several layers of walls, some with one space in between them. The space is good for those enemeis that cause splash damage, which will happen more and more as you progess. By the end of the game I had 5-6 layers of walls place around my towers. Even some decoy walls place a bit further out so the enemies would be drawn to them and it would slow them down a bit.

Final tip was how many attack towers you'll need later in the game. On my first play through I didn't use nearly enough towers and kept being over run.
By mid and especially late game, you'll need many attack towers, healing towers, radars, and walls. This is why it's important to build all of this before you upgrade your Headquarters.

Story is good, progression is awesome, as it can happen at your own pace.
Replayability is high between the modes as well, modded or otherwise.

I liked the warping feature, and the turrets having limited ammo, along with the player, really means you need to pay attention to logistics as well as just spamming down turrets, which isn't always the easiest in some biomes.

The storyline is quirky and provides a reason to progress without railroading you too much. The hero / mech you play as feels powerful but not overpowered, and as the game progresses you need to actively upgrade it and seek better weapons to survive fights. Base building is relatively simple but due to the constant attacks you need to make sure you're defending bases adequately when you're not there. The main gameplay loop consists offinding enough of the right resources and balancing power, defence, storage and advancement on your main / satellite bases, which requires exploration and some planning/thought, but isn't overly technical or hard.

In the beginning of the game, Ashley (the main character) and Mr. Riggs (the mech suit AI) have a bit of a disagreement: Mr. Riggs says they should just blow everything up and mow their way through the native fauna, while Ashley says they should be stewards and conservationists so they don't wipe out native animals, like we've done with Earth.

There is no debate.

You'll mow down thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of native creatures. Your defense towers -- Sentinels, Miniguns, Artillery, Laser, Plasma, Mine Towers, Lightning -- will slaughter hundreds of thousands more.

Whether you enjoy the game depends on how much you like that core gameplay loop: Slaughter and build, slaughter and build, occasionally interspersed with upgrading equipment.

There's no real narrative to speak of, the voice acting is serviceable, and you're not going to interact with anyone else except Mr. Riggs.

Rift Breaker does a few limited things, but it does them well. I enjoyed the game, but I would have liked to see more variety. YMMV.

One last thing: There are certain missions/build goals that are not well described and can be frustrating. If you find something isn't working and the game isn't offering you any clues as to why, just open your browser and find a Reddit thread or a Youtube video. You'll save yourself time and frustration.

Once on XBox Game Pass, the second time on Steam (where it's much more affordable and absolutely worth buying to support the devs.) More of a hack and slash with base building and defending elements, this game does both absolute justice and it keeps getting better with more DLC. My only qualm with it is that it has some basic shortcuts to starting buildings and turrets, and you can get pretty far with just those buildings and turrets, but later on in the game (particularly after completing missions where you can farm new ores) you will be learning some harsh lessons if you didn't take the time to obsessively go through the turret menu and build one of each kind of turret every ten steps. I've also had some fun times with the desert ant enemies running THROUGH entire segments of walls just to bite your inside buildings. (No other enemies can do this, but given that I've built an 8x8 section of solid wall where some ants run six walls and start biting the seventh, some run two and start biting the third leads me to believe it's some buggy behavior. Possibly also with valleys given that this section of wall was built in a purposeful chokepoint on non-traversable terrain.) Really late in the game with all enemy types rushing your primary base you will see hard game slowdown thanks to the enemy count but even then it's still very playable and beatable (I hope you set up all kinds of turrets though!)

It definitely has some similarities to Factorio, but it is very much it’s own thing. It feels much closer to some of the custom RTS gamemodes I’ve played than it does to Factorio.

The gameplay loop consists of gathering resources, expanding and upgrading your base, and fighting enemies. That sounds like ever survival game ever, but it does play quite differently. Rather than load your base with walls, traps, and crafting stations, you load your base with more RTS style buildings like resource producers, turrets, and healers. When I say load, I mean load. You aren’t going to do very well with a few dozen turrets. My base probably has 100s of turrets to defend against the waves of enemies that come. Speaking of the enemies, I’m impressed with how they are optimized. My whole screen can be filled with enemies, to the point that many other games would get pretty laggy, and I only get a minimal performance hit.

The game also has Steam Workshop support, which is always amazing to see and should give me something to play with after I beat the story. The story in this game is pretty much just a way to get you to visit all the areas and go through the tech tree. It is fully voice acted, which is also always nice. The voice actors and writing is all fine. Nothing great, nothing bad. This is really a game you play for the gameplay, not the story.

edit: After 21.6 hours I have beaten the game (Original review was after only ~13 hours). Overall, I still think the game is great.

However, in this case, I finished this game and all the endings (yes, there's multiple and some choices lead to things).  I won't spoil how, or how many, but I thought it was cool there's many.

The game itself has all the elements I like in a game.  Tower defense, top down shooter, base building and resource management, crafting, upgrades, you name it.  The research tree on some things requires you to actually go collect and find things in order to research them, which means if you want all of them, you have to explore and it's encouraged.

You'll also find as you go through the game that setting up your base in certain ways matters.  Resource counting matters later on because if you run too low you might need to eventually go back to an outpost and fix it and get more (you probably will anyway).

You will find that as you get better weapons, things get more expensive, but a whole lot more fun.

Certain enemies have certain resistances, and there's often various species of them, meaning your loadout on one planet may not work as well on another.  So choosing your mods and loadout carefully are also important.  There are a TON of weapons to choose from, and you can vastly change them up based on mods.  Not only that but you can also mix damage types on some.  [spoiler]But let's be real here, the nuke launcher is mvp once you get it leveled up[/spoiler]

The sounds are very good, though the end game cinematics seem to have really low volume and I have no idea why.  Either way it's a minor gripe.  The special effects are well done, weapons are well done, the graphics are nice, smooth framerate.  The only time I ever experienced any real framerate issues is if I was in some end game defense with waves coming from all over and projectiles flying everywhere and even then it was pretty minor drops in framerate.  I'd say it's very well optimized.

I would say if you like a mix of tower defense, active exploration, resource management and base building, as well as a storyline that's actually well done, you would probably enjoy this game quite a bit.  Honestly the storyline got even crazier after I started one specific mission I had neglected for so long and then it changed entirely.  It was like going down a rabbithole after each mission more and more.

As someone not into strategy and simulation, this game is INCREDIBLY addicting. It plays more like a tower defense with elements of survival game base building (reason I say survival game base building is because much like Rust's decay system and repairs, you need to maintain power and repairs in this game) and luckily it is EASY to take care of and once it is done, you're set! I honestly couldn't recommend this game more, especially if you are looking for a good time killing game with a fun story that plays on while you are doing ""yo thang"" so to speak.

Explore a cartoonishly hostile alien planet that you're supposed to be opening the portal to colonize, despite the fact that it features hordes of venemous/carnivorous/aggressive/teleporting/fire-throwing/acid-throwing creatures on terrain that ranges from plains covered with acidic yeast to volcanoes where the rules of gravity are in flux. Questions of why a future that has mastered teleportation hasn't mastered planetary scans aside, you get to build and bash through a small set of maps and kill hundreds of creatures with a huge variety of weapons. To support you in this, you can build a dozen+ types of towers to kill the creatures in various ways. The graphics are lovely and bright and action feels great - punchy and satisfying.

There are a few downsides - one, a script that features some dodgy text and some voice lines where the emotion doesn't match the context. Likely, the VAs didn't always understand what they were recording. Two, the game is kind of over-the-top with its events. You are almost never left alone. It's as if the game fears you might be bored, so it's constantly throwing wind storms, solar storms, attacks, meteors, fog, and all manners of crap at you.

The biggest thing is that despite the fun it does become a bit of a chore. The alien attacks eventually become huge, the number of towers and walls needed escalates (especially since attacks can come from any side of the map, meaning the amount of territory you have to secure is pretty big), and the consequences from a breach become demoralizing fast as your non-defense buildings go down fast.

I'm 30 hours in and have had fun, but I'm not sure I feel the pull to go back and finish even though I think I'm pretty close. I just hit a point where I guess I don't want to put in the work of building such a large network of defenses as required to hold off a horde of aliens made of stone, flinging acid and spewing fire.

I was cynical of this game at first, giving a negative review. Coming back to it, it's pretty alright. The cons are still present, but in terms of game quallity, this game has it.

Pros:
The mech feels amazing to use. Guns, flamethrowers, minigun, there isn't a weapon I don't enjoy using.
The game constantly has you doing something, something has to be done.
Base building feels like it's needed, but I have solo'd waves before. Forget if there's difficulty, so this would be on normal if so.
There's looting which doesn't matter as much, but customization is pretty cool. Can slap on attack speed and other things onto weapons.
Tech tree is extensive, plenty of stuff to grab.
Guns have ammo, but if you have the output, you can vomit resources to keep your ammo filled even with constant use.

Cons
Sometimes there's a bit too much things going on. Feels like the game at times is trying to slow you down rather than be an enjoyable experience.
Can be a con or a pro, but having to remake a base every map does get tedious. Would be nicer to have a bigger map with all the resources on it.
It feels rather easy to speed through the tech tree. Granted, when you make a base and then just get that resource without having to worry about defending the structures making them (on other maps) that tends to happen.

If you like games like They Are Billions, I feel like this game is sorta like that. It is more traditional RTS with a hero that does everything, but towers and building walls is kinda in that vein.

This is not an automation/factory game. This is a tower defense game.

Secondly, the game is absolutely unbalanced and broken at times. Thankfully we now got mods to fix that.
Here's an example:
I rushed to upgrade defences. I had extra resources and I decided to be ridiculous and make 5 layers of walls, with a line of rockets, artilary, flamethrowers... it was insane. Then i get attacked by a massive group of Golems. They destroyed my walls in seconds, as if they were paper.

Another example:
I was told there was an unusual monster and I should investigate. Until i set out to go and kill it I had to deal with waves of enemies almost non-stop. By the time I finished repairing there were new waves. I had to ignore the HQ defense and go hunt down the monster.

Another super annoying thing is that everything is dirt cheap, but at the same time you need like 100 to get anything out of them. Not, exagerating, you need over 100 wind turbines to generate enough electricity. Tons of storages... Why can't things be more expensive but 5x more effective?

Pros:

 * Incredible visuals, especially for this genre. Raytracing in an isometric game offers a visual style that is very unique at this point

 * addictive and fluid gameplay. There are very few bottlenecks in the gameplay. I found myself playing for multiple hours during one sitting because it's easy to get lost in the various upgrades/events/basebuilding.

 * Controller support. Even though I play exclusively mouse and keyboard, this is appreciated

 * The rift jumping mechanic is such a welcome addition to this genre

 * Combat and defenses are streamlined and much easier to set up than other games


Cons:


 * Controls are a little weird in my opinion. There is a combat mode and build mode, but multiple keybinds take you into the build mode. I would expect a single keybind to switch between combat and build modes and then a separate set of non-intersecting keybinds per mode.
 
 * The UI needs work. Some of the UI elements such as the upgrade tree do no scale very well on larger resolutions. I would love to see the upgrade tree receive larger icons and more clear pathing.",1672783385,1672783624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Impressive graphics, almost make you don't want to burn everything organic in nature. Then again, the fire looks great too
* Strong combat elements.  Exploiting enemies weakness is rewarding, but you can also manage without it and it isn't even tedious.
* Strong tower-defence elements. Large variety of defences, most of them useful, some work great in synergy to others if you give the effort.
* Base building is somewhat interesting. Several trade-offs exist and require stragetic planning.
* The concept of the campaign was nice. I wanted to get to the end and see what happens. The campaign is fully voice-acted.
* The campaign worked as tutorial, but also had some nice moments in it.

Cons:
* Some bugs. The game randomly starts as black screen and needs to be rebooted. One mission in the campaign didn't progress and I had to use console commands to proceed.
* Another review promised ""Factorio/ RTS"" elements, but this was misleading. The basebuilding isn't near factorio level, connecting pipes is as close as it gets. And you only control one unit, this isn't RTS.
* The Campaign was too chill for me, even when starting off with Hard difficulty. It's too easy to abuse the mechanics, travel to a safe zone and grind all the resources you need without any risk. 
* Survival mode on the other hand is too short. Much of the research tree won't be accessible in survival mode, including some of the most interesting setups (like the shield generator).

graphics: overall, the game looks great. go figure. the environments are detailed, have decent monster variety, and they cover a good portion of the overall mario level spread. the only times the level hung up was when the game would save, or in some combat heavy sections. the 2 things i have to complain about are the UI in the equip menu. it looks like a mobile game. it's just, not great. giant colorful icons that wouldn't be out of place as buttons on a touch screen. the worst part? no other menu in the game is like this. ah well. the other thing is how long the game hangs up when saving, no matter what you're doing, the only thing i have done to combat it is going into the pause menu when it first starts saving.

gameplay: the entire build system is seamless, it's never too much effort to build things, by the time i stopped playing, it could build an outpost in 5-10min depending on what i needed it for. the depth is just deep enough to keep my hooked, but not so deep i got frustrated, if i wasn't doing something the way i wanted, it was usually on me to look at the tools available. the cut, upgrade, and repair tools are very useful, the only thing missing is a copy paste tool so that i can instantly build sections of prefabbed base, as the closest thing available is a tool that let's you select a single specific item to build so you don't have to thumb through the menus. combat wise is around the same level, you can't just blitz the game from the start, but if you haven't built defenses yet, you can protect the base on your own. not a whole lot of depth, but that's okay. 

other stuff: the game was a mostly bug free experience, save for a game-breaking one that i will get to later. the story is alright, it serves it's purpose, not why i'm here anyway. the mod support for this game is great, both mod.io and steam workshop. honestly a good feature. the multiple campaign save system is nice, since it eliminates the need for that to be a mod. price point is good, but it's worth even more on sale, and the DLC is great, it offers a great change of pace and it's unique biome is pretty cool. as for the game breaking bug i encountered happened near the 60hr mark, i was setting up plasma converters following decompressors, leading into compressors for supercharged plasma, and i set this up in the DLC area, but upon trying to use it, i couldn't, figured this was a DLC area, deconstructed them, set them up in a different biome, and couldn't even select plasma for the decompressors because for some reason the plasma was still being sent to the decompressors that were deconstructed, and setting this up in a third biome somehow made it worse, here's hoping the devs see this review and fix it, but otherwise, let this serve as a PSA to not set up decompressors in the DLC area. i'm recommending this game despite these issues because it took this long for it to happen, and i'm confident now that it will only be a problem once now that i know this. thanks for reading :)",1672630050,1672630050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

    first starting out there are too many upgrades the game doesn't go through and tell you anywhere near desired upgrade path.  i straight out almost have base, and weapon upgrades completely maxed out, but haven't even unlocked the first row of the third tab. i have made my entire base massively self sustaining on the first map before i ported over to a different area. new areas have no reason to be. i go over flatten out a huge area. build walls solar/wind/storage/AI cores then turrets around my base. then set up mining and energy to resource conversion make sure i have enough energy and storage to max out and not deplete to zero at night or weather days. and repeat.  i have beaten the whole idea of the game with using  nothing except the starting resources and mostly beginning turrets and weapons. i can clear out 100% of every world mindlessly and there is no end of that since there are 8 other places for me to go to and do again.    now i can see upping the difficulty.... but all that does is make yourself weaker doesn't actually make the game more enjoyable. then get to a point  where you have to build x amount of this and y amount of this at exactly the right time to be doing it right. that's just pointless to me.

game has crashed 3-4 times on me so far.  that's unacceptable  for a game over a year old. i'm just done. game has no point of actually playing  

does it look good.  yes. the majority of the game looks and moves and plays well. targeting and AI works good. there is just really no reason to play the game.  my single wall slap dash together turrets. which use 2-3 of the very first resources you get. i haven't even gotten like 5 resources and could sit in my base for 4 hours and just watch my base destroy everything that comes towards it in repeating cycles.  i can up the difficulty till i have to work hard to get my base strong before it gets destroyed... but even if i do that.  i'd still have a self sustaining base that destroys everything that comes it's way.

[b]What I liked?[/b]

1. Voiced Dialogs - Thats a big hell yea, you know these games like I dunno, Lost ARK, they have story, but its like text only, when you start you read it cuz you are curious but as the game goes you spend tons and tons of time reading long tabs of text, even when the game throws a tutorial at you, its text text text, its disgustin. Riftbreaker has voiced tutorials, or whenever you enter a biome, or an mushroom explodes under you, both characters will explain things to you and have a bit of chatter meanwhile, such a lovely thing to listen to, big plus, love it.

2. Technology Research - Theres an progression system, you start with a steel sword, barely able to cut thro bushes n trees and you end the game with fokin railguns n what have you. You have to build things, gather materials, gather research all while the characters explaining to you how things work. Notifying you when your research que is empty so you can put new things in, the progression is very lovely, makes sense, makes you wanna see what kind of supercool tech you find in the next area.

3. Resource Management - As you find new ways to build things, new materials to implement, you create all sorts of buildings. You have like what, more than 10 buildings for energy, 10 buildings for this, 10 buildings for that. You dont need em all, but you can use them, love how you get options to manage how your base works or how you collect your materials. Dont have to build mining refineries, you can just grow and farm the resources, or maybe there are some other ways? Energy, Solar, wind, gas, plasma? Magma? Just choose your path yea.

4. Visuals - Graphics n whatnot, everything looking gorgeous, altho the animals or creatures attacking you usually look the same as the one's you found in different biomes, they just have a toxic variant or jungle variant, things look similar, but they do look wonderful even if they have minimal changes, each of the biomes change drastically. I absolutely love the way things look while bein build, or effects like gravity grenades make things fly around while disorting the whole area.

5. Combat - As simple as it is. 2 Hands, each hand can use one of 3 weapons at a time. One hand has a flamethrower, other one has a laser sword, then dependant on rarity of the item you build for yourself, you can mod the weapons. Flamethrower can have 30% freeze, 90% more spread therefore slow yet still burn its targets. You can mod the Mech itself having smol drones helping you, repairing buildings around you, destroying projectiles shot at you, theres a huge variety of things that can be done. Didnt have drones flying around me last time i did my playthro and on this recent one I had 3 helpers, such a lovely thing to be able to change how you want things to work for you, altho it requires bit of time.

[b]What I didnt Like.[/b]

1. Survival Mode - After you finish the main story you can go in survival mode, but its bit broken. You start with nothin, three weapons, primitive rarity, no resources and like every 7 minutes on Normal difficulty, you get attacked by steadily stronger waves of enemies. Super weird, prolly not intentional cuz you will survive it 5 times, but it gets so ridiculously difficult i dont see a way anyone would be able to survive it with what the game gives you in there. Luckily Sandbox mode or Custom can be made where you can specify details.

2. Bit of Inconsistency - The whole thing goes with: ""Resources you gather on this planet will be stored in your global storage"" meaning you can travel on different places while your resources gathered here and there are still bein gathered. With the Metal Terror dlc you get to store a specific liquid resource, but it does not get stored in your global storage when you leave the area, meaning you have to stand there and wait for it to get collected and then you can move somewhere else where you can pull it out and use. If you dont wait for it, it wont get stored, buuuuuuuut thats prolly just a minor bug i found to be fixed in next patches, right?

Overall, in my head, high quality game, love my time i spend in and i still come back even tho i played thro it, rumor bein they plan to add multiplayer, so hell yea cant wait.

As most other (positive) reviewers have pointed out, this game is not a strong looter ARPG or Factorio-like strategy game individually, but it combines those two disparate genres almost perfectly. In the early game you really can get a lot out of going out on hunts and popping open the cocoons that drop resources and useful items. There will be times when you are waiting for something to research, and the carbonium is going up too slowly. That is when you want to go beyond the walls of your base and play the ARPG aspect of the game. Once you have researched what you need to research, and unlocked the next element in the campaign, you return back to base to make use of your new tech. It is a unique game in this regard.

Your mech (Mr. Riggs) can be upgraded and configured substantially. There are many weapons in the game to choose from: acid throwers, cryo cannons, plasma guns, medium calibre rifles, high calibre rifles, rocket launchers, and many others. Even melee weapons, so you can destroy the beasts like a Terminator from Warhammer 40,000. The power fist attack is goofy as hell, though. You can also upgrade Mr. Riggs with auxiliary items that increase his movement speed, build time, health regeneration, and more. Unfortunately I feel like movement speed is the only worthwhile upgrade. You cannot tank many hits, especially in later parts of the game, even when you boost your health and shields substantially. Avoiding danger through speed is therefore superior, and also allows you to navigate your large base a lot quicker.

The campaign is fun as well. You are continually introduced to new biomes and occasionally game mechanics at a decent pace. You do not get stuck in the same boring jungle for dozens of hours. Most importantly, you always know what the next logical step is, so you are not wasting time chasing dead-ends or building superfluous installations.

Unfortunately, all of these great elements of the game take a rapid nosedive around the time you explore all the biomes and build outposts in each of them. You will notice something really rather annoying, and will be shocked to find out that there is no way around it: the deposits of all elements in the game are nearly worthless. Now, don't get me wrong. Of course the starting area (HQ) should have limited resources, so you are incentivised to build outposts outside of your HQ once your HQ's resources are dry as bones. That is completely logical, and good game design. The problem: [b]the other areas' deposits are the same size as your HQ's deposits[/b]. Yep. To give a concrete example for some perspective for people who have not played the game already:

The largest deposits of carbonium, the most needed resource, are around 20,000 to 25,000 units of carbonium ore. I need to emphasise that they are very rare. Most of them are between 7,000 and 12,000 units instead.
 
Level 3 carbonium factories, which you should have by the late game stage, produce 4 carbonium for each unit of carbonium ore. This means that most deposits, when occupied by level 3 carbonium factories, will yield between 28,000 and 48,000 carbonium in total before depleting. If you find that rare large deposit, it will be between 80,000 and 100,000 carbonium. Level 1 carbonium factories have a 1:1 ore extraction rate, so surely level 3 carbonium factories should be enough to run your operation, right? No, not really. Here's how much carbonium buildings require; buildings you need to beat the game:
[list]
  [*]  [i]Level 3 fusion reactor[/i]: 26,400 carbonium. Considering that the Rift Station, the final object of the game, requires extremely high amounts of power for nearly five minutes to successfully activate, you need at least two of these. [b]52,800 carbonium[/b].
  [*] [i]Level 3 towers[/i]: approximately 800 carbonium. Considering that you will be attacked from all directions when the Rift Station is running, you will need several hundred turrets. In my case, I needed 300 of them, which means around [b]240,000 carbonium[/b].
  [*] [i]Level 3 carbonium factories[/i]: 924 carbonium. With the previous elements in mind, we need a substantial amount of factories to extract all the needed carbonium without having to wait for dozens of minutes. Let's say we install 30 of them. That's [b]27,720 carbonium[/b] tied up just for the extraction of carbonium! You get full refunds, but... goððamn.
[/list]
This means just for the final object of the game, not including all the auxiliary elements I am not including for the sake of brevity, you are looking at depleting [i]up to twelve[/i] carbonium ore deposits. Let me say plainly: it is just as tedious as it sounds. It was boring. Now, people who already played the game might be tempted to say: ""Why didn't you just use carbonium synthesisers?"". Yes, I did convert two of my outposts to carbonium synthesisers, appropriating the existing power infrastructure, that was used on the now-empty deposits of palladium and titanium, to power them. I still ended up with only +60 carbonium per second, which is far too slow. I could build more of them, but then I would need more power-generating structures to power them. What do I need to build more power? Oh, right... carbonium, which I am short on already. Carbonium synthesisers are completely meaningless. The hilarious part is that the developers clearly saw that you would be desperate for carbonium to build carbonium synthesisers, so carbonium synthesisers do not require any carbonium to produce. It would make sense, if only every single power-generating structure in the game did not require carbonium.

Keep in mind that this applies to every other resource in the game. I did not ever bother with nuclear power plants until I activated the Rift Station, because deposits of crude uranium are laughably small.

All of this could have been alleviated by simply introducing an area or two which contain substantially-sized deposits. I would not mind at all building an outpost, or even two outposts, if it meant securing a steady flow of resources that doesn't dry out in twenty minutes. Even better, why not just make the new areas have much larger deposits in the first place? If it meant those areas were very difficult, and had constant enemy raids to balance out the abundant resources, fine. Just give me anything to make the game less of a chore to beat.

It doesn't help that some very useful buildings in the game require a [i]constant[/i] inflow of resources that are already scarce simply for construction use. Heavy artillery towers require [i]constant[/i] inflow of supercharged plasma, even when they are not firing. Simply maintaining a small set of heavy artillery towers will drain up your titanium storage in less than twenty minutes, and this is no exaggeration. For this reason, I never used heavy artillery towers until the last minute of the game. Shields also require plasma. I never used shields in the game for the aforementioned reason. You can turn off buildings that consume resources, but it is almost meaningless, since you cannot do it remotely, or automate the process of doing it for multiple buildings at once.

I also never figured out how one procures ferdonite, hazenite, and rhodonite in sizeable quantities. You need those resources to build the last level gear. This means I never got the top level gear, but it did not seem necessary to beat the game. Strange.

All in all, the early and middle game of The Riftbreaker was a thrill, and I thoroughly enjoyed every hour of it. It was all ruined by the bizarre and counterproductive game design in the late game, and that is a shame. The game is still being actively developed, and I hope that they change this, because it is just awful. I had no satisfaction from completing the game.

It has 3rd person shooter and tower defense elements too, but it feels like more of a hero RTS to me with all the resource gathering and base building.

I really enjoyed the campaign the first time through. But, unless you want to find out how difficult the campaign is on higher difficulties, there really isn't any reason to do it again. The only things that carry over to subsequent campaign playthroughs are skins (and if you beat the Metal Terror DLC a melee weapon). So, that's a downer to me.

Survival on normal in the first biome was a little nerve-wracking but doable. But, wow, the latter biomes whoop my butt, even on easy. Maybe I can do it after tweaking my build order and optimizing my actions, but so far, ouch.

The devs are still creating new content for this game and just recently rebalanced the survival mode (making it more difficult, lol), so there is more fun to come in 2023.",1671086954,1671086954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes it is pretty awesome to play. feels sick to decimate thousands of enemies and building up your base to exploit the world.
No, this isnt a very complex or intense game.

if you enjoy simple base defense, then this is what your into.
If you are someone who enjoys complex supply chains and factory setups aka factorio/satisfactory. this game is not for you.

the game very much lacks depth in every aspect of its gameplay. research is straightforward and dull. only really getting the same sword but just better. getting the same gun but better. and getting the same tower but better.
supply chains dont exist outside of power, liquid and plasma needed for just the basic high end stuff.
a fusion core needs water which then gives energy and plasma for example. plasma gets used for shielding or insane range artillery. because of the simplicity of it the only thing limiting your expansion is the game instability.

some of the cultivation outposts for example create crystals that entirely break your frame rate. 
smack it with the hammer and the particles alone multiply a thousand fold and have you enjoying a cup of coffee, a movie and your firstborn before it fully recovered its frame rate.

weapons and mods are a pain to exhange, armor upgrades are a bore and just straigth forward. but changing them out between construction setup and combat takes far to long. this metal terror dlc is extremely underwhelming in my opinion but at least adds a bit of content.

honestly had hoped that after the rift had opened, i would be tasked with building up the collony or perhaps improve the situation more. but instead it jst ends. all things considered its not a bad game but i had hoped for something more factorio like. the simple nature of this game makes it very difficult to replay this game. unless i really want to raise the difficulty higher and put on ironman. i dont believe there would ever really be a situation where one would be feel the heart pounding.

overall, fun but lacking. would suggest if you enjoy basic base building.

You start off and there is a timer before the first wave shows up. I don't see how there is even close to enough time to get ready unless maybe you know every single thing about the game and can create what you need without any time to learn. Otherwise, you are trying to figure out what you need to do and you are hearing - make 6 turrets. Make an armory. Oh, you need more AI cores. Your defenses aren't strong enough yet, but have no idea why you need these things and you are just reacting to what you are being told. 

So you hurried and built your armory, but there's no time to figure out what it's good for. You built it because you were told you should, but not why or what it does for you and it's too late to figure it out now as the first wave is attacking. You were told that you need to build 6 turrets, but after 5 you are told you need more AI cores - and then told you need more power before you build the cores. So you need to increase your power gird AND build AI cores so you can build more turrets. On top of it, you need iron as well as craponium but you haven't been told that. You just figure out while upgrading that you need it when you are told you don't have enough.

Of course the iron ore you need is outside the defensive line you've been putting up and since you didn't know you needed iron (or that it was even on the map) you didn't factor that into your defense.  

So the start of the game is you running around with your pants around your ankles trying to do a back flip while cooking cooking breakfast before guests, who you've been informed of 2 minutes prior to their arrival, show up. Your zipper is down. Your shoelaces are untied. The doorbell is ringing. Someone is yelling 'you are not prepared'.  And where did that big green portal come from? Oh, wrong game.

Later on they add environmental events like meteor showers or whatever that poop on your base and destroy everything. So if you built things close together you'll get smacked. But if you built them far apart -then you can't defend and you'll get smacked when a wave comes in. Unless you've played and failed already you won't be able to prepare.  

I've tried 4 times to play this game and it's the same thing.  Running around like a chicken with your head cut off. There's no strategy because you don't have time for planning.

Mr Riggs,  I'm a fool and I have no clue what I'm doing. 
Yes Captain,  that's OK because I'm so dumb I eat rocks
That's right Mr. Riggs. Let's open a taco stand and sell to the aliens life forms to show them we are friendly.


Oh, the banter is just so funny. When they say they are 'missing a few parts' I'm guessing brains are on that list.

Maybe there are people who like games like this, but if you are always behind the eight ball and no matter what you do you always get a curve ball that ruins whatever you were trying to accomplish, then it's not a 'strategy' game.  This should be called a real time confusion game.   


Mr RIggs, what do you get when you cross Mr. Potato head with a singing watermelon?
I don't know captain.
Either do I, but it just ate our HQ ...

One piece of advice though. If your familiar with Factorio best you put the difficulty up higher. Cause in Normal mode the game is way to easy. Brutal was hard in the beginning but once you have your groove on its challenging but fun.

More DLC is on the way and the Devs listen to the fans when possible. (On gamers request they added massive artillery)

The game loop is very addictive. The blend of genres feels unique and works incredibly well. The combat is intense, the base-building is thoughtful, and exploration helps break up any monotony in the first two.

There's always more for you to do, thanks to the large tech tree, increasing enemy size, and interesting campaign. Yet it never feels overwhelming.

There is a ton of variety as you explore more biomes, and areas of higher difficulty. Each biome can require significantly-different base designs, preventing you from falling into the rut of a single strategy for every situation. Sometimes I build many individual outposts, sometimes I build one or two big fortresses. You need to adapt to whatever resources you are provided with.

This game also gets huge bonus points with me for being made with a custom engine.

**The few cons I can think of:**

It does slow down a bit when there's a lot going on. However, to be fair, the combat gets *really* crazy. Plus it seems like they do some sort of time slowdown to prevent you from losing track of the combat.

its not a hard concept. 

2-4 people depending on how big the map is. 
2 people gotta have anywhere between 4x4 and up and 3 to 4 people have 6x6 and up..
have a trading system for your ores.. this way its not a pool and people start freaking out over lost resources
 perks and weapons are bound. 
have scaling system for monsters 1 would no no scaling and 4 would be full mods on the monsters with extra attacks.. 
if 3 or 4 people the spawn are x2 no matter what... you scale that shit to 500% but x2 it with 4 people.. now that's what i call ""brutal"" 
 its like when ""no man sky"" came out.. i liked the game but it would be a lot better to shit talk a buddie while his base gets fucked up by a muck monster or the endless hordes of monsters.
 also with 4 people have the last day a wave of monsters like normal. but right at the end a fucking ""troll"" pops out of the middle of the map and just starts walking towards the base with over 2 million health. or something just dumb. "" gotta make it hard for the boys ""  

also its a wicked chill game. so more players it would make it more relaxing.. so please. can you lazy fucks get off your ass and put multiplayer in. becuase its getting boreing being alone. and some random dumb ass being like ASHLEY BUILD SOME WALLS! 

so i do recommend this game. needs alot more.. still feels lackluster.. needs more disaters. needs more monsters.. a quests spawn. i kill it. no more spawn for half hour.. other then the waves.. so i get bored. and either altf4 your shit. or ragequit and go play GOY eldenring.. tis my rant for today.

The Good:

The Campaign was awesome, it introduced the basic resources and mechanic of how the research works and what the basic materials are without feeling like its being baby feed to you. Progression was in an almost perfect pace, the second you get board from one place you where told you had to go explore some other area of the word to get closer to finding the resources needed to initiate the rift and on the way introducing new mechanics with each area you found. The way that these new mechanics where introduced was also well done, it was always smoothly introduced and for an reason that made sense to the progression of the campaign. Really enjoyed how the bio scanner had a use outside of just lore bases and instead was used to gain this greater understanding of what is happening and the environment around us is an another amazing touch to really give the game more flavor and set it apart from other games in the same area. The Tech tree is also really well done, separating them instead of forcing them all together is an really nice touch and alien tech was a super cool concept that was excecated beautify, yet again giving more value to those who decide to investigate things with their bio-scanner instead of just blasting everything in sight, added much needed value to what would have otherwise most likely have been forgotten. The ending was cool [SPOILERS AHEAD SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH] but the secret ending was even cooler, given how Ashly obvious had interest in making this world sustainable instead of just another place for humanity to ravage, it would make sense for her to have some doubts when she had the ability to choose the future of this planet.

The DLC was integrated really well into the campaign and opened up an door of opportunities for the Devs and modders alike to work on the loose end that was introduced. The enemies where a cool concept and again, where introduced well into the game along side,
the rest of the content, Not much more to be said it was honestly really good love the new resources and buildings.

The Graphics are also absolutely stunning: the day and night cycles, Expositions, debree, ragdolls everything looks stunting. (edited)
[10:13 AM]
Everything else:

Riftbreaker slightly struggles with introducing newer players to the genre, with no tutorial outside of introducing the basic resources and mechanics in the Campaign, it leaves newer players a bit lost on how things should progress and what to do next, I myself
don't find this an issue as I love RTS Strategy games and understand the gameplay loop but I did notice a lack of guidance, however I believe these introductory things should not be integrated into the main campaign (as it would cause it to lose a lot of immersion)
but instead give an option on the difficulty screen to provide additional assistance for newer plays in similar fashion as enabling hardcore.

As it currently stands, brutal suffers from an issue that all higher difficulties do, it feels like it doesn't do much other than inflate the health and amount of enemies you fight, its common approach that really doesn't add much to the game and is a very tedious 
way of introducing difficulty, For example: in survival jungle, instead of spamming Arachnoids you could introduce the Baxmoth earlier along side Gnerots and Nurglax to make the fights harder without needing to just spam enemies that all get countered by the same 
thing.

As it stands outposts feel like they are little monstrance areas that just supply you with resources without having you invest into anything outside of miners and minor defenses for when you are at the outpost, as when you leave the outpost has no threats and 
seems to not scale in difficulty as long as you aren't there. [I realize that you are looking into making waves spawn in them even when not at the outposts but thought I should bring it up none the less]

Replayablilty is a bit on an issue, not because of the core game lacking, but mostly due to the lack of options which is understandable for an game so early into its life and I'm sure more will be added to spice things up like an endless mode for example [Coop when?].

And that's it, Overall the game is really well done, defiantly worth the money and has the potential to become even better as the Dev team continues to work on it.

Overall the game is fun if you like Base Building & Tower Defence and Isometric Combat games. I should warn any potential new player/buyer that you would be forgiven for thinking this game was actually in Early Access without being sold as Early Access. The developers are currently going through a phase of trying to expand and build on the games functionality and have been for months, with months ahead on their roadmap of the same, and with that they are releasing an update every week, or other week what fixes everything they broke the previous patch, but creates the same amount of new bugs elsewhere, that will get fixed the next week and the cycle continues. There have been times I've not played for weeks waiting for specific things to be fixed. They do publish an experimental branch before a wider update, and I don't know what these people are testing and in how much detail, but plenty gets though the net. 

You will also need a decent system to run this what would seem to be a relatively simple game. On default settings my graphics card is using near max VRAM at all times (nearly 8GB worth) and runs at 90-95% utilisation at 144hz vsync 1080p. The recommended specs on the store page is a RTX 2080!? an enthusiast level card... so core optimisation issues they keep saying they are working to address as an ongoing process, this is also the reason its not Steam Deck verified as far as I can tell. 

They have developed and built their own game-engine to run the game, and not using a mainstream tried and tested so I don't expect this to change anytime soon.

I may re-visit the game upon the release of the next DLC, but for the time being I'm tired of worrying if I'm going to be able to finish a playthough when the next patch is applied to the gamefiles.

There is a demo on the Store Page, I'd recommend you try it first.

One of the best comparisons I had for this game is propably a mix of factorio-light and a tower defense game where you control a combat mech with quite a bit of modular abilities.

The gameplay loop of creating a base from scratch isn't evolving much, but there are still some researches I didn't do. The emphasis is more on the survival and combat capabilities of your mecha/exploration of new zones (exploration of new zones having few variations objective-wise).
Maybe all this will be expanded upon (having as of yet not played the first world expansion in campaign mode). I think I'm quite close to having seen everything the campaign has to offer. Mod support and coop will probably give a much better replayability down the line, but this build is already solid.

Some details to know:
- This game can have A LOT of models on the screen in case of a large invasion of local fauna, making the FPS plummet until some of them are killed by your hand.
- The mix of different gameplay styles, mixing tower defense and ressources extraction, and management of those ressources, is quite seemless. But the gameplay loop could use a bit of diversity.
- Already a good amount of different biomes on which you'll create outposts to collect ressources you don't have access to in your HQ, each one of them with a few functionaly different enemies (excluding DLC).

[b]The Good[/b]
1. Core loop: The Central Mechanic of build, explore, exploit, defend, repeat is rock solid and pulled me right in. My humble little base grew into a fortress over the course of the game, and as I got new tools and refined my methods upgrading and rebuilding was a breeze. Compared to Factorio building a working economy is incredibly simple, which could be good or bad depending on your tastes. I think it serves the games focus better then if it made me spend my time between waves optimising belts.

2. Mr. Riggs Gun Show: The frantic run and gun combat felt good if simple initially, but as I got new weapons and encountered new threats it quickly gained depth as I began switching between my arsenal on the fly to best exploit my enemies weaknesses as they encroached on mass. I haven't played through on hard yet but some of the weapons like my favourite the chainsaw felt almost overpowered with how it could trivialise whole groups of enemies. But even then there where enemies who would punish me for leaning too hard on it forcing me to adapt my tactics as a fight went on.

3. The World: Galatea 37 is brought to life with 4 distinct biomes packed to the brim with unique enemies, challenges, and dynamic fauna. Each area has a unique resource that you need to progress and you will have to master its layout and subdue its locals to succeed. Visually the game looks really good and the small touched like scavengers coming to feast on the remains of your latest battle really helps to bring the world to life. 

4. Power Considerations: Here's something Riftbreaker does that Id love Factorio to pay attention too. Weather matters and how it affects your power production creates new and interesting problems. Be it a dust storm blocking out the sun but increasing wind output, to an intense desert heatwave damaging your buildings but giving you excess solar. This does become less of a problem as you progress and your power grid becomes more varied and robust, but I feel thats a victory the player earns against a hostile environment. 

5. Story and Characters: While I didn't really stick with the game because of its characters or story Ashley and Mr. Riggs make a good pair of leads with the occasional bit of back and forth. Story wise there weren't any real twists or turns, although I really liked the framing of having to do exploratory missions into new areas and track down resources before I could plant my final base in the area. Not a main draw but a solid addition.

[b]The Bad[/b]

1. Exploitable Aggression: One of the first things you'll realise after leaving the cradle of your starting map for the first time is that the enemies don't really have a problem with your base. They have a problem with you really only you and so long as you are not in a biome you can consider any base built there 100% safe from creature attacks. Now I understand why, it could get really annoying to need to drop whatever I was doing to go check on my 3 other bases all the time. But I feel like some sort of mechanic while Im away so I don't just need to pop back in to refresh my miners could be nice. By the end I was just plopping down mining factories with one long extension cord back to my base because I knew that it would be perfectly safe

2. UI Troubles: For the most part the UI works perfectly fine, but the crafting and mod pages are really cluttered for some reason. A way to sort craft-able gear by rarity would be nice unless I played 30 hours and just missed it. Mods just get a really long drop down menu with a few filters, and for the amount of mods I had by the end it felt like a hassle to sort through them.

3. Gardening: The Cultivator and Harvester buildings are a great idea though one I feel that was really underutilised. While being able to get rare crafting resources by cultivating alien fauna is cool and it makes great use of all the different plants you can find, it really feels unnecessary because the thousands of enemies I was slaughtering also happened to drop these ""rare"" resources. Maybe if I made a whole base around cultivators it could be worth it but in my playthrough at least they felt very underwhelming. 

4. Bugs: While the game was perfectly stable 95% of the time I did have one crash in my playthrough and the bio scanner seemed to break a few times. Nothing damning but should be mentioned. 

Overall I enjoyed my time with Riftbreaker and Im sure I'll grab the expansion for another playthrough in the future. Its got a nice blend of base building and combat and Im sure I'll definitely be back for more.",1669358717,1669358717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Along with building your bases and teching up, you will be exploring new maps and biomes, each with different quirks and different sets of enemies. The biomes require totally different weapons to conquer, which helps to keep things fresh. 

The other great thing about this game is how well the devs have been supporting it. There is an active discord community, and the devs have put out a great survey for fans to suggest new features for the game. They have brought plenty of new features as free updates to the base game, while new content has been added in the form of the Metallic Valley biome as paid DLC.

Came back to this game and tried again, this time the updates fixed the rift jump bugs and allowed me to move to different biomes and collect the advanced materials. Lots of fun, then I progressed to end game rift event and after making every check box green for the final rift/battle I did not have the option to activate the rift startup sequence. Tried rebuilding everything and still not able to. 
Got on the discussions and found other players were having the same problem as well. Some were able to find a manual workaround outside of the game that either triggered the event or messed up the save file. 
Either way the game is still too buggy to get a recommendation. 

It's a shame, it's a good game but the bugs have rendered it unplayable for me and this far after release I doubt the devs care enough to fix them.

Game is not ready for release, bugs kill the experience, not the alien bugs. 
Autosave files are massive and generate corruption errors which stops gameplay and may erase your progress (you'll find out when you boot up again and try to load). 

It's a shame as there's an excellent game under all of the bugs that I keep trying to play.

More content and overhauls on the horizon including the much coveted co-op mode, which is a very promising addition to a game like this that would be a great experience with mates. Well voice acted as well but dialogue tends to get a bit heavy on the exposition sometimes.

No, you don't get to create mind meltingly complex conveyor systems to max production or train networks for resource transportation. The game approaches these in a more simple manner. Resources gathered are automatically added to a global resource pool, production is as simple as plop a mine down on some ore, boom, you're mining. Some may hate this, totally ok, as the games combat is where it fills the gaps of ""what to do""

The combat is a typical ARPG isometric affair but it runs real well, enemies explode with satisfying impact lightning guns make you feel like palpatine and nuclear armaments for those times you just want them all to vanish. The games emphasis on exploration of your environment is what makes it work. From your special metal detector for finding anomalies. The various missions you get from orbital command, the researching of different alien wildlife and fauna to further produce more methods of resource gathering. The game also causes enemies to fairly frequently assault your bases from various sides based on your actions or various RNG elements. Base defense is paramount as this games also got some TD aspects as we setup towers of various flavors of destruction. 

The only negatives I have is the dialogue. The dialogue is what frames the tutorial mission and sometimes Ashley and Riggs have a good chemistry, but the tutorial dialogue that explains everything is longwinded and repeats itself to tedium. I turned the voices off to simply not listen to it. I did have to wiki a few things I missed, but I personally wasn't a huge fan of the dialogue dumps. Lastly, bases on outposts you're not currently on do not need any defense as long as you're not on the planet. You can only be attacked while Riggs is specifically on the map, this means outposts once setup don't need much interaction other than to setup a new one when a node runs dry. Perahaps add in cross map attacks? 

Overall it's a good mashup of logistics and base building with ARPG Combat that I Will continue to play.  Well worth the money.

lacks some description on some stuff so its a bit hit and miss; but the overall game feels really good ^^
small optimization problem when you play as zerg style; but properly not made for that )(though a bit sad) :P

if you like twinshooters base building etc. battlezone ish game

edit: after reaching 46 hours in it; it is a very good game some awesome stuff; properly best twinstick shooter controlled game out there ^^
camera etc is still crap like most of these (how hard is it to make the camera center and allow the mouse, rotated the view with the character for maximum spacing towards firing range (like ""running with guns"" did, they did the hole control of that view extremely well; though they did not rotated the cam with the char which would be much better to play with ^^

a little more :
So the game was pretty awesome :D

i honestly would have liked more com communication and missions etc. from humans would have been cool.
but it was very good.

the ending was extremely abrupt; so i played it wrong, i didnt notice i needed to move on when it said ""now built the 2 cores"" and i was ??? ehh how do i get the resource?
and then 10-20 hours of me fiddling around building a base covering the entire map researching everything not locked and then i moved on finding out the campaign is stil going on and i did it all wrong :P
it also gave me a lot of issues when i was doing plants for the material but couldnt get it bc i hadnt done the quest and nowhere is it noted you need that.

then i build the teleporter and used it to what is the most boring, anti-climatic ending ever.
it says ""you want to go to earth you can't come back if you do""
and i am like ""damn awesome, so this was just the initiated game stuff and now i am send to a new world with all tech and knowledge :D awesome

but then it shows a short cutscene thanking you for doing the first step to make this planet ready for colonisation.
and i am like ""ow that is what we are doing""...
and then it just Ends, like ... i was honestly a bit baffled and i laughed and smiled mostly bc at that point i had been maxed out and rushing out the quest maps for the last 3 materials so i could mine them with the 20+ plantations i had already setup long before; which honestly deterret from my game experience.

i do feel that they lost a Major opportunity to do some planet jumping, setting bases yourself, and trading with humans for whatever reason (maybe allow tiny human npc's to start living in the buildings and doing life stuff. maybe not needing to fill 80% of the map with wind and sun energy stuff just to run a defence line around your walls would have given more space, a better feeling and allowed to make more compact defenses (instead of literally having everything slow to a crawl bc the maps has literally thousind of objects which could have been done with a couple and some upgrade mechanics.
...
it does make me sad knowing ""thats that and no more will be made"".... its a game that has insanely high potential; the issues with twinstick shooting games is lack of proper content especially endgame content is none existing; once a twinstick reach endgame the games jsut end; 
people got no plan of what to make others do after they reach all the gimmick and got use to them.

but this many planet system could really have given a super good way to prevent a lot of the issues of longterm endgame and it would have been awesome :D :D :D

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mix in harvesting , ressources management, base building and factories, tower defense against swarm of ennemies,  and on top of that, an action mech with lots of possibilites in terms of loadout, and a bit of exploration.  All that with  beautiful graphisms, especially at nights, where half the glowing things are actually trying to eat you. 

The mech is controlled with wasd and the mouse and the controls are good fine and responsive, and it feels really satisfying going against a large swarm later in the game with your chosen loadout. The UI is good enough, except for some specific things; but you don't have to look for too long.

There's a large variety of weapons either for you mech or the base turrets , and a lot of buildings to enhance your base productivity and defenses, all that behind 3 research trees.  I haven't tested all the weapons nor turrets type, but clearly somes of them shine a lot more in combat than some other.  
     Considering the time required to search all technologies though, i highly recommend trying the lower tier quality of each weapons before committing research into them, because it takes a lot of time to unlock the last tiers and even more ressources to craft them. 

There are different biomes and the game will give the possibiliy to travel between them to harvest specific ressources. Meaning exploration is also a thing, though it is on the light side. Except for some specific crafting schematics and some ressources node, there isn't much point exploring all maps.

Sound design is ok, either the music, voice acting or sound design are decent, but not amazing. 

Onto what i didn't like : 
I only played on normal, and found the game was getting close to feeling too grindy at times, mostly the amount of ressources required is completely crazy for the last tier of weapons and upgrade for example.  I can only imagine what it is on harder difficulties.   Maybe something multiplayer could help if it was to become a thing ? 

Also, don't look for a story, there's the strict minimum on that side and i was a bit disappointed when i finished the campaign that there was really nothing after the main goal. Which in itself isn't too bad : the game do not drag on too much and once you're done with the last defense, you know you're done.  Still, a bit more would have been nice.

To conclude, i did enjoy my time, and it is a very good basis to build on other things on top of it.",1665745242,1665745242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I tried the game, I was just curious, and thought I'd get bored pretty quickly. HOWEVER, it was quite contrary! The story was something that was more than a driver to the goal of the game. The waves of creatures and exploration pushed me to build a better base and have everything ordered so that it works in unison with all of the elements. It is awesome to see the effects of weapons and how it affects the surrounding area. A very important thing is to have a variety of towers and be engaged in base defense.

A decently capable player on normal can take on most fights solo, but there are enough times that you're going to be hit from multiple directions or with a large enough force that you can be overwhelmed without some defenses to retreat to. Even if you want to play heavy Action RPG, you need at least some decent base building so it will survive long enough for you to be able to respond in time and not have to rebuild a bunch of stuff.

It's also hard to take it purely as a base building game. Around the midpoint I was confidently beyond resource scarcity for the vanilla materials, so I had a lot of heavy fortifications. But a heavy enough attack with the right composition could still put a hurt on my defenses, so if I didn't want to have to keep re-building, it was often worth going ahead and showing up for the more intense fights.

I did run into a few problems. Dealing with liquids is pretty un-intuitive, in particular the liquid decompressor. I had to look up how to work with it, as I'd never seen a building that required me to adjust a setting on it before it worked. It makes sense once I saw that, but I avoided it almost the whole game because of that.

The one big glitch that I ran into was a little after loading the game most of the way through the game, and all of the power connectors in my base stopped working. They were still there, but nothing was getting power. The console command ""debug_recreate_buildings"" helped me get going again. Not sure what caused it, as I don't think the error happened right after loading, but took a minute.

Still, that glitch was solvable, and the game was a lot of fun. I definitely leaned into excess with my playthrough, and it's fun that the game allows you to just drop resources on your problems sometimes. If I played through again, I think I could get way crazier now that I have a better understanding of how other kinds of power generation work.",1665473543,1665473543,True,2,0,0.529553651809692383,0,True,False,False

One year and one DLC later, unfortunately not much has changed.

Tedious scanning has been addressed by adding a portable scanner turret. It's now possible to upgrade/repair multiple buildings at once. And that's it...

Interface is still showing incorrect costs, you can sometimes build buildings despite them showing as red, or cannot upgrade buildings despite meeting all the requirements.

The game still crashes occasionally.

There is still no blueprinting option like in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/]Factorio[/url] or [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/9350/Supreme_Commander/]Supreme Commander[/url], making defenses building an extremely boring and tedious task.

[h1]Original Review - October 2021[/h1]

I'd really like to love this game, but unfortunately it's too unpolished. The foundation is solid and the idea is great, but I think this game should have stayed in the Early Access a little while longer...

I am really looking forward to patches and hoping to change this review to positive soon. But as it is now, the bugs are really killing the fun.

This game reminds me mostly of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/]Factorio[/url] - as you control a single character and you can build only in your surroundings (however there is no automation) - and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/644930/They_Are_Billions/]They Are Billions[/url] - as you defend your base against the hordes of enemies coming from all sides (however the attacks are not too strong and your defense lines are unlikely to fall).

[h1]Issues:[/h1]
[list]
[*] The building interface is utterly broken:
[list]
[*] The selected building information panel is often showing wrong building or not showing at all.
[*] There are often multiple category buttons highlighted.
[*] Often buttons and keyboard shortcuts are not working.
[*] It's not possible to scroll a list with a keyboard or mouse wheel - you have to move the mouse pointer and click a button...
[/list]
[*] Information about how upgrading a building changes its stats are inconsistent, incorrect or misleading – you never know what will actually change...
[*] The total input/output of the pipe is sometimes incorrect.
[*] Weapon mods sometimes cannot be used and sometimes don't give the effect they should.
[*] You cannot do basic power plants automation to turn chosen ones off when the batteries are full.
[*] Scanning objects in the world is tedious and annoying – you have to point at the object for a couple of seconds and not lose it, because it will reset all progress. No upgrades to scan things faster or automatically.
[*] Shield Generator often has incorrect amount of health points (e.g. lvl 3 building should give 4k HP of shield, but gives only 2k). Sometimes it doesn't generate shield at all.
[*] Some things are not explained at all - e.g. some symbols or what the Research Station is for.
[*] Micromanagement:
[list]
[*] [strike]Upgrading buildings is tedious – buildings have 3 levels, but you can only ever build 1 level, then you have to wait for it to build and click on it to upgrade, and then again.[/strike] No way to upgrade all buildings in the area. EDIT: You can do alt+click to build immediately a building lvl 3, but if you attempt to walk while doing so, you will encounter more bugs. 
[*] There are no construction blueprints, everything has to be placed manually, which takes tremendous amounts of times, especially that pretty much every outpost is temporary until you mine all resources.
[*] The biggest floor piece you can build is 4x4, no way to drag over the area. Also, when building it you have to keep clicking LMB, if you drag around it will miss a lot of spots.
[*] There is no automated way of collecting items dropped by enemies – and they disappear rather quickly.
[/list]
[*] You can insert weapon mods into individual turrets - good luck on finding them later. I think these should be inserted globally and affect every turret of chosen type and upgrade level.
[*] You are constantly getting warnings that your storage is full, they get more and more annoying the longer you play.
[*] Outposts sometimes lose their names and are renamed to Outpost 1 etc., there is no way to set them custom name.
[*] Some objects in the world cannot be scanned, despite being highlighted when scanning.
[*] Read database entries often are still marked as unread.
[*] All items frequently get back the ""new"" flag.
[*] [b]Occasional crashes.[/b]

Negatives:
* Serious performance issues, lag, hiccups and memory leak when having a large base (I built walls all around the edges of the map along with def. towers)

* The game randomly decides energy sources are ""LOCAL"" and one either has to load a previous save, or if lucky, delete, place again, put some windmills, sell, etc fixes - if the error doesn't apply to everything just a small area (one time it was for the full base so...)

* A little too slow pace, especially near the end game if one wants to unlock everything. I had to AFK for an hour to wait for it


Some minor things:
* One cannot rotate the view, or zoom in/out so freedom on this respect is limited and sometimes hard to hit the right spot with building, but it's no big deal at all, just a minor thing.

The human and robot talk way too much, especially after a triggered wave event.  70 different sound effects going on and these two dingbats are arguing about the atmospheric pressure of a sandbag while I'm getting irradiated and hit by two swarms of non-explosive zerglings and shield gorillas.

Make the characters sound interested in saving the plants and animals, not like the bored girl that showed up because her friends have drilled the knowledge into her and she's just there for the free gelatos afterwards. 
The female voice actor for the ""Ashely"" character is dead in the soul, all her lines sound even more monotonous than the robot suit.

Contrary to traditional games of the genre, enemy waves do not scale and hit a cap, from which point you can leave the game playing by itself, It could benefit a lot from having a better dificulty progression.

Developers chose to allow players to tweak the difficulty settings as a way to ramp up the diffuculty, but it seems very rushed to simple allow players to increase enemy wave size or damage multiplier instead of ACTUALLY balancing the ingame dificulty. 

While the campaign is pleasing with maybe one or two replay sessions value, survival is passable exactly because waves don't get harder after 3 or 4 waves, from which point even basic defenses can handle it forever. Again, developers chose to instead make it ""hard"" by giving you only 1h to beat survival instead of a more usual approach of ""survive as long as you can"" with ever more powerful enemies. Some high-level enemies NEVER show until the last wave, at which point you will have the top tier towers and weapons and make short work of them.

Despite all that, is worth some 40h playtime which is just fine the asking price, but could have much more replay value if they just bothered to tweak dificulty ingame and not throgh sliders on the dificulty settings.",1664811524,1664811524,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It isn't the best ARPG, it isn't the best factorio style game but boy does it do a good job at mixing the two. Walking around in an upgradable mech, turning yourself into a force of nature, all the while taming nature by turning ever more larger patches of wilderness into resource pumping outposts. 
Nuclear power, fusion power, gas power and renewables... all of this is possible. 
Started a new run on HARD difficulty and realized they've added things that make the whole experience even more enjoyable - transferring liquids between outposts for example. 
Exploration mostly feels worth-while. 
Did I mention the graphics are great? Nighttime with ray tracing enabled looks like a movie with fire, lightning and explosions all casting real-time accurate shadows. 

The only criticism is that after a while setting up new defences and outposts can get tedious but this just means you need a break.

The creatures and world is a little too colorful, I feel bad invading and killing these things ... same as the story, we ARE the invaders. Geez they could've come up with a better story line to justify self defense.

Update: After completing the campaign I tried survival and boy was the difficulty spike steeep. Normal mode is hard, and hard mode is almost impossible.

However, the gameplay itself is just lacklustre. The Riftbreaker has taken the interesting route of focusing both on ARPG-ish combat and Factorio-ish building, but is not deep enough in either department to be interesting. 

In terms of combat, you are given an inventory, can wear modifications etc. but none of it matters because all you have to do is just equip two hammers and walk backwards as you hit & stun enemies, or some other combination of weapons. I chose the hardest difficulty in the campaign, but in 12 hours, I never once felt challenged, and I am not a very skilled gamer.

The building is initially very interesting. You mine resources, build defenses, and do so such that you can secure a perimeter big enough to sustain your operations, provide energy etc. without making defense too hard. You use the terrain to your advantage as you do so, and there are a variety of turrets to choose from. However, even if the tech tree introduces new buildings, since there are no additional problems to solve as you move forward, and none of the initial building considerations were complex to begin with, it just becomes tedious over time. With sufficient defenses, your base is nigh unkillable, and there is no difficult optimization, automation etc. problems to solve. You just upgrade things, repair some damage, etc. on repeat.

---

You are not really solving any problems. There is no ""Hmm, how can I beat this challenge? How can I upgrade my mech to achieve this? How can I change the layout of my base to achieve that?"" Once you have a not so horrible setup, you just go and do pretty-looking menial tasks. Go and do the objectives, get attacked, repair base, upgrade stuff one by one, repeat. It's very polished though so I guess if you want to turn off your brain, it can be a fun one, but that's not really what I am looking for either in building games or ARPGs

Some games combine management and action combat by separating them into segments, where the action combat gives you resources and then you use those to fuel your management in two almost separate games. The Riftbreaker is interesting in the sense that it has tried to combine both into one game flow, but maybe since both are trying to command your attention at once was forced to make both components far too simple?

game will completely freeze every time it auto saves, including in combat which is super helpful. rather than develop a real difficulty curve they just throw more stuff at you, to the point where the entire game is choking trying to keep track of it all. 100% cpu lag, fps still going at 144. i have a ryzen 9. cant keep up.

gameplay does not involve any kind of strategic/tactical thinking. its just spam. dont bother building a good mix of towers like they suggest, just build 10 layers of walls and 50000 towers of one or two types.

most of the enemies towers can easily deal with, but there are two types that throw aoe bomb type attacks from distance, your towers just ignore them until they are the last thing left so they will just poke holes in your base. try to go out and headhunt them and you get swarmed by literally thousands of units while moving in unresponsive slow motion get stuck on a blade of grass surrounded and smacked.

most of the towers seem pointless as a result

The level of graphical processing you need to do in this game is absolutely absurd. It's not interesting, or achieving anything. This is basically Factorio, but they're trying to be Crysis about it. It would be amazing to have a game like this that was actually made within the limitations of what an actual human could play. This game will never exist on anything but a super computer because of how stupidly high they want the detail, and how low the optimization is.

This is a really fun and incredibly satisfying game. Specially when it comes to combat.

That said, if you don't have like a $6,000 computer or better... don't bother playing this. I've got a pretty decent pc and it it still chugs in the first hour of playing. Had to drop the settings down to nothing just to get halfway into the game before it turned into a slideshow.

+ High quality graphisms and sounds
+ Effective mix of genres :  tower defense + hero adventure + base management
+ Satisfying in many regards, and devs are improving the game
- 0 risk taken in terms of gameplay
- Low diversity of appraoches despite the huge tech trees

[h1] Game Design [/h1]
The RiftBreakers offers a solid overall experience, mixing Tower Defense, adventure and base managment. There a lot of content as well, towers, weapons, upgrades for your mech, and a decent bestiary to pray upon ! While most quests in the campaign aren't anything close to original, something hard to achieve in the genre, they provide exactly what we are here for : fun. After the long campaign, you may grind the survival mode if you are for more, personally I dislike this kind of mode.
The story is decent, so are the voice actors.

My problem with the game is that, while having huge tech trees, ironically it doesn't offer a lot of ways to proceed. The mech and weapons upgrades still achieve diversity though. Disintigrating rows of enemies with penetrating lasers, grenade launchers that shoot 3 grenades per shot, double metal lifesteal fists, plenty and fun ^^

Note : 7/10

[h1] Graphics & UI [/h1]
The trailer doesn't lie : everything is BEAUTIFUL. You might need a good machine to play on max graphism while having a stable FPS. The last waves of enemies, when they come by the trillion, kind of ruin  the experience I think. But  that would probably be more a game design or technical issue.
Note : 10/10

[h1] Music and Sound Design [/h1]
Generic epic soundtrack. On the other hand, the sound design matches the standard of the graphisms.
Note : 7/10.

[h1] Verdict[/h1]
I have discovered They are Billions and lost quite a few weeks of my life with it after playing The Riftbreaker. So now I have something to compare with, and I would definitely prefer the first to the latter. The Riftbreaker offers a gorgeous high quality experience, if only the devs could be a bit bolder with the DLC... Spoiler :  they weren't.

Then I found some flaws in the design that kind of let me down.   Especially with survival mode.   Its a little TOO hard core at the beginning and the waves scale up too fast to enjoy what the game offers... too big a tech tree to only play an hour.    Want LONGER survival games....

I just wish there was more balance especially in survival.  I've pretty much completed the campaign but survival is a sad reality that you dont get to enjoy the game like in the campaign.   The way survival is designed you get hit every 6min and in between that the nests are constantly hitting you.   The waves scale up in difficulty way too fast in a way that you can't tech up to match the waves.   I've beat a couple maps but not in a way thats fun at all.   I was hoping that I got to play a similar game to the campaign with the full tech tree and build but no its just in your face maybe 30 - 45 min games.    Wish there was something in between survival and campaign.      

Other issues is in the campaign I had things researched far before I had the resources for making them so in may instances I've never built a single version of a structure I unlocked and I was on the 3rd level of it and still couldnt make the first level version.    

Lots of imbalances like this.

BUT.... The game at its core is SO FUN.   A lot of good here.   Hope the devs put more into it so that there is more to the game outside the campaign.

The gameplay is fun and flashy and the writing is pretty good, but the pacing is killed by tedious maps and hollow repetition towards the end. The ideas and philosophy just fade away, and then you're just playing another video game. The same problem occurs with the dialogue - the main characters are excessively chatty in the early and even midgame, but towards the end it's just repeated lines. Some pronunciation is also off, and the dialogue writer lets the immersion slip when the characters talk to the player and not among themselves.

Instead of serving up increasingly better maps and challenges and accelerating to a big finale, the game ends up a grind with a superficial layer of variety on top (choice of weapons and mods with Bigger Numbers™).

It's got challenge, complexity, lotsa progression, some satisfying OH SHIT moments, and good variety. My complaints are few but significant for hardcore gamers:

- Some poor dialogue and voice acting (seems indie when everything else has so much polish)
- Some voice lines are delivered too frequently with too much repetition (I know my storage is full, stfu)
- Once you collect a full set of maxxed weapons the enemy attacks are trivial, to the point where you don't even need towers to help fend off a day 100+ raid -- and that's on Brutal (hardest) difficulty. You just seed the choke point with mines and sentry/lightning turrets
- There's never time nor the need to deep dive into tower strategy. I'd really love the chance to min-max the base and in particular the towers. Loading tips say you can slot upgrade mods into the towers but I never had time nor inclination to do so on max difficulty
- Due to the point above, every base looked more or less the same. 4 miners, 1 radar, 1 repair tower, 2 mine layers, 4 artillery, 4 flamers, 4 rockets, 4 miniguns, 4 sentinels, and maybe one or two fancy towers if I feel like it.

The remaining 25% of crashes are completely random - In a busy base? Crash! Nowhere near a busy base? Crash! Building something? Crash! Starting the game up? Crash! Loading a game? Crash!..... You get the point.

Would love to recommend this game (and will recommend it when fixed), but currently it's completely unplayable (at least for me). And yes, I've reinstalled the game - even on a different drive -, I've validated the game files, updated by graphics drivers, run as admin, turned off all RGB peripherals, monitoring software, game overlays - Nothing works.",1660767123,1660767123,False,0,0,0.451127827167510986,0,True,False,False

If you were looking for more of a Factorio/satisfactory/dyson sphere kind of game with considerable depth that you could really sink your teeth into and get a great value for money.... this is not that game. 

The art is great, everything is well made and polished, and its a finished game. But, and its a big ""but"", I found this game to be deceptively shallow to the point where this review was almost a negative one. There's only a few kinds of enemies, all reskinned to look slightly different. The weapons are all pretty similar and upgrading them should feel good, but ends up feeling lackluster. 

The tech tree, base building, combat, and overall gameplay loop is polished and works fine, but after you set up the first base everything else is just rinse and repeat, many times, which feels like artificially increasing game length to me. 

There's nothing wrong with the game, it mixes different game styles together decently, but I just can't get behind the deception of depth when this ultimately feels like a complex mobile game at times. I expected and wanted it to be better, but it's just not as good as I hoped it would be.

What makes the planet so terrible?  Let me tell you!

First, nearly every living thing is hostile, lives in gigantic ecology destroying hordes, and operates under some swarm intelligence that could only be explained by some kind of hostile genius loci that causes them to cooperatively work together to try and kill you en-mass.  Did we mention that most of these animals are the size of large dinosaurs?

Next, the planet is incredibly tectonically active, it has a non-functioning ozone layer, the weather is extremely violent, and it apparently has no biomes that would comfortably house a human being.

Oh, and God throws rocks at you.  And by God throws rocks at you, I mean that you are regularly showered with meteors and or volcanic debris that actually target you specifically.  Wherever you are on the map, the rocks will land there.  If you run, the impact zone will expand to some degree to follow you.

Nobody recognizing this would in any way shape or form decide that this planet is a good place to colonize, but here we are, making poor life choices in the name of Humanity.

This game is actually very easy to lose track of time in.  There is ALWAYS something you can be doing, even though you have to wait hours to finish enough research and gather enough resources to do what you need to do.  It's a combination twin stick shooter and Factorio clone, and it's a great deal of fun.

=======================================================================

With its first DLC Metal Terror, I'm updating this review from my initial one on December 27, 2021.

Overall, it resembles a more graphically enhanced version of Factorio. Nothing can compare to Factorio itself, but I found Riftbreaker less complex in contrast, which made things more enjoyable since I didn't have to wring my brains too much when designing/placing my base.

Similarly, though somewhat unintentionally, I found myself strangely addicted to bio-scanning as many flora/fauna as I could. The idea is to scan then and gain benefits from easier ways to kill hostile mobs or reap more resources from harvesting, but bio-scanning proved to be a nifty way to pass time as well.

The inclusion of several new features in Metal Terror like the Liquid Compressor/Decompressor & the Shield Generator buildings makes the game both easier & more intense at the same time. A nod as well to the new weapons/equipment & additions to the existing tech tree.

The campaign for Metal Terror is pleasant enough to engage in. No spoilers on my part, but it wraps up in a way that hints at more to come, either in future DLCs or even a Riftbreaker 2. But who can say?

My only lament is the fact that for a game of its kind, terraforming appears to be close to impossible. The procedurally-generated maps, both in the campaign & survival mode, come with a lot of obstacles like large rocks or chasms. Although the player is to ideally build their base by using the obstacles to their advantage (funnelling the flow of hostile mobs into a bottleneck so they can be destroyed more easily, etc) it proved to be more of a hindrance than help as far as I'm concerned. A vague irony since I do enjoy playing games where I can bottleneck enemies. The inability to destroy or otherwise remove these obstacles greatly impacted how I wanted to design a base to my heart's desire, with large, open & flat spaces. One can only hope that when Riftbreaker is fully finished with its attendant DLCs, more mods/custom maps will remedy this since the developers have indicated removing these obstacles appears to be an impossibility.

If you enjoyed Factorio and the various iterations of the genre, then Riftbreaker should be plenty enjoyable as well, both the base game and the Metal Terror DLC. Bang for your buck, I'd say.",1640600375,1660151107,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h1]Prologue[/h1]
In a not too distant future, humanity has advanced a lot in science, thus allowing to detect habitable planets very far from Earth and also the technology of teleportation, which one day allowed to detect a habitable planet that was named Galatea 37 millions of light years from distance from Earth. The planet appears to be very interesting, with an atmosphere and temperature suitable for humanity, an invoice for mineral resources, in addition to plant life, which indicates that agriculture is possible, but there is a big problem, because even with all its technology, humanity can send just a single person to the planet. ^^

In this way, an intense selection program is started to choose the best possible explorer and thus the protagonist of our story, the scientist Ashley, was chosen, who together with a super armor equipped with advanced AI and all the necessary equipment, to explore the planet and to build alone a foundation that allows, to build a more efficient portal that in turn allows free traffic between the earth and this new world. A mission that will not be easy, not only because of the isolation and having to do everything alone, but also because the local fauna doesn't like a complete stranger to arrive and start to devastate their world. ^^

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Very good system for building and managing the base, allowing the teleportation of mineral resources and various energy sources, allowing us to focus on the exploration and defense of the base even if it's just a single person.
+ Wide variety of plants and animals to research and learn more, including their weaknesses when they are hostile animals. Some technologies are only released after some research on local life forms.
+ Three distinct environments to explore beyond the initial one, each with its own rules, threats and resource that can only be found in a certain environment.
+ Extensive tech tree, allowing for multiple energy sources, weapons for both base defenses and armor plus all buildings can be upgraded.
+ Frantic and understandable action in battles.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Even with as many labs as possible, if you are like me who wants to have all the researches in the game complete, prepare your patience, because in addition to several researches needing to be unlocked first, it will take you more hours to finish all the researches than to finish the game story.
- Unfortunately not all environments are as interesting and fun as others, ""thanks"" to some mechanics. Personally, I found the acid region the least fun of all.
- Some serious problems regarding performance, even with a powerful computer I had episodes of slowness while playing, especially in the final part of the game when we have a lot of buildings and enemies at the same time.

[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]
So begins the exploration of this new planet by our protagonist and her talking AI support, exploring alone while looking for a good place to start building the base. Once chosen, the mission begins to build a portal connected to Earth, but for that you will need a few things, starting with minerals, mainly Carbon and Ironium that are used for all constructions and equipment, but to develop some parts of the portal will need rarer resources, more precisely Titanium, Palladium and Uranium. ^^

Which brings us to the first objective, using teleportation technology to travel through different locations on the planet, in search of sources of these ores that are teleported to the main base. But the local fauna will not stand still just watching this, because not at all happy with the visitor, they will constantly organize themselves in waves of attack against the protagonist's base, with their increasing numbers and a curious sixth sense that always makes them know where the defenses are weaker, making it necessary for the player to be able to adapt or at least avoid weak points, so as not to be destroyed. ^^

[h1] Art and sound[/h1]
Produced by the studio EXOR Studios, I liked the graphics of the game, they give a good appearance of a habitable planet for humanity but at the same time alien, with its strange plants and animals, with characteristics that we don't see on earth such as the presence of crystals by the body. As for the soundtrack I was also satisfied, in my opinion the music is pleasant and I liked the sound effects they chose for the aliens, the weapons and many other things. ^^

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
The Riftbreaker in my opinion is a very fun game and you can play and explore it for several hours, whether focusing on completing the main quest, expanding the base, doing the wide variety of research or exploring more about the native fauna and flora of this new planet, all actions that helped in the great mission. In addition, the studio team is very active and since its release several new tools and equipment have been added, there are still some problems that need to be fixed such as performance, but it is a very fun game. ^^

In the beginning of the game, your main character, Ashley, is revealed to be a bleeding-heart when it comes to enviromentalism. She's Annoying as hell about it. I can deal with this, that's fine, but the confusion came in that the way she talks about it, makes you feel you'll be punished for playing the game the way you want/are-supposed-to. Basically ""Don't harm the enviroment, and don't harm wildlife.""So, I spent the first 2-3 hours trying to have minimal impact only to realize that this bleed-heart behavior was just to introduce a mechanic of the game.

The game itself was never bad. You build up your base on an extraterrestial planet, visit several (3 different) biomes and construct outpust to gather more and rare materials in order to finish construction your main objective, a big portal. This while the whole flora and fauna tries everything to stop you. There are several dozens of enemy types with each their own attack and also the plants fight back in a certain way. There will be enemy waves trying to overrun your base, natural disasters (ranging from mildly annoying to severely damaging your base) while you have to expand your base in order to make room for all the buildings you need. 

So enemy variety (including plants, everything you encounter gets collected in an automated index) is great, as is building, research an weapon variety. So why did I give it a negative review first? Because it did not feel like a game, but much more like work, like you were a futuristic space janitor having constantly fixing things while wielding your weapons and shooting at things. Luckily, the devs really pay attention to the suggestions of the community, and did several heavily QoL-improvements over the last months, so that now it is really a pleasure to play, to construct, upgrade, maintain, expand and fix your base. It now feels much more polished.

The game really shines when, for example, several hundred (going into the 1000s) enemies try at the same time breaking through your walls, while at the same time a meteor shower has dozens of impacts all around you, your defense towers firing all kinds of ammunition agains the enemy hordes and you are in the middle swinging sword or hammer, shooting your gun and ordering an orbital strike. Rarely have I seen such beauty in so much chaos, and where you still feel in control. 

All in all it is a game where its underlying mechanics are very well thought through, with a lot of variety in all aspects. Your base can be as big as you wish (or your PC manages). Do not, however, expect much of the enemy AI. From the spawning point they will always run and attack the nearest building. There may be some room for improvement, but it is ok, since the difficulty is already quite balanced as it is. Mind, however, this is not an RTS, you are only controlling your robot (which is a real fighting machine, able to stop even the biggest waves on his own if properly upgraded).

Replace all soldiers and mobile troops with a single souped up version of the power-loader from the Alien movie controlled by you. Give said mech the ability to use laser swords, miniguns, nuclear mines, and other fun death-dealing weapons. Build a base, and defend it from aliens that can best be described as what happens when you ask the question, ""What would happen if the Zerg were just a BIT more numerous?""

Excellent and unique integration of RTS and 3/4 overhead shooter genres. Gameplay is fun thanks to the large tech tree with multiple stabbey/burney/explodey weapons and mods, surprisingly well designed aliens that fill specific roles and need to be dealt with in different ways, and intuitive, well thought out interface that makes even huge, complex bases easy to manage. Enormous, screen filling alien hordes that contain well thought out combinations and arrangements of different alien types rather than just copy-pasting 500 of the same enemy are also a plus.

Major (but not fatal) shortcomings include the story, which mainly consists of the phrases, ""Everything you do makes the aliens angry, get ready for an attack"" and ""We don't have enough shiny stuff to make the MacGuffin, go over there, find more shiny stuff and build a shiny stuff mining base."" Voice acting is similarly bad, with one of the main characters almost literally going ""BEEP-BOOP, I AM A ROBOT. RAIN MAKES SOLAR PANELS LESS EFFICIENT"" every 10 minutes.

After the latest round of patches I managed to complete the game and DLC on August 1st without encountering any game breaking bug and only one bug where I broke that stupid rock and Ash says ""roh-roo there will be consequences for this (there wasnt) and that mission never  finished but didnt matter anyways.

So PC is working as intended and this game grips you by the nuts until the end then suddenly there is nothing to do but look at the main menu screen.

XBOX I refunded and bought again and almost refunded again but there was a timely post on Twitter about what is actually going on with the xbox save games and it'll be fixed in the next xbox update (its a console problem) soon, this month of August.

Excellent combat and fun simple basebuilding while scouring the map for resources make for a really engaging gameplay loop, it's just too bad that some other things often get in the way of that. Some mechanics feel half-finished or outright unnecessary, the UI is pretty bad on most screens and there are still many bugs that need fixing, but if you can get past that you'll have a blast. The game is regularly updated and it seems like they plan to support it for years to come so the chances are high that these issues will get addressed eventually. 

My biggest overall issue with the game is the lack of a proper replayable sandbox mode. There's the campaign, a story-driven long term mode in which you eventually unlock all the tech and biomes are linked together... and then there's survival, which is a quick match of trying to build up a base strong enough to survive the incoming waves until the time runs out. Campaign is fun for the first playthrough but later on way too easy and boring, and in survival you're restricted to a single biome and without enough time to unlock even a third of the tech tree, less alone upgrade it to higher levels. A middle ground is very needed and I hope they're working on it, as well as more scenarios for survival with different objectives and more interesting map layouts.

The exploring, building and research parts of the game are well fleshed-out and there's a decent amount of new mechanics scattered throughout the game so you're never doing the same thing over and over, and there's a variety of maps in the main campaign so you can explore different biomes and deal with the unique challenges of each.

In 60+ hours of game time I only encountered two bugs, one where a build limit was miscalculated, meaning I couldn't increase my research points (this is a known bug and the devs have said ti will be addressed) the other was an item that gave me a discount on building/upgrade costs not applying the discount to upgrades (more of an annoyance, really). The game itself was stable, no crashes at all though the load times felt a little long, but not excessively so.

While I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it, my one big complaint would be the writing for the two characters which was particularly clunky with conversations going back and forth where the same point was made over and over again. For example:

You've discovered a new mineral
Yes, I should research it
Yes, that would allow you to craft new equipment and buildings
Right, new equipment and buildings would make things easier
Especially with how hostile the local fauna is
Yeah, we need to protect ourselves...

YES. THANK YOU. I GOT THE MESSAGE.

 That or dialogue that was delivered too late, ie a warning that a crystal I was to scan was fragile given AFTER I'd just accidentally blown it up with a grenade. That quibble aside, it's a very solid game, well worth its asking price and a steal if you catch it in a sale.

The DLC is a considerable expansion to the game with several maps located in a unique location with a self-contained story with new research, buildings and equipment added into the game which compliments the campaign. It's far more pro-active action-based which is a nice change up from the main story which is mostly played on the defensive. Again, well worth the asking price.

Some criticisms:
- I wished the player could turn on/off buildings at certain times of the day. You'd think as technologically advanced as humanity is in this fictional future they'd have something as simple as that
- I often feel like games generally hold the players hands too much, but this game was the opposite. There were many times when I was left scratching my head trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do. Maybe that's part of the fun.
- I failed the last mission many times without knowing why. Some explanation of what went wrong would've saved me hours.
- The voice comms are too repetitive, which is fine on it's own but the problem is the voice acting is too expressive. Like something happens for a hundred times and the character still sounds surprised when it happens and makes the same quips over and over and over and over and over. It gets annoying.

You see you can find mods in this game which you can put on your weapons and towers, mods like increased rate of fire, more damage of a specific type(like energy or fire), more range, bigger AOE, more projectiles per shot, reduces ammo cost, a whole slew of mods, and they work perfectly fine on weapons, but after some testing it turns out not a single mod works on towers, I've tested so many of them and they never worked, the tower stats update, for example it may tell you it shoots 3x as fast now! but if you put a modded and unmodded tower next to each other you can see that actually, it shoots at the exact same speed and the shooting rate shown is a flat out lie, and that goes for pretty much every mod, it updates the visual stats on the towers without actually affecting the towers in any way, which seems suspicious but I'm going to leave it up to incompetence instead of trying to deceive people.

So after 150+ hours and always putting mods in my towers I basically found out it was a huge waste of time, I mean for god's sake even the new tower in the dlc doesn't use mods, the game has been out for like 7 months and they even released dlc, how the hell is a basic function of the game so broken?

You're alone on an alien planet with nothing but the calm, soothing voice of your battlebuilder mech RIGGS to keep you company.

The primary objective is to establish a Rift between this planet and Earth, but this isn't a simple process. I've actually forgotten this was my objective when I went exploring in the other zones, only to rediscover the foundation of my giant Rift Station when I went back to Headquarters. RIGGS even warned me about forgetting too.

You build up bases, collect resources, and set up defenses to keep aliens and animals out. Then you go exploring for more resources, alien technology, and fun new ways to get yourself killed. Always be sure to set up an outpost in each new zone to respawn at a safe location. You get a finite # of Outposts, but you can destroy unnecessary outposts from the planetary travel menu.

Examples of its accessibility are that resources you gather goes into a global pool, you don't have to transport them to storage - ""rift technology"" does that for you. You don't have to refill turrets with ammo, rift technology makes sure the factories gets the required metal to make ammo from storage, and that it is teleported from the factories to the turrets. You don't have to return to base to refill your weapons, rift technology teleports it right into your stores. 

The only things that needs to be connected physically are power grids and liquids, like water and magma, but this is also easy to do.

The game also has a story and clear objectives, and it's more about reaching those goals than making the factory grow. 

All in all, base building is very accessible, mowing down hordes of aliens is fun, and it has a story that's decent - nothing groundbreaking, but enough to keep things moving along, and give you objectives to fulfill.

1: Neat to find out what works best and how to combine the proper things to keep getting enough resources. Definitely the most fun but also a tiny bit tedious. You come to realize that melee weapons are hot garbage, certain towers are just out-classed by better hitting railguns regardless of the type damage. 

2: You start getting a few mods because FPS issue's experienced in the first playthrough you get from having a massive base in your headquarters. You get either wireless energy, 10 grid spaces energy connecters, more green power so u don't have to make massive fields off solar/wind energy and or other mods to improve gameplay.

3: Pretty much a repeat of the second playthrough with Latest DLC included, nothing much is added to the base game as it's just new maps that you follow a storyline. You get another source of energy and a tower that work on the same liquid source that you can only transfer over by liquid compressors that are just not worth the effort. The towers that you get are super low range and must be connected by liquid pipes. None of this is viable since you can just use shield generators late game to protect everything and have better towers do the work. 

Game has been since the release of the demo been super good the only real issue that you get is massive frame issue's for simply creating a big wall to have a lot of space, regardless of your settings.

The end result is, it's quite a bit of fun, with a few caveats.  The core gameplay is base-building and resource gathering along the lines of Factorio (and more recently, Dyson Sphere Project), except MUCH simpler.  The logistics puzzler element is largely stripped away from those games here; you gather five ""main"" resources (two primary resources found on both the main map and to some extend on most other maps, and then one each special resource from three themed biomes each with their own building/resource-harvesting challenges, like quicksand that requires special platforming, rapidly-spreading acid plants that require careful building, and magma that requires special temperature modulators).  Where Riftbreaker simplifies the logistics, it tries to expand on combat, with satisfying weapons and a variety of critters to use them on.  I'm always a fan of games that make each new weapon upgrade tier feel overpowered, only to (gently) raise the stakes until the player finds themselves hammering away with nuclear weapons and even then only getting by with appropriate mech handling.  The weapons are all fun (by the end, you'll have all six equipped slots filled and if you're like me, a few more favorites that you wish you could also equip).

Perhaps too easy on Normal, if you're an ""over-builder"" in this sort of game instead of a speed-runner; I note this because this gametype appeals to many of us over-builders, and when my integrated, multi-layered, hedgehogged, nuclear-capable, shielded defense network easily shrugged off the final challenge, I realize I should have played on Hard from the get-go.

In the end, you might argue that Factorio has more of almost everything (combat, base building), but that game is also remarkably punishing and, arguably, far too demanding of all gamers except the most dedicated min-maxers (I quit when I failed to successfully program oil trains in a process that required five separate steps) (*EDIT: I have since actually played and completed Factorio and the trains weren't actually that hard to figure out).  Riftbreaker is more colorful, a bit easier on the player, and rewards progress with new satisfying impactful & kinetic weapons (and plenty of critters to use them on.

A few hiccups: the hailstorm event is so broken that -- no joke -- you should absolutely just reload your last autosave if it procs.  If it hits on your main map, you can spend a full hour to busywork-repair every structure.  Another problem is how you can't cross pipelines, which means that later in the game juggling water, plasma, and supercharged plasma to get them all where they need to go (particularly the last two, which need to be along your defensive wall) becomes be a pain, especially when upgrading the related/involved structures can take around 15 minutes in total.  As a result, if you find you need to sell the buildings in order to place them again, it can be a major time investment (during which you might have attacks and other events).

The three biome-specific resources drain very quickly.  By the time you've got a base up and running, you're chewing through your nodes.  By the time you get an operation running on the *next* biome, your prior biome may easily have ran dry on the sites you built infrastructure on (and that's using the absolutely-required-as-fast-as-possible upgraded mining buildings that deliver 4x more than they use out of the ground).  I'll admit that on one of the major biomes, I got fed up and ""exploited"" the mechanics of the game wherein resources are still generated when you aren't on the biome map and no events occur, by building ramshackle and totally-indefensible fast mining outposts right out in the open and, as soon as they were upgraded to level 3, quitting the hell out of that map for good.  (This ""frustration"" tactic actually lasted me until the end of the campaign, meaning it's the most efficient way to mine, even though it's not exactly in the spirit of the game).

In the end, I finished the campaign in 37 enjoyable hours, which makes this a ""easily worth the money"" title and a solid buy for anyone who enjoys the base-building genre.  This game strikes me as something a certain game developer named after a cold-weather event might have made in an alternate universe where they didn't grow into a corporate hog and instead kept doing what they were originally good at: taking existing game concepts and refining them into a slick, fun, enjoyable overall package.",1635378134,1658548406,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

I think it would've been more interesting if research took materials and a bit of time instead of just being raw time.

If you like a game that doesn't make you think through every little decision like Factorio does, you'll like this one. There's no logistic system, every resource you obtain is uploaded to a global pool that you can access even if you're in a different biome. The game always keeps you busy, if you need to research something that's going to take a while, you can go out and set up more mining outposts, clear out some enemies or upgrade your defenses. Weather events are a very fun mechanic, forcing you to rely on more than one source of energy. For example, an ion storm will give a 400% boost to both wind and solar energy for a limited time, but prevent you from placing any structures and will shut down your radar. Fog will reduce output to 25% or 50% and you'll hardly be able to see anything.

My only complaint is that it is difficult to rekeybind some of the keys. I wanted to assign each build menu with its own key, then the buildings within that menu on separate keys, but I could not achieve this result as the build menu always opens up to the previous menu you were in regardless of the keybind. You can, however, keybind specific buildings to a certain key and bypass the build menu, but it was too much work to memorize a key for every single building in the game. I ended up having to click the menu and buildings with the mouse, and this works just fine.

Running games like cyberpunk and star citizen with maxed graphics at a higher frame rate is odd to me considering my setup.

The combat is also decent, though really comes down to a rock/paper/scissors type system where there are certain damage types available and you need to use the right damage type against certain enemies due to resistances and vulnerabilities.  I found the campaign to be on the whole very fun and an enjoyable power creep.  However, it seems the survival mode is a half baked not fun version of the game because there isn't enough time or resources to actually build a fully functioning base and explore the map.  The story in the campaign is also bare bones and not much meaningful plot behind the main characters.  The game has solid gameplay mechanics but lacks soul or replayability.  It is very grindy, since you have to research the same technology 3 or 4 times to unlock all levels.  It seems the developer was just trying to pad out the content with quantity over quality.



Pros:
+Really fun base building and resource management
+Solid combat, fun being a strong mech with a decent arsenal
+Exploration is fun, discover new enemies and plants across 4 biomes (new one in first dlc)
+Campaign progression is well paced and good introduction to various mechanics

Cons
-Survival mode is poorly paced and difficulty is too high given lack of time to acquire resources, tech and build - enemy waves scale up too quickly to become impossible
-Grindy, quantity over quality - multiple tech tiers for the same weapons and buildings that become repetitive
-AI is very predictable - difficulty comes not from challenging AI but just overwhelming numbers that you simply don't have the dps to kill fast enough before they wreck your base - difficulty scales poorly especially with survival mode

I would give it a 7/10 overall (worth playing but get on a sale).  It really is about 25 hours of content that is stretched out to be much longer by grind.  I enjoyed the grind in this case, but your mileage may vary.",1658186646,1658186646,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It does a lot of things right but there are some things which if tweaked, would make the game much more enjoyable. The reason I have 23 hours in this game and not 200 is because I think the game forces you to build too many bases. I think it gets too repetitive to build YET another base with 4 layers of walls and lots of turrets. It does this a little too often. The reason you have to build lots of bases is because the resources are quite outside your main base and when the waves of enemies come, instead of focusing on your main base, they focus instead on the mini bases housing just a few extractors spread around the map. Because of this you never really see your main base put up a good defence and it's always the turn of your mini bases, of which by the way you will build many of. 

I think that they should completely eliminate the need to defend bases outside of your main base in any given map. 
Just focusing on building up your main base would make the game more engaging because you will always see the massive defences be used instead of the twinky dink mini bases, which you will also have to rebuild after every wave.

The easiest way to do this would be to make is so from the very start of the game you can build invisible extractors that require no energy to operate and no research to unlock. Make them harvest at half the speed of visible extractors. 


This way you can choose whether you want to have a bigger base and extract resources more quickly or have a smaller base with less resources/s. This would also reward a player for daring to have a larger base. I would include this type of extractor for all mineral resources like uranium, carbonium and what not.

The biggest upside to implementing this would be that all the action focuses on the main base of operations and there would be less tedium and building involved. I only want to defend one super mega base not twat about with 50 mini bases. This would also decrease the amount of structers on the map resulting in better performance.

Great game though. I was surprised by it because it's actually quite original and I can see a lot of hard work went into making it.

[i][u]""Are you still skeptical about the local creatures level of aggression?""[/u][/i]

I will admit the first time I came across this game, I wrote it off as some generic tower defence game. With constant berating from other players to give it a chance I finally caved and bought the game.

[h1][u]!!THIS IS NOT SOME GENERIC TOWER DEFENCE GAME!![/u][/h1]

This combines elements of RTS, Base & Resource Management, Tower Defence, Tech Trees, Ammunition types, enemy weaknesses, resource gathering, weapon and armour crafting, modification, farming and much more.

You can tell the devs have played a lot of quality classic RTS games in their time. I get so many vibes from this game, for example. Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, 7th Legion, KKND, Z, Rising Lands and even AOE.

Good story based campaign and an extremely hard survival mode as well.

Mr Riggs is not only your suit he is a great character as well, Ashley is a good lead character and they have some good dialouge 

Massive tech tree and array of enemies. Some of the hordes are straight insanity.

UI and general control of the game is fantastic and the graphics are beautiful. I only experienced a little slowdown on the final campaign battle but we are talking absolutely thousands of on-screen enemies .

I really cannot recommend this game enough.

I am very much looking forward to the paid DLC coming this year, ( I hope they add some more achievements too.)

Its a topdown base building/survival/diablo style hack'n slash with rts and 4x elements.
What it does, it does good.
There is a delicate balance between all of these elements and i gotta say that the devs managed to hit a golden spot with it. Its fun.

Now all of that being said, ofc i have beef with certain elements of it:
- Modular map generator which uses preset elements at random to create a map: Its bad. There are map elements which give your base extreme amounts of bonuses and defenses (such as the huge lake which enemies do not cross and also provides you with water) and there are elements which are completely and fundamentally useless to a point where you have to basically build completely in the open and defend every each square millimetre of your base. I found myself restarting the game over and over and over again till i got a decent map.
The modular generator is frustrating and at least the starting map should have either a ""on the spot"" re-roll/preview or the generator should be filled with more useful map elements cause there is an extremely large gap between useful and useless maps.

- Loot: Despite having a diablo style loot system in the game, the entire feature is basically missing. I've played this game twice to the end but there is no unique loot aside from 1 single mine and a bunch of meaningless statues/collectibles probably leftover from the alpha/a completely scrapped feature.
This was constantly irking me and was a hard disappointment cause everything is in place, everything works, drops happen, the system does everything, except: There are no items that would drop. Despite having so many slots you could put things into, there is no unique stuff, no armor, no utilities, no weapons, no nothing which could spice things up immeasurably. Its a completely dud feature that is basically in an alpha state still.

- Size: Despite a few glaring shortcomings which could be patched up as time goes on, i love this game, which brings me to my final problem: Size. I want more. I want more buildings, more toys, more research, more equipments, more things to experiment with. I want rare monsters, rare events, rare things that are exclusive to this planet. I want to sh*t my pants and feel like an explorer.
I want to be blind sided and caught off guard with something cool.
I adore the bio scanner concept, of actually doing research on the stuff around you, the idea of exploration and all that jazz, but there is not enough. It needs more.

TL;DR: I think the game's largest issue is that there is not enough of it.
The base, the skeleton, the foundation is all there, all good, and you can see that its awesome, but yeah: Its not done. Its missing the interior, its missing the walls, the decoration, the detail work.
The game's fun potential could be booted to orbit if they focused more on the ""im the first person to step on a completely alien planet where i DO NOT KNOW what could happen"".

The players should be hit with that vibe time and time again. Around ever corner they should run into things that pull them out of the rts style monotony of the game. Not via difficulty spikes and annoying events, but simply with the setting of the game: You are going to encounter things you didnt know about, and combining this with the lacking item drop feature, you have a goldmine of fun at your feet, it just needs to be expanded on.

Final thought: Good game. You cant help to feel that its barebone and unfinished, but its a good game. I recommend it and i will instantly buy any dlc they release. Thats something i rarely do. In fact, the only other game i did this for is rimworld, so that should say something.",1657999748,1657999748,True,1,0,0.474950522184371948,0,True,False,False

[h1]Quick Summary [/h1]
Riftbreaker takes the base-building genre and puts you in control of a powerful mech with fun weapons and gadgets to kill swarms of enemies. Layered on top are excellent tech, engaging progression, and explosive combat. The only lacking component is the UI, which most RTS fans will have a hard time looking past. Despite the minor gripes I have, it’s a top-tier adventure, killing and expanding across the planet.

[h1]Genre Blending [/h1]
EXOR Studios has proven again that they can mix two genres, pull it off and make it look great. It focuses on wreaking havoc with your mech coupled with basic logistics and base-building gameplay, that will ease people into the logistics genre if it’s their first, but not too simple for veterans to be bored. 

You have multiple themed locations to visit on your planet separated by loading screens. Each area varies by focusing on certain resources, weather conditions, hazards, and introducing new enemies. This forces you to mix up how you build and set up your power grid. Each new location has a specific resource to gather and they don’t get attacked when you’re not there.

[h1]Straight to Setting Up[/h1]
All major resources, used to build and craft ammo, are mined straight from the ground using the specific building for it, with no combining or complex setups, which fans of logistic games will find lacking. You do have secondary resources that are gathered mostly through plants from themed locations. You are able to plant these, once discovered at your main base, and is the only complex setup in the game with supplying water and overlapping harvesting and planting for min-maxing.

For each introduction of a new resource, of which there are around a dozen, you have to go through the same “scan the ground and dig” until an eventual change-up. Even in-game they mention this process is tedious and give you a new area or quest that expedites the process, every time around the halfway point. They mix it up in a couple of ways: like killing elite variants, blowing up nests, or scanning the natural fauna. 

[h1]Satisfyingly Streamlined[/h1]
I would consider Riftbreaker a well-streamlined game, as resources gathered anywhere are just instantly put in your stockpile. Starting with your power grid, which can be just around you, or your whole area’s base if connected up. There are multiple different types of power each with pros and cons, and most new locations encourage or require certain setups, like lava plants and gas using swamp sludge.

Ammo is managed by your usage against your production. They balance this very well by capping how many you can build at each tech advancement. Ammo is wonderfully teleported straight to your character, a godsend for how much slaughtering goes on. 

[h1]Base Building for Consoles[/h1]
It’s nice to see this style of game approachable to a wider audience, but sacrifices were made to do this. I feel it was tedious to do so much construction with a controller(I swapped away fast) with so much tabbing through so many buildings versus what a simple press with a mouse and keybindings allows. You don’t get a bounding box to mass upgrade/sell or toggle power. Each building upgrade is, weirdly, done individually. I had to spaz out and try to hit everything with the cursor. You can keybind specific buildings, but there are a lot of them, so good luck fitting and remembering them all. 

Hardcore logistics fans will miss having things like a pipette tool, ghost planning for setups, and blueprints. Although the game never gets complex enough to need them, they would be nice and prevents building massive bases with ease. Traveling back and forth from your many smaller bases is a breeze with a cheap teleporter unlocked from the start so long, tedious treks never happen.

[h1]Progression is King[/h1]
If you love tech trees and a constant drip of content, Riftbreaker will please you. You have three trees, one for the buildings and defenses, another for your weapons and gadgets, and one that gives more specific items for the campaign, along with some exotic weapons to be built. I love that you can stack research so you don’t have to go back every few minutes to start a new one. There is enough new tech to unlock that even towards the end, you still get new toys to try out. 

 [h1]Combat Feels *Chef’s Kiss*[/h1]
Combat is where the game really shines compared to its competition. Riftbreaker has the standard range of bullet, energy, and explosive weapons that you have come to expect, with some nice side variants. What prevents this game from becoming stale is that most enemies will have some immunity as well as a weakness to a type of ammo and element. This prevents spamming just one weapon or ammo type(aka can’t use all four explosive weapons at once). Along with the ammo management, it forces you to have a variety of tools to kill, and boy the tools are cool. 

They bring back the classic black hole in grenade form, four types of explosive weapons each with a pro and con, even the nuke. You got your lasers, a freeze ray, and big boy melee weapons too. You have consumable gadgets like healing, a personal turret, and mines. Early on, it will be hard to balance printing ammo vs the resource drain of using a weapon or gadget. 

With each type of weapon, you get better versions as you progress the campaign. You do get mods to augment the weapons along with your mech itself. You can get a dash that leaves a fire trail, a ground pound, or teleport for your mobility mod. You even get a mod to slow time, paired with the beautiful chaos is beautiful. Each weapon can have up to 3 mods, and there are plenty to choose from: increase spread, decrease cost, add AOE, lifesteal, and many more.

[h1]That’s A lot of Aliens[/h1]
The difficulty of this game is great until you get to the end. In the beginning, they slowly ease the alien count and variety as you get some bases built, then get smashed as a huge wave murders your hard work. Most new enemies come from each location and campaign progress made, so you never truly feel overwhelmed. 

A small sample of the types you encounter are: fast zerg-like cannon fodder, teleporting heavy-hitting snakes, stealth ninjas, or big AOE artillery strikes using creepy slugs. Getting surrounded by these enemies that counter your current setup and dying as you can’t see through all the chaos made me smile like a kid. The mix and amount of them are truly fantastic. 



[h1] Lackluster Stuff [/h1]
I would probably say a big factor in how easy the game gets, comes down to how you can spam dash and outrun all enemies with just a one-speed mod. Eventually, you can solo pretty much any horde thrown at you unless you get careless as nothing new is thrown at you in the last few hours 

The bosses or should I say lack of bosses are sad when compared to EXOR’s previous work that brought action to the tower defense genre. There, they made set piece bosses with creative move-sets and phases tailored to destroying towers. One that could easily be reskinned, was a slow-moving laser spider robot that would roam around and target your turrets, which would fit right in. 

The only boss they have is more akin to a buffed-up elite version of a similar enemy. It was never brought back in normal waves to add a nice power curve that was much needed in the end with the final wave feeling tame to what it should be.

The guy wrote the reviews is wrong on so many counts so I'm going to counter all (or most) of his points. This is because I believe Riftbreaker is one of those absolute diamonds in the rough of a strategy/city builder that deserves more attention that it's gotten. All POINTS in bold are HIS, none bold comments are mine. Here goes....

[b]Point 1. Everything becomes a chore. While you are still happy to extinguish all Tyranids and collect all resources on your first map it becomes a bit chastening when you realize you have to do this again and again and again on several other areas.[/b]

I thought this too but then realized, after listening and reading to the tutorial and tips that resources can be used across ALL outposts and every building besides defenses and energy generators work across ALL outposts too. So you can have a main base that is fortified as hell, yet on an outpost that receives no attacking enemies (due to it being low threat) you can have all your important buildings, such as research buildings, resource buildings, armories e.t.c all on that outpost without issue. The ease at which bases can be built also negates whatever negative there is about building another base.


[b]Point 2. The tech tree is interesting at first but here the quantity strikes again. You (can) research every weapon and mod 4 times and most buildings 3 times and there are a lot of weapons, mods and buildings in this game. This feels a bit like the devs wanted to strech the playtime.[/b]

He may not have noticed this so forgive him on this one just in case, but the reason for having to research weapons and mods 4 times and buildings 3 times is because they're UPGRADES. Like in literally every citybuilder and strategy game in existence. You reach a plateau with which you need to overcome in order to research the next stage of buildings that will help your defenses become strong and economy more plentiful. Like I said, it's good strategy and city builder game design 101. You want to feel the joy of upgrading your energy generators to the next stage so you now don't need to worry about using space to build more.


[b]Point 3. Many buildings are capped by the amount of how many you can build, research facilities for example and ammo depots. First is probably, as mentioned, to stretch the playtime and second feels like the reason is balancing, not letting the player run around with almost infinite ammo (I really don't like balance as a reason for anything to be like it is)[/b]

This is a non issue. I completed the story in a little over 20 hours of playtime. Also, I ran around a lot. Shot a lot of enemies with a lot of weapons. Never once did I think ""man, I wish I had infinite ammo"". It's kind of not fun to run around in a game with godmode turned on, ya know? These 2 things are game design decisions so as to not provide the player with too much ""power"" and attempt to keep the game feeling challenging. Just to reiterate, I completed the story in a little over 20 hours. There's no playtime stretching here.


[b]Point 4. While the variety of events is nice they appear way too often. There are barely 24hours that go by without something happening just to annoy the player. It would have been better if the events would be way rarer but had more impact.[/b]

I'm one of those types of players who prefers a chill city builder. I don't like having to panic fix a situation in my base. Luckily, the events he's talking about are not as bothersome as he describes. The ones that really can mess you up are tornadoes, meteor showers and earthquakes. Everything else just adds to the immersion and atmosphere. I think on lower threat planets, where enemies don't attack your base, you experience more of these natural events maybe. But that's a small price to pay for no enemy attacks, is it not? That's good game balancing. That being said, tornadoes and meteor showers can do some damage. If these were more powerful, albeit rarer, they would seriously not be fun because sections of your base would be completely wiped out, rather than some power connectors or pipes destroyed and buildings damaged. Definitely not fun.


[b]Point 5. I know my WH40K meme level is high but to be honest there is no real explanation why the fauna is so strong and hostile. In Factorio you are at least told that your pollution triggers them and they get stronger through evolving but in this game it's because of reasons. Energy waves and stuff.[/b]


So he's asking here for a lore reason to explain why enemy waves become stronger as you progress? I mean, this is really nitpicky stuff here. I guess it would've been nice, alas, not a reason to avoid this game.


[b]6. While the game provides you with a lot of (useless) statistics and information there is no overview of your current Dreadnought stats. Like a screen that shows you resistances, running speed, and all that stuff. Would be especially helpful when you equipped four mods that raise several different stats each to see the final result.[/b]

I actually agree with this. Would be nice to see a total stats page when you have all your mods installed. However, absolutely NOT a reason to give this game a bad review nor is it a reason to not buy this amazing game!

[b]7. When you craft mods a lot of stats they will have are not shown in the description. You see 2-3 stats that will be increased like +50 Hitpoints, +3m/s running speed but the mod will end up increasing up to 7-8 stats. I don't even know if they are always the same or if the not shown stat increases are random.[/b]

I don't know what he's talking about here. I craft a mod, it says what stats it increases, it increases those stats. This one is confusing.


[b]8. Ashley S. Nowak and Mr. Riggs repeat themselves way too much and don't even change tone. Yeah thanks for telling me a dust storm is coming, yes I know it will influence my sight. Yes I know solar panels will be less effective and wind turbines more effective. I payed attention the first 20 times you told me.
Also, a lot of dialogue between Ashley and Riggs is very obvious just for telling the player parts of the (almost non existant) plot or how things work. Imagine walking around saying ""I need a coffee so I have to go to the kitchen and switch on the coffee machine because it makes coffee. And then I leave the house for work because I am employed.""[/b]

The talking between the AI and Ashley never bothered me for a moment. I personally didn't feel like I even needed to turn it off or mute them. In fact I felt it was helpful to keep them on because they gave me audio cues as to incoming events and other things that I can put my attention on. I think this is also one of those things he's being nitpicky about and down to personal preference, so again, not a reason to give this game a negative review.

Unfortunately I can't fit his final points on this review but I disagreed vehemently with those too. Ultimately, this guy apparently wants to redesign the game. The WHOLE POINT of this game are the sheer SWARMS of enemies that invade your base. Seeing your wonderful and awesome turrets utterly decimate all these aliens as they SWARM your base is one of the most satisfying things I've experienced and played in a game in a long time. Literally trying to redesign the game it was originally intended to be. Again, this is his personal preference. You can see from the clips on the store page exactly how the enemies will look and invade your base. There's no excuse to go in to this game expecting something like Monster Hunter with aliens or whatever he wants.

I was hesitant to get this after playing the demo. Gameplay seemed a bit one-note and the voice acting a bit iffy which resulted in me just keeping it wishlisted for a price reduction. 

Once it went on sale I decided to get it anyway and found that while the voice acting is still a little iffy, I seriously misjudged the gameplay of this game. The scale at which you build your base starts small but you suddenly find yourself scaling up to fit your needs, and suddenly you've had to build an absolutely enormous megacomplex that you have to thoughtfully lay out and defend. You also have to visit other areas to find rare resource deposits to help fuel your increasingly hungry base while you work towards powering your rift gate to earth, so you can finally get home. This results in an incredibly addictive gameplay loop, you build the thing to help you shoot the thing, so you can get to the thing that helps you build the better thing, and the cycle continues. 

Before I knew it, a 'quick 30 minute session to try the game out before bed' had spiralled in to 4 hours, and the sun was coming up.

Production chains aren't needlessly complicated, with buildings generally requiring (in my playthrough so far at least anyway) only 3 inputs: Power being the universal necessity, then things like water and plant biomass to create natural gas, which you then pipe in to a gas power plant for a nice backup energy source if you start running low. And some basic elements, like carbonium and ironium can be synthesized from power a la Supreme Commanders Mass Converters, so you don't really worry you'll run out of basic building materials and be unable to find more. The research tech tree is also huge, and you're constantly unlocking new buildings, upgrades for your base and weapons for your mech, even research in to alien life results in passive upgrades getting unlocked, there's so much content here from what seems such a simple concept.

Besides the absolutely huge waves of Zerg crawlies you'll be assaulted by, there are also natural hazards and events, such as earthquakes, lightning storms and meteor showers. Not all events are hazardous; some can range from minor annoyances, such as rain making your solar panels stop producing power, to beneficial, such as Ion storms supercharging your wind and solar farms. The best thing about this? The difficulty has loads of customisation options, and you can even turn these events off if you don't want to have to deal with them.

And for the cherry on top? This is the single-most well optimized raytracing support I have ever seen, and it really makes the shadows and lighting pop. On my 3080 with everything on high on 2560x1440 I can get a reasonably stable 120fps, seeing dips in to the 110 range when action gets hectic. If I run the game at 1080p, the fps stays locked to 144Hz and does not drop a single frame until the late-game, when you have thousands of enemies swarming you from all sides, and even then the lowest I've seen it drop is 90fps [b][i]with all raytracing options enabled[/i][/b]. Did I also mention mod support via Nexus Mods? 

There are the odd couple of bugs, such as Tier 3 Fusion Plants having less plasma storage than Tier 2 and some crafted weapons coming out with DPS values way below the minimum for the crafting tier, but ultimately they're minor. The only bug I experienced which I considered game breaking is a rare one (only happened once in 30+ hours of campaign gameplay) where a building getting sold or destroyed can result in your entire power grid completely failing and refusing to come back online, but this can be resolved by either reloading an earlier save and disconnecting the building from your connectors before it's removed, or with a handy console command that the developers have shared as a workaround while they try to figure the issue out.

The only thing I consider irksome though is the voice acting. For the most part it's serviceable, but Mr Riggs clearly has voice lines recorded by two different voice actors; the majority with an American accent, but others with a heavy Eastern-European accent where I imagine they wanted to add a few more voice lines and called in someone local to Poland, who isn't credited in the game, to record them instead of the original actor. I don't have a preference to either voice but I wish they'd stuck with one or the other rather than mixing the two, as it's noticeable and quite jarring when you hear the difference. Also while some buildings have different models to differentiate between tiers, some remain the same and just get the number of the tier stamped on them in a blue circle, which is a little disappointing.

The voice acting and a couple of minor issues aside though, it's some of the most fun I've had with a game over the last 12 months besides Elden Ring. My only regret is thinking that £25 was too much for this game after playing the demo - it's definitely worth it.",1650825390,1656417520,True,5,0,0.586963057518005371,0,True,False,False

Not much story, but the squabbling of our scientist lady and combat mech can be quite charming. See TL;DR below if you dont want to read everything.


The concept is quite unique, and generally well executed. Most of the time you will be exploring and fighting through a flourishing deathworld, set up defensive lines or build up an economy. Riftbreaker also has a remarkable attention to detail in some areas; the hordes of sometimes 100 and more enemies are quite impressive and scary, and so is the destructive effect of your weapons. Especially in the forest areas, your ability to waste the scenery with artillery, flamethrower and missiles is genuinely impressive, and so are the chunks of your enemies raining down after tripping a nuclear mine.

As much as this game has a very strong mixture, it does come with the rough edges that ambitious games from smaller devs often show. The game can be heavy on your PCs performance; although you can mitigate it by outsourcing (protip: only build planters in outposts). Theres also bugs, which were never game-breaking to me, but require a bit of frustration-tolerance, and rarely a workaround. The UI and controls are also quite clunky; the basic twin stick shooting feels good, but everything beyond is a bit more tedious than it needed to be. You can still get used to it; only scanning is over the top. I recommend a 5x or 10x scan speed mod, there is no benefit in the ultra-slow vanilla speed.

Theres also some balancing issues, especially in the lategame. There is a good number of personal weapons, but some (Minigun) are clearly stronger than others (Light MG), and some are just useless (laser). Charge-weapons like railguns are kinda unusable, because its too hard to keep track of charge state, especially with the slow downs. They are also just not fun.
Riftbreakers earlygame is quite challenging, but the enemy difficulty drops off in the midgame, where its a bit more about creating renewable ressource production. In the lategame, it just gets too easy. You (mostly) got more ressources than you ever need, and enemies just do not scale against T3 weapons and turrets; even some T2 turret spam can defeat any wave without as much as a scratch.


TL;DR and summary?
Riftbreaker has its rough edges, requires minor frustration-tolerance and is a bit imbalanced. But its also a good execution of a really damn cool concept, with more technical brillance than you'd expect for such a game. It will entertain you for 30 hours of a playthrough, and maybe beyond that, if you care so. The game sold well and the devs seem busy doing updates to alleviate some of the problems, while a DLC should make sure to keep support going for a while, even if you limit yourself to the maingame.

game is still fine overall for a typical game, but after having a taste of things with so much polish like factorio (which, i understand why that's an unfair comparison), it makes me wonder why i'd play this in place, just to get frustrated with little nuisances here and there consistently 

you can't dismantle multiple crafted items at a time, but you'd want to craft over and over for stat rolls

you can't equip multiple passive stat upgrades at a time, you have to go through annoying menus and prompts over and over, but you'd essentially want to keep swapping them constantly for the most benefit 

you don't get ghosts of destroyed buildings, so unless you remember where everything went, have fun rebuilding each individual piece 

the building menu itself is unintuitive, with a little arrow for page 1/2, but that button doesn't do anything, you press something off of the actual building bar because there's no hotkey

again, most of it is minor; 
you don't NEED to dismantle everything 
you don't NEED to swap upgrades all the time
you don't NEED to rebuild everything the same way it was before 
so, i'd still recommend it, game is still being worked on so maybe these issues will get fixed, it just kinda feels early-access-y and not really a full launch to have generic game loop issues not easily accessible",1655037291,1655037467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I bought Riftbreaker after watching some videos about it and the gameplay looked interesting and even got it in a minor sale (I think it was around 10-20% off)

The start is pretty good, it looks good, it plays good but it falls off not long after.

The plot is pretty simple, you are a battle sister from the Adepta Sororitas controlling a Contemptor Dreadnought inhabitated by the Machine Spirit called Mr. Riggs. You are sent through the Warp on a planet that is in Reconnaissance stage from a Tyranid swarm.
Your goal is to claim the planet and its valuable resources for the Emperor of Mankind while defending yourself against the hostile Tyranid fauna.

First, in my honest opinion there are only two types of content, quantity and quality.
Quantity content can be fine if the gameplay loop is nice, like if playing the game is just so much fun that you don't mind building thousands of structures and having to collect hundreds of thousands of minerals. This game is not like this (but to be honest just barely misses it)

Let's talk about the good stuff first.
1.  There is a lot of variety. There are four different biomes that are REALLY different with every biome having it's unique traits and enemies.
2. Everything is kinda pretty. If you don't mind the drop down angle the game looks beautiful, the maps, thecreatures, the animations, flora, structures, etc.
3. Your have a lot of options customizing your dreadnought ranging from appearance to mods boosting your stats to many different weapons and support modules like a dash or jump.
4. The enviromental sound is pretty neat, the planet and areas you are in really sound alive with snails making snailish sounds, rock golems stomping around, you know what I mean.
5. A lot of different events ranging from a blood moon (including a Terraria reference) over meteor showers in the vulcano areas of the planet, earthquakes, to ion storms that disable parts of your gear

So why don't I recommend the game? Well, easy to explain, the game is all about quantity and not quality.
1. Everything becomes a chore. While you are still happy to extinguish all Tyranids and collect all resources on your first map it becomes a bit chastening when you realize you have to do this again and again and again on several other areas.
2. The tech tree is interesting at first but here the quantity strikes again. You (can) research every weapon and mod 4 times and most buildings 3 times and there are a lot of weapons, mods and buildings in this game. This feels a bit like the devs wanted to strech the playtime.
3. Many buildings are capped by the amount of how many you can build, research facilities for example and ammo depots. First is probably, as mentioned, to stretch the playtime and second feels like the reason is balancing, not letting the player run around with almost infinite ammo (I really don't like balance as a reason for anything to be like it is)
4. While the variety of events is nice they appear way too often. There are barely 24hours that go by without something happening just to annoy the player. It would have been better if the events would be way rarer but had more impact.
5. I know my WH40K meme level is high but to be honest there is no real explanation why the fauna is so strong and hostile. In Factorio you are at least told that your pollution triggers them and they get stronger through evolving but in this game it's because of reasons. Energy waves and stuff.
6. While the game provides you with a lot of (useless) statistics and information there is no overview of your current Dreadnought stats. Like a screen that shows you resistances, running speed, and all that stuff. Would be especially helpful when you equipped four mods that raise several different stats each to see the final result.
7. When you craft mods a lot of stats they will have are not shown in the description. You see 2-3 stats that will be increased like +50 Hitpoints, +3m/s running speed but the mod will end up increasing up to 7-8 stats. I don't even know if they are always the same or if the not shown stat increases are random.
8. Ashley S. Nowak and Mr. Riggs repeat themselves way too much and don't even change tone. Yeah thanks for telling me a dust storm is coming, yes I know it will influence my sight. Yes I know solar panels will be less effective and wind turbines more effective. I payed attention the first 20 times you told me.
Also, a lot of dialogue between Ashley and Riggs is very obvious just for telling the player parts of the (almost non existant) plot or how things work. Imagine walking around saying ""I need a coffee so I have to go to the kitchen and switch on the coffee machine because it makes coffee. And then I leave the house for work because I am employed.""
9. Ashley and Riggs have no personalities. Ashley tells Riggs one (!) personal story about herself how she lost her arm and... well there is nothing else. How am I supposed to like a character I know basically nothing about. Same goes for Riggs which acts like a software program with voice (probably because Silica Animus is considered Heretek Omega). Titanfall 2 is a good example how to do a mech you not only use but also like, maybe even consider a friend... I didn't cry at the end! It was raining!!!
10. The final mission is somewhat frustrating but not because it is hard. I don't mind the whole planet attacking me because i started the final sequence, I mind failing the sequence and not getting any response why it failed. Ashley+Riggs can't stop talking but when it would be helpful both can't provide you with a sentence like ""The startup sequence failed because we ran out of coolant fluid"".
11. There are way too many enemies and because of that you don't care that they look and sound awesome, you just categorize them into melee swamers, ranged swarmers, tanks like the stone golems, duelists, artillery and you don't really care about anything else. Quality>Quantity, make enemies rarer, stronger and more difficult to kill. And there are like 2-3 boss battles in the whole campaign that don't even feel like boss battles.

Such a big missed opportunity in the game. Imagine you are walking around in a dense forest, filled with hostile creatures, looking for a patch of iron. You scan in advance, frightened what might lurk behind the next two trees. Then you hear something and a chill goes down your spine realizing it's coming from a Tyranid Warrior. A strong and fast duelist that engages you in melee with heavy strikes. Able to do a powerful, metal slicing dash attack from distance. You look into your beastiary to confirm them being vulnerable to physical damage. So you equip your power fist/sword/hammer/spear and kneel down to pray to the Emperor of Mankind.

A spiritu dominatus,
Domine, libra nos,
From the lighting and the tempest,
Our Emperor, deliver us.
From plague, temptation and war,
Our Emperor, deliver us,
From the scourge of the Kraken,
Our Emperor, deliver us.
From the blasphemy of the Fallen,
Our Emperor, deliver us,
From the begetting of daemons,
Our Emperor, deliver us,
From the curse of the mutant,
Our Emperor, deliver us,
A morte perpetua,
Domine, libra nos.
That thou wouldst bring them only death,
That thou shouldst spare none,
That thou shouldst pardon none
We beseech thee, destroy them.

Freed from any fear you know your action is authorized by the Will of the Emperor. Your soul is pure and blessed. You don't feel any emotion except being thankful for being able to serve the Divine God of Mankind. Without any further hesitation you stand up, scream a final ""FOR THE EMPEROR"" and charge the Xenos.
(I let your imagination play the rest out)

So, my final verdict is a solid average and to be honest, i would have recommended the game if it wouldn't show so much potential to be better in many ways but if you like being the bullet storm without much depth this is your game.",1654970626,1654970626,False,157,44,0.644882380962371826,0,True,False,False

Pros:
[list]
[*] It's a beautiful game. The way the environment reacts to you and the overall visual effects give it a strong sense of grandeur.
[*] The weapons feel like they have some power and there is enough variety to give the player a choice in combat style. Personally, I found myself sticking with the weapons I enjoyed using and as of writing this did not fully use the arsenal of weaponry at the players disposal. 
[*] Base building is enjoyable and plenty of RTS mechanics show themselves here. I poured hours on setting up defensible positions followed by fortifying and eventually expanding.
[*] The campaigns story was well done and makes you feel like the character witnessing a new planet and its inhabitants for the first time. The best part is the English voice actors did great. If they had others or put less effort this game may have been less enjoyable.
[*] Wonderful sound design. Not sure if I could have heard some stock sounds from Tiberium Wars in there but I absolutely enjoyed the SFX of all the weapons, buildings, and enemies.
[*] and much more that I forgot...
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
[*] While I did enjoy the game quite a lot of time was spent on [spoiler] researching the local wildlife [/spoiler] repetitive tasks which while easy to do, was tedious.
[*] Late game this game starts to slow down and by slow down I mean simulation wise. I am running gen 1 ryzen 7, RTX 3060TI, and 16GB of RAM. My machine is no joke and at high settings with an expansive base and, [i]google chrome with youtube running in the background on another monitor[/i], an early smooth running game can turn into a crawling slowmo view of a massive attack. Not a nock on the game as I personally expect this to happen, but I can only imagine it on a much weaker computer.
[*] Not sure how the difficulty scales in this game or if its because I took way to long in general but at some point in the campaign the waves went from manageable to Avatar's mother nature equivalent of getting the finger. On a normal difficulty could have had to reload on a defeat if it wasn't for some quick thinking.
[*] I ended up running into a game breaking bug which wipes out your power grid. Had to google search the solution which was to use the debug console and execute [b]debug_recreate_buildings[/b] which luckily auto completes for you. Unluckily, I was about to beat the game and caused a final objective to be wiped and had to restart from the beginning on it.

The feeling of battling massive amounts of enemies with nothing but your lone mech is incredible. However, toward the late game managing your economy becomes much more tedious; resource nodes dry up, and you have to constantly establish new mining outposts to keep things running. I did not find this aspect of the game enjoyable, and I feel it really dragged things out unnecessarily.

Tangential to the above complaint, by the time I had unlocked end game buildings I had absolutely no desire to build them; they required too many resources, and far too much space. Those are challenges that I wouldn't have minded dealing with earlier in my playthrough, but after 40 hours in I just didn't see the appeal of moving my defensive line *again*.

It is simply a pleasure to view at all times. The gameplay can range from casual to incredibly difficult so there's going to be a level for everyone. 

The campaign can be blown through pretty quickly if desired, but I took my time and got my monies worth out of the game. And it is pretty re-playable in survival so you can get even more value.

Thats about it. 

[b] NOTE: The Game has been played on BRUTAL difficutly, as Hard was too easy. [/b]
And even Brutal is oddly empty of anything. Most of the fights you pick yourself. Sure there is a horde every now and then but you can easily defeat them on your own without much skill. Add Towers to the mix and as soon as you research both Flame and Artillery Towers (the first tower researches) you have won.

[b]But why will you be bored?[/b]
[list]
    [*]Everything is on a Timer
    [*]Most Missions make you wait
    [*]There is nothing to be explored
    [*]The Build Tool will Waste your Time
[/list]
The entire Game runs on a Timer. You need to research a research for like 4 to 15 (!) minutes and after that you build a corresponding building (in a single click mind you) and need to wait 5 minutes (!!!!) just for it to finally appear. Now lets get to the reason that pushed me over the edge to negative:
The Build Tool is horrendous, sensitive and just cant be reason it. For a Game that constantly wants you to readjust your base it is baffeling how final every click is. Once you started selling something, you cant stop it. want to delete the Walls around your Orbital Command, to expand the Base? I sure hope you are prepared to click individually and with pixel perfect accuracy because the second you get impatient and ""drag"" the selling tool it will jump around and sell that beautiful orbital command that took 6 Minutes to build and you need to watch as it disintegrates for about a minute and then you can rebuild it all over again! what fun! And in the meantime nothing and absolutely nothing will happen ingame. No threats no nothing.

There is no real thought in basebuilding, only tedium. 
There is no real thought in exploration, only beautiful graphics.
There is no real thought in base defending, only spamming towers.
There is no real effort put in to keep you engaged.
There is, however, an achievement for cutting 10.000 pieces of grass. And in my Playtime I managed to do about 3/4 of it. I was that bored out of my mind.

Conclusion:
The Game looks beautiful, it sounds beautiful. The Cutscenes are high class but it is just too mindless for me. If you enjoy running around in a Mech with double Hammers and just spam hits for hours on end in a beautiful rainstorm that lasts like 20 seconds. Be my guest. There is nothing to think about, nothing to strategize, just walk and smash and wait for research to finish and buildings to be build. It feels like a AAA Mobile Game: All in the Graphics, everything else is designed to scam you out of money. I am just glad this doesn't have Micro Transactions.

[b]Final Verdict: 4/10 buy on at least 50% sale. There is clear Value in this title but most is in the fancy windowdressing. I am not easily bored by repitious task, having played Steel Division 2 about 300 hours on the same map with the same settings. This game bored me out of my mind.[/b]",1653914909,1653914909,False,5,2,0.391369521617889404,0,True,False,False

[h1]Great Game, Fun Adventure[/h1]

Riftbreaker tries to be a hack and slash, boom and zoom action adventure, where you're constantly preached at about science. It would be ok if that just happened once, but you get the same dialogue on repeat for every disaster event, even if you've heard it 300 times.

Even if you focus on research, the options are truly limited. There's no way of developing any symbiosis between the animals, plants, environment, and ???. There's no connection between plants and animals. Heck, if they did it could easily lead to a chain reaction that slowly begins terraforming your landscape... but I digress.

[spoiler]Besides the option of becoming invisible,[/spoiler] you cant tolerate animal presence in Riftbreaker. You absolutely must kill many of them, or you will lose the game. Animals attacking your base in swarms is a blast[spoiler], especially with nukes and lasers and floating mines, etc[/spoiler].

At the end of the game is a grind so ridiculous it defies reason. You've conquered the planet but now you must make many, many buildings in order to build the endgame device.

The game is a definite start, lots of fun. But it needs a workshop, or a map editor, or scenario editor, or something.

And we are not talking about 2-3 minutes, technologies can take around 10 minutes each, forcing you to spend hours in game for really no reason while you wait to be able to complete your goal and advance the game... terrible.

The invasions are not fun. You are not told where the enemies will be coming from so how are you supposed to defend in the early game? Regardless you are usually doing things and all of a sudden you are notified of a wave coming in 2 minutes. That is no where near enough time to build a defence in a game like this. It just wastes your time rebuilding your base. Not to mention you don't know how strong the attack will be..

The dialogue is super annoying. The levels are too long. The tech tree is unnecessarily broad and demanding.

It comes close, but it wasn't enjoyable in the end for me.",1652406235,1652406235,False,8,0,0.570415019989013672,0,True,False,False

""Minecraft meets Diablo and Factorio, in space,"" is an idea that unfortunately works better on paper than in a game, because the tower defense part of factorio doesn't gel with the personal RPG elements of Diablo or minecraft-there's very little opportunity for the personal expression you see in minecraft, the RPG elements of Diablo are minimized down to the point of really just having some gear options that are gated behind a crafting system that isn't particularly interesting,  and the tower defense and resource management are strangled by the game's insistence that I go and fight things in the robot-so my defenses can be good, but typically not good enough to hold without my personal intervention, so I have to go fight things in the robot, which throws me right back into the RPG and loadout part of the game not really being all that good, and also not being able to sustain itself without the . The game is trying to rest on a pair of very different gameplay loops that just keep interrupting each other in a way that's very much to the player's detriment.

The concept of going to an alien planet, by yourself, and needing to forage to survive is a proven winner, but the choice to take that formula and inject constant dialogue is questionable-it actually takes a really charismatic pair of characters with good chemistry to make a script with only two people in it work at all. I don't really find the robot or the girl very charismatic or interesting to listen to at all-which is not the fault of the actors, but the writers. The conversations that are constantly happening just don't have much entertainment value, and the weather reports and reminders about active quest markers are actively detrimental to my enjoyment of the game-the weather reports could be replaced with a sound effect and an icon on the side of the screen, and the harassment to go check out the eleventh nest of hostile creatures that has spawned since I started playing should just be jettisoned entirely. It is quite simply obnoxious to be shouted at every two minutes about pending sidequests when I'm trying to organize the infrastructure for mid-game power generation. Again, it's an interruption of the fun.

Finally, the systems of resource management, gearing, and research are all naturally fun to explore on their own, but the game gates a lot of content behind mandatory tutorials. It is NOT helpful to have a new resource padlocked behind a tutorial on the farming system when I already worked out how to build a farm several hours ago. That would be just a minor gripe, except that one of the tutorials demanded I place a building on invalid terrain. 
This is the point where I stopped playing.

Pros:
+ Replay-ability
+Crafting system
+Story
+Instructions (didn't feel like hand holding)
+Difficulty ranges
+Voice/sound clarity
+Unique environments
+Resources and management
+Clear objectives
+Makes me want to play Factorio again!

Cons:
-Some times the dialog will cut out and you'll miss some of the audio if there is an event that happens (alien swarm/attack)
-Mod menu (I feel this could be shown better in a table format and when you hover over the icon it'll give you a quick description)
-Alien crafting (specifically if there was a tool tip which biome can find the plants/colonies to get to level 2)
-Bioscanner, as soon as it is unlocked give a notification how to use it!!! (I'm not going to say I went ~15 hours before the message to use the middle mouse button activates it or anything... ...)
-Some times when you click on the main menu, I feel like there should be a loading icon to let the player know the game didn't crash
-Makes me want to play Factorio again!

Overall I would rate this as 9/10 in its current state.  While I thought this was going to be more of an action/3D Factorio, I'm so excited it wasn't!  Not having to deal with belts and production on a large scale with this level of involvement makes the base expansion to exploration balance perfect.  Speaking of base expansion, I cannot give this enough praise.  Building over what is currently there sometimes has an oops moment but overall it speeds up the game play in a positive direction.

Enemies, I'm excited to see what else will be released in the future with the current set!  The range of different enemies to fight/avoid has an excellent balance.  There are some that are annoying to fight and others that reminds you how enjoyable a flamethrower can be.  I haven't ran across anything that just wipes me out (I am playing on normal this play through) nor makes me not want to play.

I expect to play several hours of this game.  I don't know if this will be a feature after the story mode is complete but, I would love to see different sites you can specifically scan for.  Overall, I cannot find a single reason not to play this game or recommend it to someone unless this just isn't there genre.  Outside of that, play it.

The Riftbreaker (RB), a good game at first, to which it then tips the scale off at the end...

RB, a moderately okay game that consist of exploring, establishing, experimenting (which gets thrown out middle of the game), and expanding.
The good parts of RB are its research trees, which are interesting, but ultimately falls short as they're basically unlocked by doing the story. It feels sort of alive, due to its mini-events, that can either be meteors falling on the planet, earthquakes, or attack events.

Where RB falls apart, is at its endgame, seemingly tipping the scale off, making bull spongy enemies, without putting up consistent resources for the player to harvet, because the other resources which requires the first resources needs to be harvest and converted for something else, while having you require to mine it somewhere else on another part of the world. Having you to require to macromanage and micromanage so many part of the game, that it just falls apart.

This really makes the Rift portal fight so terrible, because not only does the objective say that you need to [i]construct[/i] 3 parts, which sounds like something you make through the mech, it isn't. It's through the Portal as add-ons, which is confusing. The second part is, if you've placed the portal on a place that's protected on a mountside... expect to have placement issues for magnetic whatever... as you need 4 of them to protect the portal.

After having these done, you are now required to defend this portal for 6 minutes upon activating its functionality, this is where the game falls so far apart, as not only does your processing power to run the game sufficiently... because it slows the game intentionally, as you cannot kill the enemies fast enough. Resource management here breaks it all, as you need uranium, titanium, plasma, supercharged plasma, water or coolant water, electricity for your defences, walls, iron, carbon... it's way too much for the end, which basically means, do I have 1mil resources of all at the minimum to survive the last event? No? Better grind about 6 hours per zone.

Good elements of the game, are marred by its finale, which I didn't finish, as it demands so much [i]work[/i] and not having fun with, as you just repeat the first 12 hours of the game at the last... I don't even know, it's just too much micro- and macromanagement, to the point that, that is all it has to offer, and not being fun.",1650883867,1650883867,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The Riftbreaker is a reasonably traditional base-building and tower defense game with heavy emphasis on research and understanding the underlying mechanics. In its simplest form, you have a long-term goal you're trying to achieve while being regularly attacked by often ridiculously large swarms of enraged local fauna, meaning that you have to spend a lot of time planning and building your base and its defenses, struggling to balance resources and dealing with minor goals that reduce the ""swarm"" effect a little for a while.

Unless you're a really experienced tower defense player, you're likely to find the first playthrough of this game tough and quite frustrating, especially if you choose (as I naively did) to play on ""normal"" difficulty. The good news is that it gets easier once you get more familiar with the nuances of the gameplay.

There are quite a few bugs, although mostly minor and without significant impact on the  overall gameplay - for me, the most frustrating was the way pumps, cultivators and power stations sometimes just stop working for no obvious reason and need to be reconstructed.

The voice acting is... well, honestly, it's pretty poor. Some of the dialog is so stunted it's practically incoherent, and you'll get very sick of hearing the same things over and over again... But again, this is nothing more than a minor annoyance.

Overall, I thought The Riftbreaker was fun and well worth the price.

One notable difference is that the missions don't last the usual 30-90 minutes like SupCom, it's more of a continuous play.

Whereas games like SupCom and Starcraft are a campaign based mission where you go from location to location with a problem to deal with each time, this is a challenge where you are attempting to explore and take over a whole planet while the native wildlife tries to kill you.

The game does have some UX issues around being able to unlock things before it actually explains how to use. If you follow the guidance/recommendations of your mech suit in the first few hours, things are explained as you go rather than having to figure it out for yourself. Google helps if you get stuck anywhere though.
Some things just aren't explained at all well, particularly around upgrading your mech suit. They aren't too hard though and a little trial and error gets you what you want fairly quickly with minimal loss.

Performance is good, autosave often causes game stuttering but otherwise it's very good on a high end system. 2080 ti also seems to have enough grunt to be able to enable the raytracing features while still maintaining a high frame rate.

Jesus christ, I keep finding more game breaking bugs. Outposts no longer rift resources - the entire premise of RIFTbreaker.
Cultivators bypass miners, and now they've sh!t the bed and keep reverting back to making grass whenever I leave HQ.
Then there's the resource depletion on resources that should be infinite.

Fix the bugs! They are gamebreaking and require stupid console cheat fixes to get the game ""working"" again. Some of these bugs I can google and go all the way back to Oct 2021!

Updated Review:

The game now has more bugs than it did at launch.

Outposts don't give resources like they're supposed to, so I have to rift to outposts to collect resources, and while I do that, the Headquarters bugs out and shows negative resources when at my outpost.

Literal game breaking bug that means even with infinite ore turned on, I actually LOSE resources.

I did have this as positive on my first review at launch.

Since then, the game is actually MORE buggy after updates.

Fix the game breaking bugs and you'll get your positive review back.



Original Review:

Very fun game.

I was concerned with pacing issues and timed events etc. I am more of a casual base builder and enjoy crunching numbers and design builds than manic tower placing and min/max dynamic keyboard smashing as each wave comes and you get through rounds by skin of your teeth.

Luckily the game's difficulty modes allow for both casual gamers, and the mental nutters who like to be under attack 24/7 (literally, on brutal the attacks never end).

Now, onto some mild negatives.

There are bugs, however, they are not game breaking (for me, currently). Also the game auto-saves every 5 minutes, and this has saved a few annoying bug resets without really much bother. The devs are releasing updates very fast, and considering it is a 12-person team without a big AAA budget, I would argue talent/output is FAR superior to big budget games. All games have bugs, so I personally find it annoying when people dig indie developers for ""bugs that shouldn't be in a final launch"" when we all know AAA titles are littered with bugs too. It's just double standards.

If you like Command and Conquer and also research trees and base building with small elements of RPG levelling/modding, then you should buy this game.",1635157211,1649711473,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You land on an alien planet with your giant fighting robot, the end goal being the construction of a rift portal back to earth to enable the colonization of the planet.

The gameplay consists of warping to several different maps to harvest materials, gather research data and establish mining outposts. Any materials you mine are added to your planetary stash, accessible from anywhere, while slaughtering thousands of alien creatures that really don't like you coming and disturbing their idyllic little planet. Depending on the map's threat level, you will face periodic attacks in the form of alien hordes coming to wipe you and your bases off the planet, and to to defend against this you build up defensive towers and infrastructure to support them.

The game features 3 large and expansive research trees containing loads of upgrades, structures and weapons to build and craft. You are free to proceed along the story path in any way you wish, limited only in what rare metals you unlock as you go, of which there are 3. Depending on in which order you tackle their discovery story chains in the campaign you will unlock different weapons and biomes which shape your strategy, providing some incentive to replay the campaign again and do it all in a different order with different weapons.

The game is backed up by a fairly barebones story, but great voiceacting works to at least keep it entertaining.

For me, this game came out of nowhere and I was happily surprised to find a great non-early access game from an indie studio, for once. It provided me around 25 hours of fun top-down alien blasting action, and I'm thinking I'll probably play through it again at a later date.

Unfortunately, the game crashes when your base or outposts get too big and there's too much electricity/storage/liquids to process. The game teases you with wide areas to build a huge base, only to punish you for doing so.

I spent 150+ hours in the campaign building outposts, came back to my base to apply all the new upgrades only for the game to crash seconds after loading, each time. 
Has happened before, at an outpost. Had to load a 6 hour old save file and rebuild everything... I'm not gonna start a new campaign, though. Probably gonna try Factorio or Satisfactory.
Leaves a sour taste.

I also highly recommend installing mods to prevent the game from wasting your time with the scanning mechanic and other things.

A tantalizing mix of tower defense, dual-stick action, crafting mechanics and RPG mechanics.   It's more the former two, but adds spices from the latter two.   And very technically polished!  Strong recommend.

Pros:
+ Great graphics and sound.   When your base is under attack, the ground shakes, the sky goes dark.... wonderfully visceral feedback.  
+ Forking gameplay style, thanks to research tree.   The missions are the same, but how you address them is entirely up to you.
+ Comprehensive economy.  At first daunting, it's like a jigsaw puzzle.  ""Oh..... *that's* why that [ power plant | defense  tower | mineral harvester ]  exists!""
+ Plays fair.   When you get mercilessly killed, the game kinda' warned you, and gives you opportunities to adjust your strategy.
+ Lovingly crafted.  The gameplay is *tight*; nothing feels stapled on.    And a nice subtle social message, as opposed to indies hammering you over the head with the Message.

Cons:
- No co-op; but they're working on it.  I get this would be out of scope for the first offering, maybe as DLC?
- Crafting / Resource UX could use a little help.  (Why don't I have Ironium?   Where do I get Unobtaniumite? )   But if you have time for a few playthroughs, you'll get it.   And patches have made this better.

I can't honestly recommend the game as my current experiences with it are just constant crashes causing me to lose my progress time and time again. The game is pretty fun if you get to play it, but theses crashes take all the fun out of it as-is.

Twinstick + TD

Seems like a solid game. Nothing to complain about during my 6 hours of gameplay, but nothing mind blowing either. Just seems like a solid good fun if you like twinstick shooters (or melee) and TD games.
Base building has an RTS feeling moreso.

I finished the first map on easy and only got through like 1/5th of the research tree, so I wonder how shit I am at the game or if it's just unlikely to reach the later techs in a survival game on easy. Either way, there's still stuff left to see for me, which is nice.

There is one weird thing at least tho.

Things I really like about this game: Deep tech tree that keeps you going with base, mech and weapon improvements, add modifications to weapons and enhance their performance in different ways, add all kinds of gear to your mech and spec it for different kind of ops or just spec it for general exploration and combat. The combat in the game is really cool. Each weapon has it own  effects and visuals. Blasting creatures by the dozens and watching limbs and bodies go flying with blood and gore is just awesome! Great graphics and artwork.

i don't care for the frequent banter between Riggs and Ashley. For campaign this is great. it should be totally disabled in survival with notifications only. Because if you play survival you don't need Riggs and Ashley constantly being your training wheels, you should know how to play the game and spec weapons, get around the map, expand, and deal with incursions at that point in your RiftBreaker gaming experience.

Great game! I'm looking forward to future expansions with new terrains and environments, new monsters, new guns and toys and mech customization.

To be fair the game is fun, but minor things make it so infuriating I wanted to uninstall it on the spot.

Pros:
Good weapons, lots of stuff, upgrades, lots of enemies, everything you would want from a tower defense.
Things I found annoying
Cons:
Resources extremely limited, by the time I set up mining on rare a resource it almost ran out already.
Keep in mind you need to protect it so need defense, electricity  and mining infrastructure, walls and stuff.
I found it really annoying to jump from location to another just because I ran out of something just to spend another 30min trying to find a new spot and build the mentioned infrastructure A x3 on the resources would be nicer. (loading screen between locations).
Next

 Natural disasters, Meteor showers, acid rain, Earthquake, You can't do anything against it just watch as they damage all of your buildings (later on you get repair drones) 
I played the story mode
Too many different type of rare resource and most of them locked behind a mission to unlock. I didn't see palladium before 15 hr or more because I didn't know what to do with a mission so focused on other stuff, turns out I finished a game without discovering at least 2 resources locked behind scan these 10X and then you will be able to research it in 5 min.

Game desperately needs co-op So many thing to do, need to be everywhere at once. out of cobalt, out of palladium, ohh no uranium okay now titanium and you just been there an hour ago setting up new mines......

Needs balancing and more guidance how to unlock certain materials or if that material is actually 

Maybe it's just me I dunno.

Damage types are a bit annoying but you're given 6 weapon slots so it's not the worst. Just means if you find a weapon you really like using, get used to switching off of it occasionally. Towers are ok, the tech tree is pretty large and researches can take 5-10 minutes even with max com hubs leveled to same tier.

What leaves me mixed is the pacing. Game is just slow. When you're trying to build you're getting constantly attacked and it feels more tedious than dangerous. Enemies are trivial provided you use good tower placement and mix damage types, the most threatening thing being all the enemies that bombard outside normal tower range making the need for lines of artillery towers necessary. Once you're done building defenses? I mean that's it. You sit around responding to attacks and the same two enemy events (nests and big creatures). There's all this equipment to make and no loadout slot that I seen. Which means you'll be manually replacing 4 things every time you need to build and upgrade, as there are things to reduce cost and speed of building.

I want to like this but I just don't want to play it. Everything is just tedious. It seems arcade like but wants to be deep. That deepness just extends the depths of the shallows. There are quality of life features needed, like drag placement(currently has draw placement), radius tools for upgrade/repair and so on but I've had this game since release and haven't seen many improvements that'd help me enjoy the game more. 

To put it shortly, it's a high quality game that lacks design needed for a consistently fun game. I'm recommending no at full price and yes on sale. You'll get a good 20 hours out of this in campaign playthrough and a few more in survival but you'd have to be a hardcore fan to want to continue.

But it got to the point where enemy attacks was just too frequent for me to enjoy the game any longer.(Huge attack every 2-5 mins)

- Cons / Things I'd like to see changed:

1. Better Repair Tower AI, the current ones are terrible due to the repair drone returning to the tower every time it finished repairing a little bit.

2. Better Keybind page, I literally had to look up on google how to mass upgrade my walls, my right hand started hurting after manually clicking upgrade every wall up until I figure out how to do that. The keybind layout tells you nothing about it, nor does the tutorials. 

3. Chill with the events, huh? It got to the point where I had a tornado, enemy nest and a huge horde with 10+ rock enemies and a ton of long range AoE mobs, all within 2 mins of each other.

4. Lack of Multiplayer, this is something I was missing a lot, I feel this game will become 10 times the game it is now once it gets this feature.(which I know it will soon)


- Pros / Things I really like about the game.

1. Gameplay feels awesome and smooth, even with ray tracing and graphics set to max. 

2. Map layouts are different and each zone feels and looks unique. Who ever designed the maps needs a raise, they look so good!

3. Quests was easy to understand and you always knew what you had to do next.



Conclusion: I'd not recommend it yet, at least not until multiplayer comes out.


- I'll pick the game back up once multiplayer comes out and redo this review if any changes were made.

There is a game breaking bug that shuts power off to an entire base for no reason, no way to fix, have to do a restart save game and hope for the best.

I had been following the game since a preview a couple years prior at one of the many digital game cons. I was immediately drawn in by the style and game-play and when the demo dropped I must have played through it 20 times.

The Riftbreaker is a fantastic hybrid of ARPG, shooter and tower defense. It blends things in a way few other games do and does so in a way that feels fun to play and has many satisfying game-play loops. Combat is fantastic and seeing the huge waves of enemies rush in makes me think of a tidal wave come at the base. You can wade into the thick of them or you can blast them from far away with a ton of cool weapons. You can also just support your (eventually) customized turrets and let them do the heavy lifting.

The base-building could be it's own game. The way the buildings assemble in real time never gets any less satisfying to watch and being able to build a dozen of them, one right after the other, makes it easy to plan, dismantle and redeploy really fast.

If you like tower defense, base-building or RTS games, I'd totally suggest giving it a go as they have a free demo which gives you a good slice of how the game works.",1645762061,1645762061,True,6,0,0.589381992816925049,0,True,False,False

I started a new campaign and have gotten into the game more, but I think a lot of the points I make below are still solid. TLDR it's fine but too expensive and has a few flaws. Some more points I've thought of: 
-Not being able to leave during an invasion feels cheap since you can land on an outpost with little or no defence just to check something then have a big invasion destroy the whole thing.
-It's often unclear why things don't work beyond a small symbol that only makes sense for a few; resources are logical but what does it mean if there's a tiny flask or green arrow? etc. 
-The UI isn't good. You have to open the build menu then right click off it in order to select buildings- this is a necessity for building essential things later which I didn't know about until much further in. Same for turning off the power.
-Most of the other biomes aren't fun (at least at first), but the variety is nice. I don't see the point in making you travel to multiple different points of the same biome though. 
-Worst of all though are the ""hold spacebar for 30 minutes"" mining missions, especially the one with the mushrooms. I feel like they shouldn't be in the game at all, or at least made a lot more engaging.


A decent enough game that I unfortunately can't give a mixed review. It scratches the itch of an RTS but also has a kind of PoE/ARPG and tower defence feel to it, and it reminds me a lot of the campaigns for Starcraft 2. 
If it were around 25% cheaper I think I'd be less inclined to go against but I think it's just [i]slightly[/i] too expensive for what it is- it's listed as 45 AUD which for an indie game is fairly pricey. This is especially considering that the gameplay is fundamentally the same for the entire thing- build base, collect resource, build base, kill aliens, etc. It does work pretty well but it might not keep you engaged for extremely long. The story is just fine but nothing special, though I appreciate the focus on gameplay instead. 
One of the main issues I had was a resource (energy) not collecting because of a bug- the only way to fix it seemingly was to destroy then rebuild all the buildings, but this didn't work for me. From steam discussions it seems like this was a pretty common bug, and it's not quite game-ruining but it did really kill a lot of the motivation for me to play. The devs seem to want to keep working on the game so there is hope for that to be fixed along with the optimisation, which I felt wasn't great. The game ran fine for me but really ate into my GPU despite again having graphics only a little better than SC2's HotS, released in the early 2010s. 
Speaking of which, there are a number of things I think the game could learn from newer RTS, especially regarding the UI- like hovering over something (e.g an upgrade) should display what it does instead of forcing you to click it, and there are nowhere near enough hotkeys for my liking- you have to manually click most buttons, which gets old fast. The menus themselves remind me of indie games from the 2010s like ARK and again this isn't disastrous, but I feel like they should be just a little better, and another reason why I find the price just a bit too much.",1644374477,1644749871,False,0,0,0.493421047925949097,0,True,False,False

Basically, you build a base on an alien world, and defend against hordes of monsters that attack you. Some would call it a tower defense game, but I don't think that's appropriate. You don't have enemies marching down corridors you built while being pelted with turrets. You will have massive hordes of enemies gnawing at your walls to get at the chewy stuff in the middle, and if you don't go out there and fight them yourself, there's a good chance that they will break through.

The game has two modes, campaign and survival. I preferred the campaign, because it gives you the full story and lets you somewhat control the pace of the game. It also lets you take missions to other areas of the planet, each of which has its own challenges. Survival, on the other hand, works by mostly the same rules, but throws wave after wave of monster at you, leaving you little time to explore (or even breathe).

Combat is truly exciting. There are a large number of weapons for you to research and build, and they all seem useful, although I definitely have my favorites. Early on you might can take on small groups of enemies (10-30) with your sword and machine gun without too much problem, but the end of the game you will be facing hundreds or thousands of enemies, mowing them down with lasers, rockets, and flamethrowers.

The base management part is ok, but I found that lack of resources is a major pain. Every resource patch in the game is limited and will eventually run out. In the campaign mode, you can use your alternate bases as resource generators, but I eventually switched to farming plants to get all the resources I needed, because that is the only way to get renewable resources. In survival mode, the finite resources is a huge problem, because you have to build mines out away from your base, and it's pretty much impossible to defend them against enemies. 

I definitely recommend this game, just on the campaign alone. Others will probably enjoy the survival mode as well.",1644722807,1644722807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want to destroy thousands upon thousands of enemies using your mech's weapons and base's defenses, this game will fulfill that desire. There are some gameplay design issues that could test some people's patience.

It's not an easy game... at first. My comprehension of the game's mechanics really ramped up during the last 10 hours of the campaign (around 24 hours of playtime) with power production and the use of pipelines for all sorts of delicious resources (especially late-game plasma). 

You'll want to spend time on power generation and sustainable base-building as you learn your way around the game and the enemies. Do all of your towers use traditional ammo? You might want to look into Laser and Plasma towers then or risk running short during extended engagements on multiple fronts. Did you remember to build enough Repair facilities to support your defenses which is of high importance on larger maps where you can't be everywhere at once? Are you doing enough research to acquire advanced buildings and weapons? Did you build enough research buildings to make the process faster for acquiring new technology? Did you remember to protect your power grid so that the hostile wildlife don't cause a destructive blackout? There is a lot to consider overall and planning is a key part of success. So are well-defended energy farms.

Finding the right balance is an awesome feeling. Some parts of my base reached the point of not needing any more of my support due to the tower mixture I had. My more vulnerable parts that needed rarer resources that could not be transported over there (plasma for example which needs 3 to 4 buildings minimum plus pipelines to path it over) could then have my mech's support. The end of this game turned into explosions, nuclear explosions, hot plasma, and sweet lasers. My processor was dying.

Some of the questionable parts of this game revolve around the bioscanner and how not fun it is to use. Imagine having to fire a beam that must stay on a target for three or so seconds over and over again. Thankfully, it's only really forced during some missions to other maps. Some of the alien technology is locked behind having enough research though which might require bioscanner use. Killing creatures and destroying the environment can give you the research fragments you need as well which was my preferred way of doing things (bring a hammer or sword with you).

The voice acting is a bit... weird. The protagonist's is fine, but the robot, I'm not so sure about. And there felt like too much of it at times. I would have something playing in the background for a good chunk of my playthrough because it all felt mostly forgettable. There were a few good jokes sprinkled here and there.

The developer actively works on the game so bugs do keep on getting squashed, but some of the energy bugs I had (which required a console command to rebuild all buildings) were near game-breaking. People in the forums had some good tips at the time. The bug I had did something where the entire energy grid was on a different plane of existence and powered 0 buildings. Any new energy connectors weren't building correctly either and didn't connect to the buildings. That was something I experienced a month ago, so it seems okay now. As a side-note, make sure your energy grid has uninterrupted paths.

Riftbreaker is a top-down, isometric perspective tower defense-like game. You play as Ashley, piloting the command/combat/engineering machine suit 'Mr. Riggs'. After your arrival on Galatea 37, you must begin procuring resources, establishing bases, and creating defenses to endure the systematic assaults by the native wildlife. As you fortify and establish a presence, your gaze turns to other regions of the planet, where you must expand further to acquire rarer and exotic resources. All, ultimately, to create a portal for humanity to follow behind you.

Riftbreaker has two main gameplay loops: the heroine unit of Ashley, and the base building expansion. As the heroine unit, you, the player, explore the map(s), confront the wildlife, and do the constructing. Everything you do is based around the heroine unit, and to help do so, an RPG-like upgrade system gives you power and versatility. A variety of weapons, armor types, and modifications suite different playstyles and options in that regard. Flamethrowers, miniguns, rocket launchers, melee swords, axes, spears, and others all offer something. To its credit, the system is simple, refined, and very workable.

Base building is where the meat of your progression happens, and it can be a bit ... problematic. As a whole, the base system is well designed and generally has very logical considerations to why you use what you use. The biggest problem I encountered by far was upgrading building. Many buildings have tiers, usually 1-3, sometimes 1-5. These tiers are important: more resources produced, less upkeep, stronger damage, etc.

However, to upgrade them, you have two options: hold LALT to build a 'highest level possible' building from the start, or click 'upgrade' onto them. When you have hundreds of buildings across many different maps, and the importance they have to your economy, it becomes tedious. When you have hundreds to thousands of walls that each have to be individually upgraded, your wrists will feel like mine. Also, buildings at lower tier only upgrade to the next tier--so you have to keep upgrading them, or sell and rebuild with LALT. It is the sole pain point in an otherwise great system, and something that must be accepted on its terms in lieu of better options.

Broadly speaking, you go across the planet to different biomes, which present different ecologies and building concerns. Unfortunately these differences are somewhat minimal--you need a certain armor to survive the environment, and you use a new floor plating to protect your base. Once you have these, the unique dangers of the biomes are largely mitigated and more laborious and tedious to deal with than concerning. I do enjoy the attempts made here, but it would be an area for iteration and improvement in a sequel.

The minigame of resource searching and bioform research, via the geoscanner and bioscanner respectively, was 'interesting'. While they help feed into the story narrative of being a scientist, the systems felt unsatisfying and usually tedious. As a first go, they're fun and new; but they don't offer much for engagement on repeat playthroughs. However, the ideas are good, and would also be something I'd look forward to in a sequel's improvement.

Touching upon the story narrative and voice acting, I liked what they wanted to do but it was very ... clunky. Awkward, more usually. One frequent issue is that so many voice lines trigger that dialogue can go on for minutes. Sometimes warnings for something that happened 5 minutes ago would play and confuse me more than help. The personalities of Ashley and Mr. Riggs are also fairly stilted; they work, but there is no chemistry nor anything that isn't very archetypal in nature. Much of it is serviceable to explaining and guiding the player, but does little to present a world that can 'draw me in'. I'd consider this an area for serious attention and work. I did enjoy the research logs and their world building, though.

The art direction itself is great, visually beautiful, stylistic, and does work for establishing itself. It can sometimes become overloaded with graphical vomit from explosions, or tons of gunfire, but that never impeded me. The music is good; nothing particularly caught my ear, but it does well for the soundscape and directing gameplay events. It can be somewhat heavy on performance hits when a lot of enemies are present, so weaker computers may struggle during later game fights.

My one large criticism of the game is that its combat model is whacky. When you first start, it's at its most dangerous because you lack tools, resources, or equipment. However, once you start rolling, it is supremely easy to advance across the map, acquire new resources, and setup defenses that enemies cannot overcome. Attack waves themselves can become routine and forgettable, more of an annoyance than a cause for concern. Late game techs are so hilariously powerful that on the highest campaign difficulty, my batteries of 3 nuclear artillery wiped out 95% of incoming attacks before anything else got involved. I didn't even see the enemy boss units enter visual range.

In comparison to They Are Billions, you are given a plethora of defensive choices, and most of it will easily wipe out the enemy. There's little juggling or concerns to be had, as long as you maintain defenses of 2-3 different damage types. Effective choke point design will solve everything else. This is an area I consider a genuine issue, and would pay much attention to in revising in a future game. Mods, or custom difficulty settings, may help to fix or change it, but I've yet to experiment with them.


[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
I quite enjoyed my time with Riftbreaker, and it presented very fun options across the board to engage with. It's ultimately downgraded by its difficulty issues, as anyone familiar with tower defense-like games will steam roll over its challenges. The story and voice acting to me were also issues; again, I liked their ideas, they were just done very awkwardly. Immersion breaking would be my term of choice; I accepted it existed but it didn't pull me in as it could've.

It's worth one or two playthroughs; more if you explore modding or other community-based options. I'm very interested in a future sequel that expands upon, refines, and polishes its foundations. So much of it is very good, well-reasoned, and capable, but just needs more experienced hands and know-how to make it shine brightly.",1644287621,1644287621,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The meta is you have to jump from map to map, as staying on a map will just trigger endless attacks.

Tedium incarnate. 

The part where you go to a fresh map is good and fun.

There's a lot to like about it:
* The core gameplay loop is very solid
* Progression is meaningful (most of the time) - it's not just numbers getting bigger, but you're getting more options and ways to play
* Combat and weapons feel good. While I definitely preferred some weapons over others because they suited my playstyle better, none felt awful or worthless. I'm confident every weapon has someone that loves it, which is unusual (in a good way) for this genre of game.
* The pacing of missions and campaign length was spot on. There was always something to look forward ahead of me - always a reason to come back to the game and see what was next. I didn't get bored of the gameplay because of a grind.

Buuuuuuuut there's a number of problems that really didn't have to exist:
* Tons of typos and little UI annoyances. None are significant enough to really matter on their own, but the aggregate is worth calling out.
* A small number of very big UI problems: research is literally hidden (not just locked) behind activities like killing or scanning enemies, but no clear indication of what enemies reveal what research. Especially problematic when that research blocks story progression. Another example is not having a way to identify what building is draining what resource - and resource drain spirals are very easy to get into.
* There's so very much that isn't explained clearly in the game, but could be with a little more effort. I was able to figure out everything I needed to beat the campaign, but there was a lot more head scratching and guide reading and google searching than there needed to be. Just one clarifying sentence here or there could really have made this game great.

On the whole, the game was a lot of fun and well worth it UNTIL the final mission. This is where that lack of explanation really reared its ugly head. I failed that mission a dozen times - and I do mean a dozen times, no exaggeration. I don't mind failing if there's something I can learn from and improve for the next attempt, but the failures were unidentifiable. Basically, the smallest hiccup and the mission fails - with ZERO indication of what went wrong.

So yes, I do recommend the game, but:
1) Install the ""unlimited Outpost"" mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/theriftbreaker/mods/9) since the game doesn't explain how building Outposts on the wrong place can ruin your game; and
2) Stockpile at least TRIPLE the resources you think you need for the final mission

In Riftbreaker, you gather resources and build an infrastructure chain while defending it from enemy attacks with an array of defensive structures. However, you do that while present directly in the battlefield as a robot sporting a variety of weapons and skills. In addition, there's also a nice exploration aspect (you spend most of your time traversing the landscape in search for new species, resources and so on).

The mix of styles is not only for show, as the disparate design elements interact in logical, predictable ways that strengthen the gameplay. For example, your need for personal ammunition and upgrades will drive your search for specific resources, species information found on exploration will earn you increased efficiency in extracting resources from them and fighting them, and so on.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, there's a demo with a generous slice of the game (a commendable feature, as most developers forgot those exist). Read on for more...

The game's unique concept is handled with care and attention to detail (e.g. varied natural phenomena with cosmetic and systemic effects, resources that don’t just pop-up, but come as a result of events, different biomes with relevant gameplay effects, varied flora and alien species with unique behavior, huge amount of weapons and mods, great variety of defensive towers that can be individually modded, etc.).

The gameplay components (building, defense, combat, etc.) considered individually are very solid (specially the action gameplay which has a great feel and offers a lot of fun-to-use weapons and skills).

Finally, on an audiovisual level the game is very nice, and the engine technology in particular is very impressive (great performance on my oldish PC). The level of quality from a small independent developer is outstanding.

The only fault I found is that even for all its variety, the game can eventually feel repetitive. It would benefit from more missions and an emphasis on unique exploration events to keep things interesting.

In the UX category, the issues mostly have to do with the false sense of urgency the game proposes and the way the game tries to dictate to the player what to do. The game constantly micromanages the player, giving audio alerts that demand immediate specific actions with little pause between them, then punishes the player if they actually do try to move quickly to live up to these demands. This is especially egregious in the campaign, but also true in survival. All the 'warning' alerts include a 'GO DO THIS THING' portion, giving the constant impression that the devs would rather just be playing instead of you. There are precious few moments where the game presents you with 'here's a situation' and lets you decide how to react to it. Action triggers are clearly tied to user action. For example, researching a rare research plant always spawns several waves of small creeps just in time to disrupt the first attempt to research it, completing a mission objective always escalates the threat level, etc. This mandates that the player engage in meta-gaming or get rekt. 

In the technical performance category, there's really one issue but it's a doozy. The game cannot handle its own demands. I have a high power gaming rig and running on medium settings, the game slows to single digit FPS when more than a few hundred things are happening on screen (or even off screen!!!!) which is a fatal flaw in a game like this, where the challenge largely lies with swarming hordes of ravenous alien monsters. God forbid I set something on fire, or use an explosive weapon. I've counted multiple seconds of input delay during late game waves when explosions are happening.

In scenario design, the real issue is that the game prepares a lot of tools to let you develop an economy and defensive grid a la They are Billions, but never creates the correct sense of threat. Either the scenario is pitifully easy because the player figured out the threat triggers by meta gaming (campaign only) or has the difficulty too low, or is excruciatingly hard due to factors the player cannot mitigate. Playing survival mode on Hard (1 higher than normal) throws a half dozen to a dozen bullet immune boss enemies at you during the wave you must clear to be able to research any non-bullet weapons, for example. The only weapon you have available to hurt them is the starting blaster, which does 20/100ish damage with a regular/charged shot, and these enemies have several thousand health! In the campaign, there are missions marked as 'HIGH THREAT' where you can spend 45 minutes walking around the map scouting, building walls, towers, power infrastructure, etc, before placing your outpost without any problems because the game is scripted to only start increasing the threat when you place the outpost. As a final note, there is only 1 game mode besides campaign, which is survival. I would have preferred to see more options.

These design oversights, technical failures, and ui annoyances did not prevent me from enjoying my playthrough of the campaign (definitely worth the money I paid), but they will prevent me from ever playing this game again now that I'm done.


PS: The game talks a lot about 'science' and doing 'research', but science is not about blowing things up and then using the bodies to blow their relatives up faster next time.

fair warning if you're looking for a pretty version of Factorio; this isn't that, the resource aquisition and supply end of this game is a bit more advanced than most RTS games but is no where near a factory sim. You have three basic resources: Carbonium, Ironium, and power. You mine Carbonium and Ironium from deposits or later on in the game you can generate in using high power requirement buildings. Power is a little more complicated and can be generated a number of ways including: Wind, Solar, Carbonium Generators, Geothermal plants, gas plants, lava generators... there's a lot of ways to make power. Anyway point is beyond these three resources there isn't much to worry about, all resources are automatically stored and transfered, most turrets are automatically reloaded without having to hook each and everyone up to a conveyor belt.

- Music is kind of meh, some sounds could be better, they range from good to ok.
- Some resource finding missions are tedious.

Base building is very easy, menues are legible.

There is no real logistical management, sure there are buildings who require input of some sort, but they just magically take it out of the storage. Except liquids

This gets spiced up by missions, who mainy consist of: go to area, collect samples, return. Unlock permanent area, set up outpost, set up defences, return. Repeat.

It gets very boring and repetetive after a while. Put on top, that the building interface is a mess when it comes to finding the things you're wanting to build. At least after you've researched quite a few buildings.

There is nothing really to optimize (the main drive in Factorio for example). You just set up better defences against ever stronger aliens.

Be aware that there are some minor QOL things missing, like being unable to build a level 2 or 3 structure and instead you have to build the level 1 building then upgrade it.  That system gets old quickly when you're upgrading a few hundred wall tiles.  At least you can just hold the button and drag the mouse over the tiles you want to upgrade but it would be nice to have a one click upgrade option, or to be able to drag a box over an area and upgrade everything in the box.  Heck, if it was just an option for walls I'd be happy because I end up rebuilding them more often than anything else due to the random attacks.  A lot of time is spent scanning and searching for things and that gets a bit tiresome, but there's usually enough combat to break it up.

The voice acting is hit and miss but the misses are few.  The graphics are nice and except for the slowdown the movement and animations are smooth and look quite good.  Sounds, weather effects, overall look of each biome - all good.

The enemies have a variety of weaknesses and resistances so you're usually better off mixing up your loadout so you can dish out a variety of damage types.  Small critters seem to die quickly to fire but some of the larger, tougher ones tend to resist fire but end up vulnerable to explosions.  Some others resist explosives and fire doesn't kill them quickly but your shotgun will rip them up.  There's decent variety to the enemies and ways to fight them.  You have access to numerous weapons, different abilities, and upgrades for practically every weapon and ability you have.

Now the combat isn't perfect.  I have noticed that most critters just run at you in very predictable patterns.  Not all of them do this, but the majority will.  Much of the combat boils down to this: Walk backward and attack, and if they get close try to avoid being hit.  Attack meaning drop mines, toss grenades, and/or shoot depending on what the enemy is.  Avoid getting hit is usually your movement ability, but that could be a jump, a dash, or a few other things.  Yeah, if there's one thing the game does give you it's options.

There's a crafting system for not only your base, which is pretty much RTS style building but also your gear.  You can craft the same tier machine gun several times, or the same tier armour, and each one will have slightly different stats, or different bonuses.  Your buildings affect your mech suit, too.  Different buildings provide research bonuses (yea, there's a big research tree.. .well multiple trees), more ammo for your weapons, and other little perks.  There are turrets, repair buildings, quite a few options to produce power, buildings to harvest resources, and many ways you can set up a base.  Again, if there's one thing this game's got covered it's providing you with a plethora of options.

It's a top-down twin stick style shooter with base building, tower defense & resource management and includes a tech tree and weapon crafting with RNG (random stats) + equippable mods for said weapons.

The only things lacking is are multiplayer (I believe devs are looking at making this a feature down the track) and an end-game for longevity, however there are multiple game modes. I think this would be fantastic to play with a buddy, but the campaign is great on its own and this is a worthwhile buy.

Great concept. Needs polishing, refining, optimizing, and debugging. Would be nice if the devs properly tested each part before trying to add more.


DETAILED REVIEW:
Visuals: 9/10. The graphics are pretty good, except for one thing: when your towers are clustered together (which they will be because you want more towers so you can survive the waves), they get very difficult to look at during night time because every building has bright lights and is oddly super reflective.

Audio: 9/10. No complaints for sounds and quality. SFX seem appropriate. Useful sound effects get subdued when the character or the mech suit say something, even when that something is useless...which happens A LOT.

Gameplay:
Pros:
-Base building makes sense overall.
-Economy handling for solid resources and ammunition is functional and uncomplicated (which is good since this is not a factory builder or economy-based game).
-Upgrading and repairing buildings is easy.
-Replacing defensive towers with other towers is easy.
-Controls are reconfigurable, specific build commands can be assigned to hotkeys.
-Free teleporting (to existing teleport platforms) makes getting around to at risk areas very easy.

Cons: (Most of these are small QOL things).
-Tutorial needs work, doesn't explain all the mechanics, including some of the basics.
-Tower targeting priorities are not configurable in game, don't know if they're editable in the map editor. I would like to be able to set the sentinel towers to not shoot the swarms of little beasts. That's what the flame towers are for, once they're up.
-Some buildings need better information, such as the cultivator.
-Power connectors are simplistically designed but cause the base to look cluttered.
-Fluid pipes are poorly designed. You can't run two pipes next to each other because they'll automatically connect to each other at every neighboring segment. This is not how pipes work and makes building the base more difficult because of space issues. Essentially, every pipeline you want to add next to the first requires two lines of tiles instead of one (so you don't go mixing plasma with water, for example). The solution is to create more involvement on the user end (rotating pipe segments, selecting straight, 3-way, or 4-way intersections; curves can be automatic). The increased user control would allow for better, more intelligent, more efficient base arrangements.
-Large bases and large waves slow the game down. If you're using a bunch of cultivators and harvesters, you want to put them at an outpost (on a jungle map for ease of building) instead of at your main base or else your system performance will plummet.
-Despite the tutorial failings, the game is also annoyingly hand-holdy. Every time you go to a map wherein you're required to search for underground deposits or scan a bunch of something, you'll have a message in the bottom middle of your screen telling you which button to press for the geo-scanner. This is probably because every advanced resource has its own such missions and there isn't a required order to find those resources in. Don't know why the devs couldn't just put a flag in saying the player already knows how to scan stuff and doesn't need to see the message anymore. Seems an easy fix.
-HUD functionality is weak. Sun/Wind/Day/Time would work better in an upper corner instead of the bottom.  For me, anyway.
-Environmental effects are announced verbally by the character or the mech suit instead of having a readout on the HUD. Tornado, eclipse, volcanic eruption (which seems weirdly targeted at the player), meteor shower, acid eruption, dust storm, ion storm, earthquake, rain, acid rain, thunderstorm, blue moon, red moon...If the mech suit can recognise and vocally announce all of these, then they can be text alerts in an environmental panel in an upper corner. There's no need for an annoying vocal announcement that mostly mutes the sounds of the game. Nor is there a need to announce when the event is over since it's pretty obvious.
-Solar eclipse creates total darkness. Base and mech suit lights don't turn on during this for some reason. WHY? This doesn't make sense at all. Eclipses aren't energy dampening fields. If they were, nothing would work instead of just the lights.
-I would like to see a constant, comprehensive resource inventory reading instead of only when Build Mode is active. This includes ammunition.
-Survival mode has relatively strong waves very early on while still trying to secure resources. It makes defense difficult and frustrating.

BUGS: I'm adding this section three days after I posted the rest of the review. There are several bugs that make the game more cumbersome. Here are my top three.

1) Resource transference between outposts and the main base. Whether this happens accurately or even at all is hit or miss. In my current game, my main base generates about 70 carbonium. When I'm at my uranium outpost (the only outpost I have so far), the carbonium gain reads at about 2/3 of that. Additionally, when I'm at my main base, the raw uranium doesn't transfer in from its outpost. I have to actually go to the outpost and wait for my uranium to stock up. The orbital scanner screen doesn't register my raw uranium production at all. Score: -1 due to functionality affected by bug.
2) When I move between an outpost and the main base, there's a chance the game's screwed up part of the power or fluid grid. Twice in a row on this game, I've returned to my main base to find my nuclear reactors offline and everything unpowered. I've also found half the base unpowered because the game failed to recognise a power connector or something. Score: -1 due to functionality affected by bug.
3) The environmental protection research for the mech suit sometimes takes effect immediately and sometimes doesn't. Additionally, when I go to a new map that I've never visited before, the environmental protection is not in effect. I have to return to the main base, then go to the new map again for that protection to load properly. Score: Inconvenient but not significant enough to affect score.

Overall: 5/10, cautiously recommend. Maybe wait for it to go on sale.
Note: 2 points off for bugs that affect gameplay.

Kind of like Factorio but with much simpler resource construction chains and a much greater emphasis on variety of weapons and combat.

I very much enjoyed the game from start to finish with its satisfying loop of exploring, building up new bases, researching new weapons and technology and defending against alien attacks. The base construction is very fast and streamlined and it's possible to get a mobile field base or mining outpost up and running very quickly. Meanwhile the combat is also very satisfying with the large variety of different weapons and towers on offer. As for the alien attacks, near the end of the game the AI is throwing gargantuan swarms of enemies that put the Zerg to shame but it never feels too overwhelming due to the very powerful arsenal at your disposal.

Only minor criticisms would be that one of the alien biomes has a creeping spore colony that can really slow down the framerate at least on my mid-range machine, and the repetitive voice messages telling you that your storages are full can get rather annoying. These are minor gripes in an otherwise excellent game though.

But it also is NOT TAB because it is focused on a single character vs. building units.  In that respect it comes closer to Supreme Commander.  But again, no units, just buildings.  

It oddly reminds me slightly of the (very old school) arcade game Gauntlet, with an added dimension of tower defense.

This duality of gameplay does force you to split your attention.  It punishes you for spending too much time/energy on one location or overbuilding/securing one location.  You have to find the balance of ""just enough"" security to slow the hoard that allows you to jump in and save the day.  Eventually, you will have more protected areas, but then these fluctuate as resources are consumed. 

But you also quickly have to begin focusing on your own character's weapons and combinations to properly exploit them.  Trying to specialize or over-use any one weapon will lead you toward running out of ammunition and forcing you to change.  The rotation of various hoards though also generally incentivizes this so it mostly flows as expected.
 
I will say that the pacing seems a little off at the beginning.  Maybe it is me just learning the game, but the extensive tech tree, ever-changing focus, and constant special-events forces you to be pivoting to a slightly new approach.  However, the new approaches are also only slightly different.  And while I was entertained, the first mission took a VERY long time to complete as I explored, adapted my play style, and eventually wrapped it up HOURS after I started.

This is good and bad.  There's already a lot of game here that isn't 100% polished into a complete experience.  However, it definitely is still pretty good.  I do worry how deep the monster tree is, but for now, there definitely are a number of different entities w/ unique attacks/defenses/animations to meke me want to keep exploring.",1642349286,1642349286,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Base Building:
It strikes a good balance between complexity and not having to waste your time rebuilding your whole base. It might be a little simplistic if you're looking for another factorio.  This game is more tower defense and action RPG and less engineering, which is fine by me. 

Tower Defense:
I love the fact that waves become stronger each time you upgrade your headquarters.  This gives you a little control over the pace at which you progress.  You can take your time and really max out your defenses before each upgrade.  I hate it when RTS are all about the rush rush zerg zerg.(You can create a custom game and tweak all the difficulties and timings if you prefer to be rushed).  I also love the fact that different towers use different ammo types and you can only store so much ammo of each type,  which forces you to diversify your towers. This was a great way of preventing you from just stacking the best long range towers.  But by end game they do allow you to increase your ammo storage to the point that this become a non factor and many towers can be ignored, even on brutal difficulty.  I'd like to see them tweak that.

Combat:
In most base building games I've played, any combat feels like an afterthought. But Riftbreaker has tons of craftable melee and ranged weapons, lootable weapon upgrade mods, researchable consumables like mines and sentries, and movement abilities like dashes and leaps that create a fast paced and highly mobile combat system.  Even if you took away the base building, the combat system would make for a good action RPG.

Simultaneous Multi-map Progression:
The unique(to me) mechanic in The Riftbreaker is that you travel back and forth between different areas of the planet(different maps with different biomes) in order to mine various resources.  This forces you to setup new outposts and defenses in each area.  Mineable resources are then shared between all bases. 

Conclusion:
Great game.  My only complaint is that I wanted to keep playing but there wasn't anything left to do.  I really wish they would allow for infinite headquarters upgrades which would result in infinite progressively harder waves.  They'd have to make it so that each headquarters upgrade unlocks further tower upgrade levels which require more and more resources, forcing you to expand to more and more new mining outposts.  This would allow us to keep playing without starting over with a new base.  Kind of like a survival mode built on to the end of the campaign.  But even without that, I got my money's worth.",1642301975,1642301975,True,9,0,0.551541745662689209,1,True,False,False

The only element that really was taken from Factorio, is that some buildings require liquids to work, everything else works by ""teleporting"" resources, so logistic doesn't really matter that much. Maps have fixed size, not that big, and as far I can tell all other bases,outpusts are ""frozen"" (only providing resources) besides the one you are currently playing at.
The research progresses in real time, this is really annoying, as amount of science buildings is limited. Tech tree looks simple - but it is misleading, it just doesn't include prerequisites - you can finish research just to discover it is useless without some other tech. Also research is split in 3 types, with separate buildings, yet there is only one queue and only one tech can be researched at time.
Game lacks in QoL department, I found no way to build upgraded versions by default. Searching base for buildings that can be upgraded is not fun either. There are like 4 random events that keep repeating like every 20 minutes, it gets annoying very fast (go find and destroy nest of monsters, that aren't really a thread to base, AGAIN).
I like actually defending base from huge ass monster waves but it is starts feeling a bit pointless after few hours. You don't really benefit in any way from kills, and waves will keep coming no matter what. There is not enough terrain features to base your walls around them. On the other hand there is no need as monsters prefer to attack your closest defensive structures instead of using the open path into the middle of your base.

Overall I had a great experience, the gameplay was smooth, had good progression, depth, and IMO challenge. Granted a couple improvements could be made: My character seemed to get stuck on literally every tree, rock, or crystal when moving through an area. The dialogue unimpressive. The events were repetitive, and consistently held me back from getting stuff done. I had one glitch where my power grid got messed up.
I really enjoyed the game, got my money's worth. The big question is, what now? After 30 hours I researched everything, built the highest level gear, defended against the biggest swarm, unlocked every acheivement. I honestly want to play more, but I've done it all. It looks like the developer is active and plans to add to the game, but I also hope it doesn't balloon too big because I feel like it has a satisfying length.

Similarities:
1. Tech tree
2. You start with nothing on an alien planet
3. It's a video game

Where in Riftbreaker do I take a resource, turn that resource into another resource, then turn that resource into an item, which I can then combine with another item, to create another item? If you want to compare this game to anything, compare it to They Are Billions.

Simplistically, it's a base building tower defense game with some light factory elements and resource management. You mine resources, build a base, power it, and defend it from waves of creatures while you try to build a huge rift gate back to Earth. There's a 30 hour campaign as well as a survival mode and it should have a decent amount of replayability. The level of polish and content really sets it apart from competitors though; right from the beginning it's well voice acted, animations are really smooth and it's very easy to get into. If you enjoy base building, definitely give it a go.

[b]Pros[/b]
- It runs really smoothly, even when there's thousands of things going on
- Decent dialogue between the main character and her AI
- It's gorgeous to look at
- There are missions off to other parts of the planet instead of all taking place on one map
- There's great attention to detail. For example, in one of the biomes, the plants react to impacts; so if you hit the ground with your hammer all the plants light up around it
- Huge research tree with a lot of different paths you can focus on
- Actually has way more ""factory"" stuff than I expected. I thought it was just power and tower defense, but it does have systems for converting one substance into another. I'd love to see more of that though; it's definitely not Factorio
- You can scan and research creatures
- You can build teleporters
- Weather events and creature attacks to keep things interesting (could be a little more variety here)
- Lots of different options for combat by combining different weapons, equipment and skills
- Wide variety of materials to mine
- Great sound effects, weapons have real kick
- Huge range of weapons
- Some really cool ways of generating power and resources. The cultivator station allows you to grow different plants. Depending on the plants grown, you can harvest biomass and burn it for power, plus harvest rare resources. There's also wind, solar, solid fuel, geothermal, magma, nuclear and fusion

[b]Cons / Wishlist[/b]
- When an outpost is destroyed, I'd like to be able to see what WAS there to set it up again (like how Factorio leaves ""destroyed"" sprites of buildings). Otherwise I have to guess what I need to rebuild
- Even though my storage is full, I'd like to see how many mines I own so I know whether to build more (even when storage is full). Currently, if storage is full, it says +0/s
- I'd like to be able to switch sets of gear. There's loads of different things you can wear for different situations, and switching between them is kind of a drag
- By the time you get to end game and you have a large base, it's impossible to tell where anything is from the minimap. It simply uses light blue to denote 'a building', so if I want to find my carbonium synthesizers, I can't
- The gear you can wear adds all kinds of extra stats, but there's no overview screen of all your statistics in one place
- I'd love a way to upgrade either ""all buildings of this type"", or a larger ""paintbrush"" for upgrading. Running along walls or rows of buildings upgrading them 1 at a time is annoying

[b]Bugs[/b]
- When you're upgrading a building, the preview for the new statistics shows the combined stats of the current level AND the next level, not just what the next level would look like. So when the upgrade completes, the stats drop again to level 2
- There's a string of code showing on the tooltip for buildings with fire resistance
- Sometimes clicking on a button on the UI doesn't work first time and you have to hover over different things to get it to register

And the buildings visual language is very reminiscent of StarCraft, but the way you build things reminds me a lot of the Protoss. The local wildlife is aggressive and the majority of the species remind me of the zerg.  Since the local wildlife is aggressive, you need to build defensive towers to protect your buildings. There is a lot of buildings, and there is a large and varied skill tree both for your buildings and for the suit itself that gives you a lot of options in terms of how to approach this goal.

Campaign could be a lot better since it has no difficulty even on Brutal when you get familiar with it, but its a decent slow burner intro to the game mechanics. It's also a perfect demonstration on how bloated the tech tree is - it has two seperate trees and only one of them is useful, while the other is situational and has its own tech buildings. Not a terrible thing overall, but its really reinforcing the idea that I think most developer's implementations of tech trees kinda suck balls. Whats definitely terrible is the UI however - building things suck because the building menu isnt hotkey based* (*It is, but its incredibly limited in that you can only add hotkeys to select a ""singular"" building in a game with 30+ buildings, rather than hotkeys serving a global menu,) and there isn't any way to navigate the menus sans mouse clicking, which is incredibly unintuitive. If the devs havent figured out a solution already and they read this, I'd recommend they check out Grey Goo's building system which is essentially RTS building, but in a always-on Q-W-E-R etc layout (unlike most RTS where they rely on a worker unit/building to access the menu.) You could implement a system like this by reserving the Z-B keys for the category opening and than to select buildings. Should work like a charm I feel!

Overall Riftbreaker needs some refining here and there but I give this a safe rec for anyone looking for a solid TD BB experience. Its gonna get Co-Op soon as well and I can easily imagine that being a great time in harder difficulties.

I actually had to uninstall the game temporarily because it's too distracting while I work from home. There's always ""one more"" something to do. The splash screen tips were super helpful. I learned so much waiting for worlds to load.

I'm probably going to reinstall it later tbh.

What it could do better:
1. UI/function -- 
    A. Hotkeys-- I am tired of clicking to build each thing--- why doesn't mousewheel work when I have to scroll to page 2 to build items? Why can't I use the same hotkeys for each build stack? If I'm building defense, hotkey 1 through 10 should build defense buildings, not trigger my grenade. if I'm building energy, 1 through 10 should build my energy stack (customizable). These things should be silo'd for ease of use/play. I spend half my time clicking to find things. My fingers are tired. I'm not playing Starcraft 200 apm lol
    B. UI/function - Crafting ease of use - I have to click and hold for everything. There needs to be better interface here.
    C. function - building placement- If I'm holding the mouse down, from point A to B with a building, it should preplace as many as it can fit-- spaced exactly apart, not give me this erratic placement where I have to go back and clean it up.
    D. Minimap/Map info - The minimap doesn't tell me anything besides monster locations- I can't place markers and there aren't easily readable locations for certain things. Just blips. Only one skull indicator for giant mobs, but nothing else. Feels incomplete. It doesn't tell me what buildings I have where-- in my first playthrough I had to comb through my bases to find my observatory. It would help to have an overview on the minimap of your buildings/placements/maybe even the mods you socketed/where.
     E. Mods - Better itemization management/mod management-- My turrets have mods, but I can't see which ones, and I can't easily manage them. I can't remove mods from a weapon until I equip it. Etc. Organizing the items/etc takes so long. Why do some items have the exact same stats? Give me a reason to mix it up. Right now it seems like speed > everything since it keeps you alive/puts distance between you and the enemy for long. I like mod drop too, but mod management needs some love.

2. Lag - Dead body remover (you can thankfully NexusMods this out) the lag from giant dead swarms is unbearable, but also so good. Make shadows lower detail to save some FPS.

The Riftbreaker is a game in a similar vein to Factorio and Dyson Sphere Program, where you run around in a robo-suit setting up mining facilities and wage bloody war against the trees and locals.
You can read other review or watch playthroughs to get a better idea of the gameplay. I will focus on my opinion here.

It's pretty short for an automation game: You can reach the endgame in 20-30 hours. The game is pretty rich for that duration. But after that, there isn't that much to do, except secure your outposts, expand to the entire map (which is finite), and slowly research everything and scan all specimens. By the way, some research requires knowledge of a species of an organism, but knowledge of a subspecies of that organism doesn't count.
There is another game mode which called survival, which is just a much faster version of the campaign without the story, and can be pretty brutal. Doesn't give any reward upon completion tho, nor any feasibility to maintain a postgame, just bragging rights.
The game is recently out of Early Access, but still lacks a bit of polish imo. There are a couple bugs around, not that much, but I currently have the turrets at my outpost wasting their ammo on some blank spot outside my base where enemies used to be. The enemies also gradually get more annoying, in that certain enemies (the artillery and the stone golems) are highly resilient to common base defences and will literally tear your base a new hole if you're not there to distract them. (On annoying enemies, god that acidic fungal growth is brutal on survival mode, and just disgusting in general too.) The natural disasters are really annoying too, because they occur every couple minutes, you cannot do anything about them, there is no mass repair (aside from repair turrets), and your energy relays and pipes are delicate like a baby's bottom, with no way to shield them from the harsh elements. (Suggestion: have some research that shields your buildings from earthquakes please.)

For my personal taste, I would also like stronger weapons (or at least, ammo for the minigun that doesn't run out as quickly), and resources that don't run out as quickly (not sure if there's a difficulty setting for that). The enemies in this game force you to turtle hard, and every outpost your make has to be heavily defended yet have its own independent energy supply (that is, if you don't want to pipe your main base's energy to it via very vulnerable power lines). As such, I don't build much outposts at all.
At least on the other hand, this game makes logistics (apart from energy and liquids) super easy for you, with instant global transport of resources and ammo.

So yeah, some annoyances, but it is a nicely crafted game in the end and props to the devs for that.",1641132629,1641132720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The mech-smash part is kinda fun, but base building is not deep nor strategic enough to hold my interest after a dozen hour in.

It truly excels in the amount of things trying to stop you from obtaining your goal, every mission is straight forward with a curve ball in a sense of readiness, you have to be prepared to take on an objective prepped and with the right tech.

I am currently stuck halfway through the campaign with no Titanium xD.

All in all the graphics is at James Cameron Avatar level, the gameplay is silky smooth, gunplay = ""destroy all zerg"" ;) , base building is not tedious and fun in matter of always having to expand.Resource management can be felt but is not a job, you can freely do your thing without having to worry too much about mining and collecting stuff.

There is at least one development choice that is game-breaking. If you do not follow the campaign and survival missions exactly and in order, your game will not proceed. I deferred building my Rift Station until I had more area to work with and it broke my progress even though I had all the other structures placed. IMHO, that was probably a mistake to require that, and logic would suggest that it is something that should be placed later when your position is better secured and you are prepared to move forward. Or it should tell you that you can't move forward because [enter story fluff here]. 

That said, there is plenty of opportunity to customize your play style as well. Turtle up, pimp out your Mech (RIGGS) and kicka$$ or some combo of the two. Resources make you move (unless you customize the mission to make each deposit infinite) so you have to have solid infrastructure to support that expansion. Pro tip, stay away from the edges of the map. If you think you can wedge yourself into a corner to keep two sides protect from attack, you are kidding yourself. They spawn the attack on the edge of the map in your base. Hoo-boy. Upgrading offensive weapons is a critical step so maximizing research is a definite must do, as you have already likely read. Last point, use rock formations to channel the BEMs into killing ground, and use it to shelter the base. They can't blow up rock (or other natural terrain features like canyons) and you can use it as the lynch pin for the corner of a base (where they mostly hit you.

The basic concept of the game is that you've traveled to a faraway planet through a Rift: a one way trip.  You must then construct a portal to stabilize a second Rift and enable two-way travel back to Earth.

To do this you're given an upgradable, modular mecha-suit named Mr. Riggs and together you collect resources to build a base of operations and gather the resources necessary to construct the Rift Portal. You also start research into a large tech tree offering a variety of weapons, power generation options, upgrades for the mecha-suit, consumables, base amenities, and other sorts of things that you'll need to combat the hostile creatures that aren't happy you've decided to visit their planet. The technology tree offers a frankly mind-boggling array of options to customize your strategy in dealing with these threats, from lasers, shotguns, swarm missiles, power fists, hammers, spears, swords, plasma guns, flamers, floating mines, grenades, deployable turrets... the game lets you completely define your own playstyle. 

This is all done in a modular way: Mr. Riggs has two arms, and you can equip up to three weapons on each arm and swap between them freely. Similar to Skyrim you then left or right click to use the weapon equipped on the corresponding arm or press both at once. If you want two miniguns to unleash a torrent of bullets? All good. Two missile launchers to obliterate every enemy on the screen? Or maybe a more balanced approach with a sword in one arm and assault rifle in the other? The game lets you do it all. The only limitation is that you have a limited supply of ammunition that slowly fills up over time from factories you build. If you rely too much on one type of ammunition you risk running out, so the game rewards you for diversifying your arsenal and using a number of different kinds of weapons.

The quality of life that the game offers is a sigh of relief. All resources are deposited into a central ""bank"" that can be used anywhere. Gone are the days of tedious inventory management, the only inventory screen is where you equip Mr. Riggs with upgrades. It works like Starcraft: if you've got the resources, you can build it. Most buildings also have a few different ""levels"" that are unlocked as you progress through the game, and building the max level you have access to is as simple as holding ALT and building it. You don't have to babysit a lousy tier 1 building and nurse it up to tier 3, just slap down tier 3 and be done.

All in all, a really nice game with a large number of configuration options added after release to customize the difficulty. Want a peaceful world with abundant resources? Game lets you do that.

There is, however, no skill tree. Instead, we get three different tech trees and can upgrade the protagonist's mecha-suit. There's also exploration, light loot & crafting mechanics, procedural maps based on different biomes, and a lot of different enemies.

I have finished The Riftbreaker campaign twice, once on Normal difficulty and a second time on Brutal. The first time I went through the entire normal (not alien) tech tree before venturing out into the other biomes. For some reason you can do that, I don't know why the game lets you progress so far without going there. It would be easy to fix by making the HQ upgrades require the rarer minerals, but for some reason they don't. However this led me to realize that endgame-wise The Riftbreaker is mainly just a resource game. The game will throw swarm after swarm at you and you will be under constant threat in the beginning. That's where most of the game's difficulty is: early-mid game. You can fairly easily achieve ginormous resource production and once you do, the game breaks, because you can just spam so many turrets that the swarms will have absolutely no chance of getting through your defenses. The game gives you lots of fancy tech, such as shield generators, which require more elaborate production chains, pipelines and building placement, but you won't actually be needing any of those, which is a shame. Once you get the hang of how things work, the game can't surprise you anymore. You can basically defend vs any swarm with enough tier 2 turrets (max is tier 3). I'm yet to try the survival mode or the custom difficulty.

The UI feels a bit clunky and is missing a lot of ""quality of life"" -elements. Since you have to build your base in real-time I wish they had at least made a feasible grid hotkey system, which is a must for any RTS.

The storyline is nothing to be proud of, but gives you a reason enough to be shooting stuff in a far away world. The characters (Ashley and her suit) have a few voicelines, and at times they really try to make the odd attempt at dry humour as well. There is however no actual character development, and the characters feel quite shallow. The atmosphere is almost like she knows that everything she says and does will be recorded and audited when she returns to Earth. For example the protagonist says that she is not a fan of destroying the environment, but there are absolutely no actual gameplay choices which involve these kinds of things. Come on, you're making a single player sci-fi game! We're on a different planet for crying out loud, there could have been anything! Sentient aliens! Remnants of a lost civilization! A hidden underground lab which leads you to understand that the entire planet has been a part of wacky biological experiments several millennia ago! An unstable planet core that might explode at any moment! A hivemind, or some other secret reason as to why everything on this planet attacks you! But no. Just build the gate and get meaningless compliments from your run-of-the-mill commander back home. That's it. No spoilers needed. I suppose they sunk the entire art budget into crafting the biomes and their features, but those are indeed wonderfully done. Still, it's an oversight. Even the Diablo games had a storyline and plot twists.

The game did keep me engaged for quite some time, however. It's a very good game. I just wish they had playtested it a bit more and added gameplay balance mechanics where the fancy tech would actually be required. The real achievement of The Genrebreaker is that EXOR Studios made a new kind of a hybrid-genre game, which is actually fun to play. That's a huge risk for a dev studio and deserves applause! Now that they have the concept and game mechanics laid out, and proven that the whole thing works, I will be eagerly waiting for a sequel / DLC which emphasizes game balancing around the different tech features / progression, UI enhancement and depth to the storyline and characters.

The interesting part of the core gameplay is something you experience for about 5% of your play time.
Everything else is:

1. Clearing out maps by walking around while holding two mouse buttons, occasionally stopping to regen ammo. It takes an absolutely insane amount of time and rewards you with nothing but some space to build stuff later, or the opportunity to scan the land inch by inch to complete dowsing story missions, which are atrocious. There is no real hack'n'slash gameplay in this game after the first few minutes due to how enemies and weapons work mechanically, so the demo completely misrepresents the final product.

2. Walling off sections of the map, which loses all novelty after the first time. It's uniquely tedious due to the horrendous UI. Also, either you don't know the trick about holding ALT while building, which makes this procedure several times slower, or you do know about it, and are constantly fighting the bug that holding ALT also causes when your character starts running in one direction indefinitely (sometimes into a pool of lava). Whoever designed the UI for this clearly never played any video games before and has no idea how interfaces are supposed to work.

3. Literally doing nothing while waiting for the research queue. It takes hours after each milestone, and there is nothing meaningful to do while you wait. You could overlap it with side-missions, but it makes very little sense because you are researching stuff FOR those side-missions. It's like ordering a parachute on Amazon and going skydiving without a parachute while you wait for the order to arrive.

4. Staring at the longest loading screens in the history of video games. Also, this game has slow saving. That's right, saving. If you thought it was bad in ""There are Billions"", this game will surprise you. The ""I just want to save and quit"" scenario is apparently too challenging for the programmers who made this game.

5. Fixing the consequences of unavoidable random griefing events that simply annoy you without contributing to gameplay in a meaningful way. Even if you restart the campaign and disable negative events in the settings, some of them will still happen. Just a few examples:

* You are running around and dowsing for 30 minutes, because that's your mission. Suddenly, the game decides to disable the minimap for a few minutes, so you have no idea where anything is. The optimal thing to do is to stand still and wait for it to stop disrupting the gameplay. Which part of this waiting is supposed to be fun? And no, you can't turn this off.

* You are fighting the building UI. Suddenly, the screen starts shaking, which forces you to misplace a few buildings. You sigh and sell them, to rebuild them in the correct places. You can't turn this off either.

* You are doing literally anything, and a random sandstorm drops visibility to 0 for a minute. Again, ""stand up and walk away from the PC"" kind of event. Why is it in the game?

* The ones you CAN turn off are way more annoying, like ""oh, a tornado spawned inside your building block, now you have to go repair all buildings there and rebuild whatever got destroyed"". There is no reason to have stuff like that in your game.

* The positive events can also happen, but they are entirely pointless. For example, for the 100'th time in a row the game tells you that the wind turbines are briefly more powerful. What gameplay consequences does it have? NONE. At any point, your base either has enough power, or you built too much and are about to fix the temporary energy deficiency, while you are running on batteries for a few seconds. Events like that never have any impact on anyting at all, but each time they happen, you get an earful from the voice actors. Another example: hearing for the 10th time about the unique even of ""the Blue Moon"" on this planet, which appears to do literally nothing. The game never shuts up, and it's never meaningful.

Now that the game soft-locked itself (quest to scan a crystal that is non-scannable), the biggest regret I have is that I bought this game to begin with.",1640478393,1640731310,False,4,0,0.526834607124328613,0,True,False,False

Your task is to develop a base on an alien planet. You have one giant robot that can be used to fight aliens with various melee or ranged weapons.
It can also construct buildings to collect resources, to upgrade and research stuff or to defend your base (towers/walls).

Around 30 hours of play time to complete the campaign. The campaign itself is more grindy than difficult as you get attacked regularly but you're not on a clock.
There is also a survival mode, in that one you have to build the colony fast enough or you will be overwhelmed.  

Pros:
[list]
[*] Discover alien techs (such as teleportation) based on flora and fauna you encounter 
[*] Non-linear campaign where you keep and enhance your base throughout the missions
[*] Fun (if you enjoy roaming around with a giant robot smashing or nuking everything on sight)
[*] Getting all achievements is not obnoxious

Cons:
[list]
[*] Relatively high computer requirements
[*] No story

The ""logistics"" are basically non-existant (almost all resources are teleported anywhere you need them - doesn't matter where storage is). You can build ""outposts"" in different maps which can not be attacked unless you visit them (which means, you will set them up once and probably never come back, so they are safe). 
Resources are quickly no problem anymore and its just a waiting game for the overly big and repetive research tree to complete. 

The UI is terrible, I constantly misclick things, the predefined hotkeys are terrible all-over-the-keyboard (at least you can change them!). And accidentally opening the build screen in the middle of a fight (which you will do a LOT) means usually sudden death of you or some of your structures.

For the main campaign, its mostly action-paced variations of ""running around scanning things and finding different resources"". Becomes boring quite fast.

The graphics, animations and weapon effects are respectful of it being 2021. They're above par, which is nice considering its a top down view game. Performance is pretty good as well. Nothing about the graphic quality screams dated.

A) The questing to unlock materials is highly....annoying. Remove those and make it a bit more sandboxy / exploring on your own to get it. If we wanted A to B quests, we'd play MMOs (Gross)
B) that the game ends, lol 
C) and that survival mode needs tweaks, like letting you make outposts on different planets for materials instead of cramming all resources into one map. 
I want to explore ALL biomes in one sandbox run, not one at a time in a ladder climb......
Going through campaign on brutal with ambient attacks mod another time is ""ok"" but we all dread it because of the quests. Let us survival/sandbox in all biomes.

The visuals are nice; there is a perfect balance of buildings depth, also i like small touches like the number on top of the buildings which easily shows the building upgrade levels; the upgrade trees for monsters research, weapons and buildings has a lot of possible paths, depending if you like certain types of weapons or playstyles, for instance i love placing mines and flamethrowers but you can also craft rocket launcher, shotguns, burst rifle, sniper rifle, granade.
Also the customization of the mech is great, you can craft upgrades to the armor to make it more resistant against specific type of damage (fire, acid, etc).
I have completed the campaign just now, and i liked so much the dialogs between the mech and the pilot.
The music also is really nice, i like it very much.

It's my favorite parts of a tower-defense game rolled into my favorite parts of a twin stick shooter like Helldivers, and feels and looks great.  Exploration, defenses, building, expansion, resource collection, power management, character building.  

Not so good:  
Unfortunately it never gets too complex.  Numbers go up, which is satisfying, but it doesn't have the factorio-like management.  For example, to get more power, you just place a hundred wind generators.  Defense is similarly simple, slapping down dozens of towers down in seconds without much thought put to layout.  I would have liked some more logistics or buff towers, something to make you think about how you place your towers.

I'd like to see a little more information about what is eating up resources. I was off in one of my outposts and suddenly my ironium storage just DUMPED. I lost over 20k before I even noticed the issue. I would have loved to pull up a report and see exactly where the issue laid.

Another issue that popped up towards the end of the game was my magma towers and the accompanying pumps just stopped working. They kept saying they were full. I had to sell them off and rebuild them. Similarly, some buildings got stuck in this in between power state where nothing I did would give them power. I experienced this before and if it's a tower no problem, but these were fully upgraded research stations worth tens of thousands of resources. Luckily it happened right at the end of the game so I didn't have anything to research, but dang.

Once you're over the hump, you start seeing zillions of creatures attack your base, and you start detecting quality AND quantity in the vastness of variety of creature, weapon, structure, and defense tactics. 

You will have more weapons than you will be able to put to use in any combat situation, so you'll be able to equip different loadouts, upgrade, and switch as you desire, so you can experience the full range of combat styles. 

Dashes, jumps, teleports and rolls will keep you moving, and alive. Heals, mines, and some other powerful defensive systems will help you survive hordes. 

The graphics are immersive enough that it defeats most RTS-style games, the only exception MAYBE being Grey Goo, with a close second being Command & Conquer 3. Your structures, towers, defenses, power and liquids management are all well thought-out. The missions seem balanced for the most part. Where you run into things that seemed imbalanced, it's really just knowing how to counter their attacks that matters. You will be able to survive most missions after a couple of tries and maybe some clever planning. 

There aren't too many things I can knock about this game honestly. I'm a fan. I would say, I would like to see some artillery upgrades for things like extended range, and maybe even a guided missile weapon with bullet cam... so you can literally steer the projectile to its target. Laser-guided warheads would also be neat. 

The flame thrower is somewhat OP, and could be nerfed by 15-20% so you can rationalize your secondary weapon a bit... when it's running I seldom use my other arm, even in big swarms. 

There are so many ways to play with different loadouts it's hard to get bored of the combat, seriously. If you like top-down and RTS-style games, this is probably the most evolved form of that play style you will find today.

On the Base building side the controls are fast and intuitive. The way most buildings are you can still move around the base even if everything is build side by side touching so theres no risk of getting stuck in your base. The upgrade progression is well explained and the rewards and progression for your character and your base feel satisfying

on the action side, every range and melee weapon does a great job of having a role to fill. nothing felt stronger than anything else, it felt much more about using the right weapon to fight the appropriate enemy, The visceral feedback is highly satisfying, its a blast to fight through the hordes.

- One of the mission objectives spawned outside of the map and I could not get to it even witch cheats and there is no way to reset the map except if you are finding stuff in the game folders. This obviously made it so I cannot finish the game and this is very much the reason I am giving it a no.
- Mobs that die bug out and stay on the map while constantly spinning. It's fine if it's just one or two, but later on when I had 4-5 it just bothers too much, especially since it shouldn't be hard to fix.

Some of the negatives that played into my no as well:
- Late game is very repetitiv
- Scanning is boring
- The constant barrage of volcano stuff on the magma maps is just a big no and frustrating

You're essentially a combat mech that doubles as a worker unit from any old-school RTS game. You can research new building, mech upgrades, and building upgrades.

The focus is more on combat and tower defense mechanics along with resource management like an RTS. It took me about 40 hours to finish the campaign at a leisurely pace.

I really enjoyed the science / bioscanning mechanics and researching the alien lifeforms. There were plenty of ""what the fuck is that thing"" moments which was great. Particularly at the start of the game where you're really under-equipped and under-powered. However as you progress into the late game you're basically a walking tank that fires nukes so nothing short of a massive swarm poses any real danger to you.

Speaking of late game the pace of the game really dies out towards the end when you've obtained the mining outposts and most of the upgrades. There doesn't really become any reason to explore or leave your walled fortress apart from boredom. 

I'd really like to see more content and more biomes (planets?) to explore. Also maybe some more unique missions to go on to unlock hidden rewards or technology. Just something that breaks out of the mold of building a base, mining for resources and walling yourself in. 

Here's a couple of free ideas:

Alien Safari - Go to different biomes to hunt / track special creatures. (Limited / no build)
Rift Broken - You encounter another Riftbreaker who failed to open the rift back to earth and has gone mad due to isolation. (1v1 deathmatch).
Catastrophic weather - You're stuck in a biome with limited resources while a catastrophic weather event approaches, build up resources to escape before being destroyed.

I would definitely buy any DLC for this game that adds more maps / buildings / content that isn't goddamn hats or something stupid.",1639307536,1639307845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Full Review:

A very competently put together base defence focused top down shooter. Think factorio-lite with a greater emphasis on defence and combat over building complex automated systems. Ideal for those who enjoy balancing a resource economy alongside their shooty action but don’t want the headache of untangling conveyor spaghetti.

Also it has a demo if you want to try it out. That's what got me to pick it up.

Pros:
+Looks lovely.
+Cool creature design and flora really hammers in the feeling of being a xeno-zoologist
+Streamlined but still important economy management, akin to balancing the meters in Total Annihilation.
+Enjoyable lengthy campaign with varied and interesting scenarios to spice up the gameplay a bit.
+Survival Mode (On normal) provides a suitable but fairly surmountable challenge.
+Weapon Mods add variety to personal weapons.
+Unlockable decorations and the like carry over between playthroughs given you something to grind for if you so wish, but you can get plenty in the course of 1 campaign.
+Decent Banter between the protagonist and her robot.
+Expeditions to new maps allows for variety in base design within the same campaign.


Cons(Mostly Nitpicks):
-STOP TELLING ME MY STORAGE IS FULL, I KNOW YOU TOLD ME IT WAS FULL 30 SECONDS AGO! (Characters constantly tell you to build more storage buildings if you storage is full, regardless of how big your storage is or how long it has been full, they say this for all 6 major resources)
-Campaign difficulty curve is a bit all over the place(on normal). Most of the difficulty spikes coming from specific combinations of enemies. The final defence of the campaign was a laughable cakewalk compared to the first time a magma wave chased me home to the tropics. Also 1 of the possible attack waves in the magma zone is laughably easy while the other is the hardest combat in the entire game. (Looking at you explosive proof Krogoon Ultras paired with a thousand long ranged units.) 
-Weapon Mods for towers are unwieldy, as every tower must be modded individually, and you will have dozens at major strongpoints, which was so awkward to do, and good mods so prized until the late game, I never modded my towers. (Would be better if you could make tower loadouts or variants of towers with specific mod combinations)
-Inventory and Crafting screens are rife with bugs and problems. Most suit upgrades have more than 3 bonuses but  you’ll only see the first 3 bonuses on the crafting, research and inventory screens, you can only see the other bonuses in the expanded panel if you select them on the equip menu, you don’t even see more than the 1st 3 on the tooltips of the equip menu.
-Damage Elements feel majorly unbalanced. Energy is half your towers but energy resistant enemies are abundant while only a single rare type is vulnerable to it. Whereas nothing seems resistant to cold and acid feels outright necessary (again looking at you krogoon ultras) but there are exactly 0 towers that deal it without sacrificing the incredibly rare acid damage mods.
- Story beats really trail off by the latter half of the campaign, and we never learn anything about why the creatures are so aggressive (I guess the radio waves our base give out are just annoying enough for wild animals to ignore all self-preservation and throw themselves at my defences like it’s stalingrad)




Middles:
+/- Solid but not exceptional top-down shooting.
+/- Survival time limits are tight enough to put the pressure on but make long term investment in resources/tech full worthless as you’ll be done before it pays off.
+/- passable music
+/- Lacks really elaborate automation systems that require a lot of effort to set up. This may be a pro or con depending on your tastes.
+/- A lot of events(meteor shower, earthquake, hailstorm) feel like you have no way to protect against them. But this may be by design.",1639093433,1639093489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked the fact that it felt like a successor to Factorio, with base building, technology, and even the mobs look the same. However its shallowness soon starts to set in as you progress thru the game, and its cons become absolutely obnoxious. This game isn't relaxing at all, most things about this game are tedious and annoying as hell. If you were thinking this game is another worthy candidate into the base building/automation genre (like Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere, etc.) think again. Its just a top down survival game.

The bio scanner becomes an absolute grind! Having to scan a single species of plant over 150 times, then multiply that by like 50 plants and animals SO FAR (about 38 hours into the game) is an absolute nightmare! The scan requirement for each species needs to be reduced by a factor of 5. It takes like 5 seconds to complete a scan, and if the animal moves; then the timer resets. 

This game keeps spawning mobs outside the map, that suddenly swarm you like a tidal wave. And its not even one species either. The horde tidal wave of beasts is like every single species in that biome that all seem to meet up at a convention center, plan an all out blitzkrieg; an completely overwhelm your base. The size of the beast horde is absolutely ridiculous. You spend an excrutiating amount of time just repairing and rebuilding your base. Then the more defenses and towers you build, the bigger the horde gets. The game just feels like an endless survival mode.

That tedious aspect of the survival mode gets further compounded by all the natural disasters. Earthquakes, toxic gas clouds, electrical storms, wind storms, volcano eruptions, meteor strikes. Every 3 minutes the damn buzzer is going off about a natural disaster, or a beast horde approaching. I am not joking, its literally every 2 to 3 minutes. You spend your entire night trying to mitigate an endless stream of all of these disaster or beast swarms. Its gets very tiresome, bothersome, and frustrating.

Some drawbacks are unfortunately baked-in.
- The gameplay loop is surprisingly repetitive for a factory-lite: you'll be doing the same things in the last hour of the campaign than in the first. The only wrenches are piping and researching yeast.
- Similarly, there's little to look forward to gameplay-wise: HP regen, artillery towers, and weapon mods. The rest is incremental or sidegrading. (Luckily the base gameplay is great.)
- Narratively, there's no surprise either. You have your main installation, and warp to other biomes to search for extra resources. No mystery or progression: what-you-see-is-what-you-get.
- Actually there's a tease of a greater mystery, limited to two lines of dialogue and never referenced again. The game is worse for this unfired Chekov's Gun.
- Too many weapons and tower types, that step on each other's toes.
- Too much technology in general. The game would have benefited from being leaner, offering more meaningful choices.
- The weather and other random events are more annoying than anything, with some just costing you a lot of extra, boring, noninteractive work.

However, there are areas in which the game CAN improve:
- Controls are mostly fine but lack some obvious quality-of-life, e.g... You can set hotkeys for most buildings... but not floors. Some building categories have two pages, but there's no hotkey to change page!
- Some repetitive actions, like placing mines, require too much clicking. Why can't I just hold down the button(s)?
- Camera is way too zoomed-in, but at least there's a command-line option to enable zoom.
- Abysmal balance: for example, the teleport has huge range and 1s cooldown, invalidating all other movement abilities. Some passive upgrades are dominated by others, with no tradeoff. The attack drone tower does much less damage than the base tower. The game just needs a huge balance pass.

All that said, it's a good game, I liked it, I recommend it. But it's heavily flawed.

Edit: the one-month patch adds some auto-fire, buffs the Attack Drone Tower, and stablizes the debug camera zoom (that I always had on). Going in the right direction there!

Edit: another month, more addressed issues, namely weather, controls and some balance. This game might pull off a Dead Cells, going from good-with-massive-flaws to outright-excellent.",1634916976,1638939274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kinda like a AAA version of ""They Are Billions"" mechanically speaking.
The Game Loop is way more involving as all features are very nicely integrated together.

Description: 
Single hero Battle Uni, lots of weapons and abilities to unlock and mod, base building, economy management, tower defence, events, wave defence, investigations. 
Many enemy types to learn best combat approach and which you can safely leave for a while.
Tech research, story, wave & difficulty growth, are all interconnected very nicely. Nice selection of weapons to explore which are preferred or most useful in situations.

The voice acting & story are top tier for this type of game.
About 40 Hours I got out of my 1st campaign playthrough on Hard.
Just started Survival on Brutal, got my butt kicked pretty thoroughly by 1/3 way through, which is great, I have a decent challenging goal I can aim to be capable of in the future now.

Loved this game from the moment I played the demo, the final product is great.

4 bioms and 8 extra side bases on top of the extra map visits is great!

First - What It Is:
Imagine Factorio, but more expansive with multiple maps and bases possible in multiple different zones. Now, take away the micromanagement of individual resources, i.e., no belt or arm management. You don't have to physically make sure your raw resources/low-level products GET to your processing buildings by a path you lay out, anymore. Instead, imagine much more expanded, much more varied, and probably much more FREQUENT combat. It's a great deal of fun.

Second- My Actual Review:
I am PHYSICALLY having trouble both with keeping track of time when I play this AND putting it down when I'm supposed to do other things (eat, sleep, work). *ABSOLUTELY* get this; it's wonderful.



----UPDATE; HAVE COMPLETED GAME----
Okay, yeah, absolutely, I stand by my rec. Fucking sublime, although not from beginning to end, but very close. In it's current state, I'd give it a 9, even with the flaws. That said, if devs peruse reviews at all:

If resource meteors fall into damaging terrain (like quicksand), the game won't allow you to put the quicksand flooring under it, because it doesn't see it as quicksand, but putting a drill on it causes constant damage to the drill. I think that's an oversight.

Having stuff like the cloaking device and the railgun hidden behind scanning the right tree the right number of times was kinda garbage; I stumbled into it through pure luck. It would have been nice to have that better signposted, especially because that's how you get Hazenite. I never even ended up getting Rhodonite or Tanzanite mines going. I think there are some pacing/signposting issues.

Please please please please PLEASE fix the pipes. We need some way to put pipes underground or at least be able to build over each other so two different pipelines can intersect without contaminating. Especially with the number of buildings that require liquid fuels, and the fact that the teleporter platform is something you place early in the game and you have no IDEA how much planning has to go around it, nor could you. Even if that is only on the first play, it kinda sucks.

But literally, these are the biggest complaints I could force myself to come up with. If I spent 40 hours with it out the box, 2 months after release, I'd say maybe 3 of those hours, MAXIMUM was I annoyed or otherwise not having the time of my life.

Fuckin' phenomenal game, and hey, it sure as Hell came out more complete than Factorio first did.

Very nice graphics
Base building
Exploration, crafting, research

-
Time consuming - similar to every base building game
Only around 10% of players get to the end
The tower-defense element is bit behind - wave spawn spots are always random, cannot be set to fixed (like corners). So even if you control 100% of map, you are almost always dragged into new map-edge location which is not covered by towers to fight the wave. It becomes annoying over the long campaign time. Why there cannot be wave-paths from corners where you can set your remote towers on high-ground and ignore it for the rest of the game on easy.

Summary:
Initial game feeling is perfect. Great for speed runs and stream challenges.
For a relaxed game play not really.
Waves become very repetitive from mid-game on. The random spawn spots make it annoying. The play style vary a lot based on difficulty and mode, which is good. But for a casual game experience I would not recommend it. You can hardly eliminate the fight-mechanism of the game with your towers.",1638664830,1638664877,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[b] The game is super fun and addicting. [/b]

The combat is basic, just slash/shoot and run around. There's no real skill to it. BUT you can figure out new and fun ways to kill your enemies. 

Want to explode them? Lure them all around you and charge your Nuke. BOOM. Done. 

Want to slash them? Go ahead.

Want to burn them? Take your flame thrower and do it.

Don't want to fight them? Lure them to your towers. 

[u] It's fun. [/u]

[b] As for the building. It's simple.  [/b]

Stuff needs energy and more stuff. How do you get it? Build stuff. To get stuff. For stuff. 

Since the maps are huge and you have quite the assorty of resources you need to discover, it can be very fun and quite rewarding to get a nice main base + outposts going. 

[b] The missions.[/b]

The missions in campaign mode are simple but quite rewarding. You don't really get many rewards for finishing the mission itself but the end result is cool. New resource, new weapons, new buildings, new research etc.

[b] Gameplay loop [/b]

The gameplay loop is pretty simple. You spawn in, you collect resources, you build stuff and expand. Then you research and craft stuff for your base/mech. Then rinse and repeat on another biome of the planet for some rare resources. 

It's simple but it's fun. If you expect a super indepth challenge and game mechanics it's not the game for you.

And then it takes the cheesy banter, the multi-rocket launchers, an oldschool UI design, building grids and environmental ideas with it when it brings you back to present you pretty 2020s graphics, They Are Billions-style hordes, lots of tech trees and guess what: You'll love it!

In this game, your main character will stomp around pretty jungles and deserts and build power plants, mining outposts, walls, turrets, more walls and some stranger stuff on sprawling large maps. Base mechanics are light, as in buildings require energy (and some other resources) and some have to be connected with pipes and the like, but there's no ""automation"" aspects compared to factorio its successors. Some aspects of this are not that well explained in game but are easily discovered by experimentation, something the game usually rewards. 

Why build a base? Science! As usual, since games preach that creativity can be automated and put in a building ... ah well, you know. Why science points? To build bigger guns, to get more science points to build a, oh, yes, a portal to leave it all behind and go home. I like this goal. Your character (in the robot) frequently talks with the robot during the game - and while the writing is a little cheesy, I really appreciated the banter during the campaign. It enhanced and shaped the atmosphere and even transported a good message about the absurdity of destroying our planet(s) for our short-term gains.

Between the happy building, you get interrupted by aliens, which come as the usual Zerg-like swarms with some (of the also usual) brute'ish stompers among them. Just to be shot, burned, impaled or dissolved with your very varied weaponry which you research both for personal use on the robot as well as in the shape of defense turrets. Turret work on their own, but your personal weapons are usally stronger. But you can't be everywhere on the map, even with convenient teleporting equipment that renders running anywhere a non-issue.

And here the game introduces some interesting mechanics, for example linking your robot's ammo reserves to actual buildings in your base. With distance to those buildings not being important and most resources just being ""global"" values, this becomes somewhat exploitable though - especially since Riftbreaker soon opens up to allow you to build more than one base on more than one map - but not at the same time! As soon as you ""switch"" to another map, the old one will freeze, just keeping your resources per second for your global numbers. This led me to building silly large storage bases which were not well defended at all - but hey, I did not intend to come back to that map so it happily provided those cheap global numbers for the rest of the campaign. Odd, but probably hard to fix and stil fun. In the end you will have many bases and many maps, each of them a testament to specific problems you had to overcome, like lava planets or ever-growing giant fungi.

Aside from that main issue (and the fact that the campaign difficulty scaling did not work at the time I played and ""Brutal"" was just ""Normal"" in disguise), Riftbreaker is a gem. A mix between oldschool RTS and oldschool Action-RPG creates something new and very much enjoyable. On on top of that, I did not encounter any serious bugs, but found a nice, customizable survival mode to keep you busy after finishing the campain.",1638649415,1638649415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A tad expensive to pull the trigger on such an odd mashup of genres, but there's a demo for it if you want to be absolutely sure on what you buy. Strong basebuilding mechanics with intuitive design QOL improvements lay the foundation for a basic, but very fun combat system comprising of two weapons with instant-swap arms plus a large collection of weapons to mix and match to your heart's content. Basebuilding comprises of building defenses to protect your headquarters, which performs similar functions to your Base in StarCraft, and automating functions like mining to allow you to further leave and expand your base as your base goes from a small outpost, to a megalith that is capable of defending itself, barring exceptions. Riftbreaker's enemies are insect-based, with Diablo-styled variants with various immunities that force the player to work around the ever-more dangerous hordes of bugs that attack you at various times. 

Early game will comprise of single walls with a few gun turrets, holding the tides back so you might be able to intervene, while the later game allows for so much creativity and freedom of design, that everyone's base can look the same. For example, as my tech tree grew larger, I began setting up teleport points to firebases that I had set up in strategic choke points, allowing my artillery emplacements to hammer the bugs down before they even reached my missile turrets and minefields that I had set up.

The beauty of Riftbreaker is in its accessibility, in that it opens up just slow enough for the player to grasp the mechanics, before it begins challenging them. At this point, the only thing that I would change or add in is having more drone towers, to truly get an RTS feel, and adding co-op(which they are already working on, so moot point.) 

In closing, play the demo. The Riftbreaker isn't for everyone, and that's okay. But if you have any sort of fun in the demo, buy the full game and check out the Discord server. Happy hunting.",1638467899,1638467922,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AMAZING. Simply amazing, but I will adress some things will help u guys make it even more awesome. 

MUST DO'S FOR ME:
Upgrade without looking: It is pretty hard remembering where you built each building, I took some time to find my three ammo boxes in another rift jump, maybe add some interface in which you can upgrade your building without having to look at it. And man upgrading walls one by one is a pain. Maybe a list that you can see all your building and being able to upgrade it there.

Coop: DO IT FASTER PLEASE haha.

Being able to see what are you spending your resources on: Make  a list, in this list we will be able to see which resource is being spent and with what it is being spent, making it possible to stop producing ammo if you have stock and need resources.


Cool ideas imo:
Pipes: underground pipes would be great.

Energy: make some kind of wifi energy transmiting, short ranged for balanced reasons.

Those floors we can build on quicksand, acid & etc: make it in a way we can cover the entire base in one click.

Radar: on the acid planet with those growing things if we use the radar towers will not stop firing, make some option in which you can hold fire, or just fire on moving targets.

(will keep on updating)

Played through the campaign on Hard first try and found most of it to be quite easy but still engaging, I would recommend any other person with some strategy game experience to start here as normal would likely be unfulfilling. There are some weird pacing parts of the game where it feels way too easy which was a shame since you skip whole tiers of interesting weapon tech because you don't need to upgrade and by the time you do you have something better. 
I really enjoyed the additional world sets that provided their own challenges. I would have loved one more and I think there is a little more design potential here that could be explored by the developer but I think this was what really dialed the game over the top and prevented it from becoming a stale grind up through the tech tree. 

Otherwise it's fantastic, tried Brutal on survival and got wrecked so going back to Hard to practice. Its a fun mesh, like Diablo and Creeper world had a baby. I like that for higher difficulty you have to be able to balance economy, tower defense, and combat tactics to succeed. Not a lot of other titles I've played can juggle micro/macro this well. 

Despite a few frustrations, overall I would highly recommend if you are interested in tower defense, strategy games, giant robots, slashers, or base management.

Combat is splashy and fun
Diverse biomes keep the exploration going
Base building and resources can be as complex you want it to be.

Pacing of tech, resources, and storyline\missions need to be worked on.

You control a human-driven, AI-powered upgradeable mech that has melee and ranged attacks. With this mech, you build bases to mine resources to feed machines that work to feed a rift gate between this planet and earth. Easy, right? Until the local wildlife decides to hinder your work... now you've got to build defensive barriers and weaponry to protect your assets long enough to complete the job. Your mech's weaponry and defenses will come in quite handy to help in this regard. 

Personally, I freakin' love this game. You aren't just watching things happen, you're the best asset on the ground. Jump in the fray and get make things happen. That's what I love about EXOR games. They take something traditional like base building and tower defense, and make you a key part of the whole strategy. Check out X-Morph for more like that.

The positive 
-----------------

- A genuine mix of two great genres:

a. The building procedures are a lot less complicated than in factorio, but there is still some stuff with a bit of complexity in it. Foremost you have different routes to aquire resources. 
 
b. The more dynamic combat is making up for a lack of building depths. There are not just many different enemies requiring different weapons, you still have the ability to mix all kinds of loadouts. Using a minigun to shred through waves of enemies only to open up the gap for an mini-nuke right into their midst? You want to dual wield spears for economical reasons or launch grenades to spread hordes into smaller fractions that you stun with hammer blows? Or you simply want to melt everything in a straight line with a gaussrifle? The game lets you do that and even rewards you for using different ammotypes. Weapon mods and armor upgrades  provide different defensive playstyles (armor, fast moving, shields, maintenance) and can be crafted for random rolls, adding a small flavour to additional resources accumulated that can be spend on maxing out stuff.

- Detailed documentation (of weapon stats or buildings) is nothing that is natural in modern games, but it is good in this one. 

- Astonishing graphics for a top-down perspective, beautiful world and creatures look ""handcrafted"", 

- Colonization is never something I would deem as ethical, but the game lets you choose different strategies on how to do certain tasks in correspondance to your morals, even in the end. 

- If you like the gameplay loop, you will have a great replayability. Higher difficulties require more efficient and sophisticated base building, survival mode even requires buildorders and when coop is released you will have tons of fun with a friend or two. 


The negative
------------------

- Athmosphere is a bit blant. Don't expect many cutscenes and stuff like in triple AAA games, that use it often as a substitude for their shallow gameplay. Also the music, while including some cool parts giving me ""Tool-vibes"", is overall generic and annoying, so you probably have to turn it off after hearing it for hours. 

- The inventory menu is the typical console trash making things taking too long and tedious. Crafted 50 weapons to maximize stats? Good luck disassembling them. Want to switch from one menu to another with the specific hotkeys? Nope, you need to use your mouse or ""escape"" and then use the specific hotkey.

- Building overlay is consolestyle, needing too many clicks to do shit, it also inhibits an absolute tedious fucking mechanic or bug that prevents you from selecting stuff on the second row of the overlay for several seconds when switching between building menus, which you need a lot and wastes lifetime and gameflow. 

- Some hardcoded hotkeys cannot be switched e.g.LALT for building maxlevel buildings and some overlays like ""floors"" don't even have the option to be set on hotkeys.

""Brutal"" Difficulty was easy. The game was a cakewalk in general. Despite this, I still had an okay enough time playing it & am now doing a hardcore brutal playthrough. I liked the whole terran vs zerg, base building/tower defense feel. Story was okayish? The game was too short to have a lot of character buildup but I liked the little bit of conversation there was between the 2 main characters. Don't mean to sound harsh, especially for an indie game, I did enjoy this game & would recommend to anyone who thinks it looks fun.

* The game would benefit with a harder difficulty than ""brutal"", one with more mobs per attack, more mob attacks, more mob hp, more mob dmg, and always attacked from more directions than they do now. Repair towers should be a necessity, not a convenience. It's so easy to defend right now using very little. You don't even need towers given enough walls, gauntlets, lifesteal mods, and good mobility item like invis or an AoE dash/leap.
* Outposts should also have similarly dangerous attacks as the HQ.
* Zones should be attacked randomly, even ones you are not at (can be simulated, or you can warp to defend it). Therefore requiring you to set up a proper defense. 
* Outposts are HUGELY exploitable. Slap down harvesters, leave before you are attacked. Or set up a massive farm and never worry about being attacked. 
* The recon missions are HUGELY exploitable. Especially the desert/acid location (lots of water). Recon missions basically don't get attacked & have lots of water. The volcanic map with lots of geisers can also produce an okay amount of water.
* Natural disasters are kind of annoying, and don't even achieve anything. They do minimal damage and are just a thorn. You cant build during some of them, you just have to repair yourself and rely on any repair towers already setup.
* Farming is OP. With some water, get infinite resources. It's convenient, kind of nice, yet makes the mining aspect pointless. Unsure where to draw the line. I think part of the issue is how you can do this off-world. Yet, it's still really strong & worth it in a well defended area. 
* Maybe bigger, more interesting maps & locations? For example, large hives with sizable HP and defenses, even bosses, rather than random mini events where you 3-5 shot the hive?
* Lifesteal is OP as a mod. As are gauntlets.
* Invisibility is OP, but I guess not the worst & fits well with the current alt/end-game grind of scanning everything.
* You kind of barely get a chance to get into the alien tech tree beyond just a little bit of it without spam-scanning everything which is a boring way to play.
* Portals should require, probably somewhat sizable amounts of power
* Radar should not prevent mob spawning, though mobs should not spawn near your structures
* There might need to be a ""Nydus worm"" concept at some point of the game where, if left alone, mobs can spawn an entryway into your base. Right now you can focus your defense at chokepoints rather than throughout. With radars you can make these attacks even more narrow. It becomes trivial. Mortars throughout the base would probably defend this quite easily though, or even many laser/plasma turrets since they just take power.
* Even with all these changes, nothing will stop players from making infinite resources and having unlimited power, but the ascent should be steeper. You can hit ""end-game"" levels of resources and power in probably half an hour or less with ease.
* Shared supply across maps, besides power, is kind of OP. No infrastructure required to do it beyond having an outpost..but this is mostly problematic due to the fact that outposts dont get attacked, and if they do while you are there, its insubstantial.
* Having different zones with different key objects *requiring* large bases on them, not just one massive building on the main map, would be more enticing. Right now outposts are just like ""sure okay"" slap down some stuff. There's no grand reason to build on them beyond being farms. Having to build defense and build outwards towards your objective would be better from a builder's perspective. Claim critical areas, bountiful resources, technology, etc.
* Exploding plants in the early game can 1 shot players. Possibly fine to keep? Somewhat actually ""brutal?"" These are oddly the most dangerous things, hostile mines being the 2nd most dangerous, in the game to be aware of when fighting. 
* more giant hordes of insects chilling around at key points of the map with intent to clear them out. Base expansion should have some degree of challenge.
* Some way to repeatably call hordes to attack maybe? Base building is kinda fun but sometimes you want the attack. Might be convenient for research farming, or even to fuel animal-parts bio plants. As of now there is not a ton of incentive to kill mobs unless you are targeting them for research. It would be nice late game to bring them to you.
* Towers shouldn't drop research parts unless they are in that ""research"" towers radius as a support structure.
* A way to break down or craft mods? I don't like stuffing random towers with them and you get so many its kind of annoying. I'd rather just permanently mod my towers a certain way. Maybe tone down their effects when used to mod a tower type and increase that tower types power consumption when you place mods in them.
* Pursue the 'alt' ending where you do not go back to earth. That is where the story needs to continue. You explore more parts of the world, find more tech, Earth sends a 2nd rift breaker after you (potential antagonist or helper), etc.
* Co-op would have been fun for this game, but understandably would be quite the substantial change. Given the current balance it would also be even more ridiculous given how strong 1 player is.
* You don't need to partition your base up at all. The entire middle space is fine to leave open. Damage done to the base is nonexistent. Walls are super OP (but, who uses walls when you can spam gates that you can walk through?) Or just structures like supply depots lol. Variety of turrets is nice, but not really required when you can spam mortar/plasma/laser. Using energy as ammo is super powerful and I love how strong the plasma/laser turrets are. Just not a whole lot of point in building other turrets. Enemies fall to them quickly.
* Enemies don't really travel through mud, waters effectively protect a huge portion of your base. The mud-walker mobs should probably come via these sides and require the player to actually defend them.

In summary, make the game harder. More HP, more dmg, more attack-angles, more attacks, attack outposts, or even multiple locations as once. Fix bugs (sometimes a ""base attack"" mob would permanently never ""die"" and my turrets would spam attack it, wasting ammo, even after reloading/zone switching). Add content to make the game longer (not just the ""alt"" route of unlocking everything, but actually extend the game/story/tech/etc). Maybe create better gates for some of the technology where the player would have to take risks? Right now, you can just sit in your base and slowly research while expanding your ""infinite"" resource farming capabilities. It's slow and boring so I wouldn't advise it. Some gating exists but by the time you finish unlocking all the resources/their related tech, the game ends abruptly.",1638171099,1638174833,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Question: Is there a way to control when the enemies attack in sandbox mode? I love the idea of building up a crazy good defense without worry, then seeing how long I can last against the biggest wave in the game? Sort of like turning easy sandbox into ultra hard survival mode. Is that possible?

Ideas for possible improvement:

When in build mode, the first object selected will be stuck the only thing described. In order to check the level of other buildings I would need to exit build mode and enter it again. Can this be fixed?

Some buildings (I believe the lvl 3 pumps) have weird descriptions.

The fluid system seems a bit wonky to me. The storage units don't seem to hold enough resources to be worth it. Especially given how localized the fluid storage system needs to be. Maybe its just me.

On that note Factorio had a type of pipe that could run underground and emerge up to 10 tiles away. It was more resource intensive, but allowed for fluid lines to cross without mixing, and made logistics a little easier. 

Allow users to have blueprints. Essentially a predesigned set up of several buildings that we can lay down all at once as long as we have the resources. This would save a lot of time late game, when we have to lays down large segments of wall with gates in them, or certain tower configurations, or setting up the water-fusion-plasma system.

Allow the player to sell and reposition all buildings. Including headquarters. This would be good for strategic and aesthetic purposes. 

All that being said, I really, really love this game. The visuals alone are stunning. The music is great. The lore behind things feels really well thought out, the SciFi elements feel real.  The star in the gamplay itself. The game play is easy to learn without feeling overly simplistic. The combat is fun throughout, never feeling too easy for too long. While the weather events can seem annoying there are more than enough tools at your disposal to deal with them, and minimize their impact. I will be playing this game again and again. Thank you to everyone who has worked on this.

There are other players that encountered this bug as well. At the time of this review, the game has already been released for over a month, you'd think that gamebreaking bugs that other players have reported and encountered would be fixed by now but no. It didnt.

1. Removing certain buildings will on rare occasions break the building powered feature. What this means is that some buildings will no longer be powered eventhough they are connected to a power generator. One time my gas filtering plant which is just right next to my geothermal lost its power after I removed a depleted carbonium factory. There is no way a building lost its power when it is sitting directly next to a geothermal. 

Now some of you may ask, ""What if the main reason you lost your power is cause your electricity is at 0."" Yea no, because if my electricity is 0, my entire base would be unpowered but no, only certain area of the my base became unpowered despite they are connected. There are only 2 ways to solve this, A) sell and rebuild your building on the same exact spot, this however wont work on some other buildings, B) Reload one of your previous saves.

2. Here's the  next game breaking bug. This bug is related to the campaign objective where you need to build a research station near a yeast colony root. That root is easily destroyed by literally anything and if that root is destroyed when your research station is built, your game will softlock. Also, your turrets will attack those yeast so you cant really build turrets.

Until these gamebreaking bugs are fixed, I suggest you to not buy it.",1638090787,1638090787,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Would I recommend this game? Yes, if you are okay with being confused for the first 5 hours or so. Otherwise wait for some updates.

After experimenting more with the game I believe the Campaign mode is still somewhat in development, at least there needs some work done on it and the devs mentioned they will continue to push out updates.

The diverse gameplay would appeal to a very wide range of casual audiences whom play a mix of these genres. Fire this up and you'll get a dose of each in every session.

Whilst there is not much in the way of a story, that isn't necessary in this case. The excellent graphics (it even has ray traced shadows) accompanied by a superb memorable soundtrack makes playing this both a visual and audio treat. The hardware requirements aren't very demanding and the inclusion of AMD's FSR tech makes this even easier on your system.

Take it slow and enjoy the journey - this game does not rush you to its endgame. And once you do complete the single story campaign, replayability is provided in the form of survival mode.

Some tips:
- There is a console command to enable camera zoom - zoom out for increase situational awareness but this also increases cpu / gpu load. Press the tilde (`) key, type camera_enable_zoom 1 then press enter key. Then use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- When building your main headquarters, remember the most important resource is water sources in the form of mud (brown) or slime (green) pools. Always ensure your main base walls enclose a healthy amount of these. All other resources can be either farmed or ""synthesized"" elsewhere and then ""teleported"" to your main base without a physical connection.

The graphics are insanely well done, especially the lighting. The alien fauna is gorgeous and the neon colors really pop. Flames, fire and explosions are epic. The combat really does feel meaty and impactful. The best part is the game runs really smooth!

The story dialogue is decently well done and well thought out. Not too cringe-worthy, and dare I say, funny at times. 

Pro/Cons list for those that need those:

[b] Pros:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Butter smooth gameplay* (love a game that takes advantage of AMDs hardware)
 [*]Graphics and lighting = superb
 [*]Damage state color is a subtle but much appreciated component
 [*]small details like enemy knocking down trees is a small but meaningful to immersive experience
 [*]base building = many choices 
 [*]multiple different biomes
 [*]boss mechanics 
 [*]swarms become MASSIVE
 [*]exploration and research
[/list]

[b] Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]*save game stutter
[*]The research and inventory UI is a bit bland. Could be higher resolution and more detailed orientated. 
[*]Some mechanics/buildings in game need a better explanation (like the alien research facility)
[/list]

[b]Really excited for when the devs add coop. They say it is about 6-12 months out. Until then, enjoy this game because it is fracking awesome.[/b]

I've put in 156 hours into the survival mode alone! 
The game looks gorgeous, runs well (i5 8600K/1070Ti) and plays great.

I feel like I'm quite picky when it comes to games but this is a gem. 
The game is very well balanced as is but if it's not to your liking you can tweak the difficulty with your own custom rule set for both the campaign and survival game modes. 
There's a number of mods available too if that's your thing.
Plenty of content to justify the price and the survival mode will keep you coming back to experiment with different builds.

There's even more content on the way too which I am very excited for!

The Riftbreaker is an excellent mix of top down shooter / hack and slash with RTS-lite base building and resource management. 

The campaign has you building bases in multiple biomes that you can teleport between as you work your way though a tech tree and various biome-exclusive resources. This game design allows you to build, maintain, and upgrade multiple bases that share tech and resources but need their own power and defenses.

I feel that at 30 hours in I can safely say I've touched most or all of what the game has to offer, but could (and will) spend endless hours further exploring the depth of the mechanics, especially on a harder difficulty.

The early game felt like a good challenge, with the world outside the first flimsy walls seeming interesting and dangerous. 

Mid game has you jumping through 3 of the same shaped game play loops to get new necessary resources. Could have been some variety in those missions. These tasks and the enemies in different biomes felt copy pasted. 

Late game was awesome for a bit, running around with an extreme minigun and swarm missiles. It was satisfying to absolutely crush everything that you came across, for a time. That feeling wore off. 

The end came quite quickly, as being a factory game player I had a huge amount of everything needed to finish the game stored up. The big final attack was laughable compared to some of the routine attacks that are sent at the main base. I did like how enemies from each  biome that had an outpost attacked the main  base, It did require some close attention.

You still need to build your base in a sensible way (at least on higher difficulties) but it's comfortably automated most of the time so you can really focus on defense and exploration. 

The many research options allow you to try different strategies, though for sure there are some mandatory techs you will ALWAYS want to grab early. 

The smooth control of your Mech means you can really get to grips with enemies and beat them into a pulp, turn them into bullet sieves or burn them to a crisp. (yum yum!)

There are some comforts missing, for example you cannot bind hotkeys using CTRL or ALT, only single buttons. A highlight of defense towers would be great to quickly see which ones you no longer need when you expand. But that's all complaining on a very high level.

[h1][b]Graphically[/b][/h1]
This game looks amazing. Especially with ray-tracing. Weather effects look amazing in general but night time and solar eclipse are pure eye candy to me.

[h1][b]Sound design[/b][/h1]
Sounds are generic. They fit and sound appropriate to their function (nothing memorable like Metal Gear Solid sounds). I dislike the Starcraft *heaves* death cry as if these alien beasts are glorified bugs. Music is completely forgettable to me. Nothing stood out but it does sound soothing during downtimes and high beat during encounters or waves.

[h1][b]Technically[/b][/h1]
It runs smooth and is extremely stable. The longest I ran this game was 10 hours (or even longer?) with no hiccups, slowdowns or crashes.

[h1][b]Story and objective[/b][/h1]
It is generic but I like how it is weaved into the world as you travel to different areas and biomes on Galatea 37 to gather resources to achieve said objective. Objective: [spoiler]Open rift back to earth to facilitate travel between the two planets.[/spoiler]

I enjoy that its somewhat a super simple factory game in an action rpg isometric genre with virtually zero down time. There is always something to do

The research tree operates in the background so while you're exploring or building a base its not long before you get new toys drip fed to you like a hamster on crack.

The controls are easy and intuitive and I've found a smooth experience flipping between building defenses and clearing mobs

The shooting is nervous with good feelings thanks to the many wepons with specific mechanics.
The tower defence requires you to use your environment and a variety of tower supported by a good supply of energy to survive.
The base management will make you travel through unique bioms with specific rules, and you can freely teleport from one to another dependnig on your needs.

In general, a well rounded game that already guarantees you hours of fun (I mostly played offline), and it's likely that you will restart after your first playthrough. Multiplayer and moding will definitely demultiply the fun.

If I see a list of things that could be improved:
1. Cleaning the map from monsters can feel redondant, would be nice to have something more than groups of individual types of enemies to genocides
2. Exploration missions can feel redondant, objectives like ""building radar towers"" or ""protecting a research building"" are much welcomed
3. The full resource transfer makes resources unlimited in other bioms, would be funnier to start with limited supplies, and having to upgrade the outpost and survive a large wave before unlocking the full supplies synchronization
4. The ""alt"" key lets you build upgraded structures, but it doesn't let you move to spread your building, and it creates bug with the direction keys
5. In general, would be nice to easily build a rectangle of solar panels, wind turbines, AI cores, ...
6. Growing plants is not well explained and underused, would be fun to have bioms requiring to generate most of your resources through plants (in conjonction to 3.)",1637806628,1637806871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i played a bit of prolouge/demo, so the 6hrs may not be 100% accurate.

Besides the technical challenge to get the huge number of enemies running, it is also a masterwork reagrding the gameplay.

The Towerdefense Elements mix very well with the ARPG focus, with a little bit of refining-base-building for the fluids, giving it alltogether a quite unique gameplay.

the hordes also give a challenge, while being stomped by the Hammer

It can be rushed, or taken at a slower pace. You can build a massive sprawling base, or keep it more modest with a largeish central base and outposts around it, or however you like. Lots of options and the choice is up to personal preference as much as anything.

A variety of weapons you can use, and 6 points to equip them (you can have two active at a time, 3 left hand 3 right hand one of each). Imo, matching the hands is a good idea. I've used miniguns, machine guns, lasers, rocket launchers, swarm rockets, sword, fist, blaster, and flamethrower. All except the fist were great (fist was great for single target big guys...but let's be real, you're going to be strong enough to not need to go toe to toe with them pretty quickly). All the weapons feel different, and the choice of what to use does make a difference, at least until the highest level when you tend to become death incarnate and when you shoot everything just disintigrates.

A recent patch improved the difficulty levels, now easy is easier, hard is harder, and brutal is...brutaler? Anyway, you get the point. The devs are still fine tuning it, and it's coming along quite well. I'm probably going to wait a bit, then give it a third play through on brutal to finish off my time in the game.

TLDR at the bottom
I never would have thought I'd see a game mix a blend of things into such a beautiful symphonic orchestra. You're a ""hero"" that travels to a new world to set it up for a new outpost because earth is basically dying. So you are a riftbreaker who travels through rifts lightyears away almost instantly. You land on a planet that needs to be prepared for the earthlings to travel to. The only problem is that enemies are aware of your presence and will stop at nothing to prevent you from taking it over. Queue the Zerg like enemies.

You'll actually get Zerg rushes on your base. If you don't prepare, help defend and advance quick enough you'll be sorry. You'll be swarmed and destroyed. So you need to be quick, think fast and have fun while doing it all. You also get to set up other outposts to get rare resources and minerals from other parts of the planet too. So you don't just sit on 1 map with nothing to do. There is ALWAYS something to do and that is part of that gives this game so much play value.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

Customization for your robot: Armor, Weapons, Special Abilities and More

Cool weapons with different abilities good for destroying certain alien entities

You can make some awesome building turrets that destroy things with artillery, fire, nukes and more

Music is pretty good and the sound effects are nice too

Fast paced action but difficulty settings that make the game as relaxed as you want it to be

Nearly everything is destructible so you can rampage or be as gentle as you want with the planet

Lots of fun achievements to get that make you think about things

Great story and mostly good writing

[h1]Cons[/h1]

Dialogue and voice acting is a bit sub par and can be annoying

Repetitive voice lines for certain things (run out of storage it constantly spams ""build more storage facilities in voice over and over and over)

Some weapons are near worthless and not worth your time in investing into they should buff them (not saying which ones so you learn the game yourself ;)  )

No mod workshop yet and you have to mod through file editing and manual mod customization so it's not simple if you're not able to do those things or struggle with technical aspects like some people I know

Few bugs and issues at times that might cause lag or stutter (they seem to be patching most of those issues)

[h1]TLDR[/h1]

Great blend of Diablo 2 hero style meets alien Zerg with base building. Lots of options and things you can do. Great weapons and customizable options for your robot pal you pilot. You will always find something to do and have fun. Some of the voice effects might get on your nerves though as they seem to repeat themselves a lot and can be annoying. No workshop mod ability yet you have to mod through changing files in the game folder itself. If you're not great at doing that or manually doing mods then you might be disappointed in that aspect too. Over all a great Sci-Fi / Fantasy space building game with a lot to do.

Now you can do that as well! 😎

Initially I wanted to write so much but let me keep it focused: 
It is immense fun to play: Never was harvesting resources more satisfying.

I took my time to see everything in the campaign and it took me over 100 hours!
Please go and smash everything into pieces so that you can build your base
and defenses and many more things.

Don’t hesitate to support the small but excellent developer from Poland.
The developer EXOR Studios made a game which was already at the beginning fairly
balanced and the gameplay is really intelligently put together from other genres.

One second you feel you are in Diablo 3. The next moment in a city builder and the next moment a strategy game. There is always something to do that makes sense. There is not really unnecessary grinding or waste of your time.

The single player campaign makes story wise sense and puts many AAA developers into shame.

I’m exited to play in the future the announced DLCs that will be out at some point in time.
Until then the studio patches very fast from the very first day of the initial release and addresses fan feedback and bugs.

I haven't played much of Factorio tbh, but have played extensively Mindustry.

I like the campaign game mode in this game more than Mindustry, where there's good voice acting and bases generate resources even if you leave them alone. It adds to the systemic nature of the game, because you have to go and fix problems in other bases and manage their resources, giving some aspect of back tracking.

The research system is a bit of a bottle neck, but its integration into the plot makes it more of an exploratory aspect of the game, which is a plus.

My only problem is that it is far too addictive and time consuming.

This is the first game of this sort that I have played so I cannot really compare it to others of the same ilk and I apologise if I will be fawning over things that more experienced players take for granted.

It is so much fun to progress through research and development and see it change the game. A piece of technology can completely change my attitude in certain situations.

I am playing on normal scanning everything. So I can unlock tech, make gardens, and of course the perfect base (or trying to lol). I hope the game developers leave the base formula alone for normal. People saying its too easy play it on brutal then leave normal players alone to make perfect bases. You can have the darkest dungeon feel and frustration that goes with it just up the difficulty, lol. I have still died, some of the quests are pretty rough and made my own challenges. For example trying to take on 3 waves at once (did it barely). I love the fact it is like factorio (base building/upgrades), League of lengends/heros of the storm/Moba (your mech suit you control), Diablo/Torchlight/RPG (item drops/upgrades/skill choices.) I would reccomend this game if you like controlling a moba character (that can change how it plays based on skills and weapons) while running around managing a base and ""leveling up"" (customizing mech and skills). Plus the game is darn pretty with lots of little touches. I do hope they add more customization for mech skills to spice it up more. As is with all 3 elements combined the game is a blast.  Hopefully more content down the road that keeps this same feeling and pace of normal. I have not beat the game yet though as a disclaimer. Hope everyone that read this has a great day.

It's like if you combined Factorio with They Are Billions. As of the current build, here's some pros and cons that I've found so far.

Pros:
- Very pretty
- Oddly super satisfying researching something, and then doing mass upgrades with the new stuff
- Perhaps a challenge in the first hour just to get set up, but once you get in the groove, everything's a breeze.
- Can lose several hours in the blink of an eye building a massive base.

Cons:
- At large scales of buildings, units, towers ... basically if you do what I did and lockdown the whole map, your the frames take a massive dump. And not due to PC specs, more in the devs programming. But tbh, who needs frames when your towers do all the work for you lol
- Brutal Hardcore, my current difficulty, is not as challenging as I thought it'd be. If you die, you can just reload to the manual or auto-save from 5 minutes ago. Every enemy has a specific pattern that's easy to counter. Idk, so far I'm mildly disappointed in that aspect. Like, yeah I've died a couple times but it's not really punishing at all.
- There's alot of grammar and spelling mistakes, which doesn't bother me, but maybe it would bother others.
- Some things aren't explained or taught to you very well, as I've had to personally figure out what does what, or what some (poorly worded) descriptions actually meant. Not a super big deal to me
- There's virtually no customization for controls. It's all pre-determined and can make it difficult to play for certain people, though I'm not too bothered by it.

Some improvement could be
- Hotkey customizing.
- UI buttons be bound to hotkeys (Example: Disassemble --> Delete Key ... Enter --> Confirm)
- Optimization for frames (Obviously)
- Currently can't move when using the Alt key for max upgraded building. Though, you can, but it gets buggy.
- Larger AOEs for things like repair, upgrade, larger floor selections, etc. Just things that kinda make sense to me.

The game could definitely use improvement, but for what it is, I love it.

Even tho the story is not captivating, the campaign is fun to go though, setuping bases and outposts to get all the resources you need. This is not a game I'd play in sandbox but I may replay it in hard mode as a challenge.

The base building UI is much better than I expected. Building stuff feels like it's the fastest it could be before making pre-made blueprints.

On the contrary, the crafting and inventory UIs are atrocious. I procrastinate building new weapons because I don't want to open that screen. There are random stats on weapon you craft so you can build a batch to keep the one with the best roll but I will NEVER do it because I need to craft the one by one AND scrap them one by one. Fortunately, those screens are not essential to the game's enjoyment.

An other nitpick is the weapon system. (This is not a spoiler but it's a long rant so I just want to remove emphasis from it.) [spoiler]You hold a weapon in each hand and you can use Q and E to cycle between the 3 weapons equipped in either hand. I don't like this because the amount of taps I need to do to get to the weapon I want always changes depending on what I'm holding. It's very petty but it irritates me a lot because you can't use both weapons at the same time, which makes this system 100% useless. They could just use the 1-6 keys to pick a weapon and hold one at a time. Some gadgets and abilities are there but they could be moved, quickly swaping weapons is much more important.[/spoiler]

The Riftbreaker is a good combination of tower defense and managing your economy type of game, much like Mindustry or Satisfactory (the latter in terms of economy managing).
Its less focused on the economy/resource management and more on the defense  then the two previously mentioned games but it has a fair storyline with its own storyline hiccups to gaining new resources.

If one likes Tower Defense based games and managing the resources of a base, this game is already a nice one to add to your list.

It also allows you to research better towers, better weapons for your Mech and splits research into tech you need to download from Earth and Alien Research, which in my opinion could have been done a bit better in description and diversity in case of the latter.

While a few patches seem to have added more to Alien Research which is nice, sometimes I still think its lacking in diversity for specific Alien creatures or plants that could teach us so much seeing as they are, according to the game dialogue, something never seen on Earth.

All in all, the game offers a nice diversity of types of creatures, plants and environments to explore at your own leisure or peril.
Same goes for advancing through the storyline, you can do so at your own pace, decide after your startup which rare resources to chase down first so you can upgrade your favorite defenses first or perhaps chase after a better way to provide power for your base.

As for the downsides of the game:

Sometimes resources dont make sense for crafting something either. For example: a researched mini nuke launcher.
A high tier rocket launcher or grenade launcher costs uranium to build but a mini nuke launcher for your Mech does not. Seems weird in my opinion.

To gain more knowledge for Alien things, you need to scan them. At first this is okay and you dont need many scans to improve your knowledge on the plant or creature you scan, but it can get quite tedious if you need one specific type of thing you need scanned and how much you gain for scanning more and more.
It starts with discovering a new species, with the next step being some info on what resources they can drop and some basic info (such a HP). After that know how on how to plant or weaknesses/resistances of creature. Up till here, all fine and well and not much scans needed.
After this more and more scans are needed only to gain a resource drop bonus (for both plants and creatures) and a damage bonus to enemy creatures. To actually gain a good damage bonus you need to scan ALOT of critters ( or plant resource bonus which is easier if you plant them yourself).

The information given when it comes to creatures (a few exceptions there when it comes to weaknesses/resistances they have) is basicly always the same.
A normal variant has the same description as an Alpha variant. Why? what makes the Alpha variant an Alpha? what makes it so special, I mean aside from its higher HP stat? Those are the questions my brain asks me at such a moment.
Of course, scanning is optional, as in the sense you can do it or leave it be. Although on higher difficulties I think the damage bonuses can be quite essential when it comes to certain critters.
Just a tad bit more on that info would be so great.

Perhaps something still to come, I keep my fingers crossed.",1637335619,1637335619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hours Clocked: 72.1

It's hard to recommend this game, while also not recommending it. From the beginning things feel pretty solid, but you can get away with a lot before having a base, any good tech or even resources.

Then as you build up, you'll deal with random events that are interesting at first, but then quickly realize it is the same event as the last 10 events just with a different name and skin. Oh look, my Solar Panels are not working yet again. Then the next event is another one that reduced your Solar Panels and Wind Generators. Tornadoes, Hail, Acid Rain, Meteorites, Earthquakes and a never ending stream of petty annoyances.

Then you've got the aliens that will attack your base in waves, which are mowed down with relative ease. If you're really bored (which will happen a lot) you can solo them because the AI knows exactly where you are and you can just kite them around the map with impunity.

Don't get me wrong, there's a ton of satisfaction watching hundreds of aliens become red paste. It just has really horrible scaling. Rarely was I frustrated with a wave (usually a new enemy type with a resist I don't have a counter for) but it never felt it was scaled to my progress.

The environments looked great, but every mission was just like the last one. Go here, scan this, dig that, fend off a wave and move on. Over and over. It wasn't a grind, it felt like punishment. Combined with the repeating events, it stopped being interesting and I just wanted to be done.

The factory building is really simple and you'll find there's really not much to optimize. Upgrade this, upgrade that, go do another boring mission and repeat. I wasn't expecting a ton of depth, but when the rest of the game isn't keeping your attention. This is on the most difficult setting too.

For what it is, it's not a bad game. I had fun hunting achievements, killing aliens, researching the fun weapons to use. I got plenty of hours in the game, so I got my money's worth. It's just hard to recommend it, but it would be a disservice to give it a thumbs down.

Overall my recommendation of The Riftbreaker is Neutral.

[list]
    [*]Game looks nice and sounds nice.
    [*]Random Events keep you on you feet.
    [*]Lots of weapons and resistances gives combat some depth and variety.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[list]
    [*]No real variety in the biome other than appearance.
    [*]AI knows exactly where the player is, making cheesing everything hilariously broken.
    [*]Certain ""Events"" are literal copy + paste with a different skin. Seriously, most just reduce Solar and Wind.
[/list]

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Crafting upgrades is tedious.
    [*]Researching is tedious. Can scan 900 rocks easy, but a particular creature? RNG says no and it didn't drop data either.
    [*]Scaling and pacing in this game is inconsistent. You're either bored or frustrated with no in between.

I really wish that developers continue developing this game as there is definitely some balancing to be done (I beat Campaign on brutal like it was easy without any challenge at all, and I could beat only normal difficulty in Survival, not even hard). Also, a huge part of the tech tree is useless in survival as you just can't craft/use those items. Some of the campaign missions are VERY boring - go and search for a mineral, spend half an hour mining 500 of that mineral etc. They add value neither to the plot nor to the gameplay.

pros: 
beautiful game graphics, 
great play 'flow,' (satisfying weapons, pretty intuitive mechanics)
blends genres without loosing much

cons: 
no plot at all, lol. 
Survival mode feels like a 2 day project the devs threw together after spending all their time on the campaign. 

things I wish they'd change:
Make maps more unique. the random generator makes all maps basically the same. I'd love to have more mountainous regions, with tons of choke-points. As it is, you lose a lot of the tower defense strategies for directing enemies into a kill-zone, because maps are mostly wide-open with scattered terrain features. 

Add some variation to survival. It's kiiiinda a rouge-like, in that you can pursue different techs, weapons, mods. I think with a little more tweaking, survival mode can be more like that, and every game can be vastly different. 

mods are currently just extra clutter. Mods are kinda a pain to use, I've played 126 hours and never bothered with tower mods, except to see what they do. Neat concept, but you definitely don't need to use it at all. If there was an automated way to equip mods (auto-equip mods to towers? somehow?) that would be neat. otherwise, I'm going to continue pretending they don't exist.

That being said, even though I have played 40 hours with the game, the lack of an new game plus, end game, and general difficulty is kinda underwhelming. 

There is so many missed moments that make this game feel really strange to play. Your towers, while strong, only get super strong at the final mission of the game. For the entire campaign playthrough i was using riggs to beat the waves. 

Some weapons are severely underpowered (blaster, flamer, cryo gun and meele) while others can be exploited to an extreme and do barabaric amounts of dps. Mini gun and burst gun outperform every single gun in the game. 

Most valuable mod is + projectile burst and + projectile. They signficantly outperfom every other weapon to the point that is a joke. Nukes can fire several at once with it (per launcher) allowing you to vaporize every wave in the game. 

Heavy arty, while cool takes a stupid amount of resources to build to the point that a few repair towers and plasma towers outperform it. (only real advantage it has is burst damage and long range) . 

Resources are so abundunt that you can spam walls and towers accross the entire map and never lose even a single outpost. 

It has a lot of ideas that it borrows from several other games but never tries to devlop them enough to make it is own unique feature. 7/10",1636925166,1636925166,False,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

The Riftbreaker is a game where you player the titular Riftbreaker, an advanced scout sent to a faraway planet via a one-way wormhole to setup a permanent two way gateway so that the planet be colonized and its resources exploited.

Naturally, something like that requires significant infrastructure to build and maintain and it is the riftbreaker's job to set all of that up with her advanced mecha suit with both construction and combat capabilities. Unfortunately, the wildlife is disturbed by all that construction and turns hostile.

Here's where the blend of genres comes in.  Base construction is similar to an rts with a very light bit of factory building built in for a very few resources and buildings.  Defending the bases is  more of a tower defense game. Exploring the map to set up bases and find resources is more like a ARPG with crafting instead of leveling up.  Lastly, the game has a giant tech tree that would be perfectly at home in a 4X game.

Another unique feature is that your bases are permanent and keep going when you are on other maps. Solid resources are universal and can be used at any base. As a result, you find yourself revisiting old maps to setup new resources mines and other buildings to feed your main and newer bases.

My only complaint is that I was expecting an epic final batter requiring the most advanced defensive buildings, but the final battle was extremely light and easy and I needed only a relatively light defense.  It's a minor nitpick.  At least they didn't make the final batter super difficult and frustrating like a lot of other games do. There's a reason why I stop playing most games at the final battle.

Before you get the game, PLAY THE FREE PROLOGUE.

And yes, the prologue is probably more fun than the main game. But the main game is fun too, and lasts much longer.
There's a lot of bad things, but at the end of the day, the game itself is quite enjoyable as a tower defense game.
I think I've played about 20 hours and finished the campaign (lots of hours on the pause menu). And honestly, I think the game has a LOT of things you can do.

The good:
- Building is fun. Like all good tower defense games should be.
- In the late-game you don't have to worry about resources. So you won't get nagged to death with basic stuff.
- Many of the monsters are resistant or completely counter certain weapons.
- Extensive research trees. (maybe too big)
- You WILL lose track of time.
- The game really is 90% the same as the Prologue, so you know what you're getting into.

The bad:
- Research takes too long. After 20 hours of gameplay and non-stop researching, it still has over 2 real life days worth of research to do. And there's no way to speed it up. And research is also halted during your missions. Which makes it even worse.
- You need to spend HOURS on systematically building a singular (2 thick) wall around the whole map. With several towers behind it. At some point there's not tactics behind it. It just takes 5+ hours to execute it.
- Non-main resources are a pain. If you want resources, you need to go to an ""outpost"", a second base where you specifically gather that 1 resource. Realistically, I don't want to spend 5+ hours gathering resources, if I did, I'd play an mmoRPG. So my only alternative was to ""cultivate"" my resources slowly. Which is indeed... REALLY slow.
- The bioscanner lets you unlock research. and increases plant resource efficiency, scanning is fun at first. But gets boring quickly. And you get punished for staying at a mission too long for scanning, because research is halted during those missions.
- Waiting times. EVERYTHING takes time. Build a nuclear plant? 5 minutes, want to upgrade it? another 10 minutes. There's way too many artificial waiting times that don't make sense. I do NOT want to wait 10 minutes just for all the batteries I built. 

The Neutral:
- While I had fun, I do feel like a good chunk of it was ""boring"". I eventually just built a impenetrable wall, not for the mission's sake, but so I could go AFK to let the research do its thing. After writing this review, I'll be doing just that. Going AFK in-game. Hoping my towers will hold. But I'm sure they will.
- In the end-game it gets a bit laggy. Which is understandable considering all I've built and how many enemies there are.
- Story is mediocre. But that's not why you're here.
- I don't think I'll ever want to re-play the campaign. I'll proabably get all achievements, and bail.
- Very little replay value
- If they add co-op, it'd be cool. But you'll still be held back by the slow research speeds. So I don't know if co-op would actually ""add"" anything to the game. Especially on a game that takes 20+ hours for a campaign. 35+ if I see other reviews.

The wtf?
- This game has stream/twitch interaction?! Honestly, I sometimes stream games, but I don't think I could ever get viewers to actively do things in a game like this.

+ Good enemy variety and defensive options
+ A variety of different upgrade paths to research and equip

Most fun I've had in a game in a long time.

Good Things: 
I was surprised by the fact that the campaign is not broken into segments like ""Mission 1: Repair this base"" Load Screen/Mission Select ""Mission 2: Establish a Base at X under Y circumstances"" LoadScreen and so on. It's all one big piece. Your base feels more like a home because of this, somewhere you've built and come back to in between scouting for new resources or expanding outposts. 
There's not any hand holding, you're allowed to build whatever whenever wherever. And yes, this will allow you to make mistakes. I found myself learning the rules rather quickly. The game will teach you if you follow the campaign and prompts from your character/mech so keep an ear out, it may help.
At first I was a little daunted by the management of several different outpost's needs (power/resources) but as my research grew and new forms of energy supply came along, it became easier and I felt some relief. That relief encouraged me to build bigger and to keep going. I knew that with my new techs I could do more and get creative without penalizing myself.
Based on other reviews, I had a feeling going into the game that it was going to be a lot of ""automation management"". Like Dyson or Factorio but no. It's far simpler than that. I feel like a lot of RTS players who may be afraid to give this game a shot because of that should try this game out. 
Graphics and Audio 10/10. Loved looking at it and loved hearing it, from music to the sound of my mech walking over puddles of alien blood, very satisfying. 
THERE IS A DEMO!! A demo! Play it first if you are on the fence. It ties into the main game as it is the main game's prologue.
The flora and fauna are beautiful, each species brings their own value and threat. Some can be tackled or obtained quite easily while others will have you rethinking your loadout and base layout. The environment itself can be used to bottleneck or spread hordes out depending on how you use your surroundings. 
If you like base building in AoE, AoM, C&C, even city builders, you may also find this enjoyable. This game made me look at other games like diablo and say ""Why didn't Diablo allow WASD movement, it works here!"" It felt right.
Like games where you upgrade and become stupid powerful? Try this out. Want to just build a base and go afk to see how long it can survive without interference from you directly, try this out. 
There are a lot of things I can list about this game that I absolutely loved, but I won't spoil it by telling you everything.

Bad Things:
CARBONIUM STORAGE IS FULL, WE SHOULD BUILD MORE STORAGE!
IRONIUM STORAGE IS FULL. WE SHOULD BUILD MORE STORAGE!
That did get old real quick. There's an achievement for building x amount of storage capacity and even after reaching that threshold, my character/mech were still screaming at me to expand our storage. I hope they dial back the frequency of those announcements in future updates. That would be swell.

Gameplay: You extract resources, build a base, build defences and kill bad guys who appear in waves and randomly on the map. The resources management system is quite developed along with energy development and the defensive systems. I was impressed by the number of defence towers in game as well as the defensive support structures. 

The attack waves are random and come from random locations on the map edge forcing you to create a proper 360 defence perimeter. That being said the game, even on the ‘brutal’ difficulty did feel a little easy. Once you’ve perfected your defensives the enemy isn’t getting in, which is a little disappointing. 

Story: Extremely basic and only tertiary to the gameplay. 

Graphics: They look great the models and different biomes all are truly excellent. Sadly the camera is so zoomed in that you barely see anything. Massive battles erupt all around you and you only see a fraction of it. Missed opportunity.



Research mechanic : Don’t add in shitty mobile game mechanics to extend your game’s length. 




If you like big sandboxes and building reasonably complex bases, then you’ll love this game. 

If you need more direction and structure in your games, then you’ll get bored of this game fast. The big sandbox the game tosses you in are fun at first until you realise there isn’t much to do here.

There's immediate, short, mid & long term challenges, limitations, balances, deep research layers, fairly complex logistics and a decent number of required resources, tho a third apply only to the RPG aspects & can't be mined or cultivated.
The Prologue was excellent, and raised my hopes for a grand RTS, this has all the basic building blocks to be great.
i'll be discussing my disappointment in detail, but i'll be clear: this is as good as any RTS i've seen for years. i wouldn't bother otherwise.

unfortunately, that's as good as it gets. this game fails where every other RTS of the last decade does: campaign & story. I sincerely hope a good update can fix it.
*there's really no social story here. the entire narrative of this game equates to one or two missions in any great classic RTS. there's no stories to tell friends, brag about, complain about, discuss tactics & preferences. in game choices work or not, and there's no story in any of it. playtime is massively inflated in that comparison, but that's a bad thing, not good.
*building progression is fairly standard. even the latter building types offer no changes to basic methods & habits. given there are no mobile units aside from the Avatar, that gets boring in later periods.
*the natural & enemy events are all avatar centric: you never get called away from a map to reinforce any other area. boring AF, compounded w the ""one visit or an outpost"" lockout. tho i never tested if you get a new map to start over on. those multilayer side missions were too boring as is.
*locked out or missing RTS features. yes, this has major flat plane RPG theme, but these are fundamental RTS features for good reason. lock them to build mode if you feel the need. Camera Zoom, plane selection/function (upgrade/sell) tiling of some buildings, etc. a logistics drone base, to collect drops, would be awesome & make some other balance options available. hell, a long-rang version would incorporate transport logistical challenges, and open all kinds of improvements.

and the largest flaw of all.
****""The ""campaign"".
Amounts to a single mission, w sub-objectives scattered across multiple maps - usually a progression of maps for any single secondary objective. massively inflates gametime for while actively decreasing entertainment - i got so bored i got fixated on a ""perfect base"", restarted a dozen times, then cheated the game out.
honestly, linking a main map to a limited number of resource maps, w a few chained resource maps (a ravine logistics challenge map, oooh!), then iterating to create multiple progressions would be a Lot more interesting, would shorten the insane timeframe you spend on that one main map, provide lots more room for flexibility & creativity.
the worst part is that most of the needed functionality is baked in, the dev team simply didn't bother with a better story. heck, a simple hackjob where you retain tech but start over every time you fail, but unlock specific improvement techs, would make for a massively improved gameplay.
have the MC respawn at an outpost, then have to shift into a new main base w a jump zone that doesn't access all of the old zone. hey presto, deeper progression, multiple iteration, opportunity for the Characters to fail, learn, improve, and oooh, unlock/develop hidden tech as you realise you need it - or not if difficulty or player skill is that good.
like that final challenge w the main jump gate: the first time around, that's a forced fail. then you retreat/respawn, move, redevelop, etc, try again.
combine all that w multiple main base instances giving access to wider stretches of planet, much better game. maybe some themes per main map? make them different, regional, interesting.
frankly, RTS game developers generally seem to be so fixated on developing the next ""ESport RTS"" that they miss why any game becomes great: stories, better yet social stories. Starcraft, Command & Conquer, & every other great RTS has great, deep, baked in, story elements that capture a fanbase. they also generate situational stories: ""oh, you did what?"",""how did i fail there?"" etc.
sure, the sport develops & revolves around functionalities, but story is fundamental: look at any of the great ESport games; the story elements inform & affect game elements, develop interest, support entry level play, and retain players as they develop.",1636766166,1636767933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed it, however there are quite a few bugs and things I would like to see changed.
The campaign seemed really drawn out and was kinda repetitive. 
The audio reminders can be turned down volume wise, but then you can run the risk of missing alerts, however I don't need to be reminded that my storage is full, or the tech tree is idle every 30 seconds. 

I came across some bugs where objectives stayed consistent and didn't refresh. I had an ""Investigate large creature"" mission active my entire campaign because I killed it too quickly and the audio didn't process fully. I've also died during an audio log mission update and it messed up the mission causing me to be forced to reset the mission,

There is also little variation in play style, you are forced to build different types of turrets to work around enemy resistances.

However, mid-way through the campaign the difficulty suddenly skyrockets, to the point where the alien hordes steamroller your base regardless of how carefully you build your defences or try to fight them off in person. In addition, the resource management is never fully explained, and you will find your supplies of raw materials suddenly plummet with little or no explanation, as the combat drains your resources far quicker than building.

I've read some comments on the forum about the normal mode (which I played) as being too easy. If that's the case, then either I'm just a crap player or I'm getting something fundamentally wrong. In either case, the game as it stands does not do enough to explain or guide me to a solution. I've restarted the campaign 3 times and the result is always the same - once I've built a couple of outposts I can kiss goodbye to my main base, as hordes of creatures (many of whom do not even belong in the Tropical biome) suddenly decide to swarm at me in waves so stupidly large I barely have enough resources to rebuild - assuming I survive at all - before the next one barrels in.

+ Sound Design and Visuals are beautiful. Weapons sound punchy and if I invest in double-double nukes, I better have my screen be one explosion. It is.
+ The general gameplay loop is fun. It manages to offer variety without being overwhelming on weapons and things to build.
+ The mix of ""ARPG"" and ""Factory Builder"" works well, the game offers enough mechanics to keep you motivated to run around inside and outside your base. There's never idle waiting.
* Difficulty doesn't matter in Campaign, it matters for Survival. I played the game on Normal and Brutal and the differences were maybe the damage numbers.
* The voice actor for the EXO Suit you have seems to change from Regular to slightly higher pitched, to French guy, to Indian Guy at times. I suppose that they had to put some voice lines in after the VA was done or something.
- The Characters talk a lot at times. Especially when you return to a Rift prepare to get 30 announcements about full storages and depleted deposits. I feel my brain filters them out by now.
- The balance feels a bit off in Survival mode; there's times where you will just get your teeth kicked in because the game sends 50 highest-range artillery enemies against you. Those you counter with your artillery, but the artillery turrets are too busy focusing the enemy in the front that is immune to explosive damage. An option to control tower AI would have been nice.
- DirectX12 is rather unstable, but they're working on the crashes.
- The game doesn't have frame lags but the whole game will slow down at times - especially when loading into a Rift or when there's the gigantic hordes. I had instances where one second game time became three real life seconds.

The balancing of the game trends towards easy, but there are harder difficulties to conquer if you are looking for a challenge.

The game comes very close to a 3D Factorio: you are placed onto a foreign planet and tasked with creating a way back to Earth. But there are some big differences to point out: all resources are usable in their raw form so you won't be making factories to refine materials. The main focus will be harvesting materials to construct buildings and defenses, while researching new technologies to do these things more effectively.

The campaign mode takes about 8 hours to complete if you are pushing to get to the end. The game also comes with a survival mode that allows you to test your skills in a more stream-lined fight-or-die mode.",1636510032,1636510032,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] Unlike [/b] their previous title X-Morph, which I greatly enjoyed (also recommend picking it up if you like TD games).  It's a tower defense/base building hybrid.  There is a persistent research tree(s) to gain access to better weapons and buildings.  You manage a variety of different resource types, generate and connect power to various parts of your base(s), and deal with environmental hazards such as acidic rain which prevents you from building anything in a particular area.  You don't really build lanes for enemies to funnel through.  Enemies can spawn from any edge of a large map and it's your job to assess and build relatively defend-able points.  Part of the fun is to slowly creep forward to secure more secure chokes for the enemies to pass through.

[b] Like [/b] X-Morph, this is very much an action TD game.  A much larger variety of weapons though.  3 for each arm, making a total of 6 weapons at once, which can be fired independently or together.  In addition to weapons, you can equip 4 passive 'accessories' which can provide bonuses ranging from additional HP/shields, movement speed, increased radar range, etc.  Also 8 active items can be equipped, from grenades to mines to self heal.

As a TD game fan, I got to say this was not the game I expected, but definitely a game I enjoy.  Eagerly waiting for the developers to eventually add in coop play.",1636504929,1636505526,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The zero point is that game is still little unstable. And I think that this is only my issue. In other hand, while FX is cool *UI lacks* and ultrawidescreen supports but with little glitches (mainly at UI). Below about game and my impressions about gameplay.

The first point is - *balance*! There is big troubles about one. We have little production chains, and they are interesting at research/expand mechanics with nice outpost feature at campaing, but last is very big hole at main balance position. Outpost is something very far from main base so you should transfer to it with rift, but this means what when you are at different location events as creatures attacks or wind-change are paused somehow and you shouldn't maintain them. Another claim about outposts is UI lacking with them - if resources are going to be depleted you wont gather them, but you should manage this by yourself. Maybe sound messages would be voiced but *alerts are noise* with continuosly announcing weather changes, attacks or lore/plot info. So you can gather up with somehow any power and place global-covered production and storage here with using it at main base. I don't think this is planned behaviour. Other balance issues is that somewhere ""great"" attacks becomes too hard and you should every 10 minutes just restores your base. This is acceptable, but hardness test growing is something unpredictable. Also, too much mechanics is hightly abusable like distracting builds at map borders and sometimes rebuilding them (I won't going deeper becouse this is a review, not guide). Maybe this is planned, but with this easy-winning moves game becomes boring and too much repitative. Another balance issues are hidden at production chains and about this later.

Second point is plot (lore). There are *huge information layer but it's boring and cropped*. I mean that this is interesing idea, with prologue (and simulation), with sciencetist (not army) but agressive colonisation (hello, James), something about biosphere, AI with its alone user and a lot of other interesting ideas. Without completing them. I feel it could be much better, a little cinematics, a little briefings, a little more talks and this will be candy beating  most AAA titles. Maybe this can be on trust. I don't know. My feelings after very interesting proluge are broken. But who knows, how about part 2?

Something too bad are happened with research and production, third and last point. This is NOT factory cross diablo. Sorry guys. At core it seems interesting, but at hi-detalisation there are too much disappointments. You have only one main resource - energy. Another 2 - are gatherable from raw energy, this is first, and are used mainly at buildings and just a little bit at production energy and ammunitions. You shouldn't build well-placed base with gathereing at breath and item fabrication at heart. All you should do is place a couple of power plants (with combination them) and just gather more main resources to place more power plants and gather more resources. Sometimes you should shield up paths to your base. And... This is a gameplay. Of course you can craft greater weapons and go shoot em up by yourself... And this is great. So this is working potion. But some production chains are here - fluids. And this is awfull, you can't place them anywhere, you should pass pipes from, you cant mix them and everything else. After very impressive factorio gameplay this is annoying and boring. And I can't take rates mechanic - seems like you should take them at strange proportions. But maybe this is my hallucination. Also, there is worst UI, like gamepad optimized, but think - premature optimized one. I didn't used gamepad (didn't try even and still don't know this is possible, seems like yes) but keyboard/mouse are little annoy. Building is frustrating with large building count and always listing menu. Also, keybiindings are nice somehow but not universal at all.

Okay, what about whole game? *Game is whell*. Based on interesed idea you definitly will frustrate, but if you come with idea what this is part of game - it won't be so bad. There are parts of frustrating and parts of superiority, parts of abuse and parts of hard-planning, parts of very bad ideas and parts of genious them.

While amazingly good, and fun to play, I can not recommend purchase until I can play more than an hour without crashing.

The crashes tend to occur exclusively when enemies are dying. Either by player or tower fire.


EDIT:
It doesn't seem to matter whats happening, nor if it's DX11 or DX12. I've had it happen more when in battle, but it just happened when placing a wind turbine. Literally, clicked to place and FREEZE... CRASH... 

Looks like I'm done with this till something is resolved. Played it too long to refund till then. So, do yourself a favor and WAIT till *all* stability issues are fixed.

BTW. I'm running an RX 590. A more than capable card, with the latest drivers. Wouldn't be surprised if those of us having issues have similarly older, but not terrible, AMD GPU's.

EDIT 2:
After spending some time fiddling with it, in DX12 mode I set the FPS Maximum to 60% (of what?) and managed to reduce the load on the GPU enough that most, but not all stability issues are resolved.

There is a major game braking bug currently in the game that is impacting a few players. This will impact your ability to progress out of the first map, transition to any other map, and possibly losing any progress made on any map which includes your home world. The latter places you in a weird bug that resets all progress made in the campaign. 

The primary bug is that you receive an error when the game tries to auto-save. This auto-save bug will directly prevent you from leaving that map. This issue is related to the game files stored in your documents folder. Removing the Read-only status on the files or giving the application administrative rights may not resolve this issue. It resolved this issue once, but I was never able to leave the next map and this solution never worked again. 

The only way to move to a new map, you must delete the files that are impacted by referencing the auto-save error. The problem is that those files are used to record changes to the existing map and their related campaign progress related to the map. Deleting those files will allow you to change to another map but if the affected files deleted belong to be your home-world, the campaign will reset. It appears to reset the entire campaign.

The second reason I'd be tempted to give it a negative review is that I find the protagonist insufferable.  I hate to say, she is poorly written, poorly voice acted, and just annoying.  Imagine playing a game with bloody Greta Thunberg whining in your ear about the planet and global warming.  Ashley joins the military, becomes an elite one-woman invasion force and then does nothing but complain about having to follow orders and behave in a militaristic way.  It smacks of half-baked wokism and is so in-your-face that it really starts detracting from the gameplay.  You get the impression that the writers had a raging boner for the Avatar film.  The game seeks to find the magic of Titanfall 2 in terms of the relationship between man and machine, but really falls short.

The game itself is excellent however -  A fun blend of factory games like Factorio or Satisfactory, tower defence games, and ARPG/Twin Stick Shooters.  It is technically brilliant, looks and sounds amazing and runs beautifully.  It is also fun.  It is much more accessible than the likes of Factorio, but still has plenty of depth and strategy.

I really rate the devs as well.  They've been really responsive as the game has been released and have a great relationship with the community.  They released an excellent beta/demo that will give you a good taste of the game if you are sitting on the fence.

Riftbreaker is a highly polished indie title from excellent devs that has a lot of depth and is a lot of fun to play.  It's really just let down by poor writing and unlikable, wooden characters.",1636381292,1636381292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kinda similar to Factorio but with a focus on combat instead of Automatisation.

I really enjoy the gameplay, the graphics are pretty good, and the story + voiceacting are serviceable.

Points that could be improved upon:
-The AI is pretty stupid 
Enemy waves often form a spearhead and attack a single point in your defences at a time. It's easy to quickly reinforce a single point before the wave hits and your mech can then join the fight. This also allows your mech to kite all enemies in front of your defenses letting them do no damage while getting easily destroyed.

It's also possible to use natural choke points really effective against the AI because they rarely walk around it to attack from a more advantages angle and the enemies often get stuck behind eachother in a chokepoint allowing your defenses all the time to slowly pik apart the wave of enemies.

-Research in campaign and survival is unbalanced
The campaign kinda allows you all the time to unlock most of the research before moving on with your objectives. Only a third tree based on alien research is a bit progression locked. This can result in having the Extreme class weapons unlocked way before the end of the campaign. Extreme weapons are way overpowered which made the final battle a snore. The power of the mech seems to be overtuned. I would like to be more dependent on a good defense setup when fighting waves and better weapons to be mostly needed for special missions and exploration.

In survival you barely have any time to do any of the research before you reach the timed objective on the default difficulty settings. I finished it on normal difficulty and i just barely reached the laboratory tech to start any alien research. 

-The campaign barely has any unique objectives / missions
The main goal is to build the rift station. but this required 3 special resources which you can only find in the other 3 biomes. For each resource there are 3 area's you need to visit which kinda follow the same objective. scout biome -> get samples -> create mining outpost. There are a few side missions which are a slightly more interesting. I would've liked to see missions which diverged more from the normal game loop. No build zones which require certain abilities to navigate resulting in a big boss battle. Discover huge monster nests.

The Riftbreaker was a gas! I was looking forward to this game for quite a long time and it didn't disappoint. It slaps so many genres and sub-genres together under one roof, and the game engine purrs perfectly the entire way through. Even when you're defending your base against thousands of enemies and have thousands of structures built.

The campaign was pretty fun! There were some parts of it that didn't seem to serve much of a purpose, but are there for completionists. Some of the guidelines for how to further certain parts of missions were hard to pay attention to if in the middle of serious combat. All in all, it has clear direction, and offers quite a lot of variety and buildup to the finale.

The real fun, for me, came from the base-building and the combat. It was so great to unlock all the new technologies and see how they'd get incorporated into the base. The progression feels good and fair, with a lot of room for flexibility and creativity. Strategies develop over time as you unlock new structures/equipment. Although, generally you will be setting up a lot of walls with towers behind them. Due to the massive nature of the later swarm attacks, it's hard to determine which parts of your strategy are actually doing the most work, and which parts could use further improvement.

The combat overall is a romp! Weapons feel great, look great, sound great, and they all pack a punch! There are so many options, it's almost hard to choose. I gravitated towards the grenade launcher and the corrosive gun. Very fun to use, and powerful! The inventory/loadout system is simple, but does add a lot of extra ways to tweak your playstyle and combat tactics.

The environment, soundscape, and ambiance is also fantastic. Graphics, stellar. Sound, full and interesting, voice acting is superb, writing is pretty good, and the art design is tip-top. Lots of interesting things to see, inspect, adore, and love. Nothing feels out of place. Nothing!

All-in-all, I absolutely loved the game, and feel like doing another playthrough on the higher difficulties. It was a great escape from all the other games out there today. The Riftbreaker really stands out on its own as something extremely special. It scratches a multitude of itches, and it does it very well!

-Combat is way too simple and imbalanced.  99% of the time you're fighting hordes of enemies, so you want to be using AOE weapons.  Do you like using shotguns?  So do I!  But they're inferior in this game.  Really, there's no reason to use anything other than the Grenade Launcher.

-Base defense is kinda stupid because inevitably you'll have to end up expanding outside of your base when the resource deposits in your base run dry.  When a horde attacks, it attacks the first thing it sees, which means they're going to be going after your tiny carbonium mining outpost and not your main base.  

-Weapon mods don't feel impactful.  This kinda goes along with character progression as a whole; there is none.  Considering some compared aspects of this game to an ARPG you would think there'd be some, but there isn't.  

-Campaign sucks, and is a grind.  Each mission is the same: warp to new location, run around with what is essentially a metal detector while avoiding whatever unique hazard exists in this area, dig up some ore, return to base.  Sometimes you have to set up a permanent mining outpost at these locations which is kinda cool, but it's one of those ""set it and forget it"" things; you never have to worry about these outposts once you leave them, except when they've exhausted the resource deposits you've been tapping into.

-The game auto-saves every so often, and when it does your game pauses for a couple of seconds.  It's a minor annoyance at worst, but it's still an annoyance.

-You can build floors to make your base look prettier, but the tiles don't always connect together visually.  You can use your mousewheel to increase the footprint of the tiles you're building (up to about 3x3), and then you just run around your base holding left-click to paint the ground with your tiles.  If you missed a little 1x1 spot and go back to fill it in, it'll look like a distinct 1x1 tile; it won't seamlessly connect with the surrounding tiles.  If you care about making your base look good, this is annoying.

All in all, I think this game has a solid foundation, but I'd recommend checking back in a year to see what the devs have done with it.

I will start of going through the different aspects of this game, diablo style shoot them up,  resource management and tower defense.

Combat
This games fighting is incredibly basic, there are a lot of seeming customization options but none of them meaningfully changes how you play. You run in circles shooting/spearing enemies, that's all you do over and over again. There is no fun or interesting twist on this, you just kite everything. This is also very easy to do, you can kite thousands of enemies alone and slowly kill them all. The biggest worry is if any of them will stray away and attack your base on higher difficulties.

Resource management/decisionmaking
The game also lacks any meaningful decisions when it comes to how you are going to invest your resources. This might not be entirely true in survival brutal mode but for everything else there is no strategy here. You need to build energy generating building,s the game tells you to build a mix of them. The more you build the better and that is true for almost everything in this game, can you build more windmills? Then do it, can you build more batteries or storage space just do it. That is what building the base is in the game, just build hundreds of the same thing over and over.

Tower defence
How the waves work and how to think about protecting your base, the game tells you nothing about it which makes the first couple of hours very confusing. But its pretty straightforward, an attack will always come from one of the edges of the square, after they spawn they will attack the closest building or you. That means that you will need to build defensive outposts all around your base. The design of how you build things doesn't really matter because resources out there is plentiful and if you are trying for survival brutal all the work should be done by you anyway. At harder enemy waves they will destroy some of your defenses, there is no way to stop that meaning that a lot of playtime is spent running around manually rebuilding. 

Campaign mode
Its a grind that's all it is, at least for me that likes a challenge this is not a matter of skill in any way its only about putting in the hours. Slowly running around with a metal detector while killing thousands upon thousands of enemies that are zero threat to you while running around. The campaign mode is full of the most boring ""side missions"" telling you to go around with a metal detector doing menial simple and boring tasks over and over. Your main base will be managed through building windmills, and more windmills, walls and more walls, batteries and more batteries and so on. 

Survival
I put quite a bit of time into trying to beat survival on brutal and I will have to say that it is hard. But its hard in ways that are not fun, in this mode the enemies comes in huge numbers very fast and if you try to defend with towers you will never have enough resources to survive. You will need to kill 90% of all enemies yourself, which is hard because of the RNG of enemy waves splitting up and wrecking part of your base you cant defend. The risk of getting stuck in a tree or similar and getting killed since you need to run in circles for five minutes while slowly killing huge amounts of enemies. This mode feels hard in ways that are just simply not fun, in my tries I had to save scum a lot to have any chance. Because the game gives you no time to prepare and it isn't possible to build enough defenses all around your base while also getting enough resources.

Summary
In my opinion this game gets none of the things it tries to do right, the tower defence planning doesn't matter and doesn't feel rewarding. The combat is very basic and therefore also boring and the base building lacks any meaningful decision making, just keep building more of everything. For me this was too easy while the hard part was challenging in a way I did not enjoy

You build a base with simple mechanics: no conveyor belts and pipes are basically powerlines for liquids (and you infrequently use liquids). Turrets, walls, and power are very straightforward. The tech tree is just a tree of upgrades with only a few new buildings (that do not change how the game is played much at all).

The game gives you about a dozen scavenger hunt missions where you leave your main map to go to other maps where you do not build a base but instead hunt for materials (I did not find this fun).

Monsters types are very simple and do not pose much of a challenge. You don't have to think very hard to fight them.

Base defense is unsatisfying because the periodic hordes that go towards your base will get distracted by any outposts you have set up to mine materials; you'll build towers at these outposts and then they defeat the horde by themselves. By about 40% into the game your main base will rarely get attacked (which is shocking for a base defense game).

Finishing the game, the buildings/materials you have to feed into the Rift Station (similar to how you feed the Rocket Launch Pad in Factorio) is incredibly simple. Just build one building that outputs to another building to get Supercharged plasma. Then connect a pump to a water distiller to the Rift Station. That's it. You fend off some waves of monsters the game thinks are strong but really aren't, and then the game ends.

Weirdly, at the end if you choose not to colonize the planet, the game gives you some extra dialogue about how you can re-do your base to be completely eco-friendly but it doesn't actually give you any more objectives to complete; the game's just over. Or, the quest bugged out on me. The quest to start powering the Rift Station (used to finish the game) also bugged out on me and I had to use console commands to progress it.

TL;DR: a base building game not worth your time, it's just very very shallow. I played on the second-hardest difficulty but got too far into the game to change it and would've had to abandon several hours of work to restart at the hardest difficulty; if you do play this game, max out the difficulty as it does not get much harder as the game progresses than it is at the start.",1634452531,1636267755,False,5,3,0.481718361377716064,0,True,False,False

(Some small spoilers) I normally do not write reviews but i felt it was necessary because this game came out of nowhere and is wonderful. Rarely have a found a game that achieves a balance in increasing difficulty, depth and content. Rift Breaker also avoids the grinding trap when you have a game that consumes this much time.

Pros:
Extensive tech tree.
Many mech weapons and mod that have increasing quality.
Ability to mod your weapons with various abilities like increase damage, homing projectiles and many others.
Extensive base building in various environments.
Beautiful game.
Proper challenge curve.
No ability to load prior saves so if you main base wipe, that is it. Yes, that is a good thing as crazy as it sounds. Keeps you cursing. 

Cons:
There is auto save lag, so that can get you in trouble during combat.
The cursor is a bit hard to see so when you are surrounded by enemies it is tough to see.
You can play for several hours with out knowing that certain turrets need certain ammo. If you are not paying attention, like i was not, you can run out of explosive ammo. If you are out, it takes time to build the necessary buildings to generate more. If you are unlucky like me and a tough wave comes in you can wipe. Watch your ammo or face a loss of hours and hours.
Story line could be more robust.

Had a lot of fun until my first hail storm. The hail storm brought all the power connectors to less than half health. The prospect of having to visit every single one of the hundreds I've placed outside repair tower range and repair manually has completely turned me off from the game. There shouldn't be events that damage all your buildings so massively. It's the ONLY THING that happens in the game that absolutely forces you to place repair towers to cover 100% of your base. 99% of the time the only things that you NEED the repair towers for are along walls. But sadly this event causes you to cover 100% of your base or spend all your time late game running around and repairing everything. 

The other natural disaster events are far more balanced and only cause localized damage. Hail storms though cause 100% of the map buildings to take damage. Better hope you have repair towers all along EVERY SINGLE POWER NODE you've ever made, otherwise you're F-ed late game.And there is NOTHING in the game that can protect you against hail storms. Like WTF you have advanced tech to withstand volcanoes and stuff, but falling ice balls destroy everything. Makes zero sense and fundamentally ruins the game. 

I have at the time of writing this 17.2 hours in the game, and that was the first hail storm I got.

Visually, it's gorgeous. RTX On for those that have it, with some AMD performance tools to boot. One of the most fun aspects of The Riftbreaker is the attention to detail; and there's plenty of that! Different biomes with unique mobs and varying resources are intertwined in the campaign to make exploration a fun and rewarding experience.

Post campaign (or even pre-campaign if you aren't into the story), there's plenty of choice for survival play-throughs, adding many more hours of fun.

Take They Are Billions and late game Factorio (when you're got robots doing everything via blueprints and things get more abstract), add a lot of action and a tiny bit of RPG, and you get Riftbreaker, a survival base builder/tower defense/stompy shooty robot but there's also some randomized loot here and there game.

Best of all, there's a demo, so you can take a short tour and see if the basic gameplay loop and feeling of combat is your thing or not.

I played straight through the story in 1.0 and the game was totally stable save for once when I somehow got stuck in a menu that wouldn't close. There were occasional UI quirks involving hotkeys and the bottom ""select a building"" bar disappearing til I changed categories and back again, but that's about it in terms of annoyances. It's almost like they finished the game before releasing it!

A couple problems. First, spotty balance: The Campaign is quite easy, but Survival is brutally difficult in the early game at the same difficulty level. Then it gets fair in the middle and is a cakewalk in the end. So there's still some tweaking to be done there to make sure you can get your feet under you before dying, but also to make sure the final wave is even a threat.

Second, there's not a ton of variety. This is especially bad in the campaign, where you basically repeat the same missions four different times, once for each rare resource you need to acquire to build your game-winning equivalent to Factorio's rocket. Even outside of the campaign, events are generally repetitive, mostly being some variation on either ""some part of your base is going to take damage,"" ""one type of renewable power is going to be weaker/stronger,"" ""it becomes harder to navigate,"" or ""mobs constantly spawn and run at your base until you go deal with a thing."" There also aren't many monster types, mostly being restricted to the classics from tower defense games, like weak swarms, heavily armored singletons, siege-type opponents, super-mobile opponents, etc.

You should also be aware this is [i]nothing close[/i] to Factorio's design. Riftbreaker took the parts it liked and left the rest. Notably, this means [i]maps are not infinite[/i]. If your starter map doesn't have enough, say, Uranium, you will need to teleport to a different map and build an Outpost to mine it for you. When you leave that map to return to your main base, your outpost's output is approximated and just teleports the resources to your stores - which, while lore-friendly, is still a little iffy since your outposts are never in danger unless you're on their map. It'll track supply so you can actually run out of resources you mine on outposts, but those outposts are essentially invulnerable as long as you're on a different map.

Finally, if you're expecting Diablo-style random loot, forget it. Randomized mods drop for your weapons (which can also be installed in towers), but that's it. All other gear is researched via technology and constructed using resources. However, mods cannot be constructed in any way, and often radically increase the power of a weapon or tower, so while it looks paltry at first glance, it often isn't in the long term.

Also, the enemies should be tougher and more in numbers. The final wave during the rift sequence was less than what I was expecting tbh, but that could just be from my experience with They Are Billions. More optimization to allow for more enemies on the map would also be great.

The quick summary is this:  You arrive on a planet in a giant robot called Mr. Riggs, and from there need to build an ever-increasing, ever more complex factory while fighting off progressively more varied fauna that wants to kill you and eat you because nature hates squishy humans.  That's it.

It's a good game that mixes great visuals and a fusion of Factorio-lite basebuilding, fluid combat mechanics that run like your favorite MOBA and tower defense aspects that fill in the gaps between.  There's a teleportation aspect to the game that lets you move across the maps (which vary from moderate to huge) so you aren't stuck in the wrong place when an attack or event happens and there's a wide enough selection of weapons and enemies that the individual combat aspect is still a lot of fun even late game.

So on to the nitty gritty.  The graphics are well done, high quality and engaging, and even though at later stages it can get a little laggy on older machines it was never a situation where I wasn't completely unable to play.  The soundtrack is solid, with a nice ambient vibe that fits into that sweet niche of unobstrusive enough to be there and provide a nice tone without overstaying it's welcome despite the several-hour-long gameplay sessions I had.  The voice acting is pretty solid, even if the alerts can get a bit annoying if you ignore a map objective for too long, but eventhen it wasn't to the point that it bothered me.  Sound effects were also good, and very satisfying, from the rattling of a minigun to the fwoosh bang of a rocket launcher and even the sweet sound of a half-mile of plants and animals crisping under the flamer, they all made for a very immersive experience.

As far as gameplay goes, I only use a mouse and keyboard so I apologize to you gamepad players.  From my experience the actual combat aspect is fluid and engaging.  Mr. Riggs has a bevy of different weapons that all mesh quite well, including automatics, explosives, liquid weapons like flamers and a corrosion gun, and even a decent selection of Melee, including hammer, sword, powerfist and spear, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  You can equip any two, same or different, for mixed effects as well as a pool of consumables like grenades, health packs, mines and disposable turrets.  Ammo is manufactured at an armory, and if teleported directly to your suit regardless of location, so no making inconvenient ammo runs.  It keeps the action flowing when you're in the thick of it.

As far as the resource gathering and basebuilding, the game is incredibly intuitive.  The tutorial does it's job and gives you the basics you need without overstaying it's welcome, and the core aspects are pretty simple to get a grasp on.  Almost everything is based on a pool of universal resources that persist from map to map, meaning investing heavily in your economy in one area pays dividends on other maps.  Bases persist too, and you can return to your primary base from any other map as needed to develop or construct new buildings using resources collected from across the world.  New turrets, weapons and technologies are developed based on time mechanics rather than resource inputs, meaning you can finish most of the tech tree before ever leaving your first map, and can be queued from anywhere using the in-game menu.  All in all a very solid experience with a lot of freeform opportunity to build how you want, when you want.

As for the maps, enemies, and environment, all I can say is that it's a trip.  Aside from the usual giant bug monsters that want to eat you, enemies can include walking rock formations, dinosaur-looking fungus monsters, worms, and a number of different variations of each.  Maps are generated on a mission by mission basis, depending on what you need, and can vary from deserts to tropics to radioactive zones and lava-filled rocklands, amongst others.  Each map has it's own set of environmental hazards, like acidic lakes, lava, fungus plants, and so on, as well as meteorological events varying from acid rain, to hail, to meteor showers and earthquakes.  It keeps things interesting, especially when a comet comes flying across the map and wipes out a third of your power generation.

There are a few things I feel could use some fine tuning, however.  One thing I find frustrating is a lack of information.  While I don't expect Factorio-level second-by-second data input, it would be nice to have a toggle that lets me see the production output across my factory.  As of right now the only way to see fluid production is to go into build mode and hover over the building, and it doesn't account for any buildings attached to that building, so finding bottlenecks is a pain.  The main resource tab only accounts for your universal resources, like ores and munitions.  It doesn't account for incidentals like biomass or fluids, which are needed for a number of buildings, and doesn't give an overall count of how much you have.

Handling power is also a frustration, because so much of the early and midgame power comes from natural sources, like wind and solar.  Almost at random you'll see huge dips as one form of renewable power or another ceases to function completely, which can be caused by a number of reasons, from the wind dying down to rain storms to night falling.  Frustratingly, the game doesn't have any kind of tab that I could find that let me see what was causing the issue, or what the weather was doing, or where my shortages were coming from.  I hope this gets fixed in a future patch, because it really was my one major frustration with this game.

All in all, I give it a 9/10.  Even the things that annoyed me were relatively minor and didn't detract from the overall experience.  If you like giant robots, killing things, burning great swaths of a planet out of spite and bringing PROGRESS and TECHNOLOGY to a hellish, monster-ridden wasteland, I recommend this game.  Well worth the 30$ price tag and from what I've seen there's still more I haven't discovered, experienced or slain in gruesome single combat, and that's just fantastic.  And there's a demo out too, so no reason not to see if it suits your tastes.  Till next time, Rift Breaker~",1636133219,1636133400,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I give it a recommend tentatively, because it will depend on game development going forward. As it is, the game features fun combat and base building mechanics, but has a slew of balance-breaking exploits and frustrating mechanics that are holding it back for now.

I won't get into what these exploits are here, but in the campaign mode they allow you to set up outposts with infinite resource deposits, or to put the game's raid scaling on pause. 

By far the most frustrating mechanic is how raid notifications work. You are given a timer to prepare, yet raids always arrive early. You are only shown where they will come from a few seconds ahead of time, giving you effectively no time to prepare defenses in a specific spot. This is especially bad in survival (I play on hard) where attacks are far more frequent. 

Aside from those issues, the core game play is great. You have a large range of weapons and can customize them with weapon mods, allowing for many different strategies. Base building is simple but satisfying, and gives you something constant to work on while you wait for research etc. The game gave me a solid 20 hours of fun playing through the campaign once.

I've seen quite a bit of comments about how the first bit of the game is hard and you need to go back and forth back and forth and you can't actually expand. This isn't an issue. Almost immediately the game gives you repair towers to heal your defenses. And teleportation nodes that you can teleport to from ANYWHERE and then immediately teleport straight back to your previous location. For free. At any time. No cooldown. They emphasize this quite heavily actually. (looking at you 'top' wrong review.)


I find the main issue is the scaling, for a bit it was too easy, you build yourself a solid starting base with a few resource nodes in it, slap down a nice handful of turrets and then... Honestly you can just forget about the hordes, really you can just go out and cut them all down by hand. AND THEN suddenly they become very very hard when you do things like upgrade your HQ. Like, sudden 20 FPS when before you had 60 in the middle of the horde with flamethrowers and shit. I feel like they definitely need to tone down the AMOUNT of baddies and up their health just a little. Same way to tell the composition of a horde before it attacks would be nice as well.

I'm really surprised as to how fun this game can be. I've spent hours just sloshing through the map, checking my equipment what's ready to build or research as I go across the land harvesting resources. I can harvest them through HackNSlash  or I can slap a machine down to do it for me.  There are so far, many different mini periods where a penalty wave will treat your base like dog fodder, or it will give you an increased surge of juicy resources.  The enemy pile up is pretty impressive with all the bells and whistles on, but as the game runs on, you can feel it start to slag as you uncover more of the mapped area.  
This game is really enjoyable and I'll have to say, it's been a minute since I've had some really fun games to play. I definitely recommend this game.",1634548309,1635988675,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- 3 huge tech trees to research... yeah... I mean... HUGE tech trees for the game type...
- Lots of buildings, most of which are upgradable multiple times
- Very... ""free form"".  Map seems randomly generated (is it ?! I'm not sure) with no clear path.  Explore and make your own path.
- The vegetation. GOD.  The vegetation.  It's beautifull, varied, lush... and reacts to wind, light and movements...
- You have a main, huge map that will be your headquarters.   Explore, build and defend on it.  But you then get to go and explore other maps around it to get some more specialised ressources that are not available on the main one... It's... cool !  And somewhat original !
- VASTLY Upgradable mech (your own character).  Like, really.  Movement skills, loadout(3 weapons in each hand !!), general skills, special passives, mods......... SO MANY !
- You (your mec) are an important part of the defense.  Your are a tank.  A war machine.  Your own caracter is awesome... yet...
- So is a properly build base defense... so... well balanced.
- Campaign is awesome.  Then there's survival.

I mean... Some small aspects might sound/feel weird AT FIRST.... but eventually just become part of the bigger picture.
Exemple : the map is randomy but mostly WIDE-OPEN.  So there's no clear places to build your defense.   Plus, you keep expanding so... where are you supposed to build that wall ?!....   But you eventuallyrealise that the game is balanced as such.  You are warned a few minutes before ennemies attack, you know from where.... defense are QUICK to build.... movement is quite fluid, but there's also a very cheap-to-build-and-use teleport portal system so you learn to react when there's a warning... and it works......


A proper ""RTS-TowerDefense with some RPG elements... and some minimal logistic management features"".

So.....yeah... Loved it.

The only hickup : performances.  My computer is... not new gen.  A mid range 5+ years old gaming computer. 
Game ran super-smoothly untill the last 1-2 hours of the campaign.  By then, enemy attacks are MASSIVE.... and so is your defense... My frame rate went down to 0.5 FPS or so...  Painfull.",1634480293,1635985023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't say I love it but It's definetely worth spending few hours..

The game is well made, full of dynamic explosions.

The main problem for me is it gets really boring mid game when the amount of buildings, researches and things to take care of is getting simply overwhelming and turns fun into boredom and stress. Endless pointless hailstorms and earthquackes that damagage everything also irritate and don't add any fun to the game.
Navigating HUGE base is becoming a chore, the waves of attacks become repetative and that's about when I lost interest in the game.

Another main problem is that it feels really lonely there compared to They are Billions ... No human units, just a single hero robot and souless towers... Really hard to relate to all this blue glowing mess of buildings, walls and lookalike Zerg enemies.

Annoying Greth Turnberg that was taken as a voice actor and grumpy old man get annoying quickly as well..

[b] Resources: [/b] those are almost meaningless, you get so much so fast you stop caring about it before you even know it
[b] Exploration: [/b] You can go out to kill monsters – to get more resources you don´t care about – or you can try go out to find a boss, a hive, or some special location, that has a chance to drop something more than just resources - but most of the time, resources is all you get
[b] Research:  [/b] felt like it was there only to make the game loop longer – as you have to wait for hours to make something done - which creates a lot of waiting, doing nothing periods – just because you are waiting for research to get finished and there is nothing else to do in meantime (esp early game)
[b] Global events:  [/b] combined with lack of ability to repair buildings makes it annoying – a player has to repair buildings one by one – making it painfully tedious, especially in the early game – once auto-repair buildings are researched it gets better – making events pointless in the process
[b] Defending base:  [/b] felt boring – AI, if we can even call it like that, is something programmer of 1st year of any IT university could manage to come up with – get close to target and use attack, repeat – making it easy for players to kite all enemies, even in front of an endless wall of towers. Once again, making every wave of enemies feel exactly the same.
[b]World exploration:  [/b] felt disconnected from the game – a player jumps to a new map to set up a new base – then he can return back to the main base at any point – action is happening only on the active map, meaning, extra-base provides a passive supply of resources without the need to worry about it – also, becomes repetitive really fast

It's the perfect case for a game that should have been Early Access; the game's mechanics are fully implemented and functional, and it has a reasonably complete campaign. However, the performance is lacking, and there are occasional bugs and crashes that interrupt game play. It's still really fun to play though, it's very much a sci-fi They Are Billions - you build a base and watch hoards of enemies crash into your defenses and explode in a fiery, bloody mess.

The first few hours are a lot of fun while you unlock new buildings and discover new environments, creatures, plants, etc. Arranging your base, setting up your defenses, and toiling away on the layouts is also very fun. It's nothing like Factorio though (I don't understand this comparison in other reviews), the supply chains are rudimentary and there's no conveyor belts, your resources just magically transfer where they need to go (even across maps!). Laying out your base can be a bit contentious at times, but it's nowhere near as complex as Mindustry or Factorio.

I ran into a few bugs and performance issues. Every time the game auto-saves, the entire game locks up for a few seconds, which is really frustrating. I bumped up the timer on the auto-save so this wasn't happening so frequently. I also ran into an issue where I completed a campaign map without killing enough of a particular creature. Turns out you need to kill a certain number of these creatures to unlock a section of the tech tree, but since I had already completed that part of the campaign, I couldn't return to that map to finish killing the creatures!

Once you unlock enough tech and get enough resources behind you, the game reveals how simple it is. You can survive any attack by just placing one or two of each type of tower at your walls. I ended up just building square bases with a bunch of towers all around it and that did the trick. The act of clearing out trees and creatures and getting the base up and running is a fun game play loop at first, but once you realize the optimal base config is just a square with a bunch of towers, the game loses its luster.

All in all, I felt like I got a lot of value for my money, which is why this is a positive review despite some of the shortcomings. I'm hoping the developer can continue to deliver patches and updates and I'll probably do another run through the campaign in a few months.",1635864685,1635864685,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I just finished the 2nd playthrough. The 1st failed because I was too quick with mission objectives and too slow on research, so I got overrun. On the 2nd however I finished the tech tree and things have become easy @endgame.

Update: So this game is really great and has some really good content, but there are two pretty significant problems:

1) There is no late game. Once you get your base up and running and producing resources it takes just a few hours really to finish pretty much all research (besides the alien stuff that there is a slow grind to unlock). I think the foundation for some late game content exists (new resources, etc.)  but we need better reason to explore the late game materials and more structures to unlock at that point. By the time I left the first map I had already unlocked almost alll research (barring the alien research that is a very slow grind to unlock). 

Since we already have a functional and secure headquarters by this point, I expected setting up outposts to be a real challenge, but its frankly not any more difficult than setting up the original base

2) I think the difficulty scaling is okay for the first map, but the new maps should be nigh exponentially harder. My first play through I got all set up and then went out to set up outposts and quickly realized there was just no challenge left at all. The ""late game"" guns can kill the hardest enemies in a single hit. I absolutly love so much about this game, but I just don't feel like there is any challenge or meaningful progression left after the mid game set up (really just after the first map/after getting cobalt). We even encounter new enemies on the new regions, but they just aren't really any more difficult.

This game is amazing.
I just hope that more content gets made for the late game because right now it almost feels like its missing ts second half, Id even accept a late game expansion as payed DLC (because frankly they could charge a lot more for what they have here already). I want a region where I flatly *will not survive* without using the higher end turrets and weapons and mods that I have found, right now they just feel kind of pointless.",1634283026,1635813232,True,1,1,0.508960604667663574,0,True,False,False

[b]What this game has above all is the insane amount of potential, for customised campaign, workshop maps, combat focused skirmishes, defence focused RTS, deep lore diving, and co-op/versus (with co-op already on the roadmap from what I've heard).[/b]

The few notes for the dev:
- Some buildings can't be key bound? Also, alt changes to max researched level, we need one in between for level 2
- Need to simply the warning voice lines, especially the ones that reminds you about storage
- Scatter mobs are always the same type, why not mix certain mobs?
- Randomly generated maps could use some unique pre-designed zones

The Riftbreaker - It's a fun game but it was a little shorter then I was expecting.  I feel like the game had a few missed opportunities.  Because of the way the game is setup it would have been cool to have missions that where just dungeon crawls to get a special weapon or mod.

Base building in the game is good but mostly to setup walls around a resource spot and fortify with towers.  I would not call it tower defense exactly but it does have that flavor.  However the game does keep creating situations where enemies will be attacking your base often.

Environmental hazards is another aspect that you have to contend.  Earthquakes, aggressive meteor strikes, Solar flares, Thunder Storms ect.  The game has a lot of them which makes things interesting.  However the problem is they happen far to often.  It's not a deal breaker but can cause frustration.  And it's not just the storms but you are constantly informed from your characters through dialogue over and over.

Another issue with over active dialogue is constantly being reminded that your resource storage is full.  You can have hundreds of thousands of resources and you will still get nagged about it.

The game is absolutely beautiful and the environments are interesting.  Doing missions are fun because you get to explore other biomes and the have different challenges and hazards.  But the mission structure that has you going to these places are a bit to repetitive.  The goal of the game is to construct a big project.  And to do this you need different resources.  The problem is that the missions to get these resources all play out almost the same.

Gameplay feels good and I like all the different weapons you get to try.  You can even mod them to make them do interesting things.  The only issue is the weapon system is RNG based which I don't like personally.  However the weapons are not super expensive to make so you can re-roll a bunch of times to get a good weapon.  However mods are dropped and just have to keep plugging away to get a good drop.

Overall it's a good one.",1635804835,1635804835,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sort of like Factorio, but with more interesting exploration and less worrying about belts.

Sort of like an RTS, but with a character and more complex logistics and crafting than typically found in those.

All in all, this is the perfect game for me - it strikes a very nice balance of the elements I liked in those other games, but focusing more on management than setting up complex conveyor belt systems. It starts out very simple - mining two resources, setting up an ammo factory and some turrets - but as you get further into the research tree, you'll need to start chaining things together and management becomes more complex. There's several objective lines to pursue semi-independently of each other, so you're not necessarily required to do the one main objective at a time nor immediately.

My one major criticism is there can be a fair amount of sitting around waiting for research - and the game makes large expansion difficult because the scaling of a defensive perimeters is a bit harsh: Turrets not only need power, but also auxiliary AI control units need to be built, which takes more power and space. And power is variable, so you need energy storage scaling with power plants, which takes more space...

I'm enjoying this game so much, I'm over 80 hours in at this point and haven't even finished the game because I'm enjoying spreading out and improving my base over simply rushing to the end.

The Riftbreaker checked just about ALL of my boxes for what I'm looking for in a game. Whenever playing any RTS or games involving base building, I always prefer to focus on defense and end up losing because I'm not aggressive enough. Finally there's a really well put together game that encourages and rewards the turtle approach! 

You can still go out and stake claims to resources and attack aggressively, though this isn't an RTS so there's not as much risk/reward involved in that approach.

A lot of people compare this game to Factorio - my current favorite game of all time - but I don't really see it. The Riftbreaker doesn't really focus on the connections between resource gathering and crafting.  It's more RTS-style where you place resource collectors down for materials, then either place down buildings that craft themselves over a period of a few seconds to several minutes or craft personal items in a separate menu. Factorio focuses on building the most efficient or creative system of resource collection to materials manufacture while The Riftbreaker simply has you build resource collectors and storage facilities for those resources. After that, resources are mostly just ""magically"" stored and available for use. Liquid resources are an exception to this, as they are fully represented in the game from pools, to storage, to usage.

So far the only thing I have trouble with in The Riftbreaker is that it can be very difficult to tell what is using your resources.  Several times I have found myself at zero of a resource and my production at ""24/10"" (for example) meaning I am generating 10 of that resource per second, but using 24, but with no way to know exactly what is using them.  Usually it's ammo manufacturing or some other temporary drain, but it would be nice to have a utilization screen similar to Factorio that tells me where my resources are going so I can do something about it instead of just waiting for the spike in utilization to go away.

All in all, The Riftbreaker is really giving Factorio a run for its money as my favorite game of all time!",1635723157,1635723157,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was hoping for a lot more variety with buildings and automation, but everything present is a bit basic. I hated having to manually scan things with the two scanners. Some of the missions are just terrible like the one where you have create the pipeline across the map when its completely unnecessary or having to rearrange your base at the end to account for the stabilizers, water, and plasma. It's lazy that you can use the cultivator/harvester to obtain any material you need instead of some unique building/automation strategy. I was hoping for more options for automation, not exactly to the extent of something like Factorio or Satisfactory, but something in between. I was hoping this game would fill in a niche somewhere between something like They Are Billions and Factorio where it's more combat oriented, but still having an importance on resource collecting and base building. Tower variety seems lacking to deal with damage types, I would have wanted to see a poison tower without having to rely on the awful mod system to accomplish this. Conversely, too many towers fill the same niche so they are added for the sake of quaintly and not purpose.

I think this game is ALMOST there, but could use some obvious QOL fixes (a hotkey/scroll wheel to scroll between build pages, ways to destroy trees/mountains, more obvious information on where certain resources are being spent/wasted, better usage of multi planets, less reliance on manual scanning, upgrades increases radius of repair tower, larger floor tiles or a fill tool, achievements not unlocking for completing the campaign, a search bar for the research tree, less constant audio reminders, a better tutorial in the campaign via tooltips, etc.). The game also seems a bit too easy, but I played on hard, I should have tried brutal. I'm hoping to return to the game after they address the crashes, lag, etc. in the short term, but additionally add more content to create more variety. As it stands though, the package for the price is worth it, but I have high hopes for improvements and additions in the future.",1635716005,1635716167,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even with the highest armor qualities, you will quickly lose your HP in the horde situations. So, you either need to keep moving or setup behind the wall on the stepping stools you can build.
I'm somewhat baffled though.
There's a setup for conservation versus manifest destiny and the main character keeps harping on about respecting the right of the natives fauna to exist. I eat this shit up and I thought for the longest time that I was going to have to make a choice at some point and I worked on using only renewable energy for the entirety of the game to avoid as much damage as possible... and then the game ends, the expansionist superpower congratulates you on preparing the universe to be steamrolled and abused by the wasteful and willfully polluting human race. Without a hint of irony of foreshadowing. I honestly don't think there's an alternate ending, but if there is, they've done an awful job of telegraphing it.
To that effect, they really could do a better job tutorializing a lot of things.
Can I suggest that you separate which character does the Voice over for base needs and issues and which one tells us important info? Because after the 300000th time hearing ""we have too much aluminum, build more storage facilities"" I tuned out everything important they said, because the vast majority was useless.

The fact that you can't set your towers to attack only the furthest, or healthiest, or closest enemies is a major problem and contributes to cluster building rather than tactical building. That is to say, you sort of have no option but to create a fat cluster of the distance launchers at nearly every weakpoint. If you do not, you will be slowly pecked to death by the launcher snails that stay out of range of every other  tower. But if you put a six pack of launchers up and mod them with increased AOE, you're unstoppable.



Pro TIP: If you press ""G"" it turns your cursor into an upgrade application that will cut your work in half, so you don't have to click each item and select upgrade one at a time. 
Also, build your main base close to the middle of the starting map, otherwise you will encounter thoroughly annoying groups of enemies that can attack you from offscreen.",1635709493,1635709493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is all about farming resources, managing your base, defending against hordes of enemies, and researching alien flora and fauna. And it's all fun.

The game is incredibly engaging. even to the point where you forget time and space and accidentally play the game for 15 hours straight. When I started the game the first time, it was about 13:30, and when I closed the game after that session, it was 4:00 in the morning. I had been so consumed by the game I had no idea that much time had passed.

The game is also absolutely beautiful. It's one of the best looking top-down video games I have ever seen. The way the trees sway in the wind, the lighting in the biomes, desert, swamp, forest, etc. the total fireworks show whenever a horde of enemies is storming your base, and all your towers are turning them into a mountain of chunky salsa.

So... the game's story is weak, and the mech suit's pilot is not in any way an engaging personality. In fact, she is incredibly preachy when it comes to ""nature preservation"" and ""protecting the wildlife"", which is in stark contrast to the very fact you're leveling the entire area and turning it into an industrial-scale strip mining operation. But it gives you a goal to work towards, so it serves its purpose.

All in all, it's a definite recommendation from me.",1635681886,1635681886,True,1,0,0.525139689445495605,0,True,False,False

Gather resources (which are globally available everywhere), research technologies and upgrades, expand your base, deal with waves of aliens in a tower-defense style way, and explore maps for secrets and new resources. Every part of this is extremely well done and fun, and will keep you entertained for days or maybe weeks, depending on how fast you decide to go through the campaign. Sadly this game has zero replay value, so once you got through the campaign you can basically uninstall. Technically there is a freeplay mode, but that is essentially the campaign again, but poorly implemented in terms of balance: depending on random events you might be forced to restart the freeplay map, simply because an event happened that you cannot deal with at your current state of technology, and until you can deal with it the event has already destroyed your base. 

Random events in this game are the clear downside and obvious design mistake, and they cannot be disabled. They range from mild annoyances like rain that disables your solar panels briefly, stupid events like hailstorms that basically force you to sit and idle for a minute till it is over because you are not allowed to build while they happen, to outright bulls..t like a meteor randomly crashing in the center of your base and forcing you to restart. The strong quality contrast of these events to the rest of the game makes you feel like the dev team consists of a selection of the finest developers in the industry, and one underpaid intern who then implemented these random events while being drunk.

Aside from that however the game is extremely well done. Everything shows that the devs spent a lot of time on polishing and perfecting their game, and overall it is very fun to play. Even though it basically contains just the campaign, I can still recommend it to everyone who likes base-building tower-defense games.",1635681110,1635681312,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It runs smooth even with RTX enabled and definitely looks stunning when turned all the way up. It has a Sci FI setting and combines base building, a diverse tech tree(linked to discovering species and resources), Tower defense, exploring and even some RPG elements for the mech you command. 

Is it a bit rough around the edges and could use some polishing? Sure, but not anything game breaking that cannot be fixed by some patches along the way from the dev. Find it not challenging? Well hey there's plenty of difficulty settings. Personally I played it on hard on my first playthrough and some waves did carry a punch. The game does come with a demo, in the form of a prologue tutorial with most of the tech tree unlocked. So if you find yourself not liking what it showcases the game just isn't for you.

My only gripes with the game was the annoying autosave feature that cannot be turned off. With the option of F5 quick save I have no use of it and it occurred way to frequent causing a few seconds, which can only be described as a micro freeze. If it happened while fighting a horde or a big amount of ranged enemies it resulted in death for the mech most of the times. The map design could be better offering a globe layout of the map in the lines of what dyson space program does for example.

Overall I've enjoyed it, but I could've enjoyed it much more. There's a lot of potential here for post-launch content and rebalancing, that would make the game much more enjoyable.

I've encountered some stability and performance issues, especially when there is an active horde of creatures on the map, but I'll attribute those to me running the game on Linux. It did sour the experience for me, but that's the price I pay for playing games on Linux. I'll make a guess that this is less of an issue on Windows. No points deducted for this here, just a fair warning for others like me.

This game isn't perfect, and I started getting bored near to the end, though the game just managed to not outlast its welcome. The research in particular just takes a -lot- of time, and not for a very good reason, and a lot of it feels like padding. I'd much rather have preferred to pay some fixed resource cost, or have special requirements, for each research and wait a little bit, rather than just wait for an artificial timer to expire. At least it would've given me something more to do.

You also have absolutely no need to max out the research tree on Normal mode, as you'll be able to take on entire hordes of enemies just with your own weapons alone with no problems.

I haven't played on Hard on my playthrough - as the game heavily suggested to reserve Hard mode for a second playthrough, but honestly around the midgame I was already starting to steamroll the enemies, and the game didn't give nearly enough pressure, making me wish I'd chosen Hard instead - Normal isn't nearly challenging enough if you have experience playing similar survival base-building games.

The gore and environmental destruction effects are great! The graphics are pleasant and crisp. The creature designs don't really -feel- that unique or alien, but honestly it didn't bother me that much if I didn't think about it too much. The creatures do stand out enough from each other to be able to learn to quickly recognize them and remember their weaknesses.

This game won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy mowing down hordes of enemies with absurd arsenals and building impenetrable defenses and feeling safe and secure in your own little bunker - you'll enjoy this. I definitely recommend playing on Hard if you want a challenge.

Some form of co-op or multiplayer would've made this game so much more interesting, too. Maybe that'll come in a future update - I'll definitely want to give it a revisit then.",1635675215,1635675215,True,1,0,0.525139689445495605,0,True,False,False

However, my honest advice would be to wait a couple months before you buy and play. 

Why do I say that? Well, there were a few issues that took a chunks out of my enjoyment experience that I think will likely be addressed in the coming months. Minor spoiler alerts...

First off, at times the game felt like babysitting. Constant attacks came to the base for no reason, even though all the local nests and map were cleared out to completion. This distracted me from ever getting to enjoy the sandbox aspects of building the base. Sometimes I just had to turn the game off when another attack was on its way after I just finished defending one before...

Second downside (pretty major): my campaign was completely cut off from a mineral and so half the weapon tech tree was unavailable. I couldn't craft any of the top tier weapons and only a few second to the top tier. Basically all the fun ones were unavailable. I couldn't believe such a glaring mistake made it through release.

Third (another big drawback) you are supposed to be able to jump in between areas of you base using rift portals. I built them and tried absolutely everything I could think of to activate them or use them but never could. Such a thing should be very basic or at the least give some information or message for why its not operational. Step into it? Turn it on? Click on the minimap? Anything intuitive simply didn't work. And I refuse to google this one. It should be self evident.

Fourth, there were some pretty bad bugs. For one, switching through the user interface, oftentimes the information displayed was for the previous building. So it was at times impossible to know which building you were actually about to build unless you memorized it visually. Also, in order for the stats of the building to 'update' to the current actual building and not the prior one, you have to cntrl out of build mode then cntrl back in and click the building to see its stats etc. Very annoying and time consuming. There was also a horrible movement bug where the character was left auto running in one direction despite what directional keys you pressed. I'm not sure how that one made it past beta.. also, if you run while in build mode sometimes the character spins around rapidly..

Finally, the pacing of the game isn't quite right. So much time and energy getting resources and outposts and finally being able to get some gear and high level towers, only to have a final defense then end the game right when the ""end-game"" should be beginning. And the enemies all scale according to your power level so the sense of progression was never quite right. TBH I feel a bit cheated about not getting any Hazenite and being able to build top tier weapons. Maybe its randomized per playthrough? Who knows.

All in all, this is a good game but didn't quite land how it should have. I think if all the above were addressed it would be a great, fabulous game what I expected it to be.",1635668580,1635668580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really cool mix between base management and hero ability/crafting fighting. 

Replay ability is a bit stale for me though. I don't think ill get 100+ hours of this. Hopefully I'm proved wrong with updates or cheap DLC.

I think the Survival game could use a bit of work. I know you can edit the intensity but it feels like there isnt enough for anyone to leave it on ""limitless"" time.

With the price of this game, I would say it's on the line as to whether I would recommend it or not.  If money is tight, maybe wait for it to go on sale.  It's good, but it isn't great.  

It has a fun loop if you like these automation, tower defense, grindy games.  The graphics look good, it runs pretty well, the sound effects are good, and there seems to be a lot to research and craft.  It has a fantastic sandbox mode with tons of customizable settings. 
 However, the game doesn't seem very intuitive.  It has a menu system from the bowels of hell that is obviously meant for a controller.  You can key bind the sub-menus (and thank God for that), but not all the other keys actually rebind.  Keybinds should be a feature for EVERY PC game at launch.  It is inexcusable for that not to be perfect when you charge $40.

I could see myself getting bored quickly with this game.  It needs to hurry up and add coop.  I bet it will have a sort of Don't Starve Together gameplay loop at that point.  

The other really bad thing about this game is that the dialogue is absolute trash.  Your character is constantly yattering about how important it is not to kill creatures and strip mine the planet - all while she strip mines the planet for resources she can use to build things with which to kill creatures so the planet can be colonized.  Maybe a game where you get an achievement for cutting down all the foliage you see wasn't the best vehicle for a propaganda piece about ""living in harmony with nature.""  It comes across as contrived, hypocritical, and just annoying.  I miss the days when games were games.

Lots of weapons and mods to equip and experiment with. Lots of nice defense towers that are cool. The combat is chaotic in a good way. Difficulty really ramps up later in the game. Maps are nice, some more frustrating than others. Pretty fun to get your base working with different buildings that are not really worth the time investment in the end, but it's something to do. 

Could not finish the game thou since I placed the main plot building in such stupid place (way back just a couple of hours in to the game).

But by the time i beat it (~26hrs), i just didn't really want to play. Once i had some quiet moments where no quests were nagging at me, i realized, there wasn't really anything to do. I had no logistics to optimize (satisfactory), no vehicles to make (factorio), no new biomes to explore, no cool megastructures to make (e.g., Dyson), not even some game-breaking research that would make my bases impenetrable (e.g., factorio artillery trains with upgraded range and fire rate). There wasn't anything _fun_ to do, it was just quest after quest until you win.

The pacing is off, too. Once you're given a bunch of quests to do, it becomes clear that you're supposed to focus exclusively on the quests, and ignore the HQ. I wanted to stick around and build up, but it's pointless to do so because teching up is so much more impactful - and teching up requires completing quests to unlock nodes in the tech tree. Other times i'm forced to stick around and wait five real minutes for a building to finish before i can continue (i'm not joking when i say i hit ""build"" on a level 2 fusion plant, and went outside to put up halloween decorations while it did, because i had literally nothing else in the game to do).

Also the dialogue is aggressively bland. By the time i was done i actively hated hearing the voice actors. Yes, you can just turn it down to nothing, but some audio cues are actually useful (""a tower has been destroyed"" >.>), but most of them (""research queue is empty! Start more research!"") repeat too often, and between the dull writing and lifeless deliveries, are just disengaging. A bad voice actor would have been better than this.

There are really neat enemies and environments - the ever-growing yeast root in particular is probably the only thing that will truly stick with me about the game.

This game has a ton of potential but was obviously released before it was ready.

The developers seemed to spend a ton of time creating a great core gameplay, and then throw together a ""campaign"" at the end with repetitive, uninteresting missions and near zero explanation to the player as to how to proceed. 

The game lacks any sort of useful tutorial or manual to help you understand what all the buildings and tech is and how it works, which are pretty complex as there are dozens of research nodes that add new technologies to use. It might mention you have a new building that does something or other but not how to connect it to the proper inputs or where those inputs are on the map, or that you can't even obtain those resources now because you have to go complete some mission first.

The missions are repetitive but somehow also confusing if you don't pay attention to every line of dialogue (and there's a lot). The mission will have a single sentence stating your overall objective, but what steps you actually need to complete are not always clear and you find yourself stuck googling ""what to do in rift breaker acid yeast misssion.""  For example, it'll tell you to go to lava biome to and mine titanium. Well, you get to the lava biome and it's covered in red area  you can't build on. Turns out there is a building you can now build that ""creates"" cold areas you can build on.  Where did it tell you this? Probably in a single piece of dialog that scrolled past 15 minutes ago, and nothing else in the game tells you what to do except you need to mine titanium on this biome.

Or the map will bug out on you and make it unplayable, unless you  use a special console command to 'reset' the map (which again, is never mentioned in the game itself, this is a dev thing you have to read up on in forums).

The Discord is basically the only place right now to ask what and how to do things in the game since the developer has completely left that to the players to figure out and document. What's frustrating though is that in the feedback chat, the players there refuse to accept that the game has any flaws or needs better tutorials/guides for the average player. which is glaringly obvious to any competent reviewer.",1634426887,1635568080,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Feels a bit like it should still be early access- balancing weapons, some overpowered buildings and a slightly dodgy campaign system that rewards you for building huge, undefended resource outposts to feed your base then never visiting them again because they won't be attacked that way... 

The final mission bugged out and nothing spawned, so I just sat there waiting for a timer to run out and then the game ended.

Early game:  You have no resources, so you need to get some.  But you can't go far from your base as it isn't well defended and doesn't self maintain (you have to use the repair tool on EVERY BUILDING in the event of a meteor storm.  This takes up a lot of your time and prevents you from exploring.  This would be easy enough to progress past, if not for the game forcing you to go out, as it spawns nests and bosses in the world that spam you with mobs until you kill them.  But you can't fight them yet as your base explodes if left alone for 30 seconds, and your mech doesn't have enough defence or firepower.  Should you venture out, you will get insta killed upon encounter with your first heavy swarm.

The result of this, is an extreme amount of grind in the early game as you jump from base defence, to repair, to setting up mineral mining, establishing more power plants to accommodate the new support buildings... over and over.  Until you eventually get access to repair towers that can maintain your base for you.  Once these are installed, your early boring repetitive grind ends and you progress to the fun mid game.

Mid game:  Your base is self sustaining and able to hold off small waves on it's own.  Congrats!  Aside from occasional boss waves, you can now venture far from home and focus on turning your mech into a well tuned killing machine.  The hunt for resources will take you to regions and game maps where you can setup outposts for the purpose of gathering resources to send back home.  Research is also a big focus as it allows you to unlock better base defences, more efficient mineral extractors and new toys.  But don't take boss waves lightly, as heavy encounters still provide a challenge for basic defence towers and will need support, especially on waves initiated by an upgrade of your headquarters.

Late game:  Eventually you will have obtained a broad range of technologies and you no longer fear death, as your self repairing armored mech of doom can now cut through a wave of mini-bosses like they are tissue paper.  Your base can autonomously take down any boss wave without intervention as the lasers, artillery, flame throwers, plasma towers, rail guns, etc. all turn anything that dares to get close enough into a fine paste.  There is nowhere you can go, or anything you can do that presents any kind of challenge.  Base expansions feel easy and pointless, and only serve to push forward the absurd resource requirements needed of the main objective.  Welcome to the final grind toward victory.

outstanding graphics 
lush foliage
outstanding gameplay
massive number of enemies

Cons:
very demanding on GPU, but you can scale it down quite a lot.

Some events are very annoying (they damage your whole base slightly, only 2/16 types)

-It's lacking a lot of QoL content. A LOT.  Why do you have 3 different types of foundations? Just make it one and then when you research [spoiler] anti-acid buildings [/spoiler] then your normal foundations are upgraded.

 *You are uncapable of doing anything against the elements whatsoever, so if a [spoiler] meteor shower [/spoiler] happens for the 10th time, then the only thing you can do is  repair manually or putting repairing towers all over the place, 
WHY can't you just  research, for example, a SHIELD so [spoiler] meteors [/spoiler] aren't able to hurt you anymore. 

-Building is meh. You can't copy-paste, you can't make ""blueprints"", and you can't build straight because is pretty sensitive.
Also you can't destroy big boi rocks. Even with a [spoiler] nuclear weapon [/spoiler] so...

-Needing to keep pressing ""Alt"" so your buildings are built at max-level is bad, because if you try to move while doing that, you wont.

-Also has a problem when for some reason a ""key"" gets ""stucked"", and without you pressing anything, you will be moving  to a direction. And you need to ""fix"" this pressing the button again. A lot of games have this, but in this particular one happened to me really often.

-O god strike me if I can't share/transfer energy between parts of the same planet, but o boy resources are shared....
Also building an entire zone to have more max resources seems very clunky, upgrade the max capacity bois.

-Combat is not bad, but not good either, just shoot with a couple of weapons. Also defending is easy, mortar and railgun or minigun turrets seems to kill everything. But I liked it.

-Also theres not really any hint of what is the force that is coming to kill your base, so you can't meassure it correctly and over-commit to it, when 6 towers would have made it.

-""Carbon deposit depleted"" x10000 times...   e n d   m e

-If you made it this far, then i'll give you a hint that will probably get fixed: Resources are depleated, but if you put 100 miners in a zone, and they are not depleted, and you leave, they will keep producing to the infinity. Just don't visit the zone never again, because it will update it and will mark them as ""depleted"" and it wont generate any further.

Don't get me wrong, I completely recommend Riftbreaker to everyone. I got a solid 46 hours of enjoyment out of it, I can probably push it past 50 even. And the game has been incredibly fun during that time. However, that's my main issue. I am already at the point where I feel like I've done everything, seen everything, and there's no room for replayability or challenging myself, after ""just"" 46 hours. Maybe I'm just spoiled by games like Factorio, but I really was expecting to get at least double that time and get a replayable experience. And I feel like the game COULD be that, it could be greater than it is. It should be and it deserves to be.

If I were to summarize Riftbreaker with a single word, it would be ""Potential"". What is already there has created an excellent gameplay loop that is really fun to play. It took the best parts of the few genres like tower defence, factory building games, hack and slash, RTS, and combined them into a single package where they synergize beautifully. However, the game has a serious issue of staying power. It gives you an illusion of being vast and complex when you initially play it, but that facade quickly drops when you figure out that most decisions you can make do not matter, that you don't really need dozens of defence tower types, that you can brute force and cheese things very easily, and that the game really isn't difficult and complex enough to demand a lot of attention from you. There isn't also any reason to push anything past the limits, to try to make the biggest base possible, because there's no payout to it and it's not challenging at all to do in the first place.

If I were to give advice to the devs it would be this: You have created a game that has incredible potential. Everything you have in there is excellent already. You simply need to give players more reasons to keep playing it past the initial campaign and some survival games, make it an experience that is truly replayable. Here're some free ideas:

- Make aliens more threatening. Have them attack without warning so we have a reason to build defences outside of the big waves. Make them harder to kill with towers, right now it's way to easy to spam them and defend against everything.

- It's too easy to spam towers and defend everything. Make towers more expensive or put harsher limits on their quantity so you don't just make walls of them that defend against everything. Basically: find a way to prevent us from spamming them easily.

- Campaign mode needs to be way more difficult and challenging, please add a way to make it as harsh as the hardest survival, so you really have to try to stay alive.

- It's easy to cheese the game by going to different maps, setting up production on them and then returning to HQ. You can basically expand and gain new resources while nothing is happening. I don't know how this can be solved honestly, it's also a cool part of the game that I don't want to see gone. Nevertheless, it enables you to cheese the game easily.

There's definitely more, but I'll keep it short. To summarize, Riftbreaker is an excellent game in it's current state. But it could be SO MUCH more than that, it could easily rival the very games it got inspired by, it just needs more reasons for us to keep playing it.",1635510702,1635510702,True,5,0,0.536362528800964355,0,True,False,False

There is huge variety in the method within which you play, focusing on your character (Mech) itself or the bases you build. You can opt for melee, ranged, a huge variety of weapons for both, or mix both, one in each hand or dual-wielding. Then there is equipment and abilities. Huge variety. Huge replayability. Very enjoyable.

Graphics 9/10 - (Simply gorgeous. From the weather to the environments to the bioluminescent creatures. Everything has a Starcraft 2 sort of themed art-style but its own unique spin)

Audio - 7/10 - (Some more variety in a select few areas could use improvement, but what is there is good. The music is decent but fairly forgettable and doesnt stand out. Melee is extremely impactful. Guns sound powerful. Explosions are a bit mild but the other miscellaneous sounds, from construction to the creatures is excellent)

Gameplay - 8/10 - (A wonderful mix of genres blended excellently. There are some cheese strategies or ways that you can be stonewalled but they are extremely hard to come by or otherwise you have the option not to. There is a huge variety of environments and random RNG events that occur, creature attack waves, things to research and upgrade, loot to find or craft like in Diablo and unique things to discover on your own)

Replayability - 10/10 - (I have played the game from start to finish on every difficulty, Easy, Normal, Hard and Brutal. It is simply fun and there are different ways to go about your business and building your base(s) from map to map, mission to mission and ""quest"" to ""quest"")

Technical Support / Bugs - 8/10 - (I have only encountered a very rare, select few bugs. None of them game breaking. The game can slow down quite a bit regardless of your computer specs when several thousand enemies are on screen at once, or if you have built-up the ENTIRE map, but that is to be expected and not needed even on Brutal difficulty)

Once you've beaten the game the first time you do know what to expect, but there may be entire branches of the research tree you hadnt seen before or if you simply enjoy the core gameplay loop, there is much fun to be had.",1635498213,1635498375,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It should be noted that the game enters serious slow-mo when there's a ton of enemies on the field, particularly on the final waves of a given map.  

It's got this nostalgic charm that reminds me of the days of when games were tailor-made to know exactly what it wants to be and does that extremely well.

The main issues I noticed with the game are the occasional inconsistent voice line as well as some mechanics simply going unexplained outside of random loading tooltips; for example, I had no idea I could automatically build the highest-level version of a structure immediately by holding ALT until I was like 3/4 of the way through the campaign.  

I also take issue with the difficulty of the game; I found the campaign to be trivially easy on Normal, but Survival is *extremely* tough, even on Normal, possibly because the campaign taught me bad habits without really explaining how many counters work or why.  

Anyway, I'm really happy for the devs for their success and wish them luck with future updates and managing this community that blew up seemingly overnight.",1635392341,1635447270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update: after finishing it I would say it is not as much of a Tower Defence as I would like, there are not a lot of narrow passages like in They Are Billions to really defend with towers so you more likely to fight the monsters yourself most of the time, but the free portals system where you can be in almost any point on the map instantly is making this easy. Nevertheless I was expecting more of TD action but it was still fun. I would like for developers to tweak the world generator so it would create more choke points so you would have like 4-5 points from which the monsters will come and you can fortify there and nerf the damage of main character, also ,make waves more frequent so there is a constant threat.

1. too many bugs, like i am still playing beta ,  i don't want to mention each of the bugs i encounter, only 2 most annoying bugs  

a. can't unequip the stealth mod which make me stealth forever and no one attack me but my base. no matter you restart the game, change map unequip the equipment . i don't have the save and i can't reload the game to its normal

b. the visual glitch that make you don't know if the power line is connected . make many building no power and you have no idea why

2.survival mode is totally unfun to play. i don't understand why they make it so bad. i finish the game on normal and brutal in campaign. the difficulties balance on campaign is fine. but survival  mode only feel normal like playing on a difficulties more than brutal

 you won't have time to level up and download the schematics within an hour to level 3(max level is 7). but you need to fight the enemies require some powerful weapon and towers. and it is not easy to level up because it require large amount of resources . and enemies will attack you constantly within a short a mount of time. they increase strength and number of each attack.

the map design is random generate map. there is no terrain advantage . unlike any RTS game. you always face enemies on 4 sides. the low level tower/base can't do their job properly . you need to build large amount of them to do it. which make things repetitive.

i don't know if the survival  need you to be a RTS expert or champion on starcraft in order to play on normal . 

3.campaign mission is repetitive . always find element X > search it > farm 
repetitive generate same sub mission that constantly attack your base etc

4. weather is fxcking annoying. i mean i get it. you want to make the weather system feel important 
but who can live on a planet that do meter strike, earthquake, tornado , ion storm ,toxic gas emission etc that happen every few minutes(the in game time may be per day for these few minutes)

some weather that damage your base make repair job frustrated , you spam your repair on the large base , REPAIR1 BY 1 (there is auto repair build , but it cover small area and require rare resource), and more important is the power line node or tube connection , you need to repair them feel annoying and unfun

5. lack of depth . unlike xmorph defense. that game is master piece .i know they are 2 different game can't compare but something in depth . 
this game lack of the element that can dick in. xmorph get the depth about you can route the enemies on different path , using different combination of towers . so each map you can retry and play better.

but this game you can't. you know which weapon is powerful use it, spam tower, wall. pressing left and right mouse button , you win. 

6. instruction on campaign on certain mission to progress is very bad. 
eg a. research a ""stable floor"" that can build on sand, how??? no sub mission to tell you
i even get to the highest level of the technology and still don't finish that mission for my first gameplay

b. this is the tutorial mission .we can farm the plant to get the element. you need to select the corresponding plant inside the building or you stuck the mission forever because it automatic  try to make the default plant.  

i don't recommend this game at this moments, at least the bug you need to fix it. i am not your beta tester",1635406304,1635424716,False,4,0,0.512773215770721436,0,True,False,False

Think; top down hack and slash meets Satisfactory-like sandbox base building, only this game is very accessible and more beginner friendly in the campaign than many other similar games. The game has decent complexity, but is not overwhelmingly complex and you will have ample time for trial and error. 

The periodically attacking alien hordes keep you engaged in the gameplay and provide a welcome break from near-endless base expansion (the admittedly large campaign map is still finite). Enemy variety is decent, although there are also quite a few recolored enemies that are merely buffed or larger versions of familiar enemies. The horde defense approach to combat however greatly diminishes the issue of average enemy variety, as it doesn't really matter if the 2000 enemy models you mow down consist of 8 different enemy models or 16, given that the 8 models are all truly different archetypes, designs and sizes of enemies. Your main gameplay variety comes from your Mech (your controlled character) customization and an endless pursuit of base and production optimization. Customization consist of weapon, equipment and gadget choices and a choice of movement skill. All of these are subject to a strait forward crafting system, with the familiar color-graded quality ratings. - The stronger the item, the more resources it costs. The game's campaign is fully voice acted with commendable quality, which gives it that extra charm it needs to keep you interested through out the 30 hours or so of content. 30 Hours, If you go for the main objectives efficiently and leave the sandbox building and borderline-obsessive base expansion and optimization for later. Personally it took me 40 hours to complete the campaign on just the second-highest difficulty, and I still left A LOT OF OPTIMIZATION undone. My only real complaint is that the all of the storage building's capacities are way too low, resulting in game-engine/fps-straining warehouse complexes even Bezos can only ream of. 8.5/10 Will play again, definitely worth the 40€ it cost, perhaps worth even more.",1635411710,1635411710,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Criticism:
the UI is somewhat ugly and the build menu could be simplified, especially the editing tools.
story, writing and voiceacting wasnt really taken serious, it doesnt feel like the life&death situation we are faced with is real, it sounds a lot more like the characters on an emotional level know its just all a video game, so don't expect too much from the story except for some blunt exposition and really superficial worldbuilding.

Praise:
The combat just feels so good and looks so nice, everything has weight to it, its very physical.
additionally the game runs really smoothy even on my almost a decade old hardware and looks great while doing so (in 4k resolution btw) really nice job by the devs. 
I also like how the campaign is completely seamless, everything happens on one huge map that you freely explore and build 
mining bases on to connect with teleporters for fast travel when the innevitable horde attacks appear.

Finishing thoughts: 
I am not sure how much time we can sink into the game before we have seen it all, I imagine the campaign has replayabillity just from trying the really high difficulties and trying other loadouts/research trees. The coop is also being worked on so once that drops it adds even more replayabillity if they put even higher difficulties and challenges to overcome to match the power of cooperating players.

+ many possibilities to eliminate fauna on the planet

+ very good mix of base building and real time action

- The campaign has a bit of a problem with balancing difficulty
- minor technical bugs

Riftbreaker is a realtime action combined with base building. Player goal is to open a portal on the planet Galatea 37 for colonization from Earth. Through an operator in the mech with her own intelligence, draws resources, builds a base and fights against increasingly demanding hordes of enemies in the form of fauna living on the planet in various biomes. There are a number of weapons available for mech from melee to grenade launchers. Weapons use different types of ammunition that need to be produced, they can be modified and they have different effectiveness against different types of animals. It is also possible to build various defensive buildings of your base, they also have their ammunition supplies and can be modified. Even the utility buildings within the base are a large number for various purposes such as sourcing and transformation of resources, production and research. The UI for building is handy and can be handled well and quickly for a few small details.
The game is a bit unbalanced in the difficulty and usability of some weapons and buildings.
The hordes of enemies, especially at the end of the campaign, are really big, but the game manages them, and except for small bugs, I didn't have any significant problems.
The gameplay is addictive , later it falls a bit into a stereotype, but that's normal in this genre.

Story is not really important, but dialogues between main character and her AI are ok, I enjoyed them and voice acting as well.

From the space marine like feel of stomping through the wildlife, to the almost seamless transition to building and a robust tech tree. You can tell that the developers focused on game play. This game is well polished, fun, and worth the price.

The bad;

Primarily the difficulty. I found the brutal difficulty campaign to be laughably easy.. The way I played the campaign seemed to break some of the triggers. I didn't bother going to the next maps, past cobalt, until the tech tree was completed.  I think that the attacks are scripted to be based on mission objective completion and not tech tree completion, which leads to a huge difficulty imbalance for people like me who build the base first and worry about the mission later. There was zero pressure to prioritize research as the beginning defenses held me the entire game.  The survival mode suffers from the opposite problem in that you are time prohibited from progressing very far into the tech tree, again basic defenses are adequate.  You can beat the easy survival with a power fist and grenade launcher.

Leading into the next complaint. The unique premise for the story is absolutely wasted. The first quarter and half were a slow burn consisting of good build up with adequate character development. The banter between Riggs and Ashley, while annoying at times, was done fairly well. However this tapers off sharply in the later half of the game. When you reach the volcanic area and begin discovering the weirdness about Galatea 37 [spoiler] Mr. Riggs appears to be hijacked by an alien intelligence, while a cliche trope, was actually really interesting EXCEPT that it was never mentioned again.[/spoiler] 

Also don't get me started on the ending: [spoiler] What an absolute travesty of an ending. The entire game is revolved around one moment, opening the rift, and then you are treated to a really lackluster performance from Ashley. Who doubts and reassures herself in a single sentence with a deadpan voice shortly before the extremely weak final wave. Once you chose to enter the portal you are treated to a weak voice over slideshow of irrelevant art and an NES style ""game over, You're hero"". It's so bad from a game that's otherwise so good. I was disappointed to say the least. The better ending is choosing to let the portal collapse, except that their are no further missions other than those of self motivation/achievement hunting. [/spoiler]

Plant plants need to be balanced or just straight up nerfed - hard. I had a full 1.2m uranium, titanium, cobalt, gems, and everything from roughly 20 plant plants. I didn't even bother to mine the other maps except to satisfy mission objectives. The plant matter was easily refined into gas and I had infinite power before even realizing that uranium was in the game. I never built nuclear power. I never realized that I could upgrade pumps, or gas refineries, or any of those auxiliary buildings because I simply didn't need to, all on the hardest difficulty mind you.

One of the best mechanics was requiring water for the plant plants and supercharged plasma for the nuclear weapon tower. Actually having to physically supply ammo to towers drastically changes the mechanics of the game and I would have loved to see more of that. I would have also liked to see more production chains. As it stands it's basically just slap down buildings and then your resources are magically teleported to where-ever you need them. It would have been really cool to need to supply flammable liquid to the flame towers. I really hope the devs expand on this in future updates.

In summary; This game is fun, but it could have been so much more. I would have loved to have a more impossible odds scenario such as in They Are Billions, or more production chains such as in factory games.

The game is okay, but only okay. The Campaign is fun for a while but lots of rare resource ""Missions"" basically the same thing repeated for a different resource. In the end the use of the Rift map travel system is limited to a few maps and that's it. Overall that campaign isn't very long.

Survival mode is just a timed game mode on one map that doesn't use the Rift map system at all, but the building that allows it can be built, doing nothing. So not meant for long games.

So once you do the campaign once I don't see much replayability, sure the maps are procedural generated but you limited to a set number of maps each time, with like I said before lots of missions being rinse & repeat, dealing with the same dialogue over and over, and force to do them every play though to unlock certain techs. If the game had a true survival Freeplay mode/Infinite mode that let you use the Map rift system like the campaign and the research system but without the missions/dialogue, and didn't limit you to a specific number of maps to visit to search for resources I'd enjoy that. 

But right now I doesn't feel like $30 dollars worth with other games that allow a true free play/infinite mode out there. Makes me regret buying the game before I read and watched more reviews, but I don't use the refund system, at least not till I find a truly broken game.

All-in-all, Riftbreaker is a lighter than most automation games, but it also has a solid combat system that's fun and satisfying to play.  There are games with better action, games with better tower defense, and games with better base-building/automation.  But Riftbreaker manages to straddle all these genres beautifully, taking some core gameplay from each while ignoring the parts that would drag down the hybrid approach.

I started playing on release day and ran into some periodic crashes every few hours, the error box helpfully suggested I could disable ray-tracing in the options menu.  The game looked ever-so-slightly not as good, but also jumped up a few dozen fps (from 60+ to solid 100) and stopped crashing completely.  I know some of the recent patches were intended to address the crashes I had, but I haven't bothered to flip the settings back on to check and see.
[hr][/hr]
I enjoy the [i]idea[/i] of automation and crafting games, but I rarely have the time and attention to actually play them properly.  Riftbreaker turned out to be exactly the right balance for me to really enjoy.  A lot of the quality-of-life features like ammo getting put where it needs to be, resources being shifted around the maps, etc. are all automatic and default.  I didn't have to play 20 hours of the game before my ammo production would be brought to me, once I plunked down an ammo factory your weapons will be reloaded over time while you explore and fight.

Similarly, Riftbreaker's base building is so painless compared to most automation games.  Since there's no conveyor systems to worry about (except for liquid resources), you don't find yourself punished when, some countless hours into the game you research a new type of factory that requires a different arrangement to use.  This meant that [i]I could just play the game, research as I went, and never hit a point where I unlocked something new and had to spend the next several hours rebuilding large chunks of my infrastructure[/i].  I didn't need to already know what the tech tree was going to give me later on before doing my base layout.  This has killed my interest in more than one base-building/automation game, so I was really happy that I never hit that wall in Riftbreaker.",1635300406,1635300406,True,27,1,0.758328855037689209,0,True,False,False

This scratches my RTS, Tower Defense, Hack and Slash and even Factorio itch, all at the same time.
Simple to understand systems, easy to understand enemy types. This game is surprisingly well made.
It suffers from the fact that the engine is made for a smaller scale wave defense game from a couple of years ago, and in this game its weakness is showing.
No matter what rig you're running, if you build too much on one map, your FPS will drop heavily, I’m talking below 10 in some places. If you upgrade lots of buildings at the same time, or sell too many at the same time, the animations are apparently rendered individually even if it's all the same animation. At one point it gotten so bad that the game just crashed because I just spammed the upgrade option on a large cluster of solar panels when I unlocked the second level of upgrade.
The voice acting is OKAY, but it can get very annoying as the same lines are repeated over and over again, reminding you to build more storage, or commenting about natural disasters of phenomenon that happen on this planet over its different biomes.
You are also encouraged to explore different biomes to get the later game resource type, but around mid-game you will unlock the cultivator that will allow you to just grow any resource on the first biome, just need to research the handling of that resource and boom, you can grow Uranium crystals in the jungle where there is not Uranium, same goes for Titanium and all other rare resources, so scan every plant on every biome, or just cut them down for DNA points to increase familiarity in the games almanac to raise the percentage of resources you get from them.
This game needs work, but it's on the engine itself, so it's best to build out your base and actually establish more than one base, build between biomes, as you are only attacked in waves on the main biome and other large mining outpost biomes, but you don't get waves on exploration missions, so you can drop all your storage buildings and ammo crafting buildings on these biomes as they are connected to all biomes and these little biomes won't get attacked, which will save you from reaching 10 fps hell by the end game.",1634721569,1635275591,True,1,0,0.507575750350952148,0,True,False,False

The game has only two modes for now. Campaign and Survival.

Campaign is just one (huge) story mission. It will take you around 20 hours to finish. Instead of different missions/levels, you have one long one, which takes you to different biomes and establishing several outpost bases, while still returning to your main one.

Survival works a bit differently than you might probably expect. It’s actually a 60 or 90 minutes long mission, with a single goal. Surviving and making it over the last wave of enemies. It’s actually very hard – much much harder than the campaign and it might keep you busy for a while. There are different options for difficulties, biomes, etc …

However, after you beat these two modes, there aren’t much more content to keep you occupied. Which is fine. Still absolutely worth a buy.

It looks great, runs well, controls fine, and is overall a quality game. But every time I close it, I'm aggravated.

Building is kept simple so that combat can have more focus, but it means building is unsatisfying and combat is an annoying interruption. 

The random events are even worse - half of them are random damage in an area/the entire map for 30-60 seconds. There is no auto-repair function. One hailstorm left me having to repair every power connector on the map - or risk a second hailstorm completely disconnecting my power, everywhere.

Random attacks are a huge nuisance, and there seems to be no way to avert them besides simply not being in that base at all. Which is backwards. So you're constantly jumping to new areas just to avoid doing the tower-defense part of the game because of how long it takes. I'm playing on Normal - it's not really difficult or threatening, but letting the monsters be will frequently end up with breakthroughs.

A lot of this game felt like waiting around and hoping monsters didn't decide to attack something, somewhere. I even restarted the campaign to game the system some, and even with that, there's just not enough to motivate me to jump to another random-gen map to dig up more random-gen minerals.
 
I may come back to this game in a few months, and see what feedback can do to change it, but at the moment I can't recommend it.

I've had a blast in the short time it's been out. There are a few QoL things I'd love to see in the future, but overall the content it there, and it's fun to play. Replay value somewhat exists, but after your 2nd or 3rd campaign you might be stuck mostly with survival.

My Praises:

- Factorio (Super) lite: There are production lines, there is liquid, but logistics are not a thing besides pipes which imo is OK! You don't need to worry about how to move resources from map to map, etc.
- Combat: This is the part that makes up for the logistics, base defense can be intense and maps are usually pretty action packed
- Tech: The tech tree is pretty huge, and the amount of modification you can apply to your mech suite is awesome.
- Exploration isn't boring: Going around scanning everything you can to unlock tech tree branches, or just to figure out weaknesses to mobs, I love it
- Upgrading is never a burden: Resources never get consumed more than what you're initially told, while to me I love this others might find this to make the game to easy. I just enjoy not having to worry about my production lines if I am about to do a series of upgrades.
- Biome Variety is fun: While the biomes are limited, what's there is pretty cool, and fun to play on.
- It runs pretty great: While I for sure see slow down during gigantic hordes and raids, I haven't noticed much of anything else outside of that

My Wishes:

- QoL: This is also avoidable if you're just careful or don't care, but I wish stuff like line locking when you're dragging and drawing building was a thing, can't tell you how many times I've had to destruct and reconstruct a row of solar panels/wind turbines, also hotkeys to cycle the build menu would be great!
- Pipes: Please let me have underground pipes like in factorio these things are the main reason my base is always a mess, trying to use artillery + shields  = makes life kind of annoying
- Being able to turn off dialog after the first campaign run would be nice

My complaints:

- Enemies: While overall combat is great I'm going to be a little nit picky in how I wish waves were more spread out, so instead of a corner of my base being nothing but towers, I would have multiple front lines, etc. While this is a thing it seems more often then not waves pile onto a single location of your base

It really is like a combat-focused factorio without any logistics, until you get to fluids. 

Biggest issue with the game right now is that despite being able to teleport everything anywhere in the local map, liquids and power are the exemptions.  
Research cannot be scaled up like in factorio or dyson sphere, so it's strongly time-gated, although exploring/exterminating/exploiting/expand does fill that downtime quite well.  you cannot throw more resources at research and make it go faster.

Edit: After finishing the campaign on normal and hard mode at 67 hours, game is still good, but minor issues and flaws start to appear. 

The freedom the game gives you allows for some weird situations and ""power-levelling"" your gear, or it might just be me and maxing out the research tree before going on any expeditions. 


Research can actually be scaled up but not to the scale of factorio or dyson sphere. 2 types of research stations with a build limit restricted by the tier of your main hub.

The issue is not the gameplay other than the somewhat numerous amount of bugs and kinks that need to be ironed out, and lacking difficulty, but also the content itself. The gameplay is fun as is but will get repetitive quickly as the campaign doesn't seem to be very long and the quality is just ok. It mostly seems to function as an extended tutorial... but, unfortunately, it feels like it's for nothing. The game feels like it's missing a major game mode in between campaign and survival, as most games like this have difficult mission-based campaigns this has nothing of the sort, you have an end goal and side missions but other than that it is mostly open-ended. You can chose different locations for bases but your other bases seem to never get attacked unless you're there seriously diminishing the threat & strategy of surviving on an alien world. The other biomes are not all too different other than offering different resources, slightly different requirements (place a special floor tile or tower down) and buildings to get such resources. Apart from that all of the biomes play the same which contributes to that sense of tedium. I played on Hard to learn the game but I wish I played on Brutal as that may at least partially provide some of the challenge I would like to seek from this game. There also isn't any multiplayer function which could make the experience all the more better. Otherwise, the graphics are beautiful, the art style clean and nice, the characters and story are not very important and can get a little annoying sometimes, but other than that it has serious potential for being one of the best new indie games out there right now.",1635186320,1635186735,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Games like Earth 2160 (the only game with a tech tree that let you customize your weapons based on your enemy), Supreme Commander, Factorio and even Diablo are seamlessly combined in the best strategy building game available now.

This game is second to none in this year and in it's combined genre if we take all the game released in the past 10 to 15 years. Just buy and play this game if you haven't already!

+ GRAPHICS = Graphics are superior considering this is developed by indie studio. I'm pretty sure most of today's machines can run this game on medium to max settings without compromising frame rate. On max settings with RTX settings the game looks really good.

+ CONTENT = Campaign is super fun and takes you through multiple biomes that teach different mechanics unique to the biome. Progression feels good and steady. If you want, you can stretch the campaign almost indefinitely  for many hours of enjoyment. Many others say you can beat the campaign in 20-40 hours if you rush it. Survival mode is an adrenaline rush with fast-paced action almost constantly. It is difficult.

+ DEVS = Devs seem to communicate frequently and provide patch updates routinely. They quickly become aware of bugs and try to resolve them.

- LACK Of CO-OP = Devs said they are working on it. May take 6-12 months to complete. If they follow-through this game will become a long lasting game.

Some things that I find annoying: 
- Hailstorms. If you want to build a large base, you will have to spam Repair Tower that should cover everything including the power nodes. At least, it would be nice if the areas of all existing Repair Towers become visible once you want to build another one. 
- Power management. Spamming the heck out of wind turbines/ solar panels/ energy reserves becomes annoying at some point (especially when you also have to set outposts since the power from the main base does not transfer to the outposts ...it would be really nice tho!!!). Also, from my experience you are given two choices: build a large expanding base and connect everything via power nodes which have to be covered by repair towers due to hailstorms (ah, the joy...) or build separate mini bases where, for each, you spam the energy structures (and walls, and tower sets like sentinel + artillery + sensor + repair) ...kinda repetitive no matter what and kills a bit the fun aspects of the game on which the focus should be ... 
- Large meteor strike when it hits part of my base. This becomes more and more likely if you want to set a large main base (maybe that's not the optimal way to play the game, but it would suck if there'd be only one way to play the game). Thanks for the resource drop, tho Q_Q

Features I'd really like to see: 
- COOP;
- More planets and races of monsters;
- Better ways to handle the hailstorm and power buildings spam. I think the game should be more focused on fighting/ defending/ exploring the area rather than spamming big sets of buildings in multiple zones.
- More skins (not necessarily other mech suites, maybe something more diverse like a tank look like or something) :)

It's the devil in the details as they say. My two major complaints are firstly that unlike every other strategy game I have ever played, rather than increasingly complex scenarios you are basically presented with one giant scenario. Your main base always remains the same, which means it quickly becomes clunky and disorganized. So I simply tried to start a new more efficiently built base, only to find out I couldn't move my command center? So now I have the most awkward base that just keeps growing in weird directions as resources quickly diminish and hostile attacks increase at an alarming rate. This aspect isn't fun, it's stressful.

And secondly my biggest issue is this game's greatest flaw, the power distribution. You have all these wonderful and interesting ways to produce colossal, and necessary, amounts of power. Each dependent on the smallest most weak and defenseless power node that I have ever seen. You can build all the turrets in the world, and one stray acid splash can knock out all the power to each of them. Tornado? Meteor storm? Acid rain? Say goodbye to the power grid you spent ages setting up. It means you have to baby and micromanage every INCH of your base, which is already unwieldy. Again, it's a mechanic that is probably meant to serve a purpose, but is ultimately frustrating.

And there are just SO. MANY. RESOURCES. and you need SOOOO MANY. One game took me about THIRTY HOURS. That's insane.

There is a LOT to love about this game. But by the time I got to the end my thoughts were FINALLY I CAN STOP PLAYING more than anything else, and that's not what you want to think at the end of a game.",1635149207,1635149207,False,4,0,0.544672489166259766,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for a challenge or a casual base builder, this game offers both.  The stunning graphics, engaging combat, various maps, and hours of enjoyment will eat hours of your life.

The campaign is fun and has a great pace for all difficulties.  Base building is traditional, but the exploring is where I had fun.  Combat embraces mixed hordes bringing along different weakness, so don't corner your self and try different weapons.  Don't forget to add mods!

Survival is broken.  Even on easy I was given difficult hordes.  In one run I was attack by Rock giants and I had just started.  In short, since my base was a level 1 it was not possible to defend it.  For now, I recommend steering clear since that wasn't given in any QC.

UPDATE:  October patches cleared up a lot of the crashing and DX12 issues, but they still occur.  

So far, the game crashed once while playing and a few times when starting up.  I didn't lose any saved data and the game worked after re-launching, so hopefully a patch will be out soon.  In game, there are a few bugs that keep random events from producing content, but for the most part nothing major. UPDATED: The locked camera was a bad idea.

The combat part is like a Starcraft2 hero mission where you can customize your own weapons and abilities. Enemy variety really encourages you to use different weapons for different situations because there are damage types, weaknesses, and resistances. 

The base building part is like Factorio but without all the conveyor belt madness. Your materials simply magically appear in the storage when gathered and are magically consumed when used. The power management and the liquid handling lean more towards traditional factory building. To process liquid you need pipe logistics for it to work but the building input/output ratio are usually just 1:1 or 2:3 and there are only 1-2 layers in the manufacturing line to reach end products (either power or tower fuel). So it's very easy to build an efficient production line. All the simplification on the logistic side is for you to have more time to focus on your defense. There are many different tower types and special towers may require special fuels. However, each tower type feels unique and they feel powerful when firing. 

The campaign mode is a relaxing mode that you can play at your own pace. The difficulty only goes up once you complete an objective. The survival mode is more like an RTS where you have to spend your time doing the most efficient actions given the resource you have because the enemies get stronger every wave.

While at first glance it might look like a game in the same vein as Factorio, and other reviewers might claim as much, they are mistaken. Factorio is a game based around logistics - not only finding and exploiting resources, but figuring out how to get each and every unique resource to its destination is the entire gameplay loop.

This is more like ""They are Billions"" or, more broadly, a Base Building RTS. Resources are dug up by automated machines and the resources directly teleported into your inventory. There is no ""Get the Iron from this part of the map to this factory to make plates to make bullets to make aliens go splat."" This game cuts out that entire section and boils it down to ""Get iron. Your towers make aliens go splat now, congrats.""

This is both a great strength and terrible weakness. 

Yes, it cuts out the fiddly spaghetti from Factorio and similar games and lets you just get to the base building... but also, it cuts out the fiddle spaghetti from Factorio and other similar games and leaves you left with only plastering buildings everywhere.

Meaning that, once you realise that you can literally just place endless lines of Wind Turbines for practically free anywhere you want at any time with no effort, the game literally becomes ""I need more Iron. I shall walk to this iron node, put down ten turbines, put down the iron mines, and never think of this again.""

After the first hour, you will have so many resources - and soon will gain the ability to print resources out of nothing more than pure energy, which i remind, can be produced infinitely, for free, easily, by simply throwing down 500 wind turbines - that the game instantly ceases all challenge. 

Aliens attacking? Place down thirty towers. Doesnt really matter what type, aliens go splat if you shoot em enough. Need more power? Find the nearest open area, start placing wind turbines or solar panels. Gotta go colonise a new area of the map? Well, since your resource pool is universal, place down some turbines and a wall and youre set.

In fact, while the game took around 17 hours for me to ""Beat"", i could have easily done it in 10. I made sure to max out all the research trees, build at least one self-replenishing chain of each and every resource in the game and then spent the last two hours covering every square inch of my homebase map in Landmines just because i thought it was funny.

So why do i recommend? Cause, as i said, there is also a great strength in this idea.

There is never any doubt that it makes my brain make the happy chemical when i finally reach a goal. When i get 100 iron a second without power issues, when i start getting the new ore in enough numbers to never have to worry about it, when i unlock the best minigun in the game, when a alien swarm, thousands of bugs large, runs up against the walls and turrests of my fort and turns into so much purple goop? All those give me happy chemicals. 

If you are seeking another game which gives you happy chemicals for making little effort in building a base, this would work for you. 

Its nowhere near the new factorio, or supreme commander, or what have you.

Its a solid, reasonably priced indie hit that you should keep an eye on. Who knows, if this sells enough, they might make ""The Riftbreaker 2"", and perhaps, just perhaps, theyll iterate on what they have here and make a solid game into an excellent one.",1635127699,1635127699,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starting up, you have two game modes; Campaign and Survival. The fault entirely being on me, I was expecting more variety to it and at first 'settled' for the campaign.

The voice acting and dialogue is the absolute worst. It is a clear attempt to make a shallow RPG aspect seem more robust, but I honestly just turned off all volume and watched Silicon Valley while playing. Which is a bit annoying, because 5 words in the dialogue actually tell you what you need to do next and its always up in the air on when to pay attention. 

Gameplay though, I'd describe it as the best tower defense game you've ever played, meets Red Alert, meets Factorio. Game play is beyond addicting, the different biomes provide actual variety and actual challenge, outposts create the sense you're actually having to teraform/colonize and entire world rather than just a map, and last but not least:

Great game, until you run into a bug where you have to go to an area to scan a certain amount of plants that don't spawn. This grinds your progress to a complete stop. You cannot continue because this mission unlocks a very important material that is needed for many building upgrades, the production of other resources, and is one of three materials needed to build the final building to complete the campaign.

Another problem I have is this giant snail looking enemy that hurls explosive balls of corrosive damage. These things practically nuke your base from a distance that even your long range artillery defense towers can't hit. If this enemy isn't eliminated soon after it spawns, it will decimate even the highest level defenses, leaving the rest of your base exposed to destruction by swarm. 

And finally, enemy types from other areas of the planet will just magically appear in the swarm attacks at your main headquarters. I cannot tell if this is supposed to happen or not.

The reason why I am not recommending it at the moment, is that while there are tons of small bugs, there are also quite a few that soft-lock progress completely. There are missions where if you're unlucky, the things you need to progress won't spawn in large enough numbers to progress. In another mission, the objective is bugged and when it says you need to use a certain building, it's actually working only with specifically a level 1 building, any other will just never check the objective. And there are many other similar issues.

On top of that, the game crashes fairly often, it happened to me 4-5 times while playing normally, and whenever my computer went to sleep and I came back, the game crashed on arrival. The game only keeps 3 auto saves for some reason, and the best it can do is one auto save every 5 minutes. I wish it could be one every minute and would let you keep as many saves as you want, I'm not lacking storage space but I'm lacking patience to redo the same things over and over.

Anyway, my conclusion is, this game could be tons of fun if the bugs were fixed and the game was guaranteed softlock-free. When that happens, I'll probably restart a new game from scratch and change this review to a positive one!

EDIT: I waited after a handful of patches that fixed some of my concerns, and while indeed some of the potential soft locks have been fixed, and I've managed to reach the last objective of the campaign, the game unfortunately won't let me load my saves anymore so I can't play anymore. I assume it could be related to the thousands of buildings, tens of thousands of mines and thousands of bots I have flying around on the map, maybe my save file got too big.

There is jank, and the game could use some quality of life improvements like managing pipes through your base, but overall, the blend of gamestyles works really well.

The game is a mixture of base building, very light twin-stick shooter and tower defense. You go around exploring the maps, mining resources, building and upgrading, and sometimes there are waves that attack your base.

They can come from any direction from the border of the map and I think always go to the closest building, so after a while you learn to manage (and even “cheat”) a little. There are both random attacks and ones triggered by milestones like completing objectives or upgrading your headquarters.

The Campaign is more “relaxed” in terms of timing. In the beginning you probably struggle with the first attack waves but after a while you can go at your own pace, building, researching, upgrading and jumping between maps to manage your outposts.

Because of that it’s hard to estimate the length of the game. I think you can probably rush it to maybe… I don’t know, 15-20 hours? I took my time and finished it in about 30 hours.

Survival mode is a different beast. Here you have a timer (little more than an hour) and it’s way harder because you have to really rush. Can’t really comment much on it as I only played very little.",1635101274,1635101765,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Campaign: You and your faithful mech trying to colonize a new planet, story mostly showing you ropes with some attacks here and there and some flavor of lore, you can build several bases (outpost) and every new map you visit you will learn more about planet, obtain new resource types and new ways to defend base. It's basically advanced tutorial holding your hand till the end game and teaching you how to play. 

Survival: True chad mode at hardest difficulty, keeps you punch till you fall then when you barely survive it smiles saying well done and smash you harder and harder. Unlike campaign you know all resource types and have 1 hours to complete your objective. Every wave will be more advanced and deadly than others which will push you the very limit. Like TAB, it have several map types requires you to complete former one to unlock.

Random Survival: You can decide how frequent you will get attacked by waves, map size and objective time. If you want to open all of your tech and tackle the whole planet head to head this is for you.

Plus and minus:
+It's a very good hybrid, unlike TAB your mech matters and you can be deathstorm with your heavy arsenal annihilating thousands of enemies within a minute which is incredibly satisfying and unlike factorio and other similar management games you can test your base against brutal attacks. 
+Mech combat is really good, you can craft weapons with some static and some random stats which adds flavor, also you can mod it to create some crazy and fun combinations such as ricochet (bouncing bullets) minigun with penetrating and cluster attacks (which adds new bullets when it hit the enemy) for creating a bullet hell within seconds or guided swarm missiles creating a blinding and deadly salvo of endless rockets.
+Lot's of tech to unlock, building to build, weapons and items to craft. 
+I quite like the campaign but i really would like to have a bit more difficulty in it, between campaign's brutal and survival brutal there is a vast difference. It feels like campaign is very easy while survival is hardcore brutal.
+Graphics and animatons are pretty. 
+Mech and tower def. strategy combo is big plus for me.
Negatives,
-Music is generic and after a while you will forget it's existence,
-There are some minor bugs here and there,
-If you don't have a good rig, especially in survival your fps maybe tanked to bottom due to sheer amount of units on map.
-tooltips are kinda annoying, if you select a building and hover other for looking for tooltip, it shows first one instead of hovered one. 
-When you alt+build (max lvl building) it show 1st lvl buildings influence of area which is wrong because 3th ones usually have %20 more area coverage which can mess up your build plans.
-Vanilla survival are limited with 1 hour which is not nearly enough for researching any decent tech, you're gonna skip almost %60-70 tech available if you don't play random survival.

This is a perfectly executed old-school RTS (think base-building and mission scenarios from Command & Conquer games, but no units) + a twin stick shooter (think, IDK, Crimsonland?) + a bit of a more uncommon twist with multiple persistent (and non-persistent) bases/maps, which is very cool. Gives you a break from your main base and makes it very sweet to return to it later.

Never a dull moment, kept me engaged for the entire play-through. This will NOT scratch your logistic / strategic itch though.

Very fun for people who like to build bases and defend, and not have to worry about using bunch of units like in classic RTS games. Short-ish, but fun, campaign and good amount of replayability in survival. You can either take it as a challenging mode which very quickly gets really hard, or you can tone down the difficulty and enjoy endlessly defending and expanding your base. Decent amount of buildings and tech to develop. Co-op is on the roadmap so hopefully it will be an even better recommendation once that drops. Some occasional bug is there on release, but hopefully those get fixed too, nothing game-breaking so far. Given how good the game looks and how many units there can be on the screen, seems to be fairly optimized. For those who prefer more campaign (story, different missions) and not skirmish (get thrown in a random map and always have the same goal), it might be a bit of a better pick during a minor sale, but overall seems like a good price for the game.

[u]Long version[/u]

Been waiting on this game for quite a while and it definitely delivered. I've always been a fan of games where you can build your base and turtle out, slowly expand and maybe explore the map a bit. This game covers pretty much all of it and you only have a single unit to control which makes it pretty chill if you aren't playing on the higher difficulties. 

The campaign consist of basically a single long mission. I like the approach because you develop your base and your tech tree gradually and unlock more stuff by completing certain objectives. It doesn't force you to rebuild your whole base and/or research the tech again over multiple missions. There are certain ""expedition"" objectives where you are forced to build new, smaller bases, but there's still a lot of contribution from your main base. However, following objectives one after the one can make you finish the campaign relatively quickly. Perhaps a few more interesting objectives or maybe some scenarios separate from campaign could make it more interesting. Right now you can either redo the campaign on higher difficulty or go into survival. The default for survival is you have to endure for a certain amount of time (90 minutes, not sure if it varies by difficulty) which gets really hard and leaves you almost no time to take a minute and relax. Ideally I'd prefer few other modes, like one where I can mostly defend and not have to build so many small outposts just to get all relevant resources because most resources are only obtainable from the natural deposits. If there was a way to get all resources infinitely with some late-game tech like you can currently get the basic resources, it would be an interesting aspect for players like me who like to have one gigantic base instead of several smaller ones (or even worse, just mining structures that get demolished during each enemy attack).

Overall there's a good amount of different buildings and researches. I can't say I wouldn't want there to be more and I'd gladly welcome more content that expands the tech tree a bit more, even if it's in the form of paid DLC. At the very least to have some resources constantly available in the same way basic resources are.

Visuals are really good and I was surprised how smooth it ran. Even on huge waves it didn't get too laggy (around 40FPS), and I by no means have some high-end PC and played on 1440p high settings. Some explosion smokes might be a bit too much and cover too much of your screen at times and you can't see anything.

Nothing too special in the sound department, but nothing to complain about either, overall everything seems fitting.

Some features seem a bit too hidden (I don't recall everything being mentioned, but maybe I forgot and it's completely my fault), like there being an extra setting when inspecting buildings. I accidentally stumbled upon few of them having it and I don't even want to think how much I'd spend not finishing campaign because I would have missed how to do those things.

Few bugs here and there, mostly with liquid flow and shields. Sometimes liquid doesn't seem to want to flow in the right direction and buildings are left without the proper liquid until you delete and rebuild 1 piece of the pipeline. Shields sometimes don't work or give incorrect amount. Never had any crashes or game-breaking bugs.

I'm looking forward for the addition of co-op in the future as I've been looking for a game like this that I can play in co-op. I hope they decide to add a bit more content too because I can see myself playing this for a decent amount especially if in co-op.",1635088442,1635088442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. random events that hurt every building.  I dont want to spam small AOE repair towers literally everywhere because of hail and meteor showers.

2. resource generation from unloaded maps.  So while playing the game, resource deposits get depleted super fast.  However, once you go to another map, place and set up mines, and leave; you get those resources forever.  If you play slow, or accidentally AFK on a map, you'll deplete all your resources.

Some segments are tedius but as you get more familiar with the game they become easier and easier and faster and faster.  

QOL Tip:  Use F (sell), R (repair) and G (upgrade) to perform those actions by clicking and dragging the mouse around on anything you want to sell, repair or upgrade.  It is incredibly much more satisfying to upgrade, repair or sell 300 wall segments by dragging your mouse pointer over them, rather than clicking each one or even worse...clicking each one and then clicking repair icon on the selection cross.  Some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't realize you can do what I described and are complaining of natural disasters taking forever to recover from.  Just hit R and drag around as you run, boom everything's repaired.  Eventually just build some repair towers, get them to lvl 2 (3 drones) or 3 (7 drones) and never worry about repairing anything ever again.

The single player campaign was ok, the gameplay is fun enough to justify giving the game a go. But the story was stupid bad, like the dialog and voice acting are cringe.

Ahley herself is just a dumb person, complaining about being ecofriendly all while decimating forests with flame throwers and nuclear missiles.  

But the downvote comes from survival being stupidly unbalanced.  The enemy ramps up too fast while you generate resources too slow, and you never have enough power.  The spawns come at you from every angle, choke points don’t exist, you have to defend 360 degrees of your base, and you’ll never had enough coverage, towers, ai cores, or power, or raw resources to do so.

But yeah, the game seems to have been rushed out of the gate before everything was 100% ready- there are a hundred small bugs. The building system could use some QOL improvements as building en-masse is clunky and tedious. There are also some inconsistencies in quests and writing. The tech tree also could use a lot of balancing, you can rush through the HQ tiers without ever leaving the starting map. The pacing just seems off, and the progression system is very easy to cheese.

 And lastly, the end-game is underwhelming. A big buildup for a simple countdown with a pretty easy final wave of foes- and that's it. From the way the game started I halfway expected a grand plot twist, like the biters being controlled by an alien hive-mind or something. Nope, you finish the rift, you go through, game over.

I abandoned that notion eventually, after that the rest of the game was a blur.

All that being said, the game is definitely worth playing. It's super fun, and the combat is pure joy. I just hope the devs keep working at it.

Not much here. AI is built by a hungry earth government and wants you to kill 'em all. Good girl pilot wants to save the trees and the cute bugs. Bland. Old. Not interesting. At least let there be a boss battle or something truly alien about the plot.

Gameplay - 8/10
On normal difficulty and 5 hours in the gameplay is solid.

Great graphics for a 2.5D world. Better yet, even on max settings it wont kill your PC. 
A word of advise, use your NVIDIA control panel or AMD equlivant to lock the FPS down to somewhere around the 120 FPS or your GPU will work too hard to deliver frames you wont ever see.

Where Factorio focuses on the item economy and optimizing logistics, The Riftbreaker streamlines things and directs its focus on the planet, story, and combat instead of on the minutia of moving resources around and constructing production / logistics chains. I guess I'd consider it a meshing of Factorio and Diablo.

You'll mostly be managing input and output of resources by expanding your base while fending of regular waves of enemies. Once you get your main base set up, you'll split your time between upgrading your main base and expanding it to create a portal back home, and travelling to other maps where you need to gather rarer resources while fending off a combination between environmental hazards and biome-specific flora and fauna which don't like being disturbed. 

The story is fully voiced with a couple characters, graphics are amazing, and the combat is very fun. You really feel like a powerful , giant mech mowing down thousands of bugs with mininukes and railguns while artillery rains down from above. There's the occasional performance issue which tends to resolve itself quickly, but overall I'm impressed with how well their custom engine handles physics, swarming AI, and FX the way that it does. 

The devs also appear to be dead set on making this a highly moddable game. Pretty much everything outside of the game engine code is easily accessible for modification, and applying mods is as easy as copying a zip file into a specific directory. Most of the mods at the time of this review are cheat or QOL mods, but I'm excited to see if people start making custom campaigns, expanding the tech tree, adding weapons / upgrades, and other cool stuff.

I would like to note that on release, there were a number of potentially game-breaking bugs in the campaign which had fewer testers during release than the survival mode, but the dev team has been very responsive and is hard at work at fixing them.

The ""factory"" part of Riftbreaker focuses mostly just on managing your resources and land area, as there isn't a need to optimize conveyor belts or something - just connect everything to your electric lines and you'll be fine. You'll mostly just need to expand the area and move your turrets forward every now and then, just to fit all the buildings you need. There's a handful of factories that require a longer line of refining materials, but they're mostly only relevant near the end of progression.

Maps aren't infinite - it takes a minute or two to run straight from one side to another. The campaign structure is as follows:
- You have one ""main map"", where you'll be building most of your stuff, slowly expanding your factory to gather the basic resources from that map. My base filled roughly half of the whole map when I finished the game.
- From the main map, you'll eventually travel to new locations (maps), with different goals: one goal might be just to gather a certain resource that can't be gained elsewhere, just to be able to craft a better weapon. You simply explore, fight and dig the ground manually, you don't need to build in every location.
- You'll also build a couple of Outposts (new bases) in different maps, which are always focused to gather one special resource that you can't find from your main map. You'll travel back and forth between these bases a few times to expand them to keep the resources rolling in.

Overall, I really like this structure - you have a permanent expanding main base, while you also go run around in other areas where you only focus on combat and exploration.

There's also Survival mode - survive for 1.5 hours to win the game. The hardest difficulty really requires you to know how to progress *fast*. There's also custom difficulty and sandbox, where you can test different things if you want to.

You're like an SCV  from StarCraft but you're literally the only one there.
It's basically a base building tower defense.
It's like Starcraft made love to Factorio in secret and had a beautiful, beautiful baby.
This genius baby is a twin-stick isometric shooter with base building, tower defense, and sim management, all cuddled up in a gorgeous 3-D cozy. Baby's a nature lover who's even just had a degree in economics and fucking management. 

The twin stick style combat is very satisfying. Graphics are great, although it can be hard sometimes to spot the fauna (just like in real life). I wish I could switch loadouts instead of weapons but that a very small gripe

The tech tree starts very low so you get used to most of the game's basic mechanics. The economics in this game are well balanced so far. Later on, as you expand across a map, it becomes more logical to upgrade your technology and strengthen the positions you already have instead. 
There is an overarching theme about environmental awareness here. There is an absolute desire to be efficient to avoid losing precious resources, so you progress up the tech tree of power. Everything starts from renewable energy, but inevitably with growing military power comes increased need for energy and resources. 
With sufficiently advanced technology, the game posits that we will be able to synthesize any material we need REMOTELY with a 3D printer when we gain the ability to fabricate complex mechanical bits from materials you can get from the local natural resources. Even the Mech you drive around gets reprinted if you have the resources for it. Our technology has gotten so good that we will be able to harvest renewable energy to work steel.
THE IDEA IS SO FUCKING AWESOME. In this one, you'll start making shit from coal and iron because it is an EARTH-LIKE PLANET with a similar atmosphere. I've been running around the first for HOURS now and I've restarted before I've even left the first map because I have so much to do and I do not want to head to the next map and leave the flora and fauna in ruins so I've basically started shrinking my bases to reduce the noise that draws the animals. It's really awesome shit!
The character yammers early on quite a bit of respecting the ecosystem. So when the base gets bigger and it gets a LOT more attention so bigger and more animals are attracted. There is looooot of emphasis on efficiency so if you get stuck for resources, balance out your economy. THIS FUCKING GAME IS MAKING ME LEARN ECONOMICS AND FUCKING MANAGEMENT
It saves a lot of the cumbersome bits of learning to do literally everything and makes it a lot more cohesive
Challenging enough without stressing you out. If you overextend yourself, the game WILL punish you.
Monsters are pretty diverse and you can even go around cutting trees and killing animals for biomass. BUT just don't

I'm still on the first map because I refuse to go to the next territory because I want to make it MINE and the game is letting me do it, too! But honestly trying to retreat the base is a lot more interesting than just going straight after the goals. It's pretty challenging to figure out the most efficient way to build for a given required output. It's' more like arranging chips on an electronic board.
The big animals are really special too. There is an ecosystem here but for some reason these animals are really aggressive. There are the other ones that don't engage you and just run away but you can kill these just for fun and get animal biomass for it, too


Gonna try and complete this but I do not think I will be playing any other game for a long time. You guys just ruined every other game for me dammit. If the ending sucks I will be so pissed =)

Oh yeah the minimap sucks haha. I wish there was an option to literally customize them in game but I think that would be against your design philopsophy. I DO WANT MODS THOUGH!

The main story has you start in a single zone that is your hub. From there, you survive while building up research. So far, so good, with the minor exception being that the research takes actual time, and there are at least a hundred research nodes available. From there, your whole goal is to get one specific building online. In order to do that, the game introduces resources that are tied to specific biomes. 

Each biome proceeds as such: Go to new location, find out what the area's particular BS is (Desert has quicksand and heat, Jungle has corrosion, and the Volcanoes have, well, heat.) Each of these unlock a new research that has to be done to survive, you find a 'rare' resource that cannot be mined, you unlock a mission for that which entails more running around holding space, you built a little garden, and done. No idea if these keep producing resources, but once set up, there is little reason I found to return to these maps.

From there, you then have to research how to handle each ""main"" resource. Then go back into a new map, set up a base, try to find deposits, then set up your new base, which then takes just a long as your main base because you have the exact same thing happening here. This is where is fell apart for me.

The base building gets repetitive. Each new biome is no challenge, handling the exact same way. Built the new floor or cooling tower, and it's all the same. The creatures are all the same, just getting buffed as they become their ""alpha"" and ""ultimate"" variants, which do nothing except change their color, make them bigger, and make their health and damage higher.

The suit upgrades also don't seem to help anything. I often forgot new upgrades existed, and was annoyed when that really cool item I researched required rare resources I didn't have enough of (not like they really changed anything).

Overall, outside the first and main base, this game feels like straight busy work, with nothing fun outside the initial map discovery mission. I do not recommend this game.

(PS, outside the build border for the map, the game won't let you use any of your movement skills, which sucks, especially when they put objects of interest near the border.)",1635004454,1635004454,False,33,1,0.558368802070617676,0,True,False,False

I really don't have a lot of bad things to say about this game! I've been waiting for roughly a year for it to come out and was a bit hesitant when it finally did, but I can confidentially say that the dev's have ensured they did not follow the foot steps of so many other (better known) game developers and have produced a well polished and designed game.

Pros - 
Hugely satisfying
Good UI design
Unique game play, each run through will be different in one way or another

""Cons"" -
Game has crashed twice in my 12/13 hours of play and both times involved external programs (one being AMD throwing a tantrum)
Slight lag caused when auto saving
No Mission Board so I sometimes feel a bit lost if I missed/Forgot what the dialog said but you quickly figure it out or they repeat the task.
Research takes a bit long i feel at some points but will eventually be over come by several Research Buildings and getting lost in combat and building

Random events such as meteor showers and earthquakes are the fucking worst. I understand why they've added them, as simply having lots of enemies come at you doesn't quite shake you up enough. But the random events can really, really fuck you over with complete RNG bullshit.

The survival/horde wave mode is frustrating to say the least, as not only does everything slowly but surely start to stack up against you, forcing you to be out there constantly and then neglect your base or build your base and neglect all nests and the HORRIBLE acid yeast that WILL take over the map.

You got all of these element of base building, ressource finding and exploration that mix together perfectly.

The base building is the most prominent element with all the option, and the defense phase are exciting and require planning.

Develloper did a good job of varying wave and the direction of attack. You cannont simply turtle a fixed point and be safe.

Pros: 
1. The campaign is HUUUGE. If you're playing on normal or above, you will spend easily 40 Hrs + on just the campaign.
2. Great graphics, very good physics too. Explosions are very satisfying.
3. GUNS!! GUNS!! GUNS, a shotgun in one hand and a sniper rifle in other ?
   A spear in one hand and a NUKE launcher in other ?
   Dual wield miniguns ?
   Very good selection of weapons. AND weapons are very satisfying to use.
   There is no weapon META, enemies are differently resistant and vulnerable.
4. Enemy variety is great. From cloaking hunters to massive stone monsters this game has a lot of monster variety.
5. Pathing. AI pathing is very well programmed, AI is rather intelligent and can be dangerous if underestimated.
6. Game mechanics are intuitive, challenging and well thought.
7. Even with 500+ enemies on the screen, frames were relatively stable. ( Tested on GTX960 and RTX3060 laptops)

CONS:
1. Campaign mode is ton of fun. But there is only 1 campaign at the moment(Albeit quite long; took me 28 hours to finish at leisure). Your other choices are sandbox and survival modes, neither of which, in my opinion, are as fun as the campaign. 
2. There are a LOT of mechanics in the game. Fairly easy to figure out. BUT there is no actual full guide other than the first tutorial which teaches all the basics. UI elements could use a bit more description.


Thats it. The game just released and it has no major flaws or bugs. It is 100% playable and quite replayable as well.

The complexity of the base management, especially when it comes to the management of liquid resources and automatically managed renewable resources is incredibly interesting.

There are some catches, however.  While the Campaign will serve as excellent tutorial, it is quite easy on Hard.  Brutal difficulty... does not actually make the Campaign all that difficult... it just turns the enemies into bullet sponges, which (in my opinion) is not really the best way to do difficulty.  The difficulty does not advance as you increase the HQ level in the campaign, resulting in a game that starts off challenging but then quickly diminishes in difficulty to the point where it actually gets to be a bit of a joke.  The resource management still entertained me, but the game (in the campaign) ceased to be a challenge.

An additional problem with the Campaign is that it is (at least currently) extremely buggy.  It is possible to have your progress in the campaign get locked because Cyro plants failed to spawn on one of the lava level, or one of the crucial creatures in the radiation zone that you are supposed to scan might not spawn or die before you can scan it.  All of these are incredibly frustrating and require you to either exploit or straight up cheat your way out of your game being locked simply due to a bug.

The Survival mode, however, is completely different.  It is not buggy and does not suffer from the difficulty not curving.  Instead, it will absolutely kick your ass.  After playing the campaign you will probably be like, ""What the fuck?"" Because you will see enemies within 5 minutes of the survival mode that it took the campaign 5 hours to set against you.  

There is definitely some difficulty curve problems in both modes, but I definitely would say that it was fun taking my time learning how to set up efficient resource gathering in the campaign, and it was fun getting annihilated in survival.

There's a lot to enjoy with this game, and I only have a few problems with it. Rest assured, it's 90% positive rating is not hype, but like any game, it falls short in a few areas.

COMPLAINTS: there is no way to see what, specifically, is draining resources. When you have several large, complex bases this can make determining what exactly is causing resource shortages a pain. You can tell which bases are drawing what resources, but not what those resources are being used for. I couldn't figure out that I was over-producing ammo until I lost my entire stock of iron, which put a long delay in the middle of the game since I needed a lot to upgrade the HQ.

The sound design is perfectly good in many areas, with lots of recognizable, understandable audio cues, but I found it lacking in combat. Explosions, while graphically excellent, barely make any sound at all. Voice acting is...well, it's functional. It's not offensively bad but it's not particularly good either.

Drones can be created by towers but you have no control over them, which made me wish there was a ""summoner"" type tree that you could have as a player to create lots of minions to fight for you, techmancer style. The attack drones have little function that isn't covered by other towers and their range is pretty short, a problem I have with all the drone towers. 

Would love co-op, but I understand the development complications behind adding it. Hopefully we'll see it later.

Ultimately though, combat is visually satisfying, learning the game and understanding optimal build methods was actually pretty fun to do, and the biomes (though a bit samey functionally) provide a decent change of scenery. 

And just LOOK at that price point. If you like building bases, holding the line against giant hordes, and careful resource balancing, you're looking at one of the best games out there for it.",1634948720,1634948720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is basically Factorio with less complicated recipes but way better graphics. The tech tree in this game is surprisingly robust and had a lot to offer, plenty of options in weaponry to fit any play style. This game also I felt had a bit of a Starcraft nostalgic feel for me at least graphically and with the hostile creatures a bit. 

So at first it made me remember the good ole days of Starcraft when that first released, then it made me realize this game played similarly to Factorio. It feels similar to Factorio yet does not feel like a clone, Riftbreaker is very much it's own game and feels that way. 

Furthermore I was shocked to see this game released for only $30, even without a sale this game was definitely worth it. Time bleeds away as you play, as do most good/addictive games.

But don't misunderstand: if this game looks interesting to you, definitely buy it, because even with my criticisms, that it leaves a lot on the table as of 1.0, there's still an enjoyable playthrough here. 

I wouldn't make a purchase decision based on balancing critique. But, to be clear, the reason I'm writing this is because this is time I'm spending running the game waiting on technology to research, and right now that's my #1 gripe with the game as it seems to be hiding a lot of other issues with the game... 

Pros:
- It's gorgeous and should run on any middling PC. The demo ran competently on an old FX-8150 and R9 390, and the game runs smoothly on a 5600X with the R9 390.
- It will be a long, long time before you get tired of blowing something up, there are so many ways to modify and upgrade your weapons. Want a minigun with a massive spread that deletes hordes of enemies in seconds? Mods for that. Railguns, Nukes, Lasers, there's so many ways to kill your enemies, and, sigh, not enough enemies. 
- Some things persist between playthroughs, like cosmetics you can find via exploration. 
- Fairly interesting fluid-based building mechanics which are what give it's ""kinda like factorio but not really at all"" moniker: eg. pump extracts swampland -> treatment plant extracts methane -> piped to gas generator. Some buildings require coolant to run, you can place a geothermal plant on a geyser and it will produce mud, which can then be filtered to cool the other building. 
- A not disinteresting research mechanic and geoscanning mechanic: scan creatures to 'catch em all' in your compendium, some of which unlock special research such as the ability to teleport/blink jump in combat or activate a cloak, while geoscanning can reveal hidden resources. 
- You get a few tools to plan out a base: tile the floor for faster running, lightpoles, cosmetics, etc. 
- Of course, the ability to frequently teleport: place a riftportal down with the V key and you can return there any time. It doesn't even require power (which seems a bit IMBA but whatever it's fun). So, wherever you need to be you can get there, except you can only be in one place at a time! 
- For that matter, outposts are really interesting, the ability to jump back and forth between maps which run persistently is pretty neat, and that is like Factorio/Satisfactory in that the global tick doesn't stop for buildings/resource nodes that aren't loaded in on the current map. 

Cons:
- Sold ""like factorio"" but besides a few fluid loops, there are no conveyor systems for solids, or intermediate manufacturing steps for goods except for enriched uranium, which can be placed anywhere. 
- In fact, without fluids there's almost no logistics in the game except for where you place your repair towers and where you place your power lines. Most of the late game power options happen SO late in the campaign that they aren't even worth it, you will have already spammed 1000 solar panels down and upgraded them to level 3, so a building that requires coolant and rare resources to operate is worth what to you exactly? Renewable energy sources take away a lot of challenge, as long as they are connected to the grid they just work, so you can just spam them everywhere for power, with minimal impact on game performance. 
- Having played normal and hard, let's just say the towers rarely break a sweat against the mobs you will encounter. Later in the campaign you can upgrade a top tier sentry gun ability, so you can place a few turrets that are self-powered even, and those turrets will delete waves. So even huge hordes don't stand a chance against a bunker with even a basic wall around it. The most trouble you'll have managing damage to your base comes from the rare hailstorm. Seriously. 
- The former point wouldn't be so bad, but because the enemy almost never sends waves at you (it's like, maybe every 15 minutes, you'll get a couple hundred weak mobs flung at you) and it just feels criminal to build up those defenses only for them to, for the most part, languish. The devs want a ""everything at your pace"" view the roses etc. kind of game but can I please also get ""Enjoying my cup of coffee while I watch 10,000 goons spatter against my creation?"" 
- They put you on the backfoot like that in Survival mode. Truly, Normal mode on survival is surprisingly hard, but, the time limit on survival mode means the difficulty that should be in the campaign, only lasts so long, about 90 minutes, and you are bereft of several campaign enabled features, like Outposts, in survival. So you don't really have time in survival to get to unlock, or enjoy any of the games best upgrades and weapons, and in the campaign you have too much time on your hands and no challenge to meet you. 
- Research (currently) takes way WAYYYY too long in campaign, as I said above, which leads to a lot of idle time where you sit and lament why there aren't more enemies plowing themselves against your fortifications, why there is no use in stockpiling 100ks of resources in the late game, your factories are all idle 99% of the time, so you spend 99% of the game defending resources outposts that should have been long since depleted so you can pack it back in and retreat to a safer front line. And, unlike few other buildings in the game, there's a strict limit on how many research buildings you can make to speed up research (please, lift this cap once HQ is max level). So, you spend so much time sitting around idle yourself that you end up just building an undefeatable perimiter around essentially the entire map, only for the hope of maybe seeing an enemy wave every 15 mins that manages to break a section of wall or something. There's a whole tech tree for shield generators but a) when do you ever see a foe in Campaign that warrants it and b) in survival, when do you find the time to research and gather all the requisites? 
- Even with all that downtime, every wave is announced 2 mins in advance, giving you enough time to slap down a new forward outpost. More than enough time - are you familiar with the Fortnite memes? It's like that. You can build an impenetrable fortress in 45 seconds, armed to the gills. So you just drop one every time a horde comes and because you have a bajillion resources from all the idling you do, there's no point in even selling it off afterwards. The waves always come from the same basic compass direction, too, so you're not even hard pressed to build up defense against the whole wave in that time. Sigh. Zzz
- Once you leave an outpost map, it's gone if you don't build an outpost, with no possibility of return. You also can't scan for new maps, and there's a cap on how many outposts you can have (which, makes sense, given the way the global tickrate works for that). Because of this, it is possible to miss scanning/researching certain flora/fauna on a playthrough and restricting you out of certain tech tree branches. 
- Of course you may never need a new outpost, because the game has a mechanic where new resources will spawn almost as often as an enemy wave does (sigh), either by meteor or by earthquake fissure. Overall, you have way too much resource with virtually no resource sink. 
- The procedural generator is bland in its current iteration. Every map is essentially a greenspace littered with rocks, or a desert littered with rocks, or a lava field littered with pathways. They're beautifully crafted, but for water features you have generic pond A B C D scattered about, there's no sense of landmass, geography, topography, there are no rivers for instance, just standing ponds of water. It means you rarely have interesting chokepoints or anything like that.

PLAY THE DEMO TO MAKE SURE YOUR PC CAN RUN IT.

Game isn't GPU heavy but CPU. There's a lot of units and is the first game that has made my new PC rise in heat and make fans spin faster, with default settings. 

If you like Tower Defense, Economy management and Alien Swarm/Shooter, this game is it.

It's a ton of fun pioneering Galatea 37, using the scanners to dig up loot and learning about the local fauna. Later on able to cultivate and grow plants to gain a renewable source of biomass and minerals as you strip the zones of material (I had plenty left by the time I finished on Normal, but used cultivators to boost some resources I needed a boost in).

Your defences can defend by themselves if you have enough, but that will require more ammo and electricity than being there yourself helping to fight the tide. So it's up to you how you want to juggle your defence expenses with your time. When you get attacked on multiple fronts your resources gets more strained and you'll eventually get into the rhythm to warp between locations in your base to help out where the swarm is getting close to breach through your layers of walls. 

Also there's a good variety of weapons to kill with. Swords, hammers, fists, miniguns, shotguns, grenade launchers, lasers and nuke launchers.

My main issues with the game are two things: The annoying ""Natural hazards"" aka when a tornado spawns in your base and destroys all your connectors. Or a meteor rain the split second you build an outpost and the meteor destroys the 3 lvl.3 mining buildings you just put down. 
These are really dumb busy work that only tells you ""get repair towers everywhere"".

Second is the constant chatter. ""Bla bla is full build more storage!"" when I spent 500 carbonium that I regained in 5 seconds, out of my 50,000 in storage. Or being told 5 times in a row a wall is being attacked while fighting at that very wall.

All in all the game is a solid 8/10, missing a bit in defensive variety tools (I feel like shield generators comes in too late and requires a valuable resource made out a limited resource to function), a lot of uninteresting passive upgrades to your mech pulling down the score on an otherwise amazing base defence/exploration/resource management game.",1634910798,1634910798,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]As it is commonplace with games on Steam, there aren't many (if at all) objective user reviews for the game, so if you haven't decided yet whether to buy The Riftbreaker or not, read this:[/i]

I would definitely [b][u]recommend[/u][/b] the game since I don't want to deprive anyone from lots of hours of fun. I never understood why anyone would not recommend a game they have put in 30-40-50+ hours, just because they have found something annoying in it. Don't listen to those reviews. However, this doesn't mean that this game is perfect by any means.

[b]-- Pricing:[/b]
The game is perfectly priced. For 30€ you get what you (should) expect, which is about 30-50 hours of playtime, depending on whether you only want to do the Campaign, or wish to play in the Survival game mode as well. While it is always nice to pick up a game on sale, if you are interested, Riftbreaker is well worth its original price.

[b]-- Gameplay[/b]
You arrive at an exotic planet moving around in a battle mech and your goal is to mine a huge amount of various resources to build a portal back to Earth. To do so, you have to build mines, which you have to power and protect. Exploring different kind of biomes will require different kind of protective measures for your mech and your base, so you will have to utilize the local flora and fauna to research new technologies. This is the base concept of the game. If this is the kind of game you like, then Riftbreaker is for you.

Another confusing thing I read not just here on Steam, but by professional reviewers as well, is the comparison to different games and genres. Before purchasing the game I also read reviews about how this game is a Factorio, Tower Defense, Diablo, Total Annihilation/Supreme Commander hybrid. Since I am familiar with all these games, I was expecting something entirely different. Riftbreaker could bear some resemblance to these type of games, but only on a very superficial level.
[list]
  [*] It is NOT like [i]Factorio[/i]. In Factorio, the goal is to automate an increasing number of components to build more and more complex items and structures. In Riftbreaker you only deal with raw resources (save for two exceptions). Yes, you can build a pump and link it with a pipe to a few buildings' input, but this doesn't make the game anything like Factorio. You put mines on resource fields which nets you an amount of resource that is automatically stored for you.

  [*] Saying that Riftbreaker is a [i]Tower Defense[/i] game is again a huge mistake. If Rift Breaker is a TD game, then so is Age of Empires. You build turrets to defend your base for all kind of threats, period.

  [*] While it is nowhere near as complex as a game like [i]Diablo[/i], this is the only comparison that I can somewhat understand. You Kill/Destroy/Extract stuff you find around the map and based on your favor with the RNG Gods, you get some random loot which can come in the common type of rarities (Common, Advanced, Superior, Extreme). These drops can either be some kind of decorations for your base, or an installable mod for your weapons (or turrets). All armor and weapons can only be crafted, and not looted. However, while gearing yourself up with the best mods can help you achieve your other tasks, it is not required and is not the goal of the game.

  [*] Last but not least, I have no idea why anyone would think it bears any kind of resemblance to [i]Supreme Commander[/i]. Yes, you can have a lot of enemies at once on the screen, but the similarities end here.
[/list]
[b]-- Graphics[/b]
I think the gameplay videos and screenshots speak for themselves. The game looks gorgeous, the different biomes of Galatea 37 are fun to walk around in, and almost every object you come across is destructible. When fighting against hordes of alien monsters, smashing them with your giant hammer as the rocks and trees break apart by the shockwave is truly a sight to see. That being said, it is no wonder that the game is hard on your GPU, so if you want to dive in with the highest possible settings, you have to forget grandma's old PC as Riftbreaker demands a solid rig.

[b]-- Stability[/b]
This is the weakest point of the game. While games usually launch with the occasional bugs, Riftbreaker seems to have an exceptionally high amount of them. This could range from small bugs to major, game-breaking ones. During my 25 hours of gameplay, the game has crashed 7 times (even after switching ray-tracing off) which is awfully lot and is the most discouraging aspect of buying it. If you like your game stable and you are easily off putted by bugs, I recommend waiting for a few fixes. Good news is that the developers seems to be hard at work fixing these issues.

[b]-- Conclusion / TLDR[/b]
Definitely recommend, even at full price. Bugs and crashes are common for now, if stability is a must for you, wait for patches.",1634908053,1634908053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is never a dull moment.  As you begin to learn the game it can seem a bit overwhelming in a good way.  There is so much to do and so many ways to play the game the way you want to play it.  TRB offers an in-depth research tree for upgrading your Main Buildings, Energy, Defense, Resource gathering and Weapon systems for Mecha-suit.  Good luck trying to learn how to research Geothermal energy or build your first Gas Powered energy source while being attacked by endless waves of enemies that seem to get stronger as your HQ levels up. 

I simply love this game.  The creator is community oriented and even live streams and engages with the player base like no other game creator I have seen.  There is more content to come and did I mention there are no micro-transactions.  The creator will also be giving the community the ability to create mods for the game and a map-editor to create custom games and modes as we see fit.  Albeit, I probably wont make any mods.  But I will definitely be interested to see what the community will come up with.  Lastly, a Co-Op mode is in the works and will be ready roughly a year from now.

You pilot a giant mech equipped with various weapons you can upgrade to kill the aggressive inhabitants of an alien world while trying to explore the planet for resources, build a base, and eventually contact Earth for colonization.

There are two modes, Campaign and Survival, which are basically the same. Campaign is a more laid out kind of thing that has specific things happening at specific times. Survival is basically the same, but I've found that you can encounter resources on your main region that you would have had to go to a different part of the planet to find.

You build resource harvesters to get materials, then use those to build research, defensive towers, and auxillery buildings like increased storage and such. Most every building has multiple upgrades you can get through upgrades which unlock new things, or increased firepower for defenses.

Combat: It feels good to stomp around in a mech while spewing flames and bullets at hordes of enemies. There is also a variety of melee weapons to choose from along with ranged weapons, including laser, plasma, ballistic, explosive, and nuclear weapons. You unlock newer and better versions through research. Enemy types are varied, from bullet fodder enemies, to tanky ones, ranged ones, and artillery enemies too.

As you progress, stronger and stronger waves of enemies will occasionally test your defenses. If you aren't prepared, you will get overwhelmed.

It's a good game, and I recommend. Now for some tips.

-As you might guess, choke points are your friends. It allows you to control the swarms of enemies and get them clustered together for artillery file.
-Hold down ALT to build the highest tier building. I didn't learn this until I saw a loading screen tip about half way through my playthrough.
-I modified my mech to specialize into speed. This let me zoom around the map, avoid enemies, and run away when needed. Even getting extra HP or Shield upgrades didn't feel like they did much against the enemies that would pose an actual threat. The best defense was always keeping distance.
-When you go to other regions, don't worry about building up too much. Just build what you need so it will get you your resources. It won't be attacked while you're not there.
-The longer you stay in a region, the higher the chance you will get enemy attacks, random events, and disasters.
-Enemies don't seem to respawn if you have radar coverage. Meaning you can put up radars, clear a map, and only the swarm events will spawn new enemies. However, if you destroy a radar and lose coverage in an area, new enemies can spawn.

That's all from me. Enjoy!",1634887786,1634887786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You drop off on a really hostile planet and start gathering the first 2 basic materials. Then, you build your base and get upgrades. Roam the map, kill a buncha nests, defend your base from the occasional swarm. Rebuild, repair and collect more resources to unlock higher tier buildings, weapons, defenses and craftable upgrades.

Also you have to go to a different biome to explore and research new materials for new buildings and upgrades. This was fun because each biome is different and has new challenges.

I like the tower defense game + city building. It also has a rogue like feel because you get different upgrades from destroying nests.

My issue is the weather\natural disasters. Imagine my dismay when I found out that I have to manually repair EVERY. SINGLE. WIRE. that I had routed from my main base to my other smaller bases....like why is this a thing?

You get an automatic repair drone quite early on the upgrade tree, but it has limited range (circle AoE). I literally had to spend 30 minutes just running around spamming the repair button every time a hail or an earthquake happens....let's not even mention the meteor strikes....

And yes, I spent another hour or two optimizing my base (making a small clusters of bases, instead of having a big one so repair drones cover them properly) but every time a natural disaster strikes, it's another waste of time running around repairing these godamn wires....

I really hope they remove health bars on wires otherwise I'm not sure if I can continue since it has become a ""wire repair simulator"".

Again, you might like this feature if you don't mind spending copious amounts of hours running around spamming repair every time one of your bases takes a natural disaster hit (only god knows how people with multiple huge bases cope with it).

There's a couple of quests that are bugged, I think the introduction of the planter? To avoid this, make sure to use a level 1 planter. I had researched it to at least level 2 when I started doing the quest, and I guess they did not code it for a level 2 building, but level 1 so even with the building placed, the quest was just stuck. Took me a while to find this fix, hope this saves someone their time :)

EDIT: After 20+ hours in-game, I can definitely tell you that repairing wires is still a pain in the ass. Some people dm'ed me that I can ""hold the repair button while running"" like bro that's what I was doing. That's not gameplay, that's unnecessary work. 

Anyways, for those curious on how I dealt with that: Level 3 repair drones and buildings. Get these asap. The hp of the buildings gets huge boosts and the repair drone tower gets a lot of drones that insta-repair the buildings in it's AoE. The only natural disaster that can f*ck up my base now is tornado and meteor strikes (which you can avoid by running away from your base. Once Mr Riggs says ""there is a bombardment in our area"" run to an empty spot and that's where the meteor strike will fall. Just teleport back to base to avoid it. They're probably gona fix this though)",1634536193,1634882099,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

You find yourself arming and equipping swords, blasters, rifles, grenades, mines, lasers and even nukes in your ever evolving arsenal against the alien hordes.

This game is first and foremost a dual-stick, hack and slash game.  You'll spend your time mowing down countless groups of alien bugs.  Each group, each bug, each alien looks great and has abilities, flair, and an appearance that their personify their specific local biome.  

Your mech-suit AI, ""Mr Riggs,"" and you have meaningful and witty commentary on everything that happens within the game, which keeps the atmosphere of the game light and enjoyable.  -- I absolutely loved upgrading my mech with new stuff which let me RIP AND TEAR.   However, lets make one thing clear, this claims to be a base building game, but it is not.  Its all about mowing down the bugs.

The rest of this review is going to be a list of grievances:
- Sticky Keys.  Going from building mode to combat, I'd get locked out of using weapons until I use alt-tab to get out of game and returned.  Can be very problematic.
- Cloaking.  Mashing build mode with invisibility can cause permanent invisibility.  Allow you to wander the map and have the bugs ignore you all while blasting away with hot miniguns and grenade launchers.
- I played on normal difficulty at first, and it felt slow.  I would AFK to let research happen, slow.  The game does NOT have the constant aggression, continuous growing and looming threat of other notable base building games (Age of Darkness / They are Billions).
- The power fist clears and stun locks the bugs.  1000 enemy wave?  Not a problem.  Don't build towers and walls, build the power fists.
- I hate some of the environmental effects. Hail.  Why?  Earthquakes.  Why?  Tornadoes.  Even more why?  These damage/destroy your base with nothing you can do prevent it.   This is bad game design... its annoying and serves no purpose.
- Survival is more of a mini-game balanced around a few waves ever few minutes for an hour or so.  But, it has the same tech tree as the campaign and the same buildings. Realistically, most of the tech tree doesn't need to be there/should not be there for survival.  In the 1.5 hour survival mode, I got a handful of techs done...  The survival tech tree should be shortened, streamlined set of upgrades.

Overall, I had enough fun to want to play again on Hard.  But, knowing the pacing of the game... Hard was easier than normal.   Its not the grant fast pace always have to upgrade game I thought.  Maybe in a few patches they can fix the bugs, improve the UI, and improve the game pacing.  I give 6/10.",1634662171,1634877779,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Riftbreaker is like a simplified version, when it comes to resource/recipe management [global storage, only liquid needs transform, only one liquid input needed for buildings except for the final campaign building], power management, liquid management, no pollution etc.)

The combat has quite a bit of depth between enemies of varying resistance with different modes of attack across different biomes. You need tower variety to deal with them. And even then, some enemy type usually finds a way to break you unless you're able to build several of every viable tower type with enough tower ammo factories to keep them fed. It's likely going to be the long-range siege ""slugs"", if it's not the slow moving living rocks or walking metal rams, or the glass cannon lizards that shoot blobs a long distance and explode to hurt you when you kill them with melee. There are weapon combinations that seem way easier than others, though. [spoiler]Power fist self-heals you, attacks way faster than the sword, and can defeat any of the melee 'siege' enemies rather easily, so there's no reason I can see to use another melee weapon. Long range the nuclear missile is the most satisfying to use and most enemies aren't resistant to it. The ones that are resistant to it can either be killed with a minigun or machine gun easily or using a cryo damage mod. And until you get the nuclear missile, the grenade launcher is a decent stand in.[/spoiler]

The game basically requires you to automate everything (repair towers especially are recommended and basically necessary to deal with weather events but also to help standalone bases survive until you can get there to defend them). The way resources pool across multiple maps is nice in campaign, as if you're getting bored establishing cobalt bases in the jungle, you switch to the desert with uranium and sinking sand you have to build special flooring on, or switch to volcano where you have to ice up the floor to make buildings and establish titanium bases, or you can switch to acid plains where you have to constantly burn back constantly growing yeast, minesweep for exploding mushroom landmines (by far the easiest way to die if you don't notice you've walked into a patch) and replace it with your own corrosion resistant floor while you make palladium bases. There's a nice variety as you move between different biomes, coming back to your home base in the jungle occasionally to upgrade your HQ and unlock new tech, and as you pool all of the resources together, the defenses, power generation, etc. feels complete. You can get far with just cobalt but all of the best stuff is gated on uranium, titanium, and/or palladium.

Survival is a bit basic. You commit to one biome though all minerals are present, and you're constantly racing against the clock to mine and research what you need as fast as possible and you'll likely be missing at least one important thing during an attack wave (e.g. corners that you've left undefended, bases you just set up getting burned to the ground because you don't have enough time to proof it, defenses that don't keep up with the attack wave strength, etc.) It's fun, but doesn't have the same charm as the campaign. On the bright side, it's a small amount of time, so it's easier to manage your schedule with one. The campaign is (at least for me) around 30-35hours of chasing the next optimization or expansion to acquire more resources faster than I'm consuming them (ala Factorio) but with a survival, you've either won or died in ~1.5-2hrs.",1634875698,1634876760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A 20-30 hours campaign experience depending on how you go about things offering a variety of ways to play.

This, with an extensive tech tree and the ability to customize your kits several different ways offers a good amount of replayability for a damn fair price. The devs are charging ~$30 for a game where they built their own engine, that's pretty awesome. The game is beautiful.

While the game does have some bugs that may slow you down, they've offered console commands, and with the community forums I was able to work through both bugs that halted my progress. However, you'll notice that the devs are already squashing bugs like mad just a few days after release and none are all that bad.

Edit: Some of the missions have been patched to ensure that it is possible to complete them, including one of the two that I got locked on.  I'm shifting my review to positive in the belief that the relatively responsive devs will fix the second as well.

For the record, the one that was fixed was a lack of cold areas in the volcano, which I got around by using fire dash and building on it as the fire is cold enough to build on.

When you begin a campaign you select your difficulty level: medium, hard, extremely hard - and in addition to difficulty level there is an option to pick HARDCORE mode. For anyone who has played a hardcore game before, you know that means if you die - that's it, game over, thanks for playing, do better next time. However, for some reason in this game ""hardcore"" mode just means you have to re-load your last save. Did I mention that the game automatically saves your progress every 5 minutes or so? And that you can have multiple saves? 

Considering this game is flaunted as ""Diablo-esque"" and many other reviews describe it as Diablo mixed with strategy games etc etc - one would think Hardcore mode would have real consequences. Frankly I was excited when I died the first time, a chance to rebuild and do better my next play through. I was having a great time with the game until I died and effectively respawned without consequence. Hell I would argue it is EASIER to play ""hardcore"" because the game forces you to reload rather than ""softcore"" when you die you sometimes lose equipment and suffer consequences.

NPC drones along with turrets (aside from repairing) would be choice.  I don't have the starcraft autism like i did from my youth to always keep up with everything going on sometimes.  Adding more automaton on that front (because everywhere else works just fine) would not only allow players like me to take in the gorgeous environments more but also drive the pace to our liking without the constant requirement of jumping around all over the place.  

The push & pull of build vs explore is a great foundation, but does limit engagement to either or during specific times.  I love the idea of upgrading the HQ triggering a massive wave.  Environment hazards mixed with exploring mixed with waves isn't very fun though, its more ""get this done ASAP to now get this done before X blows up; but dont forget you need to go here to even find the next resource to progress""

Its a good game with minor issues games like this struggle with naturally.  Is it unique to the genre?  Yeah, they've integrated a lot of what we love from other games like it while still being true to its own.  Maybe with some more time in the tech tree I'll get a better grip and feel more in control, its worth the money though.


Addendum:
Got some more hours in, it gets easier to manage everything once you get settled in.  Stability issues arise at the HQ when you get large and are coming back from other biomes but it does hash itself out.

Only complaint is that the game is very very easy, even on hard.

Update now that they've fixed the portal so that you can actually start it: The whole game build up to the crazy onslaught that would be the final wave once the portal is started, however, what occurred was a trickle of a few creatures that lasted for maybe 30-50 seconds. I've seen standard attack events provide more opposition, which was really fucking sad. Didn't lose a single tower nor wall segment and barely got to join in myself before everything was dead.

You have the swarm fighting aspects of games such as Helldivers. You have the resource management aspects of games like Factorio or Mindustry. And you have the ARPG aspects of games such as Torchlight. 

The way each parts of these usually quite distinct genres have come together in Riftbreaker is a breath of fresh air and makes for an exceptionally enjoyable experience. One which is only made better by reasonably decent voice acting and a big stompy mech.

Update:
-> Some issues were fixed in the most recent patch. Updated review. 

Reasons:
-> There was one level, where the voice actor of Mr Riggs changed for about 2 minutes, and then went back to normal. Different pitch, tone, and verbal inflections. It was super weird. 
-> There are typos everywhere. Every bit of text, other than dialogue, has typos. Its like they rushed the text descriptions of everything in the last 3 days before release. The Prologue didn't have this issue, just the final build. In a lot of places, it actually makes it really hard to understand what they are trying to say in a particular sentence. 
-> Sometimes during weather events your entire stored energy depletes to 0. Even when you have millions of stored energy, and the current drain is only -1000. 
-> I cannot unlock progress for Petra Magneticus. Most things, you get progress by destruction, or by using the Bioscanner. I've tried the Bioscanner numerous times, and destroyed many smaller ones with a hammer and many larger ones with a corrosive weapon, and cannot earn progress. Doesn't appear other players are experiencing the issue, so the 5 techs that are locked behind it, have remained locked despite all my efforts... to the point now that they are the only thing in my tech trees not unlocked.
-> You don't technically have to place an outpost to respawn. If you die in map without an outpost, it gives you a prompt to return to headquarters or just respawn. Kind of odd, as the tutorial specifically says that you need an outpost to respawn. Maybe a remnant of an ancient gamebuild that they forgot to remove?
-> The green crystals in deserts never spawn crude uranium, and as their loot list states that they drop uranium I find that odd.
-> Getting affinity progress for flying creatures is next to impossible. The only time they die, are when a meteor storm occurs. 
-> On that note, a meteor storm targets you, and so wherever you are when it triggers, is the epicenter of the event, whereas other events occur in randomized locations, like earthquakes. 
-> Many of the weapon modifications do not function at all. So, range increases do not actually increase the range of say the flamethrower, even if you put two in that give 4.9 more meters, on the base of 28, for an expected total of 37m. 
-> The critical chance modifiers are honestly not worth it use. Since the +25% chance is multiplicative, rather than additive, if your base crit chance is 6%, then 25% of 6 is 1.5. Thus your new critical chance would be only 7.5%. Do you really think that is worth an entire weapon mod slot, when you can have at max 3? I sure don't. And it is the same with things like higher rate of fire, more projectiles, etc... Thus, there are actually very few usable and useful weapon modifications, which is a total shame. 
-> You can only find modifiers by killing stuff or discovering them. You can't craft them. Which is another missed opportunity. I have so many resources that I'd love to craft modifiers, and then insert them into towers (as that is where you can put them otherwise).
-> There is a structure, the Research Tower, that is only used once in the entire game. I mean, why? Maybe they have plans for DLC with it, but it seems like a waste of developer time to model and animate a structure that gets used once in the entire game. 
-> There was these singing blue crystals in the desert exploration, that I wanted to investigate, but an enemy was near it. I fired a rocket at the enemy, missed him by centimeters and destroyed the crystals. The one time in the game where there was an optional objective and I was denied visiting it because a rocket explosion destroyed them. That really pissed me off. 
-> You cannot revisit zones without an outpost or re-generate zones for acquiring resources, to make scavenging for non-node resources (ie Hezanite). 
-> There is a limit on several structures; armory, research lab, communications hub, ammo depot, and outpost. I just don't see the point.
-> Most of the unlocked weapons from alien research aren't worth constructing. Most of the towers unlocked by alien research are super expensive on rare resources, which makes them not very practical to be built.
-> When you craft a weapon, all of its stats are randomized. But if you craft a piece of equipment, its stats are fixed. But if you research a new consumable you get it for free. Why can't everything have fixed stats?
-> Minelaying towers and Drone towers are bigger than most towers, and are more expensive, but are also less useful than most towers, so I never build them. They are cool ideas, but failed in the implementation. 
-> The repair tower doesn't have a mesh changed at each upgrade improvement. Every other structure does. 
-> Some enemy types are ridiculously spongy in terms of health/armor. Some enemies ultra variant is weaker than the alpha variant. I keep encountering the same huge creature in the wilderness, and keep getting the same responses from mr. riggs, and keep getting told to research it in the labs, but I never get a research topic to research it. Even after killing it 9 times. 
-> Completing research to have solar shielding, doesn't apply to mr. riggs, so you always take damage from these events. 
-> You move super slow, have a really long dash cooldown, and you have 0 health regeneration by default. I equipped a red equipment that gave me 2.5 regeneration, and that isn't enough to actually survive nasty attacks, so I got rid of it. Why? Because whenever you take damage, there is a 6 second delay before you start regenerating, which completely defeats the point of regeneration. 
-> You only have 4 equipment slots and can never increase the number of them with research or upgrades. There are some really nice equipment but since I want weapon modifications, I need to have equipment that drops them more frequently. 
-> There is no way to improve the speed / efficiency of your drill arm, bioscanner, or geoscanner. So they are always as weak, slow, and generally impractical as when you first acquire them. Try bioscanning an enemy charging at you for example, and its nearly impossible to scan them before they kill you. 
-> The minigun goes through ammo faster than the flamethrower, but has roughly 1/5th the ammo capacity of the flamethrower. 
-> The rate in which you gain ammo seems to be affected by if you have the weapon out currently. If I'm holding onto the plasma rifle it slowly gains 20 ammo per second, despite having 5 level 5 armories. But if I holster it, it gains ammo ridiculously fast.
-> The shotgun and missile launcher cannot be fired very quickly, even by hammering the right and left mouse buttons. They also have charge attacks, but the missile launcher takes much longer to charge than the shotgun. The whole charging process should be at the same speed, so that you can fire both at max salvos at the same time. 

I could keep going on, but I think you get the idea (also because I hit the character limit >.>). I've not encountered stability, crashes, or save game loss like other players, but considering the lack of polish here, I fully believe that they are encountering issues. This game would have benefitted from a delay to polish things out for a few more months. If they address the issues in this review, I'll definitely update it, but for now, I'm not recommending it.",1634769155,1634840668,False,11,3,0.514831602573394775,0,True,False,False

Well, its tolerable at most.

There are technical issues. A lot of them. After loading you throw a dice, its 50/50 unplayable due to frame drop - 5fps. A reload usually fix this.

The movement is clunky. May be, there are items that makes you move better, not sure. Still, why should I suffer bad movement from start?

The combat is clunky. There may be a lot of enemy variety and ways to dispatch them. Its all so muddy they blend together. The most challenging thing about combat is getting stuck into trees or some other terrain irregularities. Not my idea of fun. 

So next point - the graphics are muddy. As hell. Everything is hard to see and distinguish from one another. Enemies, buildings, resources. And those colours - omg, i am all for colourful games, but this is unpleasant - i don't see enough of the game, mostly i see mess. That's next gen graphics?? Naaah, thank you....

Basebuilding is ..... weightless. Everything is cheap, you mass make it, (its ugly), there seems not to be of a challenge... not sure yet. At least I am sure, its not satisfying for me. 

There is a good idea with bad execution with searching for resources with a scanner. It so tedious and.... clunky.

There seems to be a campaign. It feels clunky 3.5h into it. Not sure what the dev intended to be the main experience - it or the survival mode...

I would love to change this review! Sadly for me, the main word for this game is clunky, and thus, i cannot recommend it.


**********

Update - on later stages of the game the lag and fps drops are unbearable. I've got a good system, it is not the problem.

So, we wait for update to fix that.

Stay away for now.

There's a ton of polish on the combat of the game, but the other two aspects feel bolted on which ..considering the fact that you'll spend 90% of your time tending to your base and your towers.. makes the game very disappointing to me.

The tower's hitboxes will block the bullets of other towers.. and also your own bullets.  Your own bullets are also blocked by your base's walls.  They give you these tiny platforms to stand on.. these platforms let you shoot over the wall, but not over the turrets.  That means when designing your base's defenses you have to choose between lots of towers, or the ability to manually reinforce them.  Neither option will be sufficient to protect from the later waves of enemies.

Here's the straw that broke the camel's back for me and made me decide that I won't be playing it any more.

The campaign takes you through some missions in order to unlock the privilege to mine rarer resources.  These missions can be buggy, confusing, and in the case of acid yeast: game-breaking.  I had finally unlocked titanium and set up my first titanium outpost.  I went back to base with the intention of upgrading my buildings and putting my new resource to work with better buildings.  About 30 seconds after arriving I'm met with a 1.5 minute warning that a swarm is on its way.  No big deal, I thought, my base has strong defenses and has easily wiped every swarm so far.  

I was wrong.

This swarm included so many enemies that the framerate dropped to about 10/s.  This swarm included enemies from every biome, and was *very* liberal with putting hordes of the tankiest enemies I've encountered so far in the mix.  They tore through my base like it was butter.  

I revert to an earlier save and try again.  This time I'll take the swarm seriously.  In a mad dash to prepare I get to work putting down as many towers as I can and upgrading my walls as much as I can.  There's only so much I can do in two minutes.. but I got it done.  They still managed to tear through a large portion of my base, including most of my power generation buildings, but at the end of the day I stood victorious.

I get to work rebuilding the damage, but 10 or so minutes into it I get the alert that another swarm is coming.  It's just as bad if not worse than the last one.. but this time I have no electricity to fend them off.

Now my base wasn't perfectly optimized.. but it was *good*.  I truly believe that there's nothing I can do.  When I revert to an earlier save the spawns happen exactly the same, leading me to believe that it's scripted. 
So even starting over from the very beginning would eventually put me right back to the same situation.

Lesson learned.  I'll never unlock titanium again.  I promise.

Edit: So I discovered the cheat commands and managed to push past the initial problem of not being able to survive a game-ending swing in difficulty.  I am now convinced that there was little to no QC passes on the campaign missions.  

I'd definitely recommend waiting for this game to be completed before picking it up.  But it's got enough potential that you should keep it on your radar.",1634620206,1634828074,False,2,0,0.495867758989334106,0,True,False,False

I haven't had a game grab my full attention for hours on end like that in a long time, long time.

There's so many influences in this game. I can sense Supreme Commander, Diablo 2, Starcraft, Factorio, No Man's Sky, Alien Shooter... So many games thrown into a well crafted stew.

Often when a game tries to be too many things at once, it fails on at least one or more areas. But this game doesn't.

Combat is fluid and satisfying, building/upgrading/repairing is fast (mouse drag go nuts). The sense of progression is well paced and addictive. So many technologies to research, new towers and new weapons to build. New resources to find to unlock higher tech. Different biomes with different enemies and different approaches to base building in each biome.

Graphics are NUTS. I'm told the devs made their own RTS engine for this game? Wow it's smooth. RTX lighting from the mech and bioluminescent flora is incredible to look at. Even as a top down kinda view.

I just finished my first playthrough on ""normal"". Spent about 45hrs but you could definitely probably smash it out in 20hrs if you went really fast and didn't take your time to optimise like I did.

My build and defenses were so well optimised that the final fight was hardly a scratch. The difficulty curve is really great early on, but it feels like once you've conquered your map, resources and upgrades - the enemies lose most their challenge.

Pretty keen to try hard mode with coop when that gets added to the game!

First there are lots of bugs on UI and game control. For tons of times, when I try to click certain build icon there is just no response. I need to close build UI and reopen it. or use shortcut key to force select certain building to refresh the UI stats.
Second for some reason, the game remove ammo UI but still leave the icon on the building. I don't know if ammo UI will come back. But due to the limitation, player's ammo is always not enough, because you are only allow to build 5 armories. 
Third, there is no way to disassemble Mods. In the late game in survive mode, you will get tons of Mods. But most of them are just garbage. But you have no choice but to keep them. And when you put Mods on weapon, the Mods list will be super long and just painful to use. 
Forth, the late game building just doesn't change their looks anymore. Instead, lots of them have a place show a number 2, or 3 which is the building level. But on uranium refinery, there is no place to put a number, so the number just float on top of the building.

I just hunt new resources, build new basic base, rinse repeat until I get attacked 14 more times and then suffer a meteor storm which causes damage to my base that I can't stop.

the building could benefit from a more top down perspective as buildings can get in the way, and since some towers automatically BUILD OVER EXISTING BUILDINGS a misclick can lead to defenses being destroyed. there is also certain map conditions that require you to build certain tiles for buildings to not be damaged. these need to be placed individually so you will need to DRAG THE BUILD ICON AROUND ALOT. really could use a paintbrush tool to cover more area. a upgrade pantbrush would also be good, because needing to upgrade hundreds of buildings at the same time by slowly mousing over them is annoying. 
the information panel for the buildings themselves could be more uniformaly designed. it seems like certain ones have their production and storage bonuses flipped, many people have talked about being confused as to which is the storage increase vs production. the building mode itself is a little buggy and gets stuck in certain modes occasionally.

while the game does have more modes that i can play due to the lack of variety as to what works and what doesnt. but the game is good for a once through at least.",1634785657,1634785657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do like the way they set up missions that have you scouting and looking for the more rare materials or having to scan anything and everything you come across. 

The game can get quite hard at times being running from or into danger. Also to note that even the weather plays out as it can help or hinder your base. With a lot of natural storms and disasters being unavoidable and all depends how your base is set up

It's going to get a lot of comparisons to Factorio and TAB, but it manages to be somewhat unique despite borrowing so much. I love the global/local systems mechanic and that you don't need to actually manage your transport line thanks to that magic ""rift"" tech - it makes it super easy to throw down a quick self-sufficient outpost. Later if you make it safer or just don't care, you can always connect it to your main grid. Sexy factories are fun, but not having to manage transportation reealllyyy changes the game.

The ARPG mech component is really fun. Skills are enjoyable and weapons, which normally have a quick and a charged attack. The researching is pretty slow and kind of feels like forced gating, but it did take me a bit to realize that you can build extra communications hubs to speed up research. I still feel like I'm at a point where I sit with a full load of resources a lot while waiting for research to finish. The graphics are pretty bomb overall, raytracing looks good, although it is a bit ""bloomy"" I guess. Lighting is kind of blown out, especially if you make light posts in game. 

Really my only complaints are minor;
- you can travel outside the edges of the map, but cannot build outside of it or move camera outside it (made a base in a sexy valley only to find out one tight choke had to become a longgg wall because it was out of bounds)
- saving briefly pauses and does something performance wise, must clean up memory or some sort of garbage collection (game can get laggy with big facilities but after a brief pause on autosave, performance improves for awhile)
- take this one with a grain of salt, I am still in Tropical biome. But enemies are kind of boring. Not bad, just a touch bland. Tougher enemies are reskins, there are these Titan-esque giant creatures but they're all slow bullet sponges so you pretty much just kite them in your turrets if you need to/get bored.",1634746127,1634746239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I spent a few minutes completing the simple objectives and acclimating to to the controls... when I noticed I had less than a minute left until I was attacked while only having a few defensive towers up covering no more than a corner of my base. This game could be so much better if it didn't rush you, I don't know why they thought that was a good idea. Figuring it was my fault for skipping over the tutorial, I quickly started that.

Who ever designed this tutorial is a fool, please don't make the mistake of thinking this is a sandbox type of game where you can play how you want. If you build things just trying to get a feel for setting up your base, you will run out of resources. Before the game will prompt you to go find those resources, which are far from readily available, you have to complete an objective. That objective requires resources you may have already ran out of! 

Lastly, the controls are whack. About half the time I tried placing down wall segments, the segment would turn as I placed it down, forcing me to sell and try again, sometimes several failed attempts in a row; but it only mattered if I wanted all my wall segments facing the same direction.

From the pros:

I really like the looks. the game looks great!
The scale is pretty good, sometimes you get thousands of creatures attacking you and it is very satisfying to deal with them. 
It is very satisfying to destroy the vegetation! :D

From negatives:

- campaign is kinda slow and not challenging. I played on Hard and after 5 hours I am still to find at least one challenging wave. Most of the time I spent learning the game and its kinda a lot at once so I had to stop playing just because I was getting tired. 

- the survival mode is more fun, however it really annoys me that I have to spread my resource buildings all over the map and never know where the attack wave is coming from until its already here. As a result I can never prepare for the attack in the way I want it and end up rebuilding the same infrastructure over 5 times (those mining stations that are spread out) and it is very boring to do it. Maybe there is a way to play it in a more fun way, but I haven't found it yet. 

- the AI is kinda dump. They go for what ever is in front of them, even if its a useless wall that protects nothing. i guess it opens room for exploits and there is definitely a way to divert every attack wave towards your fortified location, but honestly I am too bored to try it out. 

Final thoughts

I still recommend the game, but I wish by hour 20 I would have experienced the true scale of battles here. Instead, I went through not challenging boring campaign and got annoyed by rebuilding my mines 5 times in the raw until It forced me to stop playing survival mode.",1634467949,1634735620,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well polished game with great gameplay loop and stunning graphics. Heavy combat focus. Feels really good and satisfying. Lots of weapons that just feel way too good to use. Personal highlights: Spear, flamethrower, grenades, minigun.
Base building is fun and complex enough to be engaging. Very little frustration. Random events like sandstorms, heavy rain and mass attacks keep it interesting. Lots of different ways to generate power that are well implemented too.
Research tree is huge, progressing feel fun.
Sound is great, so is the music and the dialogue is really witty.

Great replay ability. I don't know why people are comparing it to Factorio, it is nothing like that game. This is a RTS game with the only unit being yourself. For people that like to play turtle style in a RTS you will love this game. 

Only real Negative I have is the dialog gets real annoying after awhile. Telling me my storage is full after the 200th time is really annoying. Would be nice if there was a way to turn off just certain notifications, like storage full notifications. Or at least put a longer delay before telling me again. You have one storage building, yet it will let you know storage is full for each resource that is full.  In the later game when you are mining multiple kinds of ores it gets worse.  But it never gets bad enough to turn the audio off.



A few bugs but nothing game breaking. I did have one crash that told me to turn off ray tracing, I think it was because of Dx12 bug. I see they are already working on fixing it.

Review after beating the campaign in ~17 hours:

Riftbreaker is a factorio-lite type game with a fun combat system. The main objective is to build a portal back to Earth. This portal requires advanced resources which you will need to gather in multiple different biomes (maps).

Resource gathering is a simple affair with just two main types used for construction (no refining or processing needed) and resources are teleported into a global storage (which requires warehouse buildings to increase capacity) so no conveyors needed either. There are multiple options for power generation depending on the environment you find yourself in.

There are multiple tower types you can build to defend your base and every building can be upgraded twice. You can also research and equip a large variety of ranged and melee weapons to your mech (you can dual-wield miniguns or rocketlaunchers but make sure you have enough ammo factories to keep up). All of this comes from a vast tech tree which you will progress through as the campaign plays out.

Creatures and plants are distinct between biomes and the differing environmental hazards you face will force you to adapt your play style for each map.

A few things I didn't like:
I ran into 4 crashes in my time playing, but I believe the devs are aware of the issue.

There are some environmental random events that do large, random, aoe damage to your base. (eg tornado, meteor shower, earthquake). There is nothing you can do to counter these events and must wait it out and repair everything manually afterwards. It is pure not-fun, but these kinds of events were rare enough to not be a major issue.

Overall I very much recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games within the factorio/base building genre.",1634327328,1634715330,True,2,0,0.527186751365661621,0,True,False,False

Didnt see this mentioned anywhere so thought i should say something. Game feels really poorly optimized, after you set up a bunch of bases in campaing performance goes down significantly and im only using 10% of cpu and gpu and 50% of ram.

Original: Its like a  modern factorio for casual players. Coolest feature ever is resources still gather even when you leave map (can visit multiple biomes which forces you to change instances) You dont get attacked when you leave map so its not hair pullingly insane. Way less supply chains, no conveyor or drone feeding ammo it just happens auto, maps are smaller so theres no vehicles or trains or anything. Mobility is not an issue due to speed upgrades and access to teleportation. Plays like they are billions but is mostly tower defense, cant build units to command. Im already 3/4 done research tree and i put in 6 hours so i cant imagine theres more content but i could be pleasantly proven wrong. Each map is procedurally generated so there is no 2 that are alike but as with all games designed like this youll see reused assets.

It has a very strong diablo feel when you are walking around clearing maps because of all your acess to weapons and skills and i love watching chunkies fly.

Lots of enemy variation! I love when games dont use the same 5 units.

The one thing that has always bothered me about these games is you dont get access to fliers. Even in factorio your knowledge of flight only went as far as drones yet you are building a spaceship. I dont even know if it will be fun to fly on an isometric game but the mind just wanders in disbelief.

New: 30 hours still havent beat it, feels close, feels like i spent too much time building resource gathering outposts but i really had no choice due to how slow tech progression is unless you rush tech somehow without researching anything in the tree(very risky on harder difficulties) The spear hands down is way too OP and counters almost everything if you can get close enough to it (normal difficulty) even counters shield using foes. Only reason to use other weapons is to break bigger flora. Some mod combo are ridiculous, stun on a gun that penetrates and has burst = everything on the map is stunned.

I really hope they add an ice biome in a dlc/expansion because cold weapons are not really fair right now even though they have low dmg.",1634328278,1634715103,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Run around in a mech with an array of powerful weapons, laying waste to alien hordes, while building up bases to gather resources and further your research. It's like if Factorio but with much more of an emphasis on combat, and less on meticulous factory optimization. 

The ARPG gameplay is super satisfying with no shortage of physics objects being exploded, incinerated, shot and nuked across the screen. The number of on-screen enemies can get quite insane.
Enemies have resistances and weaknesses to certain damage types, so the constantly switching up of weapons and play-styles keeps it interesting.
There are weapon mods that drop from powerful enemies or alien nests; they not only increase your weapon’s stats, they can also modify the functionality. For example, add the homing mod to a rocket launcher, you now have a homing rocket launcher.

The base-building is more reminiscent of They are Billions in that you defend your base and resources from intermittent swarm attacks. Much like TaB, you need to build up multiple layers of walls and fill every available gap with defensive towers.
The different biomes (essentially different maps) you traverse during a play-though offers different methods of producing power. I like this a lot, you can’t just plop down cookie cutter base designs. Some biomes offer 200% solar power, but increased risk of volcanic activity for example. Others are blanketed in thick, toxic atmosphere and you’ll have to refine toxic sludge into flammable gas to use in a gas power plant.

The gameplay loop involves building up your base, setting up mining operations, researching some things. New resources are required, so rift jump to a different biome, setup operations to mine the rare minerals, defend from attack. Jump back to HQ, research more. All the while fighting the never-ending alien swarms and growing your arsenal of sci-fi weapons. The goal of the campaign is to rift jump back to Earth which requires this monstrous and expensive to run, rift gate.

In my 20 hours played so far I’ve soft-locked twice, hung on a loading screen once (since been patched) and had some other minor glitches.
Hasn’t taken away from my experience at all though. It autosaves often enough for it not to bother me too much.

In conclusion, I’ve seen people describe the game as any combination of Factorio + dota + Starcraft + Diablo. I think a more accurate description is They are Billions (except in a sci-fi universe) with a little bit of Alien Shooter thrown in.",1634713657,1634713657,True,6,0,0.567685604095458984,0,True,False,False

games amazing. totally worth the money on steam. and if money's tight theres always gamepass. 

this game scratches an itch that I forgot i had. i played lots of random early 2000s rts games when I was younger, and this game has a great mix of kinda more old school rts/base defense, mixed with a pretty deep ARPG combat system... but with the excellent graphics and gameplay it certainly feels 2021. 

I read some people being turned off by the factorio comparison. I have 1000 hours in factorio, this is nothing like that. the gameplay loops are profoundly different. i honestly think that if they implemented more of a logistical focus in this game, it would absolutely suffer. there's just enough different production mechanics to keep it interesting, but not tedious

Pros: 
Exploring different biomes,
Excellent sound and graphics, 
Dozens of weapons and defensive turrets, and most of them unique and a blast to use
Lots of events to keep the player on their toes
Huge swarms of hundreds upon hundreds of enemies that try to destroy what you've built,
A teleport system that keeps the player in the action, teleporting between outposts to fend off waves of enemies feels amazing. 
A neat weapon system that heavily encourages experimenting and swapping weapons mid-fight. 
Weapon progression feels powerful, you start with a weak sword and small electric blaster that do 5-10 damage a shot, but late game you drop nuclear mines, teleport behind enemies, mow them down with dual miniguns with custom mods to cause the bullets to bounce between enemies, then explode, then set them on fire for good measure.

Cons:
The UI makes compromises for a hack'n'slash/base-building game and it's obvious, you cannot see all the resources you have in storage easily. 
Lame RNG events, such as a hailstorm dealing a small amount of damage to every building on the map and the only way you can repair it is 1 tile at a time (or with a repair turret, but that requires blanketing your base in them). 
RNG weapons and armor mods, that you have to craft, then disassemble, then craft again until you roll the stats you want. 
Tedious Scanning, the biosampler requires you to point at an enemy or rock or plant for about 2 seconds to add 1 'tick' to the relevant encyclopedia entry. You need 50 or so to max out one entry and there are dozens upon dozens and no way to automate the process.
Clumsy Building, The build menus are unintuitive, with no option to drag-build anything, save power connections, pipes, and walls, no options for blueprints or mass producing bases or quickly dropping prefab outposts. 
Spammy Tips, warning you about full storage every 2 minutes, about the weather every 3 minutes, explaining weather phenomenon every single time they happen, which is roughly every 5 minutes.
Bugs, (10/20/2021), my stealth ability got stuck 'on' numerous times, effectively granting me god mode, missions wouldn't progress as they should, getting stuck in odd spots, and just general feeling of lack of polish for the campaign missions.
Armor progression is lackluster, the mech has 200 HP and 4 armor slots and nothing else; late game, you have access to armor mods that grant +40 HP and 8% damage reduction. Slotting 4 of those into your armor bumps you up to 360 HP and 32% DR, and the math works out to having ~530 effective health, plus whatever bonus defensive stats are randomly added to the armor mods.

I would recommend this game, but I'd also recommend waiting a few weeks for bug fixes or patch changes or quality of life mods to cut out the annoying bits (Events that deal 25% damage to every one of your 200 buildings that you have to manually repair one at a time come to mind).

It's not bad, it's not great, a solid 6/10.

What I dislike:
- The (3d/graphics/sound) artists lack a distinct stylistic direction: below average. It's all just bland generic futuristic art and generic sound design. To the point where it's a poor Starcraft caricature. As if someone with early 2000s photoshop skills, not enough talent but a lot of grit was the art director.
- Tech trees, logistics, rts: mediocre. The game has a tech tree which looks complex at first but is pretty bland once you get into it. If you want a game loop which gives you that satisfaction of balancing out a complex and compelling logistics/supply chain go play Factorio or eg. the latest Anno.
- The TD aspect: mediocre. Not a whole lot of interesting towers. No creep pathing. No interesting enemies. No ability to refine and perfect your TD set-up. It's all fairly ad hoc: expand base, new cluster of tower, expand base, new cluster of towers. Etc ...
- The hack & slash mech: mediocre, generic and bland. You're better of 

It's clear that these guys can ship games. However, I would have preferred them to hire some different artists with new angles and to also distinguish themselves in depth more then in their breadth.
If you want mediocre to below average art, rts, td and action in 1 game. Go for it! However it will not be a memorable experience. In my opinion the game is bad at making you wanting to spend more time in the game. The game loop is not satisfying enough.

Why I do not recommend the game is mostly because, in my opinion, there are better and more unique alternatives in a similar price range. Eg. Anno series (on discount), Factorio, They Are billions, ...",1634686226,1634686226,False,3,1,0.420974582433700562,0,True,False,False

The weapons feel different and the movement feels spot on. The monsters are satisfying to kill and have a good variety to them.

Now there are some things that let the game down and I only mention them because I would love the game to fix them in the future.

The soundtrack isn't great, it does the job for a couple of hours but then it gets far too repetitive. 

The voice acting is also meh, your character is the typical sassy female protagonist that will make you roll your eyes, the robot voice lines are pretty dull too.

The lack of co-op hurts.

The UI is unnecessarily clunky only because its trying too hard to be controller friendly. There is no reason why I should have to select a second page of a bar to see the rest of my defense structures, there's not so many options that you couldn't rearrange it to fit it on the screen for PC players, its just a shame. The inventory management too is clunky, it should be so much easier to review your gear, choose which items to craft and dismantle unwanted items. It could all be done from the same screen and be a lot clearer, but its all separated and makes you scroll around, flicking back and fourth too much.

There' also some bugs that need fixing, none of them game breaking but they did cause some confusion for the main objectives.

It was fun, kept me engaged (for 27 hours), and is beautiful with a great physics engine.

The campaign itself was very bland and the ""missions"" was basically run around with a metal detector a bunch until you collect 500 of X resource.

The weapons were great, very diverse and fun to use.  The mods, while cool in general, were not really done very well.  Whether it's the interface for using them, the fact they are mob drops (while the weapons are research items, making it feel like they wanted it to be a looter/shooter but not quite), or that they just pile up as you go, takes to much effort to break them down.

I would say my biggest issue is by the time you get down the tech tree with things like fusion power and nuclear power, I already had so many solar/wind/gas/geyser power systems up that I never had to touch them.  I think this can be easily resolved with some reworking.  If they take out the upgrades you can research for said power, then they would produce so little it would force you to move up in technology.

It's a fun game with a lot of flaws - definitely worth the asking price.

Looks fun and has a lot of weapons and skills to blow everything apart.
Something between Factorio and They are billions, but with nice graphics.
But if you are looking for a survival challenge in the campaign, there is almost none. There is a survival mode tho ;) 
Has several repeating annoying quests like scan 10 of those, collect 500 of that, but they do not do too much harm to overall game experience.

Topdown shooter / ARPG, Supreme Commander like RTS base-building, tower defence, and Factorio-lite. It might not go as far into any of those concepts as a dedicated game for them would. But I just don't care, I'm having way too much fun.

The gameplay loop of exploring a planet, finding wildly different biomes and building ridiculously massive bases on them is great. One of the things I loved about supreme commander was going utterly overboard building up bases before triggering the next map objectives, and this scratches that exact same itch for me.",1634678258,1634678258,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is inspired by Factorio, but with much simpler logistics and more focus on combat and tower defense:y base building. I've only played through the campaign so far, and had fun doing so. There's also a condensed survival mode that seems nice as well.

I think some balance tweaks could help, some buildings seem overpowered as they can quite easily give nearly free mineral resources later in the game. On the other hand I found it kind of nice that the resource gathering and building management was rather streamlined.",1634677725,1634677725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
