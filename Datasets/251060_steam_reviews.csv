I now understand why people are so excited for Broken Arrow, even with how awful the multiplayer test version was (everything from netcode to balance was terrible, but the core gameplay elements and UI are so so much better than WARGAME's imo).

This game practically goes out of its' way to keep the game's mechanics murky and nonsensical, and if most RTS games have a joke of a tutorial, this one has a joke-of-a-joke of a tutorial (oh boy, PowerPoint slides that take up only 1/3 of the screen, what a fun and engaging way to learn the game...). Combine that with unsatisfying, slow gameplay, minimal effects, and a UI that you have to squint to use properly on ultrawide monitors, and it's a recipe for boredom honestly. Various units will seemingly at-random win or lose battles, which probably has to do with the ~50% average accuracy rating across the majority of units. Combat is a literal coin toss for most units, assuming all things are equal...
While Broken Arrow's multiplayer test was a disaster as far as balance and netcode goes, at least the better unit won in a 1v1 the vast majority of the time. In WARGAME, meanwhile, I've had dirt-cheap ATGM carriers outperform dedicated high-level MBTs in vehicular engagements across similar distances and under similar circumstances, even though the tutorial says something about HEAT ammo only doing 1 damage max against vehicles if it penetrates. This means that MBTs with the best AP ammo should be far-far outperforming the slower-firing, less-damaging 1-2 ATGM carriers that I have sitting in a bush somewhere on the map, even if they have the element of surprise etc. on their side.

This is before going into other elements of the game; all losses are permanent/you have no recursion options in a long match, R&R is literally as barebones as it gets, I'm not even sure if the game has hotkeys and if it does, they're not referenced in the in-game UI nor are they reasonably placed, you have no control over smoke launchers on vehicles as far as I can tell, infantry is really clunky to use, LoS cones/ranges aren't shown in any meaningful way in-game, you have to use 'muh command unit' to cap objectives (since when are the grunts not the ones taking territory in war, can someone explain that to me? lmao ok Eugen), bait-and-switch SEAD missions can't really be set up correctly, ships weren't very well-integrated and absolutely destroy everything unless hard-countered, etc.

I think I gave this game a fair try, I played with the deck system and skirmished against the AI but the game never really explained itself through gameplay or UI as I experimented with different things. I tried one of the campaigns but gave up after quickly realizing how clunky the meta-map controls were, I couldn't even arrange for an infantry brigade/company/whatever to attack a tile alongside a tank company that was supposed to lead the charge, even though both groups had the movement capacity to do so. This game is almost 10 years old yet it reminds me of an early access RTS as far as the UI and gameplay goes, which has been deeply frustrating and disappointing. At this point I cannot recommend anything made by Eugen Systems, they've done nothing but disappoint me since R.U.S.E. and I'm surprised that WARGAME has gained such a following in all honesty.

I've never seen a RTS game try so little to explain what's going on at any given moment yet have so many positive reviews, this is surreal, and I wish I could appreciate whatever it is that I'm missing out on that makes the game so great, because I'm not seeing it and I cannot recommend this game.",1708897077,1708897077,False,0,0,0.483870983123779297,0,True,False,False

[h3]SUPPORT DECK:[/h3] Deck only has logi trucks, artillery, mortars and AA vehicles. Start of match it bought majority logi trucks, then artillery and anti-air here and there. Logi trucks stayed mostly at spawn for whole match. Artillery would run out of gas and ammo. Never get any resupply.

[h3]AIRFORCE DECK:[/h3] Deck had noncombat commander and the rest planes. Spawned just the commanders and charged them against the enemy to then get taken out. It did nothing after that. Not one plane was called in. The enemy however did call in about a dozen bombers for my lone commander.

[h3]AIRBORNE DECK:[/h3] Deck was only helicopter infantry and Stallion logi. It never called in any of the Super Stallions. It did however call in swarms of heli infantry to charge the enemies AA and never unloaded.

[h3]ARMOR DECK:[/h3] Deck was mostly armored with focus on ground vehicles. It had more logi trucks and helicopters than I can count. Vehicles would charge the enemy with no thought until they ran out of gas. Even with no ammo, they would still move forward until they ran out of gas. Not one of the logies resupplied.

I think it’s safe to say there’s no need to continue on testing. The Ai is a zombie swarm that does nothing at all. To call it an Ai would be a disservice to Koopas in Super Mario Bros FROM THE EIGHTIES! It clear, in 2024 as of today, no thought at all was put into the Ai into doing anything tangible. Not even an IF STATEMENT as a conditional for when a vehicle runs out of gas to refuel it with a logi. This is seriously embarrassing. Wargame Red Dragon released in 2014 and the task of adding an OUT OF GAS conditional has yet to be implemented into the game. WARNO and any other future products are a MASSIVE steer clear.

There's a huge variety of units, nations, and maps. The range and effectiveness of units is intended to imitate reality as much as possible. Units like artillery, aircraft, and main battle tanks are incredibly lethal. Concealment and scouting are very important. This makes ambushes rewarding and effective, but avoiding them can also be tedious. The result is an RTS that plays very differently than most others (in both good and bad ways). 

Determining which units can defeat what, how far different units can see or fire, and exactly how aircraft and anti aircraft should be deployed can be a frustrating exercise in trial and error, but it's also satisfying when it all comes together.

Thus far, I have not been disappointed. The game has a steep learning curve (for me anyway...being new to the genre). The game allows for micro-mgmt of individual/small group units. There is also a multi-command option for most units that I'm still learning to perfect. The beauty of this game though reveals itself by REQUIRING the use of a combined-arms force to win. This game will not allow one to 'spam' up on tanks and roll into the contested map grids to win...Lol...that's an easy win for the solo game AI...you will be vsf before you know it! As of now, my 46 hrs of gameplay have been limited to single-player ""solo"" skirmishes. The game has several campaign scenarios. However, due to the learning curve, it's best to start at the skirmishes first. The campaign scenarios begin as a turn-based dynamic style board game, but the battles are fought RTS. During my prior game research, I viewed the T-B approach to be a turnoff; the few times I've tinkered with the campaign portion of the game, the blend of the two game styles has surprisingly been to my liking.

If you know nothing of combined-arms warfare, you will die quickly. It's that simple. Luckily, there are several 'player guides' posted by those in the Steam WG RD community pages to help the novice player (the 2000's term is 'noob' ....I believe). Use them. The game offers a multi-player aspect. However, I purchased this particular game as a single-player escape. My understanding is that the online MP community is quite competitive....

In short, if you like combined arms warfare, you will enjoy this game. It will require a learning curve, if you're new to the genre, but the satisfaction of torching the competent AI is worth it. There are two basic ways to win the game, one is by points or total destruction. I enjoy the latter because...well...stemming back to my Corps days, I like total annihilation of the enemy. The game offers a time limit or no limit when playing by points or annihilation. If playing without a time limit, a skirmish game may take a couple hours (or more depending upon your settings) to finish. Run the tutorials and check out the player guides to understand the settings...there are many and they can be complex.

The game has plenty of depth and the AI difficulty can be adjusted...I've found it to be quite competitive. Enjoy!  SF",1706686793,1706686793,True,5,0,0.544574260711669922,0,True,False,False

Choosing who was fighting who, setting them all up on a battlefield that sprawled across the front room carpet before letting all Hell loose (and occasionally removing said soldiers from our pet dog's mouth) filled many rainy afternoons. The Red Dragon experience gives me the same feeling and satisfaction. It's like the greatest war chest of toy soldiers I have ever owned.

Before we start, I'm writing this for a specific niche of player, a curious beast seldom seen, cautious and wary of change, only seeking gaming pleasure in solitude. Yes, I'm writing a review dedicated to those offline, single player types and I make no apology for it.

This is the 3rd game of the franchise, and I've put a few hours into the previous ones, but this one seems to hold my attention as it gives me a host of options that allow me to play the game as I want it at the pace and difficulty I prefer (slow and easy - like my good self). More on this later.

As you probably know, Wargame: Red Dragon is a modern battle simulator set in Asia and allows you to create as many alternative history battles as your heart could wish for. With units ranging in date from the 1960's to late 90's, there's an impressive amount of hardware for you to get your virtual paws on. I'd say you're looking at well over 1500 units of all shapes and sizes, this game also includes naval elements (I'll get to that later).

In terms of countries, you've got a broad range of BLUFOR representation; US, UK, France, Germany and the REDFOR line-ups present you with some new faces such as China, North Korea and (as was) Czechoslovakia. Another awesome addition is the paid DLC which brings in Israel and a very under-represented nation - South Africa. There are a total 8 DLC packages, 4 of the free.

One facet of the game that enthrals me for hours is the ability to create your own decks. This allows you to mix and match units from any country (of the same side only - you can't blend Red and Blufor) but the scope within this is about limitless. You can restrict a deck to a specific country of course, or by certain date parameters or equally by unit type (mechanized. armoured) - these factors will offer greater rewards but will also obviously make for restrictions. The whole game balances these factors perfectly. Look at any unit and you'll find yourself weighing up speed versus armour, hit power against defence, experience versus quantity. 


Gameplay
After I've got a new deck, then it's time to try it out. My favourite option is Solo / Skirmish mode. Choose a deck, choose your opponent, chose your map, choose how long you want to fight and what the victory conditions are - then it's go-time! Personally, gaming should not be a stress-inducing adrenalin rush that pushes my blood pressure up and causes me to have teen-like computer rage. I set my opponents on Easy. I'm not ashamed to say this because I genuinely believe there are others out there that enjoy the distraction of gaming, without it causing them to step nearer to meeting their maker. Maybe it's an age thing. The BEST feature the guys at Eugen have added is the ability to control the speed of the game. Instead of my heart fluttering and having to spend time racing around the large map wildly clicking on every unfolding shitshow, I can now take my time. 

Side battles and tactical encounters can be savoured. I enjoy watching each of these vignettes, they capture the feel of battle perfectly and you can really see the loving detail that has gone into the games' development. As I write this, I'm reminded of a scene where I could observe a pair of Chieftain Mk.2 tanks manoeuvre across a wreckage strewn bridge, and they did so perfectly, steering round the flaming wrecks. Whilst this is one tiny snapshot of the hours I've spent, there are countless moments like this in every game. 

One aspect of the game that I really enjoy is how you have to adopt real life tactics. It's not the type of game whereby you can just spam the enemy with every tank you've got and they'll finally succumb to your firepower. Attacks need to be thought out, using balanced forces. Sending a column of tanks into battle without any air defence is going to get them in trouble - just as it would in real life. Understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses is key, as is knowing which units support each other. 

Red Dragon also has a series of campaigns too. I'm at the early stages of this and still finding my feet with it, which is code for ""still getting my a$$ kicked"". Varied challenges using a lot of units you'd probably never choose. All with a far east slant. 

I'm going to mention the Naval element. He's my take on it, it's not of any great depth (haha), shallow BUT does add a great twist by having enemy forces that can now attack from sea. The coastal/river encounters are much better than the all out sea battles but if you're expecting a ""Harpoon"" level of complexity, then this isn't the one. It's a nice sideshow, but I find I don't dabble with fishes too often.

OK man, you love this game, tell me what you would change? Aside from the naval section, I'm gutted that there aren't a couple of European maps. There's such a high representation of these nations, it would be great to see East and West Germany slogging it out without a backdrop of paddy fields and Asian inspired architecture. Sadly, there's no mod tools to allow this, and I think the devs have moved on to their next endeavour, so this isn't likely to happen. 

I've hardly broke the surface of this fine game but if you're looking for a modern, military RTS, that has a great level of detail, then I'd suggest you give this a chance.",1702908276,1706272346,True,68,0,0.849564135074615479,1,True,False,False

This is highly recommended for modern RTS fans where the focus is on more realistic combined arms combat compared to base building and spam rushing your opponent and who ever clicks faster wins.

Wargame chat is a meme on it's own and it can sometimes take a while to get a game. The community while smaller these days, still provides heaps of help learning or getting updated with unit balance changes and the current meta as well as the ability to arrange balanced games and work together as a team. 

The Wargame franchise really is a new standard for RTS games, just be aware that it can take a while to get a handle of the game mechanics - it can be punishing at first and have a steep learning curve, especially in multiplayer.  I really recommend this for anyone who is interested in a modern RTS.  No need to worry about base building, the game is purely about combined arms combat and controlling the battlefield. My only bugbear is that the AI could use a lot of work to really improve the single player experience (or and it can cheat haha)

Hoping for Wargame 4 - if they add modding tools, adjustable loadouts, workshop support, a map and campaign editor it could be the best modern RTS ever. The South African DLC (2021) was a much welcomed late content edition.",1397723980,1704188283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven't played it, but Red Dragon is superior to WARNO because you can have the unmitigated joy of concocting the craziest deck imaginable.  The deck builder is a good chunk of the fun in this game, and they restricted your possibilities in WARNO.  Yes, some units are more effective than their point value should indicate, but flexible deck-builder enables anyone to access those same OP units.

There is a lack of urban-heavy maps.  Also, every single map uses an East Asian tileset.  For a game that includes such a broad and historically accurate array of equipment, I'm surprised at the stark lack of map variety.  Both the appearance and ""feel"" of the maps in this game feel fairly homogeneous.  Some maps are arid mediterranean-ish and are light on trees, and a few have a fair bit of elevation, but overall they're just kinda same-y.

With 815 hours of gameplay, my appreciation for its complex and nuanced approach to military tactics has only grown.

The game's strength lies in its vast and varied arsenal, allowing for intricate planning and execution of diverse strategies. Each unit type, from ground to naval forces, is crafted with attention to detail, reflecting real-world military capabilities of the era. This variety enables a highly dynamic gameplay experience, where adaptability and strategic foresight are key.

However, the game is not without its flaws. Multiplayer sessions can be marred by technical issues like desynchronization, which can detract from the otherwise immersive experience. Additionally, the representation and balance of some nations feel less polished, impacting the overall strategic depth. The AI, while competent, does not fully capture the unpredictability of human opponents, leading to a more predictable challenge in single-player scenarios.

In summary, Wargame: Red Dragon stands out for its comprehensive and realistic approach to strategy gaming, offering a challenging and rewarding experience for RTS enthusiasts. Despite its minor drawbacks, it remains a highly recommended title for those seeking a deep and authentic military strategy game.",1703060118,1703060118,True,5,0,0.574132263660430908,0,True,False,False

There is absolutely no use for any single ship or small group of ships. The blob is all that matters.

If you're new to this series, you'll have a very hard time trying to figure out what to do since there's no official tutorial system in the game aside from reading large paragraphs of ""what to do"" in-game, and that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. It won't show you how the game works or offer any idea to somebody wanting to try this. Campaign's are too difficult due to false difficulties that even going against a ""Normal"" AI will seem like you're going against a ""Hard"" or ""Very Hard"" opponent. Then once in-game, if you were looking for a great actiony styled RTS where you can see the carnage and explosions from units moving about like what you saw in the trailers for this game, well you're not gonna get that. It's impossible to see any of the units in-game due to how you have to keep track of EVERY detail of EVERY unit as you zoom back to the moon in order to see what you need to command and manage. Granted this is a nice feature which is rare to find in many games. But overall having to babysit so many units across big maps give you zero chances to actually see your units or look cloesly at the battle. It is the equivelant of playing ""Axis and Allies"" the board game in real time with boxes moving about the screen to tell you the name of units. This is sad since the detail that was put into these units is quite impressive, especially when you have 15+ nations to choose and assort with. As for the menu system, good luck trying to find and set up a game with a friend. As for the menu side of things, you are REQUIRED to make an account for this game due to it being a 3rd party company. Yes this is a small annoyance, but then trying to add your friend after setting up these accounts is frustrating since the adding buttons don't work unless you open them in a specific way.  I enjoy most RTS's, like Command and Conquer, Total War, and others, but this one doesn't do it right with all these small problems.

What I dislike about RD:
- Single-player campaigns are not interesting 
- Naval battles are not interesting yet
- Some airplanes are costly, fast but so fragile (I don't understand. Is it realistic?)
- It seems AI hasn't changed
- Eugen stopped supporting Linux and Mac players. Ir order to play online I'm forced to use Proton and windows version of the game

I followed it back when it was in beta and had friends tell me all about it in the months up to when I could actually buy it myself. Since installation, it has never left my computer not once ever. Games come and go. Passions come and go. Friends are made and depart. I graduated school. Got a job. Worked for many years. I've aged, and yet I still always come back. I'll always come back.

Wargame: Red Dragon is my favorite Real Time Strategy game of all time. I was brought up on Command and Conquer, Age of Mythology, Empire at War and Medieval II: Total War. RTS is in my blood for as long as I can remember, and this game shines at the very top of all of them. The games from my chilldhood, my teenage years and then as an adult. It is the most complicated game I've ever played and mastered, and yet it still has this innate simplicity to it that remains beautiful.

There are no bases or building. There are no gathers or resources. There are no wonders or superweapons. There is only combat. War. Battle, carnage and death. How many millions have I sent to the grave to take a zone? A question that will never be answered. There is no one way to play. There is no meta that one must be a slave to. There is no requirement for actions-per-minute or micro intensity. Wargame has none of these. One may pick a nation from either side of the Cold War and put units in it. From the latest and greatest, most high tiered technological marvels. To Private Shabhead, his platoon, a beat up M113 and enough high explosive bombs to smite God Himself.

Nearly ten years later this masterpiece lives on, unknown to many and forgotten by even more. But I won't forget. I will still be here playing this game until they shut it down in favor of Eugen's latest RTS that is trying to do something else. I hope they come back, one day. Make Wargame 4, or even more updates. New maps. Nations. Anything really. But I don't think so.

I will simply say this, to any would-be buyer. Do you enjoy Real Time Strategy? Are you less interested in the minutiae of base building? Do you enjoy complex games? Do you enjoy games that make you think, and continually learn and evolve? If so, you may just like Wargame: Red Dragon.

251060,135560191,76561198881953757,0,49,12829,0,12788,1695315323,"Wargame: Red Dragon is the best example I know of a great RTS somewhat ruined by a toxic player base.

A modern military RTS, Red Dragon on its own is a genuinely good strategy game. Each unit, down to each type of tank, or aircraft have their own positives and negatives, it's very in depth. You'll even have to keep your units resupplied on the frontline with stuff such as fuel and ammunition to keep in the fight.

Red Dragon has a pretty large amount of nations and coalitions to choose from, some being better than others (North Korea). And again, they have their own perks and drawbacks. Red Dragon isn't an RTS where you can just send your whole army forward and expect immediate victory, you'll have to think, set up lines of defence, use recon to see what your enemy is planning and go on the offensive when it's appropriate in order to come out on top.

Personally, I love the destruction aspect of Red Dragon, sometimes you'll accidentally create Bakhmut 2.0 and end up with a completely destroyed town and thousands dead after a fight, it's a small but interesting and realistic detail.

This game doesn't work like your standard RTS, like Eugen often does, you build a deck of units to bring into matches, and decks can fulfil different purposes, such as having an armoured deck, giving you access to more tanks, and an airbone, giving you access to more helicopters and aircraft for example. It is very in depth, and gives Red Dragon much more replayability in my eyes.

Now, the negatives.

First of all, the community. My god. If you have never played this game before and want to, don't expect to be warmly welcomed lol. This is by far the most toxic (yet sometimes hilarious) community in a game I've seen, and I've played Rainbow Six Siege and Dead By Daylight. Expect insults, death threats and your mom jokes, and get used to them. Its normal.  However even I admit, Warchat is the last bastion of free speech on the globe.

Secondly, the AI. As someone who personally loves single player games, the AI in Red Dragon is a pretty big letdown. There is no form of strategy, it's just plowing units at yours until you kill them all or they kill all of yours. Regardless of what deck or type of deck the AI is given, it's almost always the same result.

Overall, if you're fine with pretty hostile players, and want a good RTS with modern units, this is a great choice. If you're sensitive to strangers saying how they raw dogged your mother, stay away.

-Decent Graphics for an RTS, even in today standards( Warno takes the crown here tho)
-Lots of deck building possibilities, with unspec, and specialized, nation, coalition or faction decks, making it have a lot more variety than other Eugen titles.

Let me tell you, this game is nothing short of exceptional. As a passionate strategy enthusiast, I find myself constantly drawn back to Red Dragon for its immersive gameplay and the lively community that surrounds it.

What truly sets Red Dragon apart is its vibrant and dedicated player base. It's incredible to see that even years after its launch, the game still boasts a large and enthusiastic community.

(ONE Player Review)

 Once again the Wargame franchise has ditched the decent, long, well thought out and balanced ""rts"" campaign experience for the hectic, time limited, rushed online method of crash play. Don't expect any sort of actual combat planning sim here...its just another dump, spawn and move as fast as you can typical Wargame mess Ive come to expect since their last release. Theres so many different units, with so much possibility here, its almost sad they did this again. You'd think they wouldve learned after the Airlands botched single player campaign, but apparently not. 

You quite literally start EVERY battle, no matter what size of force with a 20min time clock..... and that just sucks right outta the gate. You have massive troop counts of all sorts, and all kinds of possible attack strategies......BUT.... it really doesn't matter with such limited battlefield time combined with the fact you have to accumulate recruitment points by capturing/holding sections before you can even start to deploy more. Even the thought of flying a covert group of seals in behind enemy lines, or planning a smart well executed assault on a section of land is almost absurd in this game.  By the time you fly them in, unload them and attempt to move them...your already crushed by the mass spawned army of tanks and artillery that rush and bombard your command unit 2minutes into the game. Youre best just to spawn a bunch of heli's or heavy tanks and just buttrush their start area EVERYTIME...and thats just lame.
According to the devs, in modern ""realistic"" war as they claim this is, all you need to do is find a good hiding spot for 20mins with your command vehicle... or just wipe out their command unit instantly and all those other hundreds of soldiers, armoured vehicles, helicopters and fighter jets you brought with you just decide its not worth it today, retreat before they even get to the battlefield and its game over, another province/state lost 

 I should restate for the record, this is not a review for the online play. I honestly couldn't be bothered to even try it online after sampling the 1player and watching the same 3 guys trolling the chatroom three nights in a row.  Such a dissapointment for Solo players yet again.

ONE BIG FAT THUMBS DOWN for a second dissapointing solo player Wargame...with another thumbs down on the side for the dev's themselves who once again created a great core game only to turn around and bury it with unneeded forced play restrictions and horrible community support... completely killing the entire ""rts/strategy"" playing experience!

I have played this game for 724.8 hours (according to Steam).

Great graphics and audio, great attention to detail on the units but the more you play the more you find it is lacking.

Very poor AI. This is more of an arcade ""shoot 'em up"" rather than an actual strategy game. AI dismounts at spawn points and runs to the fight. No flanking maneuverers, no diversions, poor logistics support, simply there is no strategy, just pile forward. 

AI spawn rates appears higher than player spawn rates.

Weapons on, or weapons off. No stealth option (return fire when fired upon), no ambush option. No return fire or tactical withdrawal if units are fired upon when a unit is instructed to move from A to B. The unit will continue forward without returning fire and usually be exterminated.

Helicopter dismounts, from ""elite"" units can take an age.  No tactical flying by helicopters (low flying), though you can adjust the height of the hover), when instructing a helicopter to land while in flight the helicopter will climb ridiculously and expose its position to opposing forces. 

AI enemy units have far greater accuracy over player units, with AI enemy often hitting first time and requires less shots to destroy player units. AI units require much more ""hits"" from player units to destroy the AI units. Tanks and AFV's can fairly quickly sink ships, but ships have little impact on tanks or AFV's.

Player recce/stealth units are quickly discovered. When directing artillery on to AI units, AI units then move. 

AI never uses helicopter logistics units.

Aircraft fly over enemy controlled territory (where enemy anti-aircraft units are undoubtedly placed) and get shot down quickly, rather than avoid enemy controlled territory. This occurs even when trying to set waypoints (click by click by click by click) to try and manage the approach to a target. 

Player often loses other units while trying to micro manage one unit. 

There is a glitch that remains unfixed (and never will be), when players select units, other units - anywhere on the playing map - will also be selected, and the player usually won't know until random player units move to random areas on the map, often getting attacked and destroyed as the units go for a wander through enemy areas.

And that claxon!!! No option to change the sound, reduce volume or switch off.

Wargame: Red Dragon could be absolutely awesome. 

But it isn't, sadly.

However what lies under the clouds of complex mechanics is a fantastic and infinitely re-playable game. But how so? Once you understand basic mechanics of war such as logistics (tanks can't run without fuel, AA can't function without missiles) and combined arms warfare (Tanks need AA support to protect themselves from aircraft), you discover that the game is easier than what it appears to be and from that, the experience will never be the same again. You will see that war is not black and white and there you will see the depth of the game makes Civilization 6 and Total war tremble and drool (they can't cope with complexity and smart AI).

However, this game is not for the faint hearted. It is a fast action precise and intricate game that requires actual though and critical thinking that many other strategy games don't require. Why is that? Point and clicking is no longer viable. Like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia pointed and clicked its units on Kyiv and expected to take it. They did not. The game requires strategy and finesse and once you master it, You will feel infinitely prouder, especially when playing as the Chinese and beating the Americans who have more tanks, better tanks and an air-force that would make the average air enthusiast wet their pants at the sight of ever single armored unit being vaporized on the map because you forgot to place AA.
Just play the Americans, with the capitalist free liberal market behind their back, Its an easy win. They have more of everything and everything is technologically advanced compared to the concrete block wonderland that is the USSR and its speed bump puppet states called the ""Warsaw pact"".

I love playing with other people in tactical games. You can really use your wits and skill to out-manoeuvre the enemy or spring a surprise attack on them. The game is very in depth with advanced strategies such as strategically deploying smoke artillery rounds so that you can advance your units to a strategic position or take out enemy units. I love coordinating attacks with people on multiplayer or communicating and giving other people support when they call for supply trucks or infantry to area for example.

What I like most about this game is the combat requires good sense and planning while also minimizes the amount you actually have to micromanage. The closes game I can compare this to is [i]Company of Heroes[/i], but that franchise has a lot more nuance and micromanaging of units.

A couple other cool features of this game is (1) the ""deck"" building, and (2) the limited resources. 

(1) Prior to match-making, you can building your own ""deck"" of available units to choose from. Each unit comes with their own unique weapons, abilities, and costs to deploy.

(2) Like tabletop games, once your deck and resources are depleted, you are left with what you have deployed. Herein lies the grand strategy of the game.

Lastly, the units are balanced for the most part. Essentially every faction has their trump card. And the way the devs balanced this out was they might limit you to deploying only one unit of the type, making it expensive to deploy, or limiting the amount of ammo that unit has. Either way, every unit type has a counter. And no matter how good your unit is, even the most basic of counter units will act as a hard counter. E.g. AT soldier vs. tank, or simple AA gun (no rockets) vs plane.

I hope to see a new addition to this franchise in the coming years.

Be warned: this game has a steep learning curve, and it's much more based in real world tactics than your standard RTS. The addition of naval units is pretty fun, as now everything from river gunboats to destroyers is added to the fray, along with your standard assortment of tanks, trucks, planes, helicopters, and infantry. The number of units is pretty astounding, though I'd say about 40-50% of them are just recolors with new camo and maybe a different gun on top. This is especially bad on the Communist/REDFOR side, though the USSR did basically just export its designs to all of its vassal states, so this can be somewhat forgiven for the sake of historical accuracy. It's too bad that the multiplayer community is extremely small and the people in it are awful. Wanna play a game online? Be prepared to have half your team quit as soon as you start losing. There's really no penalty for it; hell, once enough people leave even I'll surrender. It's really not fun, unless you get to steamroll the other team, I guess. The multiplayer problems with this game could probably be fixed through just more exposure, or at least a fix to the matchmaking system so that you can join games in progress if someone quits out or something. Solo skirmishes are okay, and the AI is challenging enough even on medium difficulty (or maybe I'm just bad), though I've also heard it cheats, which isn't very helpful if you're just trying out a new set up for your army. If you want a highly-realistic RTS or are just tired of the standard RTS formula of games like Starcraft and Command and Conquer, or if you're a fan of modern military equipment, I'd recommend this, though I would wait for it to go on sale just in case you end up not liking it.",1404194208,1676187537,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

AAA can't shoot in any of the places people historically put AAA pieces because radar guided AAA needs direct line of sight or they are useless. AAA has ranges that are too short to kill jets unless you have 4-6 pieces in any one location which is a solid 300 points you will never have to spend in a multiplayer game against people or ai. Helicopters are pure cancer and completely ruin the balance of ground engagements. The maps are mostly bad and theres maybe 4 playable maps in a pool of 50. No map editor.

2023 Updated Game Review (More Detailed):
There are a few things that have caught my eye in this game that I hope are fixed/Improved on or Just Implemented in general due to some unrealistic moments that have happened here and there in this game.

1. When evacuating aircraft out of the warzone they SHOULD NOT be evacuating into enemy territory aka (making a turn left or right into their territory.) The Unbelievable amount of aircraft I have lost just evacuating them and they decide to do it towards enemy territory is frustrating!

2. When an Aircraft is being Fired on they should be doing Maneuvers not just deploying flares and continue going in circles. They should dodge those Missiles with flares to improve the chance of escaping those Missiles. 

3. Something nice that could be implemented into the next iteration is for Airborne Aircraft for us to set a boundary line mode where they will not cross into enemy territory and back to default mode which is what we have now. This reduces the chance of your aircraft going into enemy territory mindlessly.

4. Russian Tanks seem to be super OP to me. After watching Plenty of Russian Tank videos such as T-74 and T-80 videos They are made in this game to be very tough. And yes they are tough but almost too tough. Countless artillery and tank shots I shoot at those T-80s and T-74s they just don't wanna die. There must be a technique I must be Missing... But one thing for sure there needs to be some sort of nerf.",1672543356,1675187901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Each game serves different players. While I prefer Steel Division, I appreciate the nuances of Red Dragon. They are both complex, detailed, and tactical in their own way, but the implementation and the mechanics of Steel Division offer the player a more diverse and enjoyable experience. The campaigns of Red Dragon (of which I tried two), offer variety because the player makes their own choices, with battles connected from to the next, but each battle, especially when they occur again and again on the same map with similar units and outcomes become a repetitive bore.

My first review was written after 40 hrs of gameplay, my second written after 200 hours, and this will by my final one as I feel that I truly understand the game now. This is my journey through Wargame Red Dragon.

I had started by watching a video on the game and sort of forgot about it for about a year, until my friend who had recently downloaded it reminded me of it. I read some reviews and decided to buy it. I started playing campaign and relised quickly that this game would take some time to learn, and the learning has never stopped, even now. My first 20 hours or so were brutal, I played one battle over and over, determines to defeat the North Koreans in the first battle of Busan Harbor. These battles taught me the importance of the, as the AI would throw themselves at me and I had to figure out a way to not only repel them, but to counterattack and destroy them. I can now say that should you decide to get the game, dont play the campaign for too long, play against a friend or skirmishes, you will learn more faster, and then play the campaign.

Between 20-30 hours or so into the game I almost exclusively played against the AI with my friend, each of us trying to learn as much as possible. We did, and soon a victory previously determined by luck was now determined by our skill to react. I then felt pretty good about myself so I decided to go into a 1v1 against someone on multiplayer. 
It was a slaughter, I remember sitting there thinking to myself how this could have happened as my push was wiped out through tactics and units I was only now getting exposed to. I asked the player after this game essentially how to get good, he told me to do what he did (he had 1300 hrs unknown to me) and play 10v10s. 

To this day, this is the best advice i received on this game. playing with that many people means i could sit back and play artillery while also watching my more experienced teammates  and how they played the game. This I did for maybe 30 or so hours, at the end of which I came out a completely different player.

The rest of my time had been a blur, battles mostly lost over time turned to mostly won, and I was having fun the whole time. I have read other reviews and have seen comments on the state of the community, and although I will say no sane person will look at or converse in warchat, I have also met people that I continue to play with to this day, both on wargame and other games aswell. The game itself has over a thousand units, and I can confidently say that I have memorized hundreds of them, their functions, and other units they pair well with.

This brings us to now, I can happily say that this game made up 25% of my 2022 playtime alone and I have no issues with that whatsoever. If your thinking about getting the game I cannot emphasize enough that you should. Behind the learning curve is sasitfication at what you have learned and done. Ive met cool people, facists, communists, many racists, and people with schizophrenia, this game has all of them.

Featuring units, vehicles, and prototype military equipment from the era in a ""Cold War gone hot"" (1950s-1995 mostly- some earlier ww2 equipment still obviously in use for many). Gameplay is heavily reliant on tactics and combined arms, though a proper helicopter rush with the right coalition is kind of hard to beat.
While some individual units are quite powerful almost nothing gets done in this game without some combined arms action, Infantry units can set up sneaky ambushes from along roads and take out tanks rushing a little bit too quickly to take good shots, but a proper push may require an artillery barrage or helo rocket salvo to stun or suppress entrenched units as you push forward with IVFs and tanks. You may need to drop napalm bombs or apply it in other ways to wipe out entrenched infantry in a few city blocks or heavily wooded area because you just can't get close enough to duke it out in CQC, your pushes and defensive lines need to be watched over by AA guns or SAMs to ward off helicopters and bombers/strike craft, but beware, sneaky SEAD slinging aircraft can snipe your exposed radar-bearing AA Guns and SAMS with ease, but are often juicy targets themselves.

Honestly this is the best Wargame has to offer in terms of being a complete package. It has multiple campaigns, most of which are a decent romp. The multiplayer is great (just don't look at wargame chat) and can be set up to provide a decent variety of interesting game types with... albeit lackluster map variety. The DLC generally all offer an interesting nation (coalitions sometimes too) to play in skirmish or MP, but we all wish they could have come with some campaigns.

I hope WARNO can one day catch up, but it is just missing a lot of stuff.

Not sure where should I start...

Wargame is such a damn good game with so much potential to be exploited that went out of luck... really really unfortunate.

Getting into Wargame is essentially playing RUSE on steroids. I'm not sure if they're made by the same people or not. I haven't fully tried the main campaign and the ""risk-esque"" style that it allows you to play. I've mostly done Skirmishes on multiplayer or against/with AI. I have found however, installing the ""Sandbox"" mod does provide a better gameplay on the Skirmish side so you aren't farming for points the entire match only to get a handful of units out to defend. The gameplay is ""realistic"" to a point, vehicles have limited ammo/fuel, older vehicles like the Sherman and Stug are generally worse than the newer vehicles as well as having worse armor. The DLC doesn't make you overpowered by any means but allows you to enhance and learn new play styles as different countries. Not to mention all countries have a weak point and a strong point. I.E.

Expect to get zergrushed by 50 separate helicopter units mounted with ATGMs and/or rocketpods and/or machine guns. Naval combat is the same in principle as well, but with the added caveat of ""dude just spam anti-ship aircraft and dong-haes lmao"".

Campaign is irrelevant, the AI cheats and makes moves in reaction to what you reveal to it. Neat editing style for the introductions and neat writing for the scenarios though. Except for Busan Pocket, that's just the Korean War but in the 80s.

UPDATE 18/10/2020: The community is as disgusting and toxic as ever. Even when I have muted every single player I come across you nonetheless get insults over in-game text beacons - Eugen needs to literally enable the player to block all forms of communication (chat, text beacons etc) with the nasty, racist and despicable people who play this game. Can only hope that the upcoming Regiments, Cold War Game and Broken Arrow either have a better community or implement better muting settings while also going beyond in terms of gameplay; at which point I will be glad to delete this game permanently from my library and be done with Eugen Systems for good.

Decent game but probably the nastiest online multiplayer community I have ever encountered. The sad reality as someone pointed out accurately on reddit is that Wargame's 'potential audience (autists, ex-soldiers, neo-nazis, russian nationalists) isnt big enough for it to be a comercial success'. To which someone replied 'nutshell.' https://www.reddit.com/r/wargame/comments/5nke5w/viability_of_wgrd_as_an_esport/

So it is no surprise the games community are so terrible. (However, I do hope they eventually make a new Wargame set in a near-future conflict with next generation technology and involving Nato, China, Russia and Iran etc - I can only hope this might generate a new player base of less vulgar people...). In Wargame: Red Dragon the online community are mostly (although not everyone of course (but must be 75%)) an aggregate of some really nasty people. I cannot recommend the game therefore because multiplayer is the best aspect and yet the games are always full of a lot of arrogant, argumentative, rude, aggressive and hostile people (nasty pieces of work sums it up). For this reason you can barely ever just enjoy a game without some sub-human racist trying to pick a fight over every aspect of the game or some egoist blowing his own trumpet so hard it makes you want to vomit with disgust. People sprouting pathetic insults everywhere, complaining constantly and sometimes even team killing your units to be antagonistic. If you can find enjoyment beyond this fact the actual game is pretty awesome. I however have decided to uninstall the game to avoid this perpetual abuse.",1561163842,1659373102,False,5,1,0.45670396089553833,0,True,False,False

 But hey, at least it's fun to waste minutes of your time trying to find the exact pixel that will send your useless units into the bush that will turn them invisible. (= sarcasm)

2022 edit (since I got dragged back to it by friends): In short the game is a macro strategy decided by luck at the micro level with limited controls which constantly distracts you from both the macro and the micro level by the need to resupply everything topped of with an AI that's incredibly inept, cheating blatantly and unfun to fight.

2.never start fight w/ the poor, weak, disabled in english language ppls
3.I joined your server before rule 10-12 ever existed
4.fix your tongue like ""next time speak more human"" just because somebody's grammar are poor
5.do not pretend every country know here & there, I do not recognize BritB0ngs is a rude but rather beloved callings, but if you insist, I will embargo it, boicot it to the ashes, even Im ex British die-hard supporter & rank 7 of 28 student in my classroom in english language proficiency(you ultimately disrespect & commit rule 03 of discrimination)
6.all blocked ppls upon my death, I pray to the God who create me, let him judge based on karma, I will remember this, all they do to me this 1 year 27 day staying at EUG Sys discord server, I WILL REMEMBER TILL MY DEATH I swear
7.you never know what other discord server react to your realm, that is pathethic, they disgust of EUG Sys discord server
8.next time shut up instead or at least spread 100000 english teacher+free internet for all humanity, if in case you would come in mind ""i D0nT UnDERstanD wHAt yOuR mEAN"" or ""s0wry m8 I caN't UNDERstAnD anY ShiT yOu sAy""
that just waste my time, better say something better n more value to listen than empty unhelpful stuff like that. Imagine wanting something like ""understanding"" but don't have the real effort to put
9.banning me from discord just because their personal butthurt ain't going anywhere mate, you reap what you sow, now get lost Im banning your entire game from my sight as well

Think Men of War Assault Squad 2 + Starcraft 2. It has the rock paper mechanics of starcraft with some of the complexity of MWAS2.

It has the rock-paper-scissors of Starcraft in the sense that AA will counter-air, etc. However, if you don't hide your AA an armored bomber that could tank some light aa might just airstrike. There is an element of complexity like in Men of War, well it depends in the unit's unique mixture of stats, and how it's deployed.

Combine arms like real life is important in this game, and understanding that is easy. Doing it in a timely, effective fashion is hard. Say there's an open field, you want to push across, you'll need tanks for firepower, and AA to cover those tanks. If there is a forest or town on the other end of the field, you'll need some infantry to screen the town/woods, so your tanks can shoot the enemy infantry from afar without getting an rpg in the side armor. 

Coordinating all these units in a timely fashion to provide ample cover is difficult, and this game also has an economy. You get points over the duration of a match, and each unit in your deck cause X points to summon, so if you have a 180 point super heavy, and the enemy has a 100 point anti-tank plane, they are going to dive-bomb that tank despite aa coverage and walk away with an economic victory in that exchange. However, I think overcoming this learning curve is a great deal of the fun in this game, and the strats the variety of units enable are many and varied.

As far as micro-managing units go, you mirco high-value irreplaceable units in order to get your money's worth/ lower exposure. For example, you manually queue waypoints to plot a flight path for your bomber to avoid AA, etc.

I also hate carpel tunnel.
I enjoy the idea of chess-like real time battles but without having to slam between 15 different bases while also controlling various units all in real time while producing factories and other shit.


I also like that I can focus on real time micro, my units don't miss for an hour and a half before wiping squads, flanks and scouting are rewarded and that the ""cover system"" isn't a snoozefest like CoH2 where you just have two hunkered opponents shooting like stormtroopers all day.

It's the best mix thus far of having real time tactical combat that feels almost turn based but fast and rewarding.

1) Join a multiplayer lobby only to be cussed out in 3 different languages (One is ALWAYS Russian)
2) Get mercilessly Heli-rushed by some guy with 800 hours just using that one heli deck
3) Wanting to test out a new deck that you just created to avoid using the meta to only get your world rocked by some Komandosi or Spetznaz
4) Wanting to try out a really powerful unit that an enemy was using against you, to only realize that A, its not that good, and B, it was only good because you're bad
5) Getting your expensive fighter jet that theoretically should beat anything get stunned by some drunk Ivan with a MANPAD so now your jet is left completely vunerable to even the North Korean Airforce
6) Getting frustrated to always loosing against FINPOL decks so you make one, only to get your 3-stack of Komandosi Nighthawked, and then ruthlessly pushed
7) Go back to BLUEFOR and make some deck that finally starts to click, until your glue sniffers sitting in you M163s and PIVADS to let a B5 bomber through and now you don't exactly have a fighting force
8) Decide to play with some artillery until all of your brand spanking new paladins that have been alive for 5 minutes to only get Smerched
9) Face a lot of DLC decks in Multiplayer
10) And finally, the crown jewel of the Wargame Expereince; The Global Chat. One does not explain this, one has to experience this

Overall, i despise this game due to all the mental torture it has given me. But then again sitting down with a couple of friends and playing together is super fun due to all the things you can do, including *BEST KOREA* deck spam.

Oyun gerçekten güzel ve hakettiği kadar büyük bir topluluğa ulaşamamış durumda. Oyun Soğuk Savaş döneminde geçiyor. (1975-1997). Başlıktan tahmin ettiğiniz üzere NATO pahalı, az fakat güçlü donanımlara sahipken, Doğu bloğu ucuz, çok ama daha zayıf donanımlara sahip. Oyun oldukça detaylı; Topçu, anti-hava, tank vs. neredeyse her türlü asker araç mevcut. Bunun yanısıra hepsinin bir menzili, hızı, görüş açısı, atış oranı, düşmanı panikletme, uçaklarda bombanın kilogramı aynı zamanda cinsi ve gizlilik faktörü var. Piyadeler de aynı şeylere sahipler fakat onlar da aldıkları eğitime göre sınıflandırılıyorlar. (Militan, düzenli, şok, elit) Oyunda olmayan tek şey denizaltılar. Ama hiç aratmıyor, zaten bu tür bir rtsye pek uyacağını sanmıyorum. Geliştiriciler oyuncuların stratejik dehalarını sınırlandırmamak için olsa gerek, T-34 tankını bile koymuşlar. ;) Hurra diye saldıramıyorsunuz, bölge ele geçirmeniz gerekiyor. Bunun için ise komuta birliklerini o bölgeye mümkünse ağaçların arasına yerleştirmek gerekiyor. Ve düşmanı gözetlemek için her zaman bir gözlem birliği veya helikopteri kullanmanız gerekiyor.

Kısaca kendi oynadığım ırklardan öne çıkan ünitelerini yazayım:
Rusya: Her konuda iyi.
Polonya: MORTAR YOK :O fakat iyi piyadeleri ortalama tankları var.
Doğu Almanya: Piyade ve gözlem konusunda iyiler, ağır tankları yok, uçak birimleri güzel ama çeşitliliği az.
Çekoslovakya; Destek birimleri iyi diğer birimler idare eder.
Çin: Neredeyse her konuda iyi fakat SSCB'nin biraz daha uyduruk hali. Ağır tankı yok.
Finlandiya: Piyade-tank olarak iyi, aynı zamanda amarıgadan cukkaladıkları f-18c gerçekten çok iyi uçak. Helileri kötü. Destek birimleri vasat diyebiliriz.
Yugoslavya: Piyadeleri iyi, tankları, gözlemcileri güzel. Hava kuvvetleri de iyi ama bombardıman uçağı seçeneği pek yok. Helikopterler çok az ve nispeten zayıflar. Çekoslovakya koalisyonuyla kullanmak akıllıca olur.
K.Kore: Piyade dışında tüm üniteleri zayıf. Çin-Sovyet ekipmanları kullanıyorlar.

ABD: Her konuda iyi.
BK: Piyade ve tankları iyi fena olmayan hava kuvvetlerine sahip, koalisyon halinde kullanmak çok daha mantıklı olur. Hava savunma sistemleri zayıf.
Batı Almanya: Karada iyi. Havada vasat.
Fransa: Dinamik ve hızlı birlikler,tankları da fena değil. Ama çok kırılgan.
İsveç: Piyade ve kısmen tankları iyi.
İsrail: Her konuda iyi. OP. Savunma taktiğini en iyi uygulayan faction.
Danimarka: Piyade. Diğer her şeyde vasat. Anti-Tank füzesi atan bir uçağı var o güzel. Ve OTOMATIC isimli hava savunma sistemi.
Norveç: Helileri bile yok. >:(
Kanada: Amerika gibi ama daha zayıf.
Anzaklar: İngiliz ve Kanada karışımı ama ikisinden de daha zayıf.
Japonya: Piyadeleri güzel, tankları kağıt gibi. Genel olarak zayıf.
G.Kore: Amerikan silahlarıyla savaşıyorlar. K1 tankları çok iyi. Uçakları da ortalama. 

Oyunu oynayın oynattırın. Gördüğüm en iyi modern savaş RTS oyunu.

İndirimde 19tl civarı bir şey oluyor. Gerçi şimdiki fiyatında bile her kuruşuna değer. Öbtüm.

I bought every single wargame ever since the European Escalation one.

I'm predominantly a player that doesn't play much multiplayer; I enjoy campaigns and good story setting. The political campaigns were extremely well done and interesting for me. While the DLCs they release are centric to ''factions'', I would love to see DLC releases of new strategic map campaigns.
Fighting the AI on the tactical map is sometimes a grindfest. It consistently shoves hordes of troops towards your positions and command vehicles (it knows where your units are). Fighting against advanced AI difficulties isn't easy because we're not computers : it's hard to micromanage multiple engagements effectively unless you slow the time of the battle down (which was a great add-on for Wargame Red Dragon). Playing against human players, which have the same decision-making limitations as you, is fun and makes the fighting more deliberate and interesting (unless they play to win and use cheese tactics against you).

The ability to customize your decks gives you the ability to build your own battlegroups, specific to your playstyle. You might choose an armoured battlegroup if you like to turtle up, or you might choose an airmobile battlegroup if you're more into risky moves and quick action. 

I wasn't a big fan of Navy combat, but I did enjoy amphibious insertions, especially on the strategic map. I love how with every game, your strategic flexibility was augmented.

Paid DLC are the strongest nations to play, and the Red Dragons, the coalition the game is named after, is one of the weakest in the game.

It's good macro mixed with a little bit of micro skill, and even though the game is ""busted"" in some regards with certain mechanics that are easy to abuse, it's still an excellent, well designed game. Look at the players who stick around to play it. Those who know what they're talking about have 2000 hours or more. You'll see lots of negative reviews from nerds with 100 hours who get mad they can't beat the enemy team in a 10v10 - but if you want a game with a lively 1v1 competitive scene that can carry over into casual team games, all set in the Cold War going hot in Korea, this is a good game for you. If you're new and you're planning to pick it up, check out the wargame bootcamp discord server - which can be found on the wargame bootcamp subreddit.



NOTE, AS OF THE TIME I AM WRITING THIS CAPSLOCKED TEXT, ON 11/15/2020, THIS GAME'S MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK FOR MAC OS PLAYERS. A GLITCH THAT ALLOWED INFANTRY TO TELEPORT ANYWHERE AROUND THE MAP WAS PATCHED, BUT THE DEVS ONLY PATCHED IT FOR WINDOWS. AS A RESULT, MAC PLAYERS CAN NOT NORMALLY PLAY WITH WINDOWS PLAYERS UNLESS THE WINDOWS PLAYERS ROLL BACK VERSIONS. WHY THEY DIDN'T DO IT FOR BOTH VERSIONS IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION, BUT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU OWN THE GAME AND USE MAC OS, YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO PLAY AGAINST ai AND AGAINST OTHER MAC PLAYERS. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS GAME, OWN A PC SO YOU CAN PLAY MULTIPLAYER!!!!!!



3/9/2022 Edit: With the South Africa Update, paid DLC nations have been heavily  nerfed, allowing smaller coalitions like Red Dragons, Blue Dragons, CMW, and Eastern Bloc, to become much more viable in 1v1 games. After the SA balance patch update dropped, you can basically play any coalition for the most part and do pretty well, since no coalition or national deck has outright stupidly good units for the price anymore.",1573003819,1646854160,True,20,2,0.682793498039245605,0,True,False,False

The community isn't the biggest the player count usually hovers around 400 at peak although at the time of this review it has spiked recently to around a 1000+ players. The community size isn't really an issue for me however as the campaign and skirmish modes are still a lot of fun even if the AI isn't the smartest. 

The DLC for this game is also pretty good, lots of new and updated units for the factions. I'd get them on sale since the game is quite old and their very often half price during the sales.

Overall if you're looking for a good RTS, set in the 20th century then this a very good title I would however like with the DLC reccomend getting it on sale due to it's age.

3 Eggs
14-1/2 ounce can condensed milk (sweeten milk)
1 ½  teaspoons finely shredded lime peel
1/3 cup lime juice
Baked Pastry Shell
 
Separate egg yolks from whites:  set whites aside for meringue.  In a bowl
Beat yolks till thick and lemon colored.  Stir in condensed milk and line peel.  Gradually add lime juice, beating at low speed just till combined.  Do not overbeat.  Stir in green fool coloring, if desired.  Spoon lime mixture into pastry shell.  Evenly spread meringue over filling -seal to edge.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Cool, cover and chill to store.  Makes 8 servings.
( I usually add more lime peel to give it that extra lime taste)
 
MERINGUE FOR PIE
3 egg whites 
½ teaspoon vanilla
¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
6 tablespoons sugar
 
Bring egg whites to room temperature.  In a mixing bowl combine egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed about 1 minute or till soft peaks form  (tips curl).  Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high speed about 4 minutes more or till mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks and sugar dissolves.  Immediately spread meringue over pie, carefully sealing to edge of pastry to prevent shrinkage.  Bake as directed in pie recipe

But way more in-depth and complex than anything in Total War's RTS element. Hundreds of real world units, and you have to manage your actions down to tiny details like making sure your tanks face forwards, and retreat in reverse etc. Units have weak spots on their armour (such as the back of a tank) etc, and using smart tactics can turn a battle around in seconds. There is far too much to explain here, but I highly recommend this to any fan of strategy games, this is absolutely one of the best I've played.

Reading some guides is highly recommended. The 200-page guide on Steam is a good place to start. And NO, you don't need to read 200 pages of it (whatever that means on Steam) to get a decent grasp of the game ;)

If you want a detailed, realistic modern RTS with spectacular gameplay and visuals, plus competitive multiplayer and a truly demented community of psychotic war-minded maniacs, this game is for you.

Pros: Not as grand as the Hearts of Iron series, nor not as 'tactical' as good old Operation Flash Point, this game fitted itself into a nice niche market. Other than Steel Division series, or the franchise's older games, this game provides rare, but very satisfying experience as long as you are into military stuffs. Even the deck-building feature could be fun; at least, it is for me.

Cons: If you are an average RTS player, you have a very steep learning curve to climb; this game is a different breed from the rest of the RTS genre. Your units are extremely dependent on the LoS, their responses are slow, armour works differently depending on from which side your units are hit, and the list goes on and on. So, the emphasis of the game is on the map-reading skills and patience for setting up good attack plans. There are definitely elements of hardcore micro-controls as well.
 
Also, tutorials of this game is downright useless. So, you are left on your own to learn this game. Since the game is relatively old (a new game in its franchise, WARNO would soon be available), there are plenty of resources you could turn to make your learning experience more bearable. Still, you have to go on the net to find the very basics of the game. To me, that is not tolerable.

Overall, the game is for the 'acquired' tastes - definitely not for everybody, but for a very specific niche of players. Could be on sale again when the next game comes out; in fact, the game was once free on Epic Games Store. Until then, go onto YouTube and feel around the game.",1643725903,1643725903,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

WG: RD is a top tier RTS. The only good cold war RTS that has a (battle) campaign-scale perspective while having the depths and complexity to give both historical immersion and fun things to do as a game.

When you jump into a (multiplayer) game, 30 seconds for fast typing and communication, then you are right the midst of action. That's in sharp contrast of AOE4, for example, where you are busy for 10-20 minutes before you get actions.

WG: RD is hard to play. The player base is highly knowledgeable already. But it can be learned for RTS or military fans.

The game is old; yet the graphics is effective. You will get a sense of seeing the historical tanks and planes in action and you will base your game-play decisions on what you see and what you hear. The graphics is minimal (e.g. you need to open a side panel to see some simple unit animation in the abstract, out of their actual terrain). There are some much need UI improvements that will never be made. But on the balance, the graphic is effective to facilitate gameplay and give immersion.

The (base) game is not expensive at all. So many other games are several-fold more expensive but not several-fold the replayability and content. If you are new, you will likely need 100+ hr before you are proficient; still, I think those 100+ hr will be full of fun and well worthwhile .",1642698176,1642698176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:
-Five campaigns of varying difficulty. The first one in particular is very hand-holdey with what you can or cannot do, but the last two (one of which was added in a free DLC) set the player up against fairly challenging odds with a number of tools in their box.
-Generally well-polished gameplay with reasonable depth and a fairly high skill ceiling. Different units all have their own characteristics,  with placement and composition mattering.

The bad:
-The AI is not exactly clever. Its tactics can bluntly be summed up as ""attack with everything it has and hope for the best"". Sometimes it works, predominantly when it has tanks on open ground, and its artillery/air management is decent, but to say that it mismanages its infantry would be an understatement. After a while you learn how to exploit its flaws and at that point it's rarely going to win any battles against you if you just keep a spare command vehicle around. It's not smart enough to avoid driving its tank columns into your infantry-clogged town, for instance.
-Not much replayability. Sure, you could redo a scenario once or twice in order to get a better result, but each one has a pretty clear scenario flow and ultimately I don't feel any strong urge to repeat them a second time around. I did well on the first go, and because they're scripted in terms of progression the campaigns wouldn't really change beyond how the battles go, how much ground you take/lose, et cetera.
-The in-game global chat is widely known to be a very toxic place. I don't personally care about that sort of stuff, but if you're one of those people who are going to get triggered by it, well, don't say I didn't warn you.",1641231871,1641231871,True,15,0,0.627057552337646484,0,True,False,False

First, there is no interactive tutorial, just a manual. Expect to watch YouTube videos to understand very basic things about the game. Second, the game pretty regularly glitches up and tells you you have territory at the beginning of a battle you don't have. The graphics are just so-so. The interface lacks ease of use. You can't look back at the strategic picture after you've started a battle, it's difficult to see what units are still in reserve. The ""chess board"" is very difficult to understand and almost nothing is explained. In the end it just took too much time to enjoy. Uninstalled at first.

I have more than a small amount of experience with real time strategy games and this one fails to deliver on many of the core concepts that I have come to expect. 

The game requires an absurd amount of micromanagement. Units completely fail to act on their own when facing, say an artillery bombardment. Rather than taking cover or moving away from the exploding bombs they'll shout ""Its starting to get dangerous over here!"" Then continue to stand perfectly still while the enemy slowly gets the range correct to wipe them out. Oh hey, the building I'm in is covered in napalm? Better sit here and burn to death while we wait for the battalion commander to call me personally to request I move my squad 3 feet over to the not on fire building!

The ""unique nations"" all feel like re-skins of each other with marginal changes to stats with the occasional interesting unit sprinkled in to push you into purchasing DLC so you can add it to your units. 

The logistics system is an overly simplified for a modern RTS (Somehow my fuel truck is ""resupplying"" entirely new marines out of it? Were they hiding inside some kind of hidden compartment like a clown car?)

The big thing is, if you're redfor, and you're not playing Red Dragons, you're not going to have many 'workhorse' units, especially tanks.

Higher command levels have to delegate to more peopel, and thus they are forced to give less orders. It is up to the ranks below them to delegate the details, or so that's how it's supposed to work. 

The AI in this game cannot complete the most basic of tasks on their own, meaning you have to micro manage them down to the squad and even team level. This would't be a problem in a Squad RTS... if such a thing existed. I have't seen a squad or team level RTS since full spectrum warrior back on the PS2... But I digress, this game isn't that. It's at the smallest, a Battalion or Regimental RTS. And the fact your troops have NO combat AI, no self preservation or agency of any kind, means you are forced to divide your attention in a thousand directions at once. It is humanly impossible to play this game optimally. So instead you have to cut yourself down at the knees and either accept massive casualties for no good reason, or micro a few squads at a time, while your main force is hidden somewhere safe and just pray nothing unexpected happens. 

Some people can multitask better than others, but this scale problem is seriously inhibiting access to higher level play. It unjustly favors heavy weapons and quality over quantity, because you will struggle to manage large numbers of units at once. You might be temped to build a large economy based army, but you'll never be able to use it, because you can't micro manage that many units.

The game has the potential to be a great RTS, but not at this scale. Perhaps if they sub-divided the forces among more players, so each player had a platoon to themselves, then this game might turn into something. But the base game is borderline unplayable.",1640457473,1640457473,False,20,4,0.613073229789733887,2,True,False,False

for 16 servings

2 ½ cups warm water
1 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
7 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
¼ cup semolina flour
OPTIONAL TOPPINGS

TOMATO SAUCE

28 oz canned whole tomatoes
1 tablespoon kosher salt
MARGHERITA

tomato sauce
fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces
fresh basil leaf
TASTY’S BIANCA

extra virgin olive oil
fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces
ricotta cheese
fresh basil pesto
dried oregano
PEPPERONI

tomato sauce
fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces
spicy pepperoni slice
freshly grated parmesan cheese

Preparation
“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.
In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.
Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.
Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.
Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.
Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.
Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.
Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.
Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.
Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.
Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.
Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.
Add any garnish of your preference.

Frankly it sucks, the AI is absolutely garbage and the programming sucks to, bad developers using basic cheats to make up for one of the worst AI I have ever seen. AI will funnel their entire force into a kill box with absolutely no adjustment. 

In open fields the game gives them about 4 to 5 times the units per points you have and they basically know exactly where everything you have is but your line of site is a joke. I have literally had defenses lined up two layers thick protecting my command vehicle and had them bypass all the lines unseen, roll the map edge, unseen and then suddenly appear right behind the command vehicle with a single tank, pop it and you lost the battle because you can have 100 units on the field, killed 90% of the enemy with almost no losses, but when the command vehicle is killed everyone throws their hands up and quits. 

I cannot express the general disdain for this AI. Game is very lovely though, but you never really zoom down to enjoy it, would have preferred less beauty more actual war. I saw folks say it is very realistic, gave me a good laugh. The command system in this game kills that from ever being a possibility 1 second into the game.

-Most cheap units are not viable (excluding infantry), seven 25 point tanks will always lose against one superheavvy tank. I think some more nuanced differences between medium tanks and heavvy tanks would have led to larger and more 
interesting tank battles instead of the neurotic micromanaging of one or two superheavvy tanks that is the meta now.

-DLC nations are just better; for the same price Israel gets a 5pt box with 3 machineguns and extra armour where you would normally have your standard m113. The only non-dlc nations that are actually viable are the US and USSR.

- The singleplayer campaign is both short and bad, the ai zerg rushes you with everything they have until they lose, repeat this for 5 campaigns

I've been hesitant to write a review for this because I honestly feel like any way I describe it won't do it justice. It's a game I love to love and love to hate, all the time. No matter how salty I get at it I keep coming back. It has probably the highest skill ceiling (And skill floor.) of any game I've ever played. It has probably the most freedom and diversity of playstyle of any game I've ever played. I've been a longstanding RTT and RTS player, but absoloutely nothing feels anywhere similiar to this game. No, not RUSE, not even close. Absoloutely not like CoH or Assault Squad like many people like to compare it to. It's more akin to like...a cold war Total War game? But much easier to manage and suprisingly less clunky. 

That said, as this is one of the few games I've intimately come to know, I'm aware all too well of its negatives: Absoloutely no tutorial or anything telling you about the vast ocean of required knowledge to be competent at this game. The AI and singleplayer in general is beyond a joke, the game would actually be better off without it. (And that's coming from someone who strives to find a good co-op or singleplayer experience.) Thanks to the developer's lack of explanation for stats, poor consistency, and generally being blissfully unaware of how the game really works, only a handful of the massive variety of units are really viable in even a casual setting. There are actually really decent parts of the community, but by and large what most players are exposed to are the chronic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ers on the general chat, and the lobby stackers in random games. Bad advice that's two games out of date is common, and many new players are stuck in limbo either playing singleplayer because they're too afraid to deal with all the ""veterans"" in multiplayer, or playing large team game clown matches because they feel like they're not competent enough to play without relying on someone else. DLC bias for the most part isn't just people looking for something to complain about, it's actually a real thing here, as some units are inexplicably cheaper or better than other units that do the same thing or are the same price, respectively. That said, they still add some neat variety to the game, and DLC itself will not win matches for the majority of the community.

But let's end on the cool things: Never in any other game have I seen such a variety of nations modelled, with their own unique units, with their own full voice lines, and to actual viability. (As long as you use coalitions to cover each other's bases.) Combat is the closest I've ever seen to authenticty as far as ranges, combined arms, and damage models on such a large scale, at least compared to other games. (Some ranges are still not correct for gameplay reasons, but they're within the ballpark.) Despite DLC bias and weird inconsistencies, I'm actually impressed how viable each coalition and major nation is. The balancing could use obvious improvements, but it's still impressive regardless; you can still make trash units work just because of the way combat works, and it feels so good when you do. 

You might take for granted sometimes just how many kinds of cool units are available to you, all right from the start of the game: American F-117 stealth bombers, Soviet TOS-1 thermobaric MLRS, Canadian ADATS Shorad/ATGMs, Danish Otomatic self propelled naval cannons, Swedish BKAN-1 howitzers that fire like autocannons, North Korean apcs with Iglas mounted on them, Yugoslavian paratroopers using ex-wehrmacht weapons, German and American MBT/Kpz 70 prototypes, flamethrowers and flamethrower tanks that actually look like a real flamethrower despite the weird pool of fire they leave behind, even Finnish StuG-IIIs (Sturmis) still around to provide you some fire support for cheap. Plus, all the usual suspects you've come to love if you're a cold war fan, like Pattons, T-55s, T-80s, Leopard 1s, AMX-30s, Leopard 2s, Abrams, BMPs, M113s, Bradleys, Challengers, all of them with many different variants. The pure variety of this game on top of the unreplicable style of gameplay puts it as my favorite of all time. If you've got an unhealthy obsession with military equipment, well known or obscure, do yourself a favor and buy this game. You won't be disappointed.....",1479328082,1638226949,True,71,10,0.612056553363800049,3,True,False,False

This is a deep game, with a massive amount of real world unit types which allows you to build your own combined force. The game mechanics are quite easy to learn but hard to master, but the pure amount of statistics of every single unit means you have to put in a great amount of time to learn how to use each unit the best way possible.
You have to concentrate on your strategy and mastering the use of different unit combinations for the given situation and be prepared of your opponents units and how to counter them. The campaigns are not the strenght here, but the multiplayer are, and it is excellent. Eugen is continously and often updating the game and tweaking/correcting units, game balance etc to fine-tune the game according to the players response. DLC´s with new countries are continously beeing released.
Prepare to loose sleep. The more you put into this game, the more it gives you back. It is timeless in many aspects.
{UPDATE 2021}
Having played this tile for many years since my first review, and made a pause, then took it up again, thinking I would have lost ""my edge"" in maneuvering my units around the maps, it was just so intuitiive to pick it up again. Recently Eugen provided a new DLC ""South African Forces"", including some impressively researched unique units from the SADF, many special vechicles as well as infantry. I voted it ""Labour of Love"" 2021 as I think the developer has listened very well to the community about requests and are continously supporting and updating this game so many years after its first release. It is not so common these days, and for fans of the cold war / modern era RTS games with depth and excellent MP matches, there are not many, if any, games out there challenging this game.

After 360 hours of gameplay, I can happily recommend this game to anyone who is interested in a deep and authentic Division-level RTS experience.

Pros:
+ Awesome 1-1 scale visual experience
+ Reality-based operational-level combat
+ Complex combined-arms strategy
+ Outstanding graphics
+ INSANE number of nations to play as

Cons:
- Poor, simplistic, and cheating AI
- Limited campaign content

My only real complaint about this game is the lack of single-player value due to poor AI and limited campaign content. The AI in this game is very simple, and resorts to simply throwing waves of enemies at you. I have confirmed that the AI cheats by creating matches where you can only spend 1000 points and witnessing the AI throw 2000+ points of tanks at me in the first wave.

The thing about this game that keep bringing me back, in addition to the fun gameplay, are the number of nations you can play as which are featured in no other game in existence. For example, I have yet to find another game where you can play as the Israeli, Norwegian, Polish, Dutch, or Norwegian militaries (and there are even more). There are only maybe 2 other games out there letting you play as the Finnish military, but they aren't nearly the quality.",1637532270,1637532270,True,26,2,0.700925052165985107,0,True,False,False

As an example, for the longest time I thought the game cheated when my M1 Abrams' could not kill  T-90s....then I realized that my assigned model of M1 did not have enough armor penetration to penetrate the frontal armor of the T-90.  Thus, I had to solve the problem with the T-90s with Legion 90, or A-10 Warthog, instead of  marine M1 Abrams.

UPDATE 11-18-2021:  Developer updated the game with the addition of South Africa.  It seems the Developer also updated the AI in the campaigns:  In the past, the AI would stick to roads, thus making the AI easy to ambush and subject to choke points.  After the update, the AI still favors roads, but the AI will now go through the woods or across rivers if roads or bridges become choke points...in other words, its time for fans to try the campaign again with the new and somewhat improved AI.  Have Fun!

After thousand of hours in this game,  the campaigns continue to present a challenge because of the level of detail applied to each unit, and its particular strengths and weaknesses.  In light of the large number of units in this game, the learning curve is steep...and true mastery reserved for people without day-jobs.  Nevertheless, this is a rare, modern game that will kick your ass and not apologize for it.  It is also one of those games that you keep coming back to figure out new ways to defeat it.  It is never relaxing or easy...but it is also very addictive and fun...there always seems like there is something new to figure out.

I recommend that if you're new play with artillery in LOW POINT (fewer units) 10 v 10 matches.  This will give you the ability to help other players on your team while keeping a close eye on what works as they duke it out on the front line.  Eventually, this play style will impress upon you the value of recon units and let you put your toe into ground based AA.  Over time, you'll learn by watching and will start to feel comfortable enough to create defensive strategies.   From there, you'll learn offense.  Remember, the ONLY reason to spawn ships to to cover an amphibious landing.  Don't be the ""spawn a kongo, watch it blow up, and then quit the game"" guy.

Once you get the hang of things you'll start to have a few successful games.   And Red Dragon is probably one of the most satisfying games when it comes to doing well.

I believe that Wargame: Red Dragon's replay value comes almost entirely from it's competitive multiplayer fan base. There were also a lot of quality of life improvements added to Red Dragon as compared to previous titles in the series , as well as a whole new layer of strategy that comes with the more complex terrain and environment.

In my opinion the RTS genre's ultimate appeal is the strategical rabbit hole you get to dive down when matching up against real intelligent human beings in multiplayer and getting involved in the competitive multiplayer community.

Against human players all of a sudden you're fighting a real war, and if you have the guts to approach this game with a competitive mindset you will find yourself experiencing a level of fun and heart-pumping adrenaline rushes that can not be replicated by fighting against AI.

A lot of people feel like having a competitive mindset is something for those who care more about winning than having fun. The truth is anyone who has put serious effort into trying to become one of the best at these kinds of games is doing so because that is exactly what they find fun.

The replay value of the Wargame series can amount to hundreds if not thousands of hours for these kinds of players, of which most would consider Red Dragon's non-naval aspects and new ground forces to be worth the price alone.

Despite the disaster that is the naval warfare in this game, Red Dragon's non-naval multiplayer stands up on it's own and can be worth buying for the military RTS fan with a competitive mindset.

There are moments where I like to call stategic/tactical orgasms of which the only people who get to experience these are those who put their all into learning the complex details of a game, such as this one. I believe the cost of Wargame: Red Dragon is easily justified for those who crave a new competitive online experience.

There's no base building, no economy to worry about or min-max, the game is 100% about the combat.

I love it, and have sunk a few weeks of my life into this, but having played other games in the series, I just wish it could get a few of the quality of life changes from Steel Division, like the rangefinder/line of sight tool, the ability to order units to 'deploy at location' instead of where they are currently, co-op campaigns, and a less scummy AI.

Pros:
+The game is expansive, and captures warfare in a really involving way on a grand scale. Creating your own decks and armies is great fun, and is almost worth the asking price to play fantasy general on it's own.
+The graphics have held up well, as has the sound. Runs well too, even on my hunk of junk!
+Campaigns are really fun, well crafted and extremely challenging. Though honestly, this is a negative too, since if you want to experience the later campaigns you're going to have to save scum like crazy.
+Impressive unit selection, and some great opportunities to invent fantasy conflicts and see what would happen. Japan vs South Korea? Go for it. CCP vs Poland? Fill your boots! Great stuff.

Negatives:
-Basically no tutorial. Very little information is given, and unit identification is confusing.
-The AI cheats so badly it's not particularly fun. It literally gets to deploy twice as many units as you do, *and that's on easy*.
-Unit balance is properly questionable. I think they've tried to simplify to unit costs, rounding everything up or down to 5 points. But this means you have some units with identical command point costs that are drastically better or worse than each other.
-Finally, and probably most damning, there's very little feedback to the player about events going on in game, pressing space bar to jump to notifications often doesn't do anything, and unit responses are often non-existent. Playing something like Company Of Heroes, or Starcraft, where off screen events are easy to track from minimap icons, unit responses and even subtitles. Red Dragon just hopes you notice things without prompting.

The game is properly hard. It's very rewarding too, but if you're only willing to dip your toe in, and have a casual and relaxed mess around, this may not be the game for you.
However, I've had way more fun than frustration, and anyone with a taste for history, what if's and general cold war f*ckery, this will be a blast.",1634069277,1634069277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Teamstacking is a thing on 10v10's so stay away from them until you know what you're doing.. and please if you do buy this game, don't always use a support deck in a 10v10. The artillery spam gets so bad that eventually it turns into a shit flinging contest to see who can fling the most shit to the other persons' side of the map.

Warchat on the other hand is an entirely different game in its self. Its pretty much spam and degeneracy which can be funny at first, but gets old pretty quick. If you never want to deal with warchat, you can just hit the ""Close Chat"" button at the lower right side of the screen.

The first thing you'll notice about this game is that it is... extensive. There are thousands of units to content with; it will take you a while to internalize the basic differences between certain units so you can make appropriate decisions in-game. For instance - the difference between Moto shutzen and motostrelci is pretty powerful. You sort of need to browse the armory for a bit to do your homework. Good thing that deck building even by itself is weirdly enjoyable, especially because there is nothing to grind. (I previously played European Escalation, and I did not like how you had to unlock units based on your progress in the single player. This is a massive improvement.)

I would not consider myself to be that good at Wargame, but I'm trying. In other multiplayer games its possible for a few good teammates to carry the whole team. Not so much here, except maybe in the 10 v 10 tactical matches. This is a high intensity, high stress game when you are really into it. Minor mistakes (and usually dumb luck) can completely turn the battle. 

The community is... something. Take it or leave it. Definitely a game mostly populated by hard right wing cosplayers by this point. For a game of this age there is still a good number of players though; you should be able to find a game with little difficulty.

The single player is not that great in my opinion. It's useful for learning how to play, but otherwise not very inspiring.

Naval combat is also pretty bad. Avoid it if you can.",1631824120,1631824120,True,2,0,0.513473033905029297,0,True,False,False

You can not even call the tutorial bad because its none existen and with over 1500 units and a lot of different kinds of units it get overwhelming fast. if u have cleared this hurdle the fun begins there are multiple way to play the game 1v1, 2v2-4v4 and 10 v10.

If you are, however looking to play on a grander scale (10v10), you will ALWAYS find the same group of people in servers stacking the teams to their advantage. There is no auto-balance nor does this ""community"" want it, they just want horribly stacked games (average win-rate of 70% in one team and 25% in other). How it can be fun to stomp bad players every game, every time is beyond me.   
If you think you can turn the tides of such games, even with a friend, you are wrong. At best, you can hold one side while watching the other fronts collapsing due to the horrible imbalance. To combat these stackers, we even tried organising a large group of people to play against them - once they saw our win rates, they simply left the server. So no interest whatsoever in playing a fair game. This is one of the reasons this game is know as ""lobby simulator"", since you wait endlessly waiting for a (fair) game.

The main issues are with balance/AI.  I've played the first few missions of a couple of the campaigns and every single time, I was steamrolled.  I expected it the first time around, being new to the game and all, but I learned from my mistakes and brought different units, deployed them into cover with overlapping capabilities.  So the AI just sent stuff that I had no ability to defend against, or that my units simply refused to fire at...  I mean, do I need to tell the anti-aircraft to shoot at each individual plane?  

During the simultaneous assault on all fronts, my infantry don't bother to fire their AT weapons at the armored vehicles, preferring to shoot their rifles at the tanks instead...  Do I need to micromanage each individual soldier or should they reasonably be able to figure out that a rifle will do absolutely nothing to an armored car?

The map showed that the other side brought tanks and recon units, with air support so why the hell do they also have artillery?  And AA vehicles?  I watched a couple of youtube videos on the campaigns and didn't see the AI doing this so wtf?

And what's with the points system??  The difference between my side and AI was about less than 20%, 1500ish points to their 1750ish points.  So why on earth does the AI have 3x the units???????  Forced handicap?  In a game that already teleports whatever the AI needs into the battle?  Yeah, forget that.

-only one music for the whole game
-management is somewhere inconvenient, but somewhere disgusting. For example - turning
-many units for land battles few for sea ones
-a large number of units and countermeasures, which means great complexity(and lack of game balance)

Just like with other strategy games you have vehicles and planes and helicopters and these all use ammo and fuel. You have supply vehicles and supply helicopters that you use to resupply your vehicles and your soldiers. You have motorized, armored, mechanized, support (which basically focuses on artillery, AA and resupply), airborne and marines there is so many vehicles and a lot of nations in the game. Its a really fun game.

+Tons of nations. BLUFOR which is basically NATO and REDFOR which is basically Warsaw + China.
+Tons of vehicles. Planes, Helicopters, AT jeeps and AT armored vehicles, Tanks, armored and un-armored infantry transport vehicles. Some of these are amphibious too so they can go across the rivers. There is even some really interesting and rare vehicles in some countries you can even find WW2 vehicles being used.
+The game is much more complicated then it seems. Capturing points requires command units. These could be helicopters or tanks or armored vehicles or un-armored vehicles maybe its just a squad of infantry with these you capture points on the map and these give you points with the points you earn you can call in additional soldiers from your deck (yes a deck i'll get to that later) you can call in special forces and recon teams, you can call in tanks, helicopters, infantry, AT infantry, AT vehicles, AA infantry, AA vehicles, Artillery and just TONS of things you can use but none of these will be useful if you can't supply them. They have a limited range, they have limited fuel, they have limited ammo and they need repairs when they get damaged. And for that you have supply trucks (some are amphibious) and supply helicopters.
+Tons of maps
+Campaings which are really cool.
+The deck system is really cool and fun to use. So you need to create decks. You choose either BLUFOR (basically NATO) or REDFOR (Warsaw + China and a few additional countries like N. Korea and Yugoslavia, Finland etc.) after you choose your faction then you choose your country. And after you choose that you need to choose what kind of army you'll be using. Armored maybe ? Or Airborne ? Some countries have more options then others. After this you get to the fun part you create a deck. You have different categories like armor, naval, support, infantry, helicopters etc. and in each category there are different vehicles that you need to choose from you have point limits and the role you choose will effect what kind of units you can put in your deck. For example an armored army will have extra tanks at its disposal. Adding anything to your deck costs points. So you can't fill out your deck you have to decide on whats important and whats not. Lets say you made an armored deck. Do you need any recon helicopters ? Do you have the points or the available space for those extra helicopters ? Or should you use that extra points on getting more aircraft instead ? Maybe some infantry on trucks ? No, no we are armored ! We should add the infantry with APCs instead ! The APC will offer more protection and unlike a truck it will have guns too maybe even a few ATGMs ! Some of the APCs can swim so we can put them in unexpected locations ! But the truck will be faster on road and it will waste less resources, it will be cheaper and with its fuel it can go further. You see what i mean ? This system is really cool and explaining it is kinda hard. The best way to experience this great system is  by playing the game.

+/- Sometims the game does get a bit overwhelming. There is just so many stuff you need to think about and do that at times the game just feels really overwhelming.

-Honestly my only problem with the game is how long it takes to actually play. Thats the thing with real time strategy games in general so i can't really complain but like 90% of the time instead of playing the game i'm just switching between menus creating different decks. Its a lot of fun but god damn is it addicting.
-Steam store says the game is 20 GBs. I got the game for free in Epic Games Store before and it was 20 GBs. But when i download the game on Steam ? It asked for 40 GBs of empty space. I said ""alright maybe its cuz i got all the DLCs this time"" deleted a few games, made the extra space, downloaded the game then i realised after the download finished the game only took 20 GBs on my PC. Idk why but when you first download the game you might need to make up some extra space. After the download finished you can re-install everything you deleted.
-Giving orders can be a bit hard at times. Telling a vehicle to unload the infantry in it or splitting up a group of units or just the small difference between right clicking and making the unit move there or instead clicking the ""move fast"" button THEN clicking on where you want the unit to go and then the unit will go to that location using the roads so its faster these small things just take a few extra seconds and sometimes using them can be a bit hard. Its not a deal-breaker in any way tho. At this point i'm just picking really small things and complaining about them.

Honestly the game is fucking great. Its just so much fun to actually create a deck and then use it in a match and see what happens. The units are so cool and there is so many things that you can do. The game is tons of fun the DLCs are nice too with extra countries i definitely recommend them as well. With a discount or without one if its interesting to you then get the game. Make sure to force some of your friends to buy it too cuz playing against friends or playing with them against an AI is just so much fun.",1624399922,1624399922,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

So i am going to talk about this game with my ""brief"" time with it and what i liked and disliked. Like all good reviews i am going to talk about the negative aspects first. 



ONLINE

This is going to be an unpopular opinion. Online is not that fun which is really impactful to the overall state of the game. I have played about 20 online matches with various players and the community has some clear problems. The one i found to be most annoying is ""gatekeeping"" in which older players basically bully new players out of playing the game. The common trend is for the veteran players to go on ""redfor"" and basically have doom stacks and trash new players. 

TO NEW PLAYERS: if you join an online game, and redfor is already all taken, leave.

This really sucks because it would be a lot of fun to be able to play online and go against people who are good and learn from them, and then engage in good dialog afterwards, which happened to me most times. but this was still after 3 players who have 3000 hours trashed me and my 15 hour team. 

There are various degrees of online play with players. You can do 1 v 1s, 2 v 2s, and 3 v 3s and 4 v 4s and even 10 v 10s. They even have 10 v 10 maps but these are uncommon to come across as you need a dedicated server. The 10 v 10s on other maps are not as fun. You are limited to a small amount of units, which sounds fun but get boring quickly because it is hard to plan and communicate. For example, in a 3 v 3 i was in, my ally told me to push. So i attacked with my Abrams platoons and artillery. He however did not push so i was wiped out. He then told me after the match ""play more aggressive"" 

These were just some things about online. Almost every review on here says online is the way to go. They are somewhat right. that is when you get friends and are in a lobby with people of similar skill, which is far from often. The community is toxic a lot of the time ( although you really have some gems in there ) and new people are often bullied form playing in some strange hazing of an almost decade years old game. 

BOTS BOTS BOTS. aka single player

Now the most exciting thing about this game to me was the singleplayer and skirmish. I bought this game knowing it was not polished and you should too. Single player is not the main aspect of the game. that being said, it is in there so it should at least be decent. 

There are 5 campaigns with various level of difficulty. Upon playing you will notice how linear it is for a strategy game. At least for the first half of the campaign. There is not a lot of options for diverse play style. When you do get your bearings it just gets old kind of fast. The moving mechanics are somewhat dated too. A big complaint is that not all nations are available for both sides. Which makes somewhat sense as you would not see Finland fighting alongside North Korea in the second Korean war. ( the main one i dislike is no British units in second Korean war, which does not make sense ) This brings me to my next point. If the devs made more campaigns, or added the ones from previous games, and just made them a little larger with more units and breathing room, the campaign would be way more fun. 

A reddit post i saw a couple weeks ago made some up. Scandinavia so those nations can actually be used. Taiwan, and the Chinese invasion of it. Perhaps Yugoslavia VS USSR. With Israel added the options grow. Perhaps adding Egypt, Iraq and Iran ( which almost happened ) and allowing a middle eastern campaign. With South Africa being added the options for a Cuban/ South African historical match up in Angola could be recreated. but no Cuba. Adding the option to switch sides would be fun too. Play as Redfor in the second Korean war. Simple but adds a WHOLE new dynamic. Bring back co-op campaigns. Or head to head. 

Part of the reason for this is because the game is set in Asia. Which is totally fine. But games grow and evolve and Israel would never fight in Korea. So adding a campaign where you can actually play with them would be awesome. 

SKIRMISH 

This mode is perhaps my favorite. You make your own battles. Add the AI and make them whatever nation you want them to be and just go to war. The AI bots are often easily managed but again, this game is somewhat old. When you play enough the bots even become very predictable and they often suicide attack. It is still fun though. 

An issue i have with Skirmish is you cannot 10 v 10 with pure AI. Which would be awesome. You kind of can but you need a dedicated server and need to pay for it. This sucks big time as a part of the player base are only skirmish players and they are left out. 

MAPS... SICK OF THEM

The maps are fun! but there are not a lot of them and there are a lot of reused ones. You begin to learn them pretty quickly. More so online as everyone wants to do mudfight for some reason. There are not a lot of maps though and this hurts the game somewhat. The main issue is that there are no European or Middle Eastern maps which sucks because you need to play on Korean maps which sometimes breaks immersion. The maps they have are mostly fun, with cold war Z being a fun hilly mix up from other more flat maps. But again, they get old fast. 

DECKS AND NATIONS... THE REASON FOR BUYING THE GAME 

Now decks are basically your units. You have a TON of options on how to set them up. First off you need to pick Blufor ( NATO and allies ) or Redfor ( Warsaw Pact and allies ) then you need to select a nation ( you don't have to pick a nation but it is a lot more fun in my opinion ) then if you want, you can make it a 'special' unit by making it armored or motorized ect. They have a good selection of nations in the game, and although they share many vehicles and patterns, they play very different. The US ( my fav nation ) are expensive and hard hitting and suited more so for defense. The USSR are the opposite. Cheaper and more geared to attack. The French are more mobile, the Germans have great IFVs and APCs with supporting Infantry. It is awesome. Even still, you can mix and match and create outlandish decks more suited towards you. I made a US Armored unit and learned and added on and took away until the decent set up i have now. the options are limitless. I like to recreate historical and real life units. Which you easily can. 

As someone who works in the military field. The game is pretty accurate when it comes to how some of the warfare would actually play out. ( kind of ) and the nations strengths and weakness are somewhat in real life too. But this game is not 100% accurate, but is still fun. The game lacks several factors such as technical training and doctrine that would matter in a real life cold war match up. For example, USSR personal were very worried about a mechanized NATO force, especially American because Westerners grew up with cars and machines available where as a soviet most likely did not. This made it so the USSR would need more mechanics where the NATO forces probably knew enough already and did not need to send their tanks back to the motor pool. 

This would not be possible to implement and i would not expect a video game to have it. I am just saying that this game is far from a real life military sim. 

MOD TOOLS: lastly. Mods fix most issues in games. If the mod tools were out this game would be getting a way better score from me. 

OVERALL: 

I really like this game. but it could be SO much more. The game has new life as South Africa is coming out. But the game in my opinion is still somewhat bare bones. The online is fun but toxic and uninviting. Campaign is lacking. Skirmish is fun but gets boring. The decks are awesome and are done perfectly. Mod tools are lacking which is also annoying as far as PC games go. 

I would give this game a 5/10. I am never going to ""main"" this game but i will always come back to it every now and then and play around. Until i get bored with a lack of mod tools and single player.",1624336020,1624336020,True,18,1,0.629675328731536865,0,True,False,False

Most of my time is spent in the deck builder, trying to create realistic decks and divisions and battlegroups for the AI to use. A lot of my time in game is spent in the air tab, managing all my SEAD (suppression of enemy air defense) planes that I always bring too many of into the game. I try to support my AI team mates with air support and by building an elaborate recon and anti air net that doesn't always survive the first 20 minutes. This play style would probably not only not work in multiplayer, but would also get you yelled at by your team mates (or worse, kicked).

I absolutely love this game. I have a blast doing what I do. The only downsides and issues I personally have with the game (and this might even be positives for some players) is that this game can be very micro-manage heavy. Steel Division 2 has spoiled me with its unit autonomy features and gimmicks, and since playing that game, the micro-managing aspect of this game has become even more of a downer for me. To be fair though, a ton of rts games now are a bit annoying with all the micro-managing that has to be done. I am supposed to be managing a massive fighting force that is literally countless platoons and even a few battalions in size. I shouldn't have to worry about pretty basic stuff that should be decided and done at literally the squad/vehicle crew level. If one of my tanks engages the enemy at his 9 o'clock, he should turn and face the tank at his 9 o'clock. Now I get that doesn't work as cleanly when you are being attacked from multiple directions, but I'd assume the tank should prioritize which direction the most dangerous incoming fire is coming from and face that direction. At this point though I am more or less just complaining about lots of different rts games, not just Wargame: Red Dragon. I also assume that the computing power and resources needed to program the ai to be that effective is quite large when you having dozens of tanks and other units on the field interacting with one another. Okay, I'm getting off topic here so lets bring it back to the game review.

Unit fuel, or ""autonomy"" as it is called in game, is another feature that kinda seems like a downer to me, or at least the way they implemented it into the game. Unit autonomy is a stat that is present on all ground and air vehicles in game, and is pretty much just another name for how much the gas tank can hold in each unit. Yes, fuel is a factor you have to consider when playing this game. For some that's a big turn off, for others, a cool and realistic feature. It might very well be if the stat was reflective or at least somewhat representative of the vehicles' actual fuel capacity and mileage in real life. For every ground unit it feels way too small and just an artificial constraint made to help balance units out. For helicopters it can feel the same as well. If a unit runs out of fuel, you have to risk bringing up a supply vehicle to refuel it, or it will just sit wherever it ran out of fuel at. That part I am fine with. What I don't like is what I stated previously, the fuel tanks simply aren't big enough or anywhere near their real life counterparts. The map sizes and combat ranges are definitely much larger in this game than in many other rts games, but still not really big enough in my opinion to warrant having to worry about fuel, at least at the level it currently does. Planes are the only exception to this rule, and that is simply so that they don't just loiter 500 feet above the battlefield the entire match above each player's starting zone, flying in a tight circle non-stop. Some planes present in game probably could in real life but for the sake of immersion they don't. Most planes can stay well longer than they need to drop their ordinance and get outta there. For planes, that's fine with me. For all the other units, not so much. You have to refuel your units multiple times during a match, which can be anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour or more. At most you should only have to do that maybe once in that time frame, twice if you are really playing a super long game. I'd prefer it if they treated fuel like they do in Steel Division 2, something that only affects air units. (To be honest, Steel Division 2's units and map sizes are where refueling would actually be much more appropriate if you are going by their real life counterparts, as tanks in the second world war got fuel mileage which was just about what you imaged it would be, awful.) I assume that they didn't include a stat for ground vehicle fuel for the sake of gameplay, which is alright to me. I wish they would retroactively just update this game and let the only logistical needs you have to worry about be health and ammo.

One thing that doesn't really affect how I would rate the game but would definitely love is official mod support. I really believe this game would absolutely spike in popularity and have much more longevity than it does now (which is already impressive but that may be because there isn't a game like it, or at least doesn't do what it does nearly as well) if players could finally be able to make their own maps, and adjust unit characteristics, attributes, and skins without having to mess with this game's very... weird and odd coding.

Obviously, this is all just my opinion, and it may sound like I was just going on about the negatives of this game, but I'd argue the positives far outweigh the negatives. There really isn't a game like this that takes place in a modern setting and at this scale. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely is a work of art. It's not for everyone, but I definitely feel that a lot of people that this game is for doesn't even know this game exists. I'd argue it is worth about $29.99, and if it ever goes on sale for $19.99 or less, then it is a steal.

One last thing, then I'll quit: the community in this game is extremely toxic, like on another level sometimes. If you are easily offended by people, I'd recommend you either turn the in game chat off or not play at all. Trolling and racism is very prevalent in the in game chat. It is so prevalent that it's almost meme-like. Most of the people are probably trolling, but it is possible that some of them do mean what they say, which can be very homophobic/racist/anti-semitic/etc. and there is no chat moderation as far as I am aware. It doesn't really bother me because I think most of them are probably trolling. Obviously that doesn't make what they say okay or alright by any means, but it is what it is. All you can do is add those people to your ignore list and move on. It can be so absurd at times you can't help but laugh. Not everyone will have the same reaction as me though, so if you are easily offended, just turn off/mute the in game chat.",1623399869,1623399869,True,61,1,0.809183120727539063,4,True,False,False

Lesson 1:

Do not play against AI. You will feel dumb.
Instead make a CV only deck for each side, pick one, and have the AI duke it out up to 3v3 while you enjoy the herbs of your choice.

Lesson 2:

If you play multiplayer, play 10v10.

Lesson 2.2:

If youre a Noob, sit on the NATO team.
All the tryhards play NATO so even the odds if you may.
Real chads play Redfor.

Lesson 2.5:

Whatever you do, ignore the chat in main.

Lesson 3:

Mark your shit. Even if you have no idea whats happening, mark your shit.

Lesson 4:

Play support until you know whats happening. 
Playing support means get cheap recon, cheap infantry and anything that dosnt matter in points if youre dumb. 

You will be dumb.

Lesson 5:

Anything that can shoot, shoots.
If NATO fanboys send their 120 points Apache, send a 40 point soviet ground attack aircraft from the 50's. Satisfaction ensures if you dont even loose it while trolling the Apache.

Lesson 6:

In urban combat situations, send artillery while your troops are loosing, not after.

Lesson 7:

Move your shit up.
If you stay behind, youre out of range. Dont be out of range.

Lesson 8:

Move your shit back.
If you stay where you are, you are in range. Dont be in range.

Lesson 9:

Dont get emotionally attached.
Chances are: everything you send in will die. Dont try to rescue one unit and waste 6 others in the process.

Lesson 10:

Have fun.

We buy this game; we lose this game; we keep losing this game again and again until somewhere down the line we learn this game. Why did we keep playing this game? 

If you're like me, you played this game because of the infamous community with its unfiltered chat.
I come home from a hard day at work and play this game with my upmost toxicity from all the years of personal economic instability, mistakes & regrets, love-life regrets, political frustration, lockdowned loneliness, parental issues and that old forgotten speeding ticket I still have to pay.
All of our puny problems just disappear when we play a nice game of wargame. 

We talk shit to each other, we roleplay as Kim Jong-un and bomb South Korean troops, we kick each other from the match for having poor win rates, we bicker with our nationalistic bias views on which country has the best tank; we make such harsh political jokes that might get you beaten to death by an angry mob; we remind our Russian friends why spamming Anti-Air tanks and Spetsnaz is a bad idea and that they should go back to counterstrike; we speak in racist accents as we stomp the west with the might of the People's Liberation Army; we get our asses kicked by Chinese players; our friend in the military kicks the Chinese player's ass and then talk shit to us for being trash; our better educated West European friends fall into awkward silence baffled by our capacity to shoot out shit talk faster than an automatic. 

It is because our well educated friends don't understand the powerful spiritual healing known as toxic gaming. 
This toxicity is an escape. It puts perspective on how tiny our individual problems are. After every wargame there is a break from the toxicity as the last messages in the lobby pop on screen, ""GG Gents."" As in the end, we all truly respect one another and enjoyed playing this brilliant masterpiece of a game. This is because we vent all of our real world anger into meaningless text in a video game.

This game reminds us to take our brothers and sisters in open arms. This game helps us come home and greet our wives with a smile instead of  knuckles. We can take a break from all the pessamistic thoughts in our heads by venting it all out in this game's outdated, unfiltered, global chat. Some people dislike the grotesque wargame community.
I cherish it.

This is wargame afterall....

Red Dragon is a unique game in these times. It is best described as an RTS, or a RTT (Real-Time Tactics game for the old world in conflict players. WiC is probably  the game closest to RD. but WiC was significantly more arcadey than this game.

Some of the things that is enjoyable about this game:
- Strategic and deep pre-game through the deck system
- Every unit matters, and most stay relevant throughout the match
- Deep tactical gameplay, where positioning matters
- Armchair generals wet dream in terms of unit depth and accuracy
- Unique setting, not many cold war games out there
- Air combat
-Combined Arms gameplay

Red Dragon is a game that is close is being a great game instead of a frustrating one. The crux of the issue is the multi-player , which reminds me of something from 1999 and not 2014. I firmly believe that if the multi-player was shored up, this game would enjoy more widespread appeal. There are also some QoL issues that hurt the game.

- Multi-player has an extremely toxic lobby chat, which is not moderated
- There is NO report function for toxic player behavior (IE, team-killing) and you have to report it on the forum. This is totally unacceptable for a modern game
-  Players can leave matches at any time without penalty. I would prefer a more MOBA based system because quitting players ruin the match and can leave the player with too many units to handle 
- No matchmaking system for unranked play or ELO system to ensure fair, but challenging, games
- Unit response times feel sluggish and not 'snappy'. Sometimes units do not go where you tell them to or seem to have a delayed response time for seemingly no apparent reason
- The game relies heavily on ranges and spotting, but there is no way to tell the radius of what your units can see, nor any clear tooltip to show what terrain is favorable. The player should be able to mouse over a unite and see its sight radius. The lack of such a system can make the player feel hepless when units are sniped out of nowhere

Wargame has always been a series that could really benefit from QA and QOL improvements. They remind me of Parafox in that regard, but without the follow-up.

Pick up this game if you're a patient gamer, and can handle consistent negative game experience with the good. If you can't skip this title.

I picked the game up a while ago, because I was looking to play a modern military RTS. The game simulates a ""cold war gone hot"" scenario, where the communist block faces of against NATO forces (conventional warfare, without the use of nuclear weaponry). You can take command of the forces of individual nations, or of coalitions.

The game has a learning curve, what units to use, how to use them and when to use them is essential in winning a game. For example: an MBT might be very dangerous on an open field at long/mid ranges, but it is vulnerable to AT fire from infantry squads in urban environments, or getting ambushed by infantry or even lighter tanks in heavily forested areas.

I've only been playing singleplayer and I can say that I found the campaigns and skirmishes to be very enjoyable. It also helps that you can build custom decks of units for skirmish battles, making the game even more replayable. It's also worth mentioning that the game balances realism with gameplay, so I wouldn't say it's 100% realistic, but it sure is fun.",1621256462,1621256462,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

the ""tutorials"" are just pages of text, which technically tell you what to do, but playing an actual tutorial would be nice. let's jump into the ""easy"" campaign, Busan Pocket. you get your teeth kicked in by north korea after the first turn. well, lets try a skirmish. 1v1, on a 1v1 map, as the default BLUFOR starter deck against an easy REDFOR starter deck. you are smacked, but not quite as hard. join a multiplayer game, titled ""noobs"", a 4v4. hopefully you can get carried and taught how to win. this time, you are placed on REDFOR and you choose the other starter deck, Soviet Battlegroup. you take notice that every single one of the BLUFOR is playing Israel. weird. you begin the game with your comrades, and you are immediately decimated by an enemy artillery strike right where all of your units are, along with the rest of your team. turns out, map hackers camp out noob lobbies for easy kills!

This game is great, but seriously, the learning curve is just a wall. This could easily be fixed somewhat by adding a well and proper tutorial, and also making proper starter decks that are not awful, and having AI play the game normally and not know where all of your units are. maybe even touch up on the campaigns, but they might be okay. maybe add an easier campaign, one where you are not immediately having your back against the wall.

If you escape that by watching youtubers and building your own decks, you are in for a great game. I might argue one of the best RTS's ever. The amount of different playing styles, strategies, and army combinations is incredible.

Táto recenzia je v Anglickom a Slovenskom jazyku:

The game excels in high-quality artificial intelligence and a captivating course of battles. Thanks to the possibility of controlling the speed of the passage of time, you can enjoy the game in detail and even during difficult battles you have enough time to think about the next step. The single player campaign is challenging on easy difficulty, which I consider a big plus, because the game forces you to really plan strategically on the game map as well as tactically fight on the battlefield. It is a great pity that the game also has some shortcomings that spoil its course and the impression of it. It is all the more a pity that Red Dragon is not the first kind of such a game from the same manufacturer. For example, the passability of the terrain is greatly simplified. A tank rising to the top of a rock, or the passage of heavy equipment through a dense forest or even a building, is something you will have to get used to quickly, otherwise you will wonder ""how that tank got behind your lines when you cover the whole valley with mountains like Mount Everset around. ”The tutorial is very weak, and you can only really master the game after dozens of fights of all kinds. During the fighting, you will find that some units (eg helicopters and ships) are OPs and that the prices of deployment do not always correspond to the potential quality. On the contrary, the vehicles are so poorly appreciated in the game that you rarely include them in your set and they are not even used by AI. The creation of the set is very diverse, but I really lack a free hand to perfection. I am glad that the authors do not forget about the game and complement the countries, even though it is in the form of quite expensive DLC. However, I am a little surprised by the choice of countries. I understand the need to create a certain exoticism, but some of the leading countries of the time are still missing in the game. Finally, there is multiplayer, which is the real pearl of this game. Sufficient player base is a guarantee that finding more opponents in a short time is not a problem and also the game against AI is very good. Long fights in which you sweat a little are no exception. I recommend the game despite several shortcomings. Thanks.

Hra vyniká kvalitnou umelou inteligenciou a strhujúcim priebehom bojov. Vďaka možnosti ovládania rýchlosti plynutia času si hru môžete vychutnať do detailu a aj počas ťažkých bojov máte dostatok času na premyslenie ďalšieho postupu. Kampaň pre jedného hráča je náročná už na ľahkej obťažnosti, čo považujem za veľké plus, pretože vás hra núti naozaj strategicky plánovať na hernej mape ako aj takticky bojovať na bojisku. Je veľká škoda, že hra má aj niektoré nedostatky, ktoré kazia jej priebeh a dojem z nej. Je to o to väčšia škoda, že Červený drak nie je prvým druhom takejto hry od toho istého výrobcu. Napríklad prechodnosť terénu je veľmi zjednodušená. Tank štverajúci sa na vrchol skaly, či prechod ťažkej techniky cez hustý les alebo dokonca budovy, je vecou, na ktorú si budete musieť rýchlo zvyknúť, inak sa budete čudovať „ako sa ten tank dostal za vaše línie, keď kryjete celé údolie pričom naokolo sú hory ako Mount Everset.“ Tutoriál je veľmi slabý a hru skutočne zvládnete až po desiatkach odohraných súbojov všetkého druhu. Počas bojov zistíte, že niektoré jednotky (napr. helikoptéry a lode) sú OP a že ceny nasadenia nie vždy odpovedajú potenciálnej kvalite. Naopak vozidlá sú v hre tak veľmi slabo ocenené, že ich do svojej zostavy zaradíte len veľmi zriedkavo a dokonca ich nevyužíva ani AI. Tvorba zostavy je veľmi rôznorodá, no k dokonalosti mi chýba skutočne voľná ruka. Som rád, že autori nezabúdajú na hru a dopĺňajú krajiny, aj keď je to vo forme dosť drahých DLC. Som však trocha prekvapený výberom krajín. Chápem potrebu vytvoriť určitú exotiku, ale v hre stále chýbajú niektoré vedúce krajiny tej doby. Nakoniec je tu multiplayer, ktorý je skutočnou perlou tejto hry. Dostatočná hráčska základňa je zárukou, že nájsť viacerých súperov v krátkom čase nie je problém a rovnako aj hra proti AI je veľmi dobrá. Dlhé boje, pri ktorých sa poridane zapotíte nie sú žiadnou výnimkou. Hru odporúčam napriek niekoľkým nedostatkom. Ďakujem.",1620636252,1620636252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, as you can see I am no recommending the game, and while I once and a while come back to enjoy the game, the developers seem to have completely given up on it years ago, the stories about them abandoning non-windows users is true, leaving many users screwed, and reducing an already dead playerbase. 

The Single player missions are interesting in concept, but are ruined because of AI literally being able to cheat against you, new players won't be able to beat it, however there are some really cheesy tactics you can use to basically win, which are only amusing once.

Skirmish mode is fun, but obviously won't keep your attention.

Game had a mostly dead community, so online experiences will vary depending on personal experience.


With the Developers long since abandoning this game, even though it's a game I mostly enjoy, I can't in good faith recommend it.

[u] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU LOVE LARGE SCALE EPIC BATTLES AND REALISTIC RTS GAMES, BUT NOT TOO REALISTIC SO IT'S STILL ARCADEY AND FUN [/u]

i bought this game originally like 1-2 years ago, played about 20 hours of it, and i just didn't have fun. but a few months ago, i've picked up the game again, reinstalled it, took some time to learn it. and OH MAN it is fucking incredible

if you look at the screenshots like some of the ones i've taken, it is amazing.
down to the littlest details, you can zoom in and watch your units fight, but not just normal fighting, YOU can REALLY see down to the details. for example, you can zoom in from birds eye view to a soldier's view. watch your infantry fight alongside your IFVs and tanks, whilst tracer rounds fly by and ricochet off the ground, explosions booming around the camera, the earth becoming scorched from the fire around your units.

and this is just ground combat, there's also airplanes, CAS, fighter jets, artillery, hundreds of units, etc, to play, most of them with different weaponry and stats. (ignore the lame naval combat pls)
did i mention you can also use a variety of units from different time periods of the cold war? T-34s, sherman tanks, STUG III's against modern tanks, always hilarious to play despite the old ass tanks getting one tapped by abrams. and occasionally i get a lucky side shot, killing a modern tank with some outdated 80 year old tank

Everything famous or infamous about this game is already out in the wide open. This review instead is intended to be a eulogy to Eugene Systems and the RTS Magnum Opus known as the Wargame series.

My first exposure to Wargame was through European Escalation. At the time, Red Dragon was brand new and superseded Airland Battle as the most relevant. I was terrible at all three of them. My friends talked me into these titles by saying my weird, obscure knowledge of Cold War era Eastern and Western military hardware would be an asset because I wouldn’t need to dig into unit stats as often to know what a unit’s capabilities are. This is both true and remarkably false at the same time for reasons I’ll touch on below, but it was enough to push me into these games.

The next year or so consisted of a cycle of picking one of the games, attempting to play, getting frustrated at how bad I was at it, and not touching it again for another couple months. It wasn’t until European Escalation and Airland Battle’s multiplayer was effectively 100% dead and I started consuming guides through Youtube and the Steam Community Page that I started to become “not garbage” at this game and play more regularly. The fact I had to do this is my biggest gripe about Red Dragon and the Wargame series as a whole.

As I mention in my Don’t Starve Together review, I have a natural disdain for games where I have to spend a stupid amount of time reading out of game, unsupported literature to learn how to play. Wargame anything is the epitome of that, which probably explains why the only people who still play it are racist, neckbearded, and likely unemployed, armchair generals (more on this below). The only reason I was able to get to a point where I could hold my own (not get decimated in two minutes) in this game was because I was in college at the time and I was able to put the reading time in between classes and my part time jobs. I have ~300 hours or so logged in this game. A third of those were probably spent building “decks”, which are essentially the combinations of units made up of “cards” of certain experience levels and quantities that you go to battle with in a game. I know not exactly how much time I’ve spent reading or watching videos / tutorials on this game, but it is probably ~24-48 hours of my life.

Simply put, there isn’t really a tutorial in this game, or any of the Wargame titles for that matter. The closest the series ever came to having anything that was actually valuable as instructional material was the campaign in European Escalation and it isn’t very helpful. This segues conveniently into my next point which is IF YOU’RE GOING TO BUY THIS GAME IN 2020, SAVE THE CASH AND ONLY GET RED DRAGON. Seriously, multiplayer in Airland Battle and European Escalation is “totally dead” as opposed to the “kinda dead” multiplayer in Red Dragon. Additionally, the game controls and feels ever so slightly (and annoyingly) different in the previous title. Red Dragon is the most refined title in this regard. 

I really rip on this game above, but I sincerely love playing it. The single player campaigns are all based on things that could have happened, there’s a lot of attention to detail in regards to the units and their capabilities, and it's a genuinely challenging RTS. The game is not receiving any official updates or balances anymore, but just know this: The balancing history for this game was frustrating as all living hell. We all expect small balance tweaks and adjustments in a game like this, but most of the ones I remember were HUGE. For example, entire infantry squads of a certain class were cut from 15-man groups to 10-man groups, entire vehicles changed category, and napalm based weapons were changed to not do damage anymore for some reason. You have it good if you’re getting this game now because you have no expectations, just remember that.

 If this goes on sale and you like RTS games, get it. Be forewarned though, it is a steep learning curve and the “Warchat” is full of people saying some very racist things for no reason other than because they can. Despite the issues and neckbeards, please keep this game alive. We won’t get another one like it and it needs to be appreciated while there is still a player base.

04/29/21 Edit: While multiplayer was certainly ""dying"" at the time this review was published, the game appears to be getting some more attention now due to a recent free release on the Epic Games Store.

While the game itself has its own issues such as brain dead unit path finding in towns, limited single-player content beyond a basic skirmish (with a basic AI) or five campaigns (decent replay value, but the aforementioned AI doesn't lead to very interesting battles) and the near total lack of modding support (that's not to say there aren't mods, just not many), the real issue could perhaps be considered to be the community. Being an older game the community is rather developed (if small) and have some experience under their belt, and not everyone is tolerable to newer players. Often people's first games are total defeats, being wiped clean from the field. And that is if they actually made it to the field and weren't kicked/banned from the lobby for being new. Therefore, I recommend if you do pick this game up (because it really is good, grab the DLC too if you can because Reds and Israel are busted AF, NL is still good but just not as insane) look into the Wargame Boot Camp discord and some video tutorials (in-game one isn't great).

A tip to new players... DO NOT play online initially. Learn the game via the campaign and by skirmishing the AI. Watch as many Youtube videos as you can about how to build decks and play matches. Don't make the mistake I did and kill your W/L ratio by playing online first. There is no matchmaking, so veteran players often lure new players into playing SUPER unbalanced games. Join a discord community with veterans. They will most likely be happy to teach you the basics, or at least lead by example when you play games with them.

Update:
Been playing for a while longer now, and its perhaps the best RTS game out there. There are some problems with balance sure, but if you know what you are doing you can counter anything.
There exists a tutorial for the game, crazy right, its on the library page, but honestly you really don't need it since there are way better tutorials on youtube.
 
Its amazing that 7 years later we are getting a new DLC pack for this game, honestly if this game was not good, this would not be the case. And yeah you can look at the concurrent players in game or matches that are going on and it doesn't seem like it, but there are always people on. Hardcore fans (like myself) always come back to this game.

The latter does not really appeal to me and I often wish they would have just run with an amphibious aspect of the game as the ships are just broken IMO. Which is a shame as no doubt the developers put a lot of time developing the units.

As you can see from the number of hours I have ploughed into this game, I like it and why not. It is a very unique game and nearly all games played on MP are going to be different with the number of viable nations and coalitions. Like ALB it has a near vertical learning curve. So if you have skipped previous incarnations of this game them you might be in for a bit of a hard time. Don't be put off. You can play against the A.I which might cheat and not simulate human tactics and play. They will allow you to get to grips of what units do what. Also how to use them effectively. However this will require some watching of you tube to get peoples views on deck building. As deck building is the core of the game. There are no bases to build, however in certain game modes occupying territory yields an income of sorts to buy units from your pre-configured deck.

The game has been out for over a year now and this means that new players really stand out. However the forum is a good place to post and organise games with newer players. Smaller games are a great way to really appreciate the game. 1v1 up to 4v4 (other variations are available but require dedicated server support). In house games are a great way to learn to play and offer feedback to mates after a game. Again there are more experienced players out there who offer tuition as they want to add to the community.

10 v 10 is great fun and can be quite a punishing place if you are new. As new players have a tendancy to quit the game once they lose an initial push or are overrun. This has a big impact on the players left on the game and which is why a lot of newer players tend to receive the cold shoulder by some players. On the reverse of that it is also a gaming environment where new players mistakes can be corrected by other stronger players. As long you aren't feeding units to the enemy in the games most dominant game mode. Destruction, basically awards points for killing certain units with a set value. More expensive units give higher points.

To summarise a great game with fantastic MP, it has been out a while so expect to do a bit of homework for MP games. If you wish to win that is. Alternatively play it with mates in your own in house environment until you are up to speed. A truly glorious game that deserves a thriving community, unlike the dwindling one of current. Hopefully Eugen will pull another out of the bag.",1439222804,1616853827,True,2,0,0.544135451316833496,0,True,False,False

In short , this game is much more punishing than other modern RTS games and may be not a good taste for you if you are a casual player . 

In this game unit die very fast , slow to reinforce , can't be built and heavily rely on vision which lead to many situations in which player can just camp inside wood and building , freely destroy enemy and only need to move to dodge incoming arty strike . 

For single player campaign , Eugen is kinda famous for making hard campaign without difficulties toggle , the A.I always know where your units are and move accordingly , along with the problem above can give you quite a headache . 

I installed and uninstalled this game many times , this is the first RTS game that did made me feel frustrate , as a casual player .

My god, where to begin with this near-masterpiece of a game? Be forewarned: this is a REVIEW, not some pathetic little story, profoundly lame joke or cooking recipe. If you want something stupid to read, look anywhere else.

I guess I’ll start with the obvious thing: gameplay. This game is very complex, and I’d only recommend it to an RTS pro who has several RTS games under his or her belt. If you’ve played a game called “R.U.S.E” (which has since been taken off of Steam for reasons unknown), then this game will be very similar to that (not surprising given that the game was made by the same developers, Eugen Systems) one. However, if you’ve played numerous RTS games but haven’t played R.U.S.E, R.U.S.E isn’t mandatory to be able to play – it just makes things a bit easier to learn.

What’s totally insane is the extreme level of detail and diversity when it comes to units. Where R.U.S.E had 7 nations; Wargame: Red Dragon has 21 nations (split between NATO and the Warsaw Pact) with a collective total of over a thousand units. Just like R.U.S.E, each nation has its strengths and weaknesses, but unlike R.U.S.E, you can actually mix and match units from the same faction into a “deck” (to be clear, you cannot have Soviet and NATO troops in the same deck, but you can have, say, British, Canadian and South Korean units in the same NATO deck, or Polish, North Korean and Chinese units in a Warsaw Pact deck); a deck is your deployment group of what units you can call in. There’s lots of units in the game and some of them may look incredibly similar (in rare, rare cases, some are just reskins of other nations’ units) but there are statistical differences that affect your units’ performances, so I recommend looking up guides and videos on what nations’ strengths are. I’m not going to get into depth about that.

Graphically, and as far as detail goes, this game is INCREDIBLE to look at, even when you zoom in real close. The details on just about everything are absolutely marvelous, from water effects to miniature explosions when a tank gets blown to pieces.

Difficulty-wise, this game actually has a unicorn-rare feature that I haven’t seen properly exercised in almost any other RTS game: you can actually choose how the AI, both AI teammates and AI enemies, play the game, because you can set what decks the AI uses. If you want to play like a wimp and give them really crappy units while you roll out the best tanks in the game, be my guest. If the AI’s abusing artillery, you can make a deck that omits artillery so they won’t be able to deploy any. If you want to have an infantry-only war but you have no friends to do it with (this isn’t a guide on how to make friends, so don’t even ask), you can just create a deck with only infantry units in it, assign it to an AI, and you’ll be good to go.

The only issue that makes me call this a “near-masterpiece” was some lag when playing with three friends against four AI, which resulted in one of my friends being dropped from the game. Occasionally it’ll also lag without warning; the battlefield will freeze but after 5-15 seconds it’ll start again.

I wholly recommend this game, primarily for anybody who has a lot of experience with strategy games and enjoys the kind with no unit cap, or maybe you liked R.U.S.E but wanted to try a more advanced version of it or maybe a spiritual sequel to it.",1548539826,1614986591,True,16,4,0.702753305435180664,0,True,False,False

RTS was a dead genre for some time, and yet the Wargame series seemed to have potential. Probably because it was a game that focused on a rather modern era. It gained attention for simulating somewhat a modern battleground. Ironically, the developers went on and made a generic WW2 game afterwards. Kinda unfortunate considering the fact that people were genuinely excited that more nation packs could be added to this game and could be kept alive.

There was a time when the Wargame forum was always filled with new posts and debates about the game or new countries. But now, the community seems pretty much dead and although there are still a lot of people out there playing, the in-game chat is full of racist, uneducated and idiotic people. To this day I wonder why the Dev's would put all their attention to Steel Division and totally abandon the Wargame series.

I'm assuming there will be no updates in this game anymore(and it didn't have any for some time). But if you're interested in a modern RTS game, this game is probably the best choice on the market. If the Dev's poured more effort to this series maybe it would have been more successful, but it's already too late. 

Many people that still play this game is harsh to new comers. If the Dev's bad decision was the start of the end, the attitude of the current players is slamming the final nail on the coffin.",1482401228,1613043175,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

It's micro management on a macro scale. You can control hundreds of infrantrymen and dozens of tanks, helicopters and fighter jets all at once. You better hit that bong AFTER you've got everything set up and rolling because even on the Easy setting, you'll get ran over like a steam train if you aren't 100% ready to go.

Wargame, that was a great idea. But it has gotten into the wrong hands! 
Beware, if you buy Wargame, you will first think of it as a shining star in RTS heaven, but that is only half the truth.
If you stay some time you will notice, that you are in RTS hell in many regards.

With Wargame:Red Dragon you will sell your soul to one of the most biased and ignorant game developers and hosters ever. FOCUS is lieing to your face with their shining trailers that do not reflect the gameplay in any facette. While this is not to uncommon for advertising, it comes worse. They also praise this as the ""best naval battles ever"", which is a plain lie. Prepare to be disappointed by the naval component of this game.
FOCUS is also most incompetent when it comes to support. Today is release day and there are still douzens of technical issues, random crashes, graphic bugs, AI bugs, HUD failures compatibily bugs and so on. If you visit the tech forum you will notice that only 1 of hundred threads is even answered by FOCUS, not to mention solved...
When contacting a Moderator or FOCUS administrator, dont expect to be answered ever, no matter whats the issue.

EUGEN.
EUGEN has found a diamond of an RTS and decided not to polish it at all. Its the best RTS game ever made in the hands of all the wrong people. 
Its really a shame, that a bunch of developers can ignore major parts of their community even after almost three years of often very detailed and intelligent feedback in their forums. 
EUGEN has the bad attitude to send their trolling Communtiy Masters into the board, which do nothing but posting memes or give some random comments, often with a very arrogant and ignorant tone.
They will not listen to your suggestions.
They will not answer your requests
They will treat you like you are some nationalist if you raise your voice for your favourite nation 
They will not let you play Wargame they way YOU like, but make you play it how they want.

You already looking forward to play YOUR favourite nation, be it NATO or PACT?
Forget it! All you get is the same crippled decks we had in AirLandBattle. 
Want to play this game competetive and enjoy it the same time?
Forget it. The only way you can play competetive is by exploiting the weak new deck system to the extend.
You like infantry? Forget it. Welcome to the worst inf META since Suddenstrike 1. 
Like city fights? Welcome to the short range teleporting starcraft mod Red Dragon with the worst city fight solution possible.
You like planes?
Face the worst deck setup ever which allows you to spam a colorfull vairety of planes, but only 1 or 2 of the ones you really want to use (the whole game!).
You like Helicopters? Feel free to rage hard on their nonexistent Unit AI, worst pathfinding, altitude management, movement behaviour and spotting issues. Using helicopters is like playing lottery, no matter how hard you try. And you will soon learn to hate the Message ""Angle to high - cannot target"" or seeing your helis lose their LOS during firing for no reason.


Wanna join a prosperating, friendly community? 
Forget it. Thanks to the non-existent balancing of PACT vs NATO, Coalitions, nations and navy you will have to choose bteween beeing Pub Stomped from Premades, playing with incompetent random players who are so afraid of doing anything that they virtually do nothing. 
Ah, oh you play 10vs10 just to find yourself inside of the worst lag and spam fest ever in the history of RTS.

What else you get:
Impossible video options to make the game running smooth and look relatively good the same time (worst optimization ever)
Bad Interface options (everything will always be in your way)
Annoying sound when zoomed out. It was critized since 2 years, EUGEN decided not to change it. Prepare to get ear cancer when not listen to music the same time. 
No really usefull lobby options. The game is still virtually restricted to the most unfunny parts. 
Replay value is the lower than in ALB and EE.

My advice: dont buy this game. Wait for a 10 EUR weekend sale, maybe until then the game is at least stable. 
Dont expect anything else to happen. In three weeks of BETA the game meta was not changed at all and community feedback ignored 99%.

Dont feed EUGEN trolls with your money.",1397747338,1609899140,False,59,0,0.508552968502044678,4,True,False,False

This game was amazing to say the least. The unit and faction variety is just massive and I already finished 4/5 campaigns (I played lots of hours offline) and my experience was great. I also love the fact that all the units stats are realistic and even historically accurate.

Improvement suggestions:
But there is one improvement I would like ti suggest. After finishing a campaign, pretty much that was it. I would really appreciate it if you could play the same campaign from the perspective of the other side.Like playing ""Climb Mount Naronaya"" with BLUFOR instead of the USSR.
I'd also appreaciate it if you could move your units in any province in the campaign ""Busan Pocket"" so you can encircle your enemy easier.",1609009079,1609539697,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics for me are beautifull just because of the realistic vibes I get from it, also just the explosions are so great in this game and the detail that goes into every unit is just amazeing

I really liked learning to play this, its not hard but it takes time to really get the hand of purposely controlling your units on the battle field, so you need some decent strategy to play this game

audio is just good nothing to special but not even bad so thats good.

you need a fast PC/Laptop to run the game at the preferred FPS but I myself have a ""decent"" laptop that runs the game good enough.

there is the different campaigns of the game that all have their own difficulty and theater of war. When the years progress it gets harder. but yes most people dont like the campaign because it is to challenging but personally I just like it because of it.

There is no end to it, you can do the campaign for atleast a long time. And there is just endless possibilities if you play online with friends/randoms!!!

It does have a very steep learning curve: the tutorial is so useless as to be effectively a huge waste of man hours during development, and the community is absolutely venomous at times (we're talking League of Legends-tier), so learning through watching YouTube videos (BoltSauce is a particularly good channel) is the best way to proceed. There you'll quickly get a good grasp of which units are best to use for what purpose, as well as what the various decks and unit tabs do. 

Wargame: Red Dragon is best played with friends, either versus each other or against the AI. Be warned, however: the AI may have its derpy moments (get used to finding BMP-2s in the middle of rivers or even the open ocean, having run out of fuel), but don't underestimate the ingenius simplicity of its tactics. Oftentimes rushing hordes of tanks really [i]is[/i] the best way to break through a defensive line, and on any difficulty higher than Easy, any units you use to engage the enemy WILL get shelled and/or bombed. But devoting time to working out the AI's various quirks, through observation or studious post-battle analysis of replays, can be just as fun as the battles themselves.

Overall, would strongly recommend Wargame as a solid and surprisingly realistic take on modern-ish military strategy gaming.",1608674304,1608674304,True,1,0,0.505449593067169189,0,True,False,False

The setting for this game can be from 1980-2000s as the units can include AH-64Ds & F117 Nighthawks. If you're a fan of millitary strategy this game is for you, very accurate units, abundance of balanced weapon systems and other tools and just great gameplay and maps.

To add to that if you're not running windows multiplayer is basically non-existent so you're also stuck running campaigns and skirmishes unless you can setup games over discord or some other out of game matchmaking system. It's really unfortunate that the Dev's seem to not only neglect but almost actively shit on the community behind this game as it is a lot of fun and a solid game, especially when compared to their flops that followed.

[h1] GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS [/h1]
- I liked the game but it is best for professional military and war fans with a lot of patience and attention to details, along with a strategic vision for using multiple units at the same time. If you want to just have fun, maybe it is not your best choice.
- Be warned: this is not the norm RTS. It is like a genuine military war-games simulator. It has a huge array of MICROMANAGEMENT options that you have to attend if you want to see the missions completed, be it in campaign or skirmish mode (just check the Controls section for a starter).
- Thumbs-up for ultrawide support. I gave a negative vote only because I expected something else from the advertised ""the new reference in RTS"" (in my opinion, yet an unfulfilled wish).and I thought the price is a bit too high for what it has to offer. Still, I bought the game because I like military simulators and to encourage developers because it is clearly a hard and thoughtful worked game.
- The game is very good for a military map strategy simulator. It's like playing two different modes, a strategic global view and a tactical close-up view (zoom levels). They each are great but they just don't mix together quite properly. You can enjoy either one or the other.
- The main issue of this game for the regular player is a Clausewitz nightmare: it combines all three operational levels in one: a strategic map with a strategic picture of the whole region, an operational level for each area of operations (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc. where you must conquer sections) and a tactical level of micromanagement for each set of units you are sending in combat (care for how, when and where you combine your units, lots of detailed information about each unit and tons of things to watch and to do, including resupplying, defending, reinforcing etc.). On top of that, you have limited troops you can send in combat based on the command points you obtain through combat and objectives capture. 
- Your eyes can get stuck with a wall of labels moving on a map for hours, I don't find that very enjoyable (I recommend you go to User Interface and select Icons Type - NATO, Labels Size - Small, Label Style - European Escalation and Label Size in Multiple Selection - Minimal, in order to minimize the impact of those many labels on screen). At times you may feel like a general in front of a big map in High Command.
- The game has a proper name """"war-games"""", it does a very good job at that and it should be called simulator but not RTS game.
- I enjoyed playing this game in skirmish mode (vs AI).
- The game has good potential but imo needs more to become ""the new reference in RTS genre"" or maybe it just needs less micromanagement and more fun, it is kind of too realistic and detailed in military strategy, operations and tactics at the same time (therefore I said I would recommend it to professionals).
- Classic RTS games are about resources / economy / troops building and management along with terrain and objectives management. This game has a different approach, you get everything you want, just need to focus on fighting (troops / terrain / objectives) but with a lot of micromanagement. I am NOT saying it is a bad thing, though. It's just a different approach and can be enjoyable. But it's not for the average player.
- The game offers A LOT of info (as troops morale, ammo reloading status, weaponry caliber, range, accuracy,mechanical issues, repair status and such) but they are not of real use in the big picture and should not be included in an RTS either. The relevant info is the supply status of the units (fuel and ammo).
- Unfortunately, the campaign mode has no decent story and focuses on 4X turn-based features rather than RTS.
- The game is good for military exercises (Blue vs Red) in skirmish, plenty of maps and commands available, using all types of units.
- I expected more from a 2014 game. Better graphics, smarter concepts and a story.
- In my opinion, the price should be around $15 (especially 5 years after release).
- Yes, I did.play the campaigns and skirmish and the vote is only for these. Please consider that **I DID NOT TRY THE MULTIPLAYER** side of the game, it may provide a nicer feeling and better opinions.

[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]
- The game does well on the turn-based features.
- The campaigns are quite short and with no decent story, in fact some of the most arid campaigns I ever played in an RTS.
- The real-time feature (aka the RTS side) of the campaigns, where you choose to lead your own battles instead of auto-resolving is poorly implemented, it looks quite ugly and definitely is not giving you the joy of massive scale RTS battles nor it has much strategy in it since you cannot diversify units production, upgrades and such.

[h1] SKIRMISH [/h1]
- The skirmish is the diamond of this game. You must try it, it has maps up to 4vs4 against AI or real players.
- It is fun up to a point and provides large scale battles with a ton of units.
- The interface is a bit uncommon for an RTS and you can find at times wondering what group of units is doing what and where.
- Too many labels on the screen, it looks like a military map (good for strategic decisions) but  makes you lose focus of the tactic side and POIs (points of interest) where you want to perform an action, conquer an objective and actually enjoy the game visually. Basically it is like this: zooming out at max it is a map full of labels you don't need. Zooming in at max it is pretty well rendered units but you totally lose control of the big picture. Zooming in just as to control your units and feel the battle, the picture you see is not an enjoyable one (not much to see) and still too many and too big labels. 
- The ""Speed"" feature is good probably for lazy players but great for simulations. A good skirmish can extend up to two hours or even more if you play with AI on Very Hard.
- Units go straight through any type of environment (literally) be it house, tree, water, rock, other unit. the collision mechanic works rather not. The no-clip problem is something I can forgive. Zooming function has issues sometimes.
- The AI is sometimes behaving strange and just stops its units doing nothing (even if resupplied or fresh) or takes very wrong decisions. I also saw quite often AI units (including infantry) going straight through the burning ground (taking useless damage and morale impact) after the area was spammed with missiles and incendiaries.

[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]
- The game is great and as I mentioned, with a lot of patience and love for details micromanagement. Best for people with a military professional background.
- Before ranting about my playtime, please refresh your browser and check again.  Not that you would need a lot of time to see what a game can and cannot.
- I played my fair share of games and about all good RTS games around for many years and I will repeat the fact that the game HAS potential, and it's great for war-games but to be named RTS it needs more polish, content, a story and less micromanagement.
- What an RTS game is in my opinion, actually one that gives you playing satisfactions without combining all three military operational levels and without micromanagement headaches, just to exemplify:
** Command & Conquer series.
** Stracraft series
** Halo Wars series. 
** Sudden Strike series.
** Company of Heroes series.
** World in Conflict.
** Age of Empires series (not all of AoE games).
** Total War series (not all of Total War games).

It has op tanks and op infrantry and the only way to win is playing the capitalist nations (so far)the communist nations are garbage well its historical so i didnt expect much but the cost between buying troops is a bit on the weird end. op tanks can cost around 170 which is captitalist nations but compare that to communist nations which has 170 points tanks the capitalist have a upper hand.
The devs try to balance it out by making the communist nations have cheaper troops but to me it doesnt work. chines troops have anti tank and cost around 20 points but capitalist nations that have troops with anti tank capabilities is much more stronger with better range and most of all can easyly counter communist nations tanks.
Theres a game mode which is quite confusing. its about which faction can kill the most people and guess what 0-0...capitalist nations will always win since they have more quality troops.
I dont have any DLC for this game so the quote about the jewish nation being op might just be the other players being good but if you go on youtube, you could clearly see that the jewish nations is op and other youtubers that played that nation agrees and the reviews of that dlc in the steam page.

Back when I used to play this, I genuinely used to have nightmares/dreams about this game, something like the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect]Tetris effect[/url] as I used to play this game a lot.
Usually they are losing games where I end up having to pull the entire team or suffering a small percentage of the pain as my units in the field, as well as feeling my brain ""sizzle"" in frustration (just bad dreams, not really nightmares). Other times they are just normal games with more units than usual, and our team manages to push to the last sector. In both cases, they are all real trippy (they're dreams of course).
So I guess this game somehow manages to qualify for ""Haunts my Dreams"".[/spoiler]

[h1]THE REVIEW:[/h1]

It's a good game and a last hurrah for the Wargame series and maybe even Eugen as a whole (sorry, I'm not getting Steel Division, this is the end here). I've been a long time supporter of Eugen back during R.U.S.E. These series have been my dream game (not related to the nomination) come true: A real-time RTS with a myriad of military units from various nations. In the Wargame series there is depth, there is detail, and most importantly, there is fun in both victory as you steamroll the enemy and play hide-and-seek with the last CV, and there is fun in defeat as you fling insults on the enemy, your teammates, and Eugen for making the game unbalanced/unfinished/shit...etc.

Red Dragon, like the rest of the Wargame series is pretty good. It got all the good and bad points of its two previous games (European Escalation, and Airland Battle). There are two main features of RD:
-Adds various East Asian armies and Australia, as well as Finland, Yugoslavia, Netherlands, and Israel (if you count the DLC) to the Wargame roster. Loads of fun for both PACT and NATO, and a nice break from the European theatre of EE and ALB. The timeframe is also shifted a little bit into the '90s, which may be a little late and too fictional for some Cold War enthusiasts (like me). Somewhat related is that there are ""prototype"" units for several of the armies in-game, which is a bit too much bullshit for my tastes. like the Fallschrimjäger '90 back when the game was newly released.

-Naval warfare, which is unfortunately very ""basic"" and very disappointing. Unlike the introduction of fixed-wing aircraft in ALB, the very feature that RD was made for comes very short of expectations. The scaling and range of the weapons systems are just not ideal in many ways. That being said, ships are still relatively fun to use. There is nothing better than seeing an amphibious assault successfully land on the enemy's side on Wonsan, Gunboat, or D-Day. My favorite combination:
Landing craft INF, recon, AA + Smoke screen + Landing CV + Heli support + Naval support = Capture the enemy's main spawn = Easy win.

[h1]Q&A:[/h1]

[b]Q:[/b] Is it ded?
[b]A:[/b] There are enough players if you are looking for a game.

[b]Q:[/b] Is it hard?
[b]A:[/b] If you got a knack for RTS games, then this will be a fun game to learn. Otherwise, it will be a bit challenging. It isn't anywhere near CMANO, that's for sure.
In the end, you should be able to identify and generally remember the stats of most of the units ingame. As soon as you see ""Unit name"", you should be able to know what you are up against, how counter it, and what extras come with it. I don't mean literally memorize, but generally remember so you can make a quick decision instead of hovering over unit, pressing TAB, and reading everything all over again...
(I can't say it's hard myself since I've been playing Eugen RTS games since R.U.S.E. and EE.)

[b]Q:[/b] Should I buy the game?
[b]A:[/b] It's entirely up to you. If you have a hard-on for military hardware and troops, get this. If you get a raging boner dreaming about ""Cold War gone hot"" scenarios, get this (personally I prefer EE or ALB). If you get wet thinking about fucking around, spouting memes like an immature fag in the menu lobby chat instead of playing the game itself, get this. If you just want a good quality real-time RTS that offers a unique experience, definitely get it.

[b]Q:[/b] Thoughts and opinions?
[b]A:[/b] I used to play 10v10 tactical/low income to make up for my toaster PC. The worst aspect of this game is the community and other players on your team. Sometimes you strike gold and end up with an excellent team, or the enemy ends up with a shitty team. Sometimes, it's just not your lucky day: People not using recon, falling to obvious traps, inadequate air defense, artillery spam...etc. If you do get this game, prepare to be frustrated. Unless you get some friends to play with, or join normal servers (that are obviously not hosted by friends stacked on the same team). Also, for your own sake, mute the menu lobby chat unless you want cancer. This is the only noteworthy thought/opinion. You will really see what ESRB's ""Game experience may change during online play"" means.

Huge content, several free DLCs, beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, great learning curve.

Well I just love this game, the number of hours I spent playing is a great testimony of that.

There are still some huge flaws : 
- on overall, the game is not balanced and as a mostly PACT players, I do feel like giving the US the Patriot and making it easier for US players to spam F14 was a big mistake. The same goes with the longbow which does not have many counters, especially since USSR AA choppers were nerfed...According to the dev, the game should not be balanced to reflect the difference between nations. But to do so, they just skipped some equipment for some nations (USSR S-300) to give an edge to other nations
- the matchmaking is really bad. Since in lobby we can now see the % of wins/losses, and since it seems veteran players are mostly Western people playing with Western nations, they do pubstomping making it really difficult to play a fair battle while playing for PACT.
- no votekick system, which means that if someone decides to TK his team, there is nothing you can do about it. So may have spent 20-30mn waiting for the battle to start (when there are not may people playing), to have everything ruined by one guy.

It has tons of units, and they are not just the same thing re-modeled for different factions, they are based on real world military data. May not be 100% accurate, but has a good balance between reality and gameplay.

In the first 5-10 hours you'll feel like you are banging your head against a brickwall - because it is not a easy game to learn, and even harder to master. You will be completely overwhelmed and desperately trying to save your combat lines. If you don't make it through this stage and uninstall I wouldn't blame you. It isn't for everyone.

But if you make it past that painful 10 hours, you'll start to appreciate that this game is less game but more of a chess game. You are in command of an army that you can configure your way - and there is not a ""right"" way.

Do you want to have an elite group of army that is well-equipped and emphasize quality? You can do that.
Do you want to have swarms of soldiers and vehicles that doesn't neccessarily beats anyone 1 versus 1, but the sheer quantity would overwhelm any defensive line and lead you to victory. You can do that too.

The amount of freedom the game offers you is staggering, and there are so many variation you can set up your army its replayability is extremely high. You'll get your moneys worth out of it.

There are also many mods made for WG:RD. I personally recommend Ash and Shadows, which introduced the latest weaponry of today to the game + new mechanics (notably, active protection system).

They also largely leave artillery alone unless they get mad. Another issue is balancing artillery. IRL infantry dig in once they hit an objective in a peer war. This makes them nearly impossible to kill using just artillery. Infantry are also too easy to spot. In real life tanks rarely spot infantry unless they are incredibly careless.

A few words of caution though: Don't play this like your regular RTS; you'll lose very quickly. And stay away from the Warchat unless you want brain cancer.
There are only 3 things bad about this:
1) The ""tutorial"" is a joke. Just go and play easy singleplayer for your first game--you'd probably lose unless you've played something similar, but you'll learn a lot more.

 give it a little time and you will see the beauty this game is :)

You got to love the feeling that goes into planning your move, and regardless of the outcome think 2 steps ahead.

UPDATE : 02/28/2020

Still playing this game..... now 6 years on -  almost 1400 hours and still loving the game. 

Why >? you may ask  well since my above statement still rings true I am going to give you a better break down and hopefully help people better understand this game especially if your new. 
1) i can not speak for single player option as i have not yet played them.

2) all online play mainly 10 v 10 matches

first you start by building a deck from a vast list of units and you choose the respective country you would like to play from the usa to france and for the soviet block the soviet union to north korea 

what way do you want to play ?

artillery and infantry ?   tanks and infantry ?  artillery ? offensive action or defensive play ?

AA cover ?      my best opinion and most success has come from having rapid fire artillery or mortars close by to support your infantry attacks and have aa to cover the attack close by keeping either 30mm or 20mm cannons and tanks close by for support.


this is why i love this game there is options galore and thinking must go into how your forces are going to take the next 500ft  then hold and secure it before your next move.

the risk of loosing your forces is what keeps you on edge, but when you know your ready to throw the dice throw them and see what happens. 

Patience is required in the game but as your progress it will keep you coming back. 

10/10 



  (your first step is to play a few games and make a few mistakes but pay attention to how everything pans out and how to lay out your units to best suit the situation.  make a few decks and have some fun, over time you will see how to best mix your units for Anti-Aircraft cover and making sure choke points and areas are garrisoned. 

 I never leave expensive units 80+ at the front line i will leave cheap units and infantry to control crossroads and hopefully they can hold them off untill i can bring up my support to either blunt and or counter attack them - if you do leave higher end units leave 1 or 2 spread  them out from different POV's and wait.",1510003908,1602555204,True,16,0,0.630169153213500977,0,True,False,False

Expanding to combat on the seas, along with the already established air and land warfare, this large and deep cold-war era RTS is not for the faint hearted! With the scope enlarged from ALB and slow hedgerow battles of EE largely gone, this is all out modern warfare on a grand scale. 

The campaigns are a good intro, Skirmishes a great way to build your decks (and learn your enemy's), and mutiplayer is tactically brutal and strategically tense. With 100's of NATO and Warsaw Pact units to commit to battle, it is helpful if you have an interest in military units, their intended use and hard counters. 

For those who go as far into the RTS genre as C+C or Worms, this may not be for you. If you have many leather bound books on military history and generalship, then do try (and be patient with) this game. It rewards the keen commander with excellent gameplay.

It's a bit of a slow roll because there's no tutorial, the single player is garbage and unplayable. Start off by watching some tutorial videos online, then play against AI in a ""multiplayer"" game and set the AI to very easy.

Once you learn the basics, keep increasing the AI difficulty until you can kill the hardest difficulty. Then forget all the tactics you learned, but keep the unit knowledge and mechanics as playing against real people is nothing like AI and join a large like 10v10 game and try to hold a small section of the map until you can do that, then try pushing a small part of the map and ask for feedback from other players and add them to friends.

Wargame: Red Dragon is a game I recommend to any weapons and military nerds out there. I love this game but if you are buying it, you must know that it is not your average RTS game based on rock paper scissors. If you are into C&C or Company of Heroes, you may find it difficult to understand but if you are into the realistic military games genre, then you are in for a bliss. Here is my criticism of Wargame: Red Dragon.

[h1] Criticism [/h1] 

[b] Pros [/b]

+Accurately designed and depicted vehicles and units.

+Aesthetics of cold war.

Explanation: I am personally tired of seeing WW2 games as a person from a country that was neutral in the war, I don't feel the patriotic feelings a Russian or American player may feel while playing a WW2 game. Of course I am aware of the importance of WW2 but I just don't have the  same romantic appeal towards the genre. Since most game devs only know of American involvement in Vietnam, the cold war era was equally boring in video games. That's why I find Wargame: Red Dragon to be a gem. It allows  you to create what if's between other major powers in the cold war instead of just America! Hell yeah! stuff I keep seeing in other 'Cold War' games.

+Deck based forces.

Explanation: I was at first sceptical when I heard the game had card decks you have to go through but oh boy was I wrong in my assumptions. I have spent more time making decks or looking at the beautiful units and vehicles than I have in matches. The deck making can be complicated but once you get a hold of it, it becomes so much fun. You get to decide what units you want to bring into combat and design your own army. 

+/- The lack of a base building

Explanation: This may be a negative thing for some others but it does make sense in Wargame: Red Dragon. You will never see an army build a tank factory on the go in the front lines to magically spawn tanks in a few minutes, in real life. The only building there is is the FOB.

+Easy to set-up skirmish or multiplayer games.

+Over a thousand units! 

Note: All of them are unlocked and ready to go(if you have the nation unlocked some nations  come as DLCs), no microtransactions to unlock cards or custom stuff is a fresh sight.

+Active community on youtube and discord. There is help you can find anywhere, just avoid Warchat.

[b] Cons [/b]

-/+ The DLCs and the subject of Pay to Win.

Explanation: The DLCs add interesting nations but there is some criticism regarding them. Although, I do not consider the game a Pay 2 Win game but some of the DLC nations are unbalanced compared to the stock nations. 

-Lack of Moderation and the situation of Warchat.

Explanation: We all know that a lack of moderation and the presence of anonymity is a recipe for disaster online. Warchat is no exception. If you are new and want to learn how to play, avoid warchat and just look for youtube tutorials or a dedicated discord server. Warchat will give you 58 types of lung cancer.

-Eugen Syndrome.

Explanation: The devs have abandoned it for their next game, it is sad but it is the truth. Developers abandoning their hard working product is always sad to see.

-Hard to mod, the game is not friendly for modders.

-Lack of new maps. I have played it over 296 hours, there is more to do of course, there is always something to do, just playing  the same maps over and over again gets boring sometimes.

-Desynch of game in coop against AI and some other game breaking bugs.

-Barely any tutorial.

-Uninteresting and short Campaign against stupid bots with the intelligence of a toddler.

-Minor realism issues.

Explanation: Maybe I am just nitpicking and some features weren't added due to technical reasons but here are some minor problems I have with the game's claim of realism.

-Infantry combat is janky and models look weird, the infantry cannot use mortars, grenades. 

-Vehicles cannot deploy smoke screens, only some artillery pieces can. Vehicles also can only use commander's or the loader's machine guns/grenade launchers/autocannons. There is no coaxial weapon feature.

-Naval combat is fun but unfinished, it is open to too many exploits.

-AI is dumber than a rock and also cheats.

This game is simply unplayable now due to those contaminations.
Do not waste your money on this game.

On a technical side:
* developers claim that it is realistic - total BS, the game is BaLaNcEd... all the technical parameters of soviet and NATO equipment is equalized for same damage and efficiency. 

* the game is a click fest, sometimes its about few clicks which you missed before something went wrong because the units have IQ of 0.

* from previous statement, just horrible AI, to do stuff well you literally have to micromanage every movement of each unit

* because of a crappy player base, even if you micromanage it properly on your side - someone will do something dumb on your team.

all in all, this game will make you rage more than it will give satisfaction.

Audio (7 of 10):  Excellent, but voice dialog becomes repetitive very quickly.

Gameplay (9 of 10):  Some realism was sacrificed to provide for a better gaming experience.  Avoids making the game arcade like in its simulation, but simplifies where it helps.

Learning (8 of 10):  While the game has many units it is well balanced, learning the basics is fairly straightforward, especially if you're a student of military tactics.  If flanking, SEAD aircraft sorties, and Fire and Forget all sound like neat features you'll find them all.  Regrettably a detailed analysis of combat effectiveness is hidden as the combat statistics don't reflect in game realities.  For example high rate of fire weapons may go through ammo faster but may not attack any faster.

Stability and Bugs (10 of 10):  406 hours and no crashes, lockups, or hangs.  I wish Microsoft Windows was this stable.
Overall (8 of 10):  A superb, enjoyable game if you want a visually delightful military simulation.


Gameplay tips:  I have enjoyed Red Dragon a great deal without mods, it's one of the few games that really doesn't need them to work around limitations.  DLCs are great because you know exactly what you get before you buy it.

It's an extremely intense game to get into if coming from games like Halo Wars, Starcraft, Empire at War or even the Total War series. Games can last from 45min to hours depending on the amount of people in a match (2-20) & the game mode. The game is set during the cold war era. This is NOT a rock, paper n' scissors style of RTS but instead it relies on statistics, chance & overall unit composition. It requires you to be well acquainted with micro & macromanaging large amounts of units & the terrain they inhabit. The game uses a ""deck"" system in which you can customize a deck of units for a nation of your choosing for a certain map or for group play. Decks are limited to a ""unit cap"" & come with their own respective bonuses depending on what style of play you favor, such as reconnaissance (spotting for your team), armor (being the tank), air (providing CAS & quick reinforcements) or mechanized (infantry & highly mobile armor); however, you can always choose to go with a general deck, which has zero bonuses but allows you to field any combination of units you desire. I spend majority of my time outside of matches editing & building decks. Overall it's a helpful tool for you to take advantage of, so you can know everything there is to know about both your units & what you could be up against in matches. Overall, in strategy, I give this game a solid 9.0/10. Reason? Me personally, I love the challenge but I know to many the very steep learning curve will either make or break new players. 

PROS
>Plenty of units & nations to choose from depending on, which faction you play (NATO or Warsaw Pact).
>Able to command units on the ground, air & sea.
>Challenging & highly strategic (no guns blazing or blind rushing).
>Maps are beautiful as well as graphics. 
>Audio quality is great & gives you a feeling of immersion.
>Variety of singleplayer campaigns to play solo & yes, skirmish against the AI does exist. 
>Can choose to set a game timer or not. 

CONS
>Steep learning curve.
>Small community.",1593643218,1593643218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

----------
+There are over 1,5k units of very various (logistics, infantry, support, tank, recon, vehicles, heli, planes, navy)
+Different deck specialization.
+Decent terrain , hide your units in the woods or protect your units wherever....
+You can make lots of different tactics.
+Massive multipleyer (up to 10 vs 10) or small plays if you want (1 vs 1).

Negative.
-----------
-I find the compare tool very usefull when creating a deck, but you should be able to compare more than 2 units at once.
-Stealth is a bit fucked. A vehicle can detect infantry hiding in urban areas or forest from hundreds of meters away.... (even if you deactivate all weapons aka they should not be exposed)

Q: How is the community?

Comparing to Airland Battle, Red Dragon is expanded a bit with mechanics and units, but these games are mostly the same. I think that AB has better maps, when RD has more interesting units and mechanics, for example amphibious vehicles.

Pros First
You like RTS games? You like modern combat? You like making the perfect play style after alot of trial and error? Then this game will be fun for you it provides for you to make the perfect deck to bring into mutliplayer. These decks come from a huge assortment of countries set during the later colds war. You wanna play the Soviets in the 80's? This game has that. US? UK? West Germany? China? Japan? You can play all of these countries and more If you pay of course.
That's all I can say that's good

Cons
Singleplayer? More like glorified tutorial with not alot of instruction and more you just figure out everything on your own while the AI throws massive waves of tanks infantry and planes at you WHile YOuR uNIts HavE LoW INItiATivE and although the campaigns are beatable they are not fun because of the cheating the AI does in the later campaigns overall singleplayer is a crap segway to multiplayer.

Multiplayer is a mixed bag and there is good stuff about it but the bad overshadows. Toxic community is a huge reason this game is dead and will stay dead. You a level one starting out? well sucks for you level 5000's don't want to play with scum like you and will kick from they're lobbies and although there are ""noob games"" these games are still filled with people with hundreds of hours. You want fun competition? forget it a huge portion of the people in this game are salty, annoying and above all racist with chats filled with idiots just yesterday I saw a guy insulting Chinese people and the whole chat joined in. You might be asking about the gameplay and all I will say is that It can be a micro with you doing things you never thought you would have to do a big example of this is radar weapons and how you have to turn them off everytime they are done done firing lest they get targeted by a plane with radar seek. Or the fact that every unit must be resupplied after they run out of ammo which is fine by me but is daunting to people starting out. And the META's omg the meta players in this game let me tell you if you want to buy this game for a realistic combined arms experience do not buy this game you will be disappointed by spam and cheese used by people with the pay to win countries in this game.

So unless you want to spend 100's of hours learning the mechanics and strats of this garbage game while dealing with a idiotic community do not buy this game as the devs don't care and will never balance the game so don't fall for the trap of this game no matter how awesome the idea seems and if you do buy it then good luck and I hope you have a better experience than me otherwise...

10/10 would study every weapon and unit again. I think I should become a general now.
update April 20.,2020: This game is very awesome. I got this game with all DLC on sale, and you should too if you want a high quality RTS for a fairly low price. The campaigns are well made, their backstories interesting and very close to real life, and each one with a different style of gameplay. Busan pocket and pearl of the orient being more of a defense style, Climb Mount Narodnaya being a Russian blitz style, and 2nd Korean War with a mix of defense and offense. I would love a Wargame 4, but I don't think that would happen. Multiplayer and AI battles are also very cool.

Considering the scale of the maps and battle areas, the graphics and textures of both the maps and units is very good and still holds up today, 6 years after the games release. The nature of this game is air-land battle which means it incorporates all aspects of tactical and strategic warfare in terms of aircraft, land forces and naval elements which, working in conjunction, can beat any larger force which is managed poorly as playing the campaign will show you. Many people complain about the global chat which I admit can get quite colourful at times, however I personally find it a good laugh to follow a conversation between 2 salty players, usually from different countries, bringing up massive stereotypes and slagging each other off (recently inflated by the Kung-Flu situation). As a multiplayer battle goes on, the environment will of course change due to aerial and land bombardment as well as crew served and shoulder fired explosive and Napalm based weapons. The effects on the environment will be permanent, this means deforestation and craters will be caused within the maps which is a pretty cool feature as it adds realism and even removes cover. Tank and other vehicle carcasses will also stay present on the map as a testament to your failures. The balancing of units is generally very good with prices of units increasing incrementally based off how good the unit is both compared to its class, and other units it may encounter on the battlefield, an example is aircraft is not an unstoppable force as an AA unit that costs less than a quarter of its price can shoot it down with ease, yet a SEAD aircraft can take out any Radar guided AA without much risk to itself. A counter argument to this however is certain nations, such as the DLC nation of Israel is pretty powerful, possibly to carry on the great ROFL stomp of Yom Kippur! Every aspect of combat is addressed in this game as supplies and veterancy/disposition of your units must be taken into consideration when thinking about deploying them into an assault. Logistics is the backbone of any army and this one is no exception with larger units taking more supplies e.g. it takes more to supply 1 hellfire missile than 1 84mm Karl Gustav round. The learning curve is likely going to be the biggest turn off for new players as it seems to take around 30-40 hours to get your head around how to successfully handle all your types of units in conjunction such as aircraft, artillery and armour. You'll hate enemy airburst artillery. 9/10 game",1584650028,1584650028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wargame: Red Dragon is a game developed and published by Eugen Systems

The game offers some really nice graphics and a nice yet simplistic aesthetic which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even though it is a little rough around the edges

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time

Wargame: Red Dragon overall, however, is an okay game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay strategy game to play in short bursts!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

I tried playing tactical games so there's less units to manage, but again you're probably facing off with someone who has 2000+ games that knows every unit weakness and map strategy by heart. There's not even enough population to consistently get into online games within 10 minutes or so.

I really wanted to like this game but I can't give a recommendation for it. It's designed for online play, but there is only a tiny online community for it. Most public battles are 4 friends on one side vs a bunch of randoms on the other and that goes about as well as you'd think it would.

So what about offline play? The AI is horrendus. All it knows how to do is throw units into a meat grinder. Additionally, sometimes it just stops making moves or spawning units and just sits there (probably a bug, but c'mon this game has been out for what, 2 years now?)

Finally there's the steep learning curve. I like complex games, but forget 1 type of unit and your whole force is destroyed in seconds. The micromanagement is also pretty horrific. Every unit has to be given very specific commands and it will not take any automated action what so ever. Helicopters taking ground fire? They just sit there until they're destroyed. Same goes for tanks. The notification system is terrible. All you hear is ""trouble...trouble....trouble..."" and no indication of who's in trouble or where they are...yeah lemme just scan the map for the 5 guys standing next to a burning tree...again taking no action on their own to move 3 steps to the left so they don't burn to death.",1454472073,1581720628,False,70,12,0.678043067455291748,3,True,False,False

Here's why; I spent at least 5 hours reading and watching guides before I even played against AI. After playing against the AI enough to feel comfortable, I jumped into multiplayer. The first thing I noticed is the game only averages 500 players online. You can expect some teammates to be toxic towards you because you're new. Although that type of thing doesn't bother me much (plus there are convenient mute features for those whom it does), the main problem was even finding a game. Out of 6 days attempting to play, I was able to get 10 games in. On 1 of those days, there simply just were no lobbies to find or the wait times for the lobby to fill were way too long. More concerning though is that on 2 of those days, every available lobby would simply kick me because of the low games count on my profile. 

TLDR: The community is not welcoming to new players, to the point that you can't even play the multiplayer portion of the game.

1. The community is the most toxic I have ever seen. The ingame chat filled with nazis (with the name of Jewhunter, WaffensturmführerSS, Adolf Hitler, ...) who openly talk about how they want to kill either jews or their parents... or in ""good"" moments just verbally abuse each other in ways that would make 4chan look classy in comparsion.

2. The unit spam is really the worst about the game. It doesn't feel like a military strategy simulation, but rather like an arcade shooter wherein the one wins who can spam the most units.
Honestly it just looks plain silly when I start a bomber and the enemy sends 10 AA jets against it, or suddenly there are 20 helicopters flying in bulk into my zone going full kamikaze.
It's better when the credit gain is set to low on the map, but appearantly nobody likes that..

3. Singleplayer sucks, and so does multiplayer sadly. When you finally get into a game after waiting for 20 minutes in the lobby, you either get an extremely stupid team who surrenders the match in the first few minutes, or your team gets stomped by the pro players, who make up most of the remaining player base.

A big reason for that is that there's no auto team-balance and no way to see how strong your team is - except stupidly clicking on every player and then on ""view profile"" - so in 8 out of 10 games you get extremely unbalanced teams.
Which just leads to really frustrating matches, especially when you are new to the game. I player over 50 matches so far and only 3 where actually good and worth remembering. This is really not good enough.

I would love it if they added more campaigns to the game or did more expansions.

EASY DOES NOT MEAN EASY. You will get your ass handed to you many times, but once you get the hang of it, it is very satisfying to see MAJOR VICTORY pop up on the screen.

ps: Always prepare a deck for every foe, role, and situation.
Take time when building deck, read the fine print. Know thy unit strength and weakness.
Use common senses please, tank in an urban setting? Infantry in an open expanse field? Helo without air superiority? Please don't. (Unless your bluffing)
Please coordinate with your teammate. Whose take which role. (and lane!)
Recon is the KEY! (knowing is half of the battle.)
Sometimes, a strong point isn't exactly strong. Learn to know the lay of the land. Elevation, chokepoint, and visibility. 
Well, there is much more to say, but do read the wiki and guide your fellow gamer wrote. It's very valuable for you and your teammate!

Have fun and stay aware. ;D

At time of writing this review, I consider this game one of my all time favourites. 

The reason why I bought this game are youtube video's. When I watched those video's I was really suprised about the depth of the game. And as a RTS fan, I was instantly hyped and bought the game.
When I actually started to play the game for the first time, I was absolutely masacred by easy A. I.. I tried playing the game for a couple of single player games, but still no visible progress. At that moment I choose to not play this game anymore. I though I had wasted my money. (Eventually I figured out it wasn't.)

Quite some time later I decided to give it one more shot. I started to look up guides and started to watch youtubers who explained how this game worked. Thanks to one particular youtuber I learned how to play the game. I watched his guides.

I added a example video.

Example video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgmslx7_kLg&list=PLlSUA5AyYAoeDPCjR6weNeiXXJitl4dlc


After playing a fuckton of games I finally passed the learning curve. Currently I have various friends in wargame with whom I regularly play games and share decks with.


Negative;
- Long learning curve (unit placement, synergy between units, utilizing the right opportunities, etc.)
- Alot of failure and roflstomping in the beginning.
- Alot of mechanics to get used to. (soft counters, hard counters, tank shells -> kinetic or HEAT, etc.)
- Even the slightest mistake can result in a total annihilation of your units or even defeat. Which can be quite frustrating.
- In-game tutorials are not sufficient enough to learn how the game works.


Positive
- Playing with a group brings the level of tactical gameplay to the next dimension.
- The game become really fun to play after you are passed the long learning curve.
- The evenly matched online games are awesome to play and even give a satisfied feeling if are defeated.
- When played accordingly the mechanics and synergy systems implemented are brilliant.
- This game offers you a very broad selection of units. There are unlimited combinations to combine into a deck. 

I recommend this game to players who have the time AND the will to learn how the game works.

Review:
Really underrated and amazing game and the only real strategy game out there these days besides Starcraft and CMO/CMANO (which I don't even consider a ""game""). This game may be frustrating at first but so worth it once you get to know the controls and common units.

Graphics are good. It's just downright fun to fly around your favorite fighter jets (avoid jets while learning the game though) and drive around your favorite tanks. Don't have a favorite tank? Well there are over a hundred to choose from, and you'll find some you like after playing with them. Don't be intimidated by the number of units - you will get used to it and learn them over time. The variety makes the game fun.

Gameplay is good - the controls are fairly easy to grasp (unlike CMO/CMANO) and the game does not demand as much APM (actions per minute: how fast do you need to click) as Starcraft. The ""difficulty"" is not the controls, it's mostly learning strategies (how/when to use which controls/units) and unit counters. These take a little while to learn. Do not get this game if you only expect to play for 20 hours.

The best part about Wargame is its replayability. There are so many units to choose from, and so many different ways to play, that games don't feel repetitive, like Starcraft, where people have carefully planned builds and timings etc. Hate jets? You don't have to use them at all. Don't want to micromanage artillery? Don't deploy any. I love the flexibilty and general lack of you-lose-if-you-don't-do-X kind of gameplay. Except recon. You lose if you don't use recon units. Use recon units.

As with any game, Wargame has its share of ""wow you suck noob why did you do X thing"". IGNORE THEM - the other 95% of us are just happy more new people are getting the game! It's better for everyone when new people join, and we'd be happy to have you. Watch out for pubstomping lobbies (i.e. lobbies called ""noobs welcome"" with 4 very high level players on the other team), but you should be able to find good games/lobbies if you're a little bit patient.

Summary:
I highly recommend Wargame: Red Dragon. It truly is a one-of-a-kind game. If you like strategy or modern/cold war military stuff, or miss Command and Conquer, and are willing to endure a longer-than-usual learning time, you will like Wargame once you get the hang of it. It is extremely replayable and lends itself to a wide variety of playstyles. I wouldn't even call myself ""hardcore"", but 600 hours later, I'm still here. Come join the fun!

(and seriously, if you get the game, there are players who want to help you learn. the wargame subreddit is a good starting place)

P.S. if you're thinking ""I'll wait for the next one"", the developers have said they won't make a next one. The hard core fans will not leave this game until the sun explodes. So don't worry about the game dying out, despite the relatively small number of players. We are here to stay, and I rarely have trouble finding games/lobbies/players.",1575008511,1575008511,True,33,4,0.744957149028778076,1,True,False,False

The experience is akin to the game World in Conflict as far as troop deployment/holding territories, but here we see a much more fleshed out game. 8/10",1574949731,1574949731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Industrial buildings and extraction facilities that take months to build are not ""created in 30 seconds."" like may ""real time"" games. That is a plus. Finally, some logic, and critical thinking in this genre. That is all. 

What is the point of a ""wargame"" 

When it has more in relation to chess, and Rubik's cube, than actual war? 

Why have real time when on foot warfighters run at 30 miles per hour? 

Why ruin realistic engagement ranges? Why place fake events with fake timers on random vehicles? 

Why do helicopters not perform normal operations?

Why implement strategic objectives only to destroy the point of completing objectives with silly rules like having officers in certain areas providing ""trust"" to ask for reinforcements? How is that logical?


You want real time strategy? Arma. Ace medical advanced,  Discord/teamspeak. Multiplayer. Conduct a 5 hour operation to secure an area with 55 other people.  

This is just something that creates pretty pictures that seem realistic without any adherence to actual critical thinking or reasoning. 

Sure, I enjoyed it. It's probably only enjoyable due to the unique implementation of this game. There isn't anything on the market quite like it. It makes you ""feel."" like your some strategic officer planning and conducting military operations. It does many visual aspects in a non cartoony way which is a plus for RTS games. It does things much closer to real time than most rts games. It uses a lot more logic on the conduct of war than many rts games. And, in terms of talent towards one project, it does not have competition. 

Being unique though, does not mean quality. It's a decent amount of quality fun compared to what RTS can offer at the time of the release of wargame red dragon but that doesn't mean there are many many errors in logical reasoning. 

I mean, the point of a strategy game, focused on militarized objective, is the whole ""critical thinking and reasoning"" part. Why do stupid things? I don't like doing illogical things. 


---------------------------------
Yet, this game takes stupidity and gives it a trophy. Why use the word strategy? Real Time Strategy.

Not Real Time Stupidity. 
People with low self esteem and too much pride actually develop cognitive reasoning skills who then shell out their wallets to programmers and developers lacking in critical thinking so that they feel smart when in fact the only thing that's accomplished is enhanced stupidity skills. 

So much talent into something so stupidly silly. 
If you like the strategy in real time STRATEGY don't get this, it's more stupidity than strategy. It's more Silly than Smart. 

That is why, I don't want to say i like this. It doesn't make anyone even remotely better at... well.... quality decision making. 

That said, it's pretty. The visual experience isn't too bad. (for $5) (at 2019 so not many competitors at the moment)",1574926919,1574926919,False,0,2,0.387323945760726929,0,True,False,False

This along with total war, city of heroes and a couple others is one of my favorite games ever.
it is superb, the action is so intense that it can be quite stressfull, beyond exciting.
it is well balanced and everything works, there are one or two very minor issues which are barely noticable, i wish eugen was able to upgrade this game, i believe that it has so much more potential.
it is simple to play, makes perfect sense, strategy and tactics work extremely well, it is so much fun.
the game is simple to play but winning is difficult, only because existing players love it so much and keep learning to get better at it, don't worry about winning it, just have fun with the journey, you will win in time.  After 9 years i still barely win a game but i can't stop playing.
Quick tips to practice to help you win.
Learn about recon to see your opponents units and stealth to hide your's.
Learn about smoke to help your recon advance to see your opponents units and to distract your opponent.
don't worry about killing enemy units, that is easy, it is all about seeing them.

Pros
+Multiplayer 
+Lots of units
+Awesome mechanics

Cons
-Singleplayer
-Singleplayer AI
-Comunity
-Devs don´t give a sh** about that crazy amount of hatespeech in this game.


When it comes to singleplayer.... well...  just.... dont...
The Ai knows 1 tactic and 1 tactic only...  WAAAAAAGH!
I´d be fine if the China or North Korea AI would use Human wave tactics, just using soldiers as cheap meatshield (as they did in reallife) but here...
No matter wich faction the AI controles they are going for Human waves.  The Ai is utterly incompetent and is just rushing their units towards your Comand units, wich the AI obviously always sees...
I completed every Singleplayer campain (don´t ask why I done this to myself... im a masochist)  and wasn't challenged a single damn time...  I won battles with 1/20 of the enemy troops just Abusing the fact that the AI is rushing for your command units, ignoring Tankbattalions in perfect firelines, infantry sitting in bushes and lit. everything else...
Or... you can ofc just outkite the Ai, wich is completly uncapable of refilling fuel or ammo or... well anything else.
Just keep running and sooner or later the AI is running out of Fuel ending up beeing sitting Ducks waiting for you to end their suffering.


Well Wargame Red Dragon is in its essence a pure Multiplayer RTS
And in Multi.... it is a pretty good game.
As long as you´re not playing with randoms. The global chat degenerated into a hatefilled pile of racist bull**** wich would make the Chan forums look like the most harmonious place on Earth.
And as long as your playing with Friends ""just for fun"" and avoid any attempt to play this compettitive. Balancing is... not a thing.
DLC´s are mandatory due to some really overpowered Units.

Random ques are a mess....  just a mess....  a complete and utterly f***ed mess...

Actually this is the only Game i´ve ever seen wich allows this amount of bull**** talks, from racist-Masterrace talking up to Anti muslim or anti China or anti USA or anti everything....  including Swastika spams in Globalchat (wich is always on your Mainmenu screen) or the ocasional deathtread to anything thats different. 
ATM there is also a big ""hate war"" between Chineese and USA/GB players cuz... well ofc everyone is part of the true Masterrace. This drags also into official Forums so that you may at this point just think, the devs like it that way.
It is Crazy what they allow Ppl to do/say/post in this game/forums...  Its the worst of Mankind projected into one Community.


So this game can be fun with Friends/Discordmates but.... that goes for every game. Even a ""Waiting for the Bus simulator"" is fun with Friends... So not a real selling point.

Get ready to the fact that you'll get your ass kicked 4-5 times even when playing against easy AI, and your ranks in other RTS probably won't matter anyhow. But when you'll get over the steep learning curve, this game will keep on giving, since it's one of the most detailed RTS that is available on the market. It still misses quite a few options though - you can't order your infantry to get a loose formation when under enemy arty fire, or make them entrench themselves, so do not expect features like this because your hands will be too busy anyway. Managing a squad consisting of 10 units is OK, but when you are controlling over 50 different types of vital units - that becomes quite a challenge. An infantry squad sitting in an APC will perish in vein since they won't be able to add any firepower apart  from the vehicle's weapons, and will die with a high probability when an enemy tank will practice shooting at them, but when disembarked, put into a right position against their type of target - they will be able to put a lot of heat at enemy ranks. I haven't seen this kind of units variety in majority of other RTS games, and every  match will be different due to sheer size of options. Of course, a lot of units inevitably will lookalike, but that's reality - when you have only a dozen of really different wargear manufacturers.

Rich new players can buy dlc nations which can soften the steep learning curve a bit with their power creep and lets hope money spent on the dlc nations goes towards a well polished sequel. Do not be alarmed by that power creep, it's balanced out and nerfed to oblivion by now.

I think the idea, mechanics and theme of this game combined with features from your later games has the potential to unite a large part of real time strategy fans with a well polished sequel.

This is, hands down, probably the hardest game I've ever played (when it comes to the multiplayer).

Describing the learning curve as ""brutal"" doesn't do it justice. It's practically inhumane. The lack of an effective tutorial, slews of hidden gameplay systems and mechanics that are not referred to anywhere in the game itself, and a tiny but very experienced playerbase means that as a new player you will have no clue what you're doing and will almost always be matched against people who very much do. This last part is the most significant by far - the gameplay systems are complex and hard to master, but it's doable. What isn't so doable is beating people with infinitely more experience than you when you've just barely figured out the core gameplay mechanics. The singleplayer mode really doesn't help in this regard, since the AI is criminally stupid and makes up for it with sheer numbers - not a good reflection of real multiplayer matches.

If you are masochistic enough to enjoy a game where you will lose, lose, lose, and lose again, over and over and over, until you sloooooooowly get good enough to start winning, this game is a brilliant experience unlike any other. But if you're not willing to put in literally hundreds of hours to git gud, and can't stand the idea that you will get your teeth kicked in practically every match by people who know about parts of the game you didn't even know existed, this game is not for you.

I've had a lot of frustration with Wargame: Red Dragon, but something keeps me coming back, demoralizing as playing this game may be. Maybe it'll do the same for you.

(On a sidenote, if you're even slightly interested in the field of Cold War era military technology, this game is remarkably educational in the sense of presenting lots of those in an easily digestible format. You'll be able to tell apart a MiG-29 from a Su-27 in no time! Obviously don't use this as an actual resource, but it's a nice starting point for further research of your own - often just going ""ooh this vehicle looks cool"" and then googling it is enough.)",1552847000,1573069969,True,14,3,0.655589163303375244,0,True,False,False

Single player is generally decently playable, apart from naval battles which are completely broken and should be skipped. However, multiplayer is where this game shines. I've found smaller team games (2v2 to 4v4) to be the most satisfying. Avoid the general chat.

Very steep learning curve, due mostly to the enormous number of different units and some unconventional game mechanics. Also, since you construct your own ""decks"" (unit rosters), rather than using a fixed set of units every time, there is an additional layer of complexity. Avoid the general chat.

There are plenty of good guides and tutorials around, but it will still take quite some time and effort to learn the basics well enough to not be useless in multiplayer. Once you're past that initial hump, the game gets a lot less frustrating and more enjoyable. Avoid the general chat.

The UI has some problems, the lack of a proper LOS tool being the most significant flaw. Avoid the general chat.

The only things I think needs to be add and only add is that they should get aircraft carriers that cost like 600 or 700 points. And they should  make it so boats that have heli pads can have helicopters land on them instead of having to go to shore and if there is a cargo ship in the area (within resupply area)  the helicopters should be ably to resupply. They also should add oil rigs that are FOBs or resupply bases so the cargo ships can resupply. Right now I would rate this game a 4.7 out of 5.

Its not for the faint of heart or those who lack an understanding of real military tactics. Combined arms, meticulously placed air defense, stealthy recon, well timed flanking and precise air strikes are the nature of winning but can be so hard to successfully achieve yet so satisfying when it occurs. Wargame is fantastic for forcing you to be so micro heavy you can't spend a single moment distracted or face complete and utter annihilation. Their are so many pros to this title. 1) the choice of nations and the accuracy of the units is staggeringly good and accurately depicts the military prowess of the respective nation at the time. IE. USA and USSR are absolutely beast mode factions whereas Poland or South Korea are a literal joke. 2) This game forces you to think like youre controlling a large force on an actual battlefield. Bum rushing a wall of tanks or other corny tactics are not applicable here in any way. Think like a general or fail. 3) wargame chat is not monitored and is absolutely savage and hilarious. 4) you can skirmish the AI over and over again and get to the point where you can easily take on players in multiplayer one on one with no prior experience.

the only con is naval battles suck so harddddddddddddd.

There are roughly three types of people playing this game – people who will click anything including farming sims for fun and laughs, competitive gamers who will use every trick in the book, including unbalanced gameplay to win. Finally, there are some people with various military understanding who expect much more from a game with such wasted potential. Make no mistake – this is a game with an enormous wasted potential to be true military, command&control type simulator. Most people will say there is a ""steep learning curve"" and anybody complaining cannot master the game well enough to play it. It’s not true, however keyboard shortcuts are not intuitive, they are hard to apply mostly due to in-game time limit. There is no tutorial or decent manual, however you’ve got to be quick with the keyboard and read the maps quickly to see and control your units. If you are looking for true tactical experience don’t bother, because fraction of a second or a misclick may cost you units. For some reason they’ve decided to invest in rather impressive graphics in a military tactical/strategic simulator instead of decent command and control capabilities. By the way, the player may enjoy most of these graphics from replays - there is no time for it during the game. 
Once you get over controls and time limit, you gradually will have to curb your enthusiasm, because units themselves are unbalanced and in many cases fictional. At the same time there are units which fall into general description quite well but player can’t use them in decks according to basic military knowledge or nation/coalition potential. The game will provide you with units no one ever has seen, or unit’s availability is broken to the point of fiction. Most powerful fraction in the game is Eurocorps (Germany, France, Netherlands), most crippled nations are US and Soviet Union. The game also gets irrationally pumped up nations with units no one had ever seen in real life. Then again, it amazes me how many units they got somehow right, or at least decently balanced. Over all the game is a half-finished product, rushed to the market long time ago and never fixed. Is it worth buying? It might be, it’s either RD or Space Invaders/Xcom/Rescue HQ.

This makes campaign mode tedious and dull, since there are [b]TURN LIMITS[/b] that even seasoned experts can't outrun (2nd Korean War; hard-coded 22 turn limit, you still fail if you retake South Korea).  I don't like to be pressured to get shit done in a game I'm trying to have fun with; and some of these turn limits can't be modded out.  (22 turns enough for a 2nd Korean War?  Thought not lol.)

Multiplayer is alright, a lot of vulgarity, politics, hate, anger, etc. in the game chat, but that can be a lot of fun to the right person.  Sad thing is it's nowhere near as large as it once was, you'll see around 200-500 people on at any one time, and nothing is more foreboding than when the chatroom is dead.

When I say it's not worth the emotional investment, that's because this is a really fun game, has the most content in the entire Wargame series, and with a little work, could be one of the best games in the RTS genre...  but Eugen Systems will never put anymore work into it.  Period.

Some banter says it's partly because when they broke off from Focus Interactive, the Publisher retained the rights to the Wargame Series.  Whether that's true or not, I don't know.  At the same rate, Eugen has it's own problems - this is a company that makes a habit of abandoning their games 1 to 2 years after their initial release; they've done this to every title they've come up with.  They've got a damn good idea, but they just aren't the right people for the job.  If the strike they had shows the company itself is mismanaged, this also translates to how their games are mismanaged.  Steel Division 44 and Steel Division 2, for instance, should be a good indicator that they're getting cheaper and cheaper with how they do things.  Not a good future for them.

If you're happy with playing through a game a few times only to ditch it in a couple of months, or if you've got the talent and drive to mod a game that wasn't created with the intention of modding (search the moddingSuite 0.8.6 or 0.9.0 on the Eugen forums if you want to mod), I recommend against this game.  You'll really enjoy it, and you'll have to suffer knowing it'll never truly feel like it has what it needs.

I don't recommend Wargame because it's sad to know this game is dead and abandoned by the studio, and will never expand into what it deserves to be.  Not worth it.",1565137670,1565137699,False,7,1,0.492132246494293213,0,True,False,False

The singleplayer of the game is confuzing and hard even if you made the game easy on you, however the story is still awesome just needs some fixes on the difficult of the AI in the story mode.

A beautifully made RTS with one-of-a-kind gameplay in a setting that is largely unexplored by modern games.

This game is hard to describe to an observer. It is probably best to start with what it is and isn't. A tl:dr is provided in ""Is it worth it?"".

This [b] is [/b] a real time strategy game that functions most similarly to Total War* in unit management and in multiplayer. Placement, movement, direction, and cohesion of your units is much more important than numbers, micro, or economy. In fact, this game has a very simple economy that is more akin to a real time tactics game but on a larger scale and with less immediately apparent gaminess. This is a game that rewards players with intimate knowledge of the game engine and the 1450 units the game has. This is a game that has an enormous amount of replayability (many players end up playing for hundreds or thousands of hours) thanks to the deck builder and the amount of opportunity for innovation.

This [b]is not[/b] a game that is easy to pick up and will require a large time investment for many (about 80 hours of gameplay and studying before I was at all competitive) This is not a simulator and you'd be better-off picking up Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations if you are seeking a 1:1 simulator, then probably come back to this when you find out that simulators are, well, not that glamorous.  The [b]single player[/b] experience is limited and is tedious to many due to shortcomings from the game's AI. [b]If you are buying this game for the naval combat,[/b] you should probably look at  Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations as the naval aspect of this game is imbalanced and not modeled well for even most casual gameplay.

 [h1]How does the game work?[/h1]

The game is split into three parts for single player and two parts for multiplayer.**

Multiplayer is split into the lobby and the game. In the lobby you choose your deck. Your deck will be made in the deck editor in-lobby or at the main menu. Decks are saved and then selected at the lobby screen. Due to how the game is balanced you will often use select coalitions and generally will stay away from specializations and nations unless you're in a larger team game or have a specific strategy in mind. While you select your deck the lobby host will have chosen the gamemode, map, number of players, and other game parameters.  After you launch the game you enter the RTS phase. You will deploy a limited amount of units in your starting zone and then start the game after time runs out or all players notify that they are ready. From here you will play accordingly to the gamemode and map. After the match is finished your are shown your kills, losses, and points scored (conquest). You are given a ""Kill list"" that details what unit killed what and vice versa for units under your command. All replays are saved.

Single player has a campaign map that splinters a geographical region like Japan. You spend political points to mobilize realistic divisions (Decks) to the field. Admitedly, due to the game being balanced around multiplayer and the AI playing more like the Zerg than a Cold War commander, the concept often falls short. You then fight with the divisions in various zones and move them about in order to achieve objectives and complete the scenario. When your units are in a sector along with hostile units you will be given the option to fight. When you fight the game operates like the multiplayer process above but with the decks being determined by what divisions you have. This process is the same for naval units. After you fight a victory type is given and losses are calculated. All losses in campaign  must be replaced in a suitable sector at the cost of unit initiative and political points.

[h1]Who should buy this game? [/h1]

Generally, those who have a strong love for gaming, military history, and an attention to detail will love this game. If you are okay with putting in the effort that many have negatively described as requiring ""the time investment of a part time job"" in order to master the mechanics and familiarize yourself with this one of a kind game then you're in the right place. With a lack of developer support the community has had come together to give new players all of the tools they need and connections necessary to get a feel for the community and the game alike. After the hurdle of learning the game mechanics you're ready to play on your own and step into the game that is, Wargame: Red Dragon.

[h1]Is it worth it?[/h1]

If you look at the positive reviews you will find many players have played this game for hundreds or thousands of hours. A game that is not predatory in nature, doesn't hound you for money, and is as beautifully made as this doesn't come by often. A game that rewards skill and gives someone thousands of choices to mull over for the next thousand hours to come awaits those who are willing to put in the initial effort. With a skill ceiling that rivals games like Starcraft 2 and Age of Empires you will find yourself coming up with new ways to win and even breaking out of the lane mentality if you're clever enough.

If you read this review and have doubts about the complexity, initial time investment, or the “real-time” in RTS I recommend passing up this title and looking elsewhere.

The game's main feature is the deck based unit system which is every bit as complex as old trading card games without the balancing. This game will not make things easy on new players nor will it go easy on people who make bad decks, so don't jump into a North Korean tank deck before you at least try out the pre-built American and Soviet decks some.

I mentioned that there is problems with balancing. While there is balance to most base game factions, if you play well you can certainly win against a US or France/Germany deck with a North Korean deck, the Israel dlc is objectively and unanimously agreed to be overpowered. Watch the video on Youtube Valefisk made on the subject or read some forum/Reddit posts about it. Apparently the Yugoslavia dlc units are stronger than the base game units as well but not on par with the Israel dlc according to other forum posts I've seen.

This game might be worth it on sale if you got the time to learn how to play, but the tutorial sure as heck won't teach you.

-Good graphics and it really shouldn't be a problem with a worse pc to play on high level of detail.
-Good amount of people so that you can possibly play multiplayer.
-Couple of campaigns with a good amount of playtime each.
-Massive amount of units and alot of combinations.
-AI is good although it gets dumber towards endgame for some reason.
-Decent amount of multi/skirmish maps.


(Bad)
-Extremely high toxicity in chat when you first enter the lobby but less ingame, people spamming racist and hate comments but you can clear and hide the chat.

Eugen, all I want from the computer is the same limited initial supply like I have to deal with and the same point gain I have to deal with as well.  I dont care that your AI is so brick dumb that is literally throws tanks into CQC environments ripe with shoulder launched AT.  I dont even really care that the AI starts with knowing EXACTLY where my command units are.

The point total of armor they threw at me in the first minute was well in excess of FOUR TIMES what I started with for MAX deployment points. Whiskey. Tango. FOXTROT.

I guess nobody in continental Europe has played an RTS game since their countries so regularly screw up beyond repair that there's some border conflict every ten years - and these are the morons who don't understand the EU and NATO is the reason we haven't had a major destructive continental war in Europe in the last 50 years - so playing a war game of any kind is just superfluous. Let me put it like this, imagine a console FPS where you aim with the D-Pad and fire by pushing down on the analog stick and actually moving the analog stick causes you to jump up and down repeatedly out of cover. It's a needlessly obtuse control scheme that nobody can defend - but somebody will because this is the kind of game made for aspies and autists so they feel smarter than everyone else when really there's nothing intelligent about someone who can't function in normal society because his high IQ misanthropy isn't a form of wisdom in any actual philosophy.

I get the idea behind recon units but they're needlessly helpless and also over relied on. It's not clear at all what your units can and cannot see and as someone with experience in this kind of shit in real life - something not a soul who worked on this game can attest to - if you get shot at, the first thing you do is return fire. You don't wait for some cigar-chomping guy sitting at a computer to directly tell you to return fire. The game is in desperate need of a fog of war to show you where the limit of your range is and just how far you can actually see. I know for a lot of people a fog of war breaks the immersion but it's a necessary thing to show where you need to send them to cover your blind spots. 

That's a real summary of what I think the problems are in this game. There's a serious lack of useful mechanics in favor of creating a bloated and frustrating sense of realism. Older Total War titles are able to give players a sense of realism while still giving you usable mechanics and generating an enjoyable, challenging experience. When the game comes together it is a fun and engaging RTS game but ""engaging"" isn't having to use four commands to get units to attack-move or worrying about whether or not your soldiers have ammunition - which, by the way, you're never told if or when they run out, you just have to hope you're paying attention. Further compounding on the complication inherent in this game's design you're never given an adequate descriptor of the range/area of effect for buffs, supply, weapon range, damage, etc.. The game instead opts to expect me to break out a fucking sextant and a ruler and a physical map of whatever area I'm playing in and after learning the metric system - because, really, no one outside of Europe using the metric system in normal life, not even in the military in most cases - you can figure out exactly the range and effectiveness of your units. But by the time you've done that some adderal-sniffing artillery player has already destroyed all of your deployed forces. Oh and don't tell me having these metrics makes the game more ""realistic,"" I know for a fact lots of the units have nerfed or exaggerated ranges. This isn't just me, actual people who enjoy this game in between their methamphetamine binges have confirmed this to me as a long-understood fact in the community.

Units are helpless without your direct influence at best and at worst unresponsive. You'll have every indication the units are doing something but they're not. What terrain is actually good and isn't also is not readily apparent. The ""topographical"" minimap is laughable. Apparently weapons systems that fire just fine and even with stabilization stats don't fire on the move or simply stop to engage on their own; no, I'm expected to in set-piece battles involving thousands of troops hold the hands of special forces teams and elite armored divisions instead of trusting they can do their jobs when I tell them to go somewhere, attack something, bombard an area, carry out missions, etc..

There's even texture pop-in issues that directly affect the gameplay. Units will be destroyed and you will neither see the units destruction nor be able to identify what killed it simply because you're out of range. The camera is jittery and just because I dared to scroll past a certain limit I'm either thrown face-first into the dirt like a French Resistance Fighter in a concentration camp or catapulted into space like a monkey in a Russian satellite, motion sickness included.

Many fans will say I just suck at the game and they're probably right, but that's a lot like saying I suck a billiards meanwhile they've got actual cues and I'm using a tree branch. The learning curve for a video game should be in the meta and not in the mechanics, controls, or UI itself. Many other RTS games and affiliate mods enforce realism and are complex the further down the rabbit hole you go without forcing me to wait six business days for a unit to receive a movement order. You could apply Eugene's design philosophy to a host of other strategy games and they'd all be ruined for anyone that doesn't spend their days doing rails off their keyboard while they wait in the lobby. This is, genuinely, a game made for people to feel smarter for playing where Euro-trash and self-hating Americans can wax about how much better everything else besides the current global superpower is and I guess the sore losers have to have something to do with their time or they might actually organize and do something effective before getting bombed out of existence from the stratosphere like those guys who play Civil War mods and games as the Confederacy so they can pretend their racist slavocrat oligarchy ever had a fighting chance.

It's highly possible the people who've introduced me to the game just are failing to properly communicate the game to me or maybe this control scheme is friendlier to people who play less traditional RTS titles versus myself. Maybe you can get your way past the esoteric controls and mechanics to chew into the meta and enjoy yourself but the game is very deceptive in how it's played and what it is. It's mostly about building card decks and stacking the game so your victory is a foregone conclusion since you've opted for a monastic lifestyle of being an armchair general to nurse your wounded pride after you failed MEPS, hoping your mastery of this game will convince your friends and family you're a person of value and not just another neat who hasn't had his junk touched by anything except the toilet paper he keeps not-discreetly-at-all behind his computer monitor and who's so pale from lack of Vitamin D you could be spotted in Wargame even without the use of recon units from ten kilometers away. This is just me warning people the game is not accessible in any way and is another title with huge potential weighed down by an over-abundance of ""realism"" mechanics and a poorly designed control scheme that punishes any attempt you make to actually understand how to play.

I've heard from fans that later games in the series improve on these faults and hyperbole aside many long-time fans who introduced me to it admit that some of the design choices are/were questionable in regards to Wargame but it's still regarded as the holy grail like those people who insist the last good music was produced some time before the invention of electricity.

However, I have yet to find another game (Especially another RTS) that can provide such an entertaining, nail biting, and satisfactory experience. And I believe that with some practice and determination, anyone can learn to love this game.

The scope and scale is the perfect middle-ground between the grand scope of HOI 4 and the more Up-close style of Starcraft and it is perfect for a Cold War RTS game of this caliber. The game is just over 5 years old and the graphics still hold up rather well (except for the nightmare inducing faces of some infantry units) And when watching a replay of a match without HUD can provide a nice cinematic experience.

Now's what makes or breaks the game for a new player: The skill curve. When you first boot up the game there is no in-depth tutorial what-so-ever and the game essentially leaves you with 4 options: 
1. Go into multiplayer (Where you will be destroyed) 
2. Play the campaign (Where you will be destroyed)
3. Make a Deck (Where you will have no idea what you are doing, But I highly recommend as it allows you to get a feel for it and see what different nations and coalitions have)
4. Play a Skirmish match with AI (The best way to have your first game; create a match with 4 Easy AI on the other team and 3 Medium+ AI on your team)

Skirmish allows you to get a feel for the basic controls and have a little fun with it. From here, I HIGHLY recommend you start looking at some tutorials on Youtube for basics in Deck Building, General unit strengths and weaknesses, etc. After you do your homework and you have a brand-new deck you can go test it out in a 1v1 or 2v2 skirmish against AI or if you're feeling ballsy, a 10v10 Multiplayer match.

It may not seem like it at first but with every loss or victory from being carried by your team you will learn very valuable information. In addition to that I highly recommend going and watching your replays after a match to see what you and your enemy or teammates did wrong or right also watching streamers and content creators play can introduce you to higher level tactics and counters for certain units.

Eventually if you keep sticking with the game and trying out different units you'll come to find your own preferences and you can learn how to build decks around certain units and unit types. The deck creator is a game within itself and can provide and interesting experience as you have to know what role you want that deck you play in a battle. This is where the game gets the most fun and although it may seem like a rough road to get there (and it can be) I promise you that your first 1v1 victory will feel extremely satisfying.",1556512918,1556512918,True,3,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

Vast number of nations to pick from. Game lured me in with Yugoslavia DLC pack, which in itself is very unique. No other game that I know of lets you play as Yugoslavia. 

If casual multiplayer is your thing, the 10v10 servers are perfect for beginners. Being slower paced, they allow you to learn the ropes & have fun doing it. The 1v1 and 4v4 modes are more serious and fast paced akin to starcraft or other high octane RTS.

Servers are up 24/7. I never have to wait long to grab a lobby, and soon after the game starts. During prime time it's instant with many lobbies up. Bellow I'll include a write up on getting started in multiplayer.
Lots can be said about the community but it's definitely a cult niche, take a look at subreddit /r/wargame. Memes being put out on a weekly basis five years after game release says enough by itself. 

=======================================================================

Beginners intro to Multiplayer: 

10v10 are the noob friendly games, they remind of warcraft 3 customs. You control only portions of the whole army which allows you to focus on micro, and really grasp the mechanics. 10v10 Tacticals are very much suited for solo learning. They give you ample time to make your decisions and observe how others play. It's more like a moba with less units to control and you dont feel as overwhelmed. Once you get ahead of the game you can move on to faster modes that are more akin to traditional RTS if you so wish. 

In said tacticals pick your niche and learn it well. You can stick with your choice of specialty, say tanks. When you learn tanks in and out expand to another niche say infantry and eventually stick to one or be an all rounder. Myself i stick to air, but sometimes i learn different things due to boredom or wanting to win. During the game, focus on securing a sector and observe how others play, their spacing in particular and what units they take.

When you get enough of tactical you can move on to different modes that require faster decision making due to responsibility of sheer number of units. It becomes less of a micro/tactic game and more of a macro/strategic game. Use the knowledge you learned and you wont feel so overwhelmed. You can like myself just stay in tacticals if that's the game pacing you prefer. Beware of elitism here, there is no right way or wrong way to play this game so explore until you find the mode that suits you.

Also recommend picking a nation or coalition and sticking with it for some time so you can refine your deck (a ""deck"" is the units available to call up, which you can customize in the armory) . If you change a lot you might not learn what works in a deck and what doesn't. There is a lot to memorize but it's pretty much a joy to do if you take it easy.

And lastly, dont take heed to toxic comments during the game, plenty of hotheads around in cold war ;) Hope you find your game mode and stick around because this game has a lot to offer. Incredible scope & depth.

First, let me get this out the way.

[b] The game is not an RTS base builder! [/b]

You have a limited amount of units you need to use efficiently and tactically. Yes, you can spawn and send your best battle tank straight to the frontline, however, they will get melted by two well-paced gunships. There is nothing that brings a tear to your eye like losing 8 Abrahams tanks to 2 Russian helicopters. Worse still is losing 6 helicopters to a sneaky Tungusta hidden in the forest.

This aspect is what I like most. Units are both insanely strong and paper weak at the same time. You need to find the correct time to deploy them. The units you command feel just as powerful as you would imagine in real life. One  AH64 Apache can destroy am entire assault if used correctly or get destroyed by a single missile battery you overlooked before firing a missile.

There is slight monotony between the various units of the different nations (USA, Canada, UK etc), but I find the specialisations (airborne, armoured, mechanised, etc) keeps me building new decks and diving back into combat. 

Since the game is a few years old the units do not represent the latest in military technology, but this can be overlooked.... for now.",1554195469,1554195564,True,7,1,0.565263092517852783,1,True,False,False

I am now 60 hours into the game. I need to revise my review, and now recommend this game with SEVERE reservations. I now have an extremely practiced and experienced hand with the fine, granular details of the game. I have studied it, failed over and over, and rage quit many times (from SP, I don't play MP). My love of this series kept drawing me back. After mastering switching between bullet time and very slow time modes anytime any actual combat occured; after mastering the campaign map and save scumming when stupid mistakes were made and I failed to PERFECTLY MAX/MIN my moves several turns in advance; after finding every perfect weaponeering, or target to weapon match in the game and ensuring I had overmatch in every battle; and after failing over, and over, and over, and over to get to this point I now feel I can competently take on the AI. I've beaten all the campaigns up to (and currently playing) Climb Mount Narodnaia, and I'm now having a blast.

I've played games with learning curves from hell before. I play DCS A-10 competently and thoroughly understand the flight systems, tactics, and procedures in flying A-10s in order to get the most out of that game. Wargame: RD is different. This games makes it NOT fair. You don't always lose because you did something wrong. you sometimes lose because you did not execute every single minute tactical detail frame perfectly. you sometimes lose because you failed to totally annihilate the enemy. You sometimes lose because they hid one 4-man (infantry) command unit in a jungle and you have less than 5 minutes to find them otherwise your entire division sized advance is halted on the strategic map. You lose for reasons that would make no sense in real life. I despise Max/Min'ing but in this case, the rest of the game makes up for it.

Seeing your forces annihilate a tank regiment frontal assault, barely clinging on and surviving as you desperately hover over the deployment butrton waiting for JUST ONE MORE command point to deploy ONE LAST ground attack aircraft, whose cluster bombs are the ONLY thing that can pause this iron tidal wave for just a few seconds, just a few seconds to get one more SACLOS shot off, or one second for your RPG team to move a city block is exhilarating. Frustrating, yes absolutely.

I think my original review is still valid, I left it in here. The Difficulty settings in Wargame: AB made the game accessable and allowed you to scale the challenge whern things got too easy to give you that sense of accomplishment. Red Dragon gives you a few tools to help along the way, but mostly says ""If you are not intimately familiar with this game, go to hell and die"". After you suffer for weeks of playtime, however, it slowly reveals its tactical and strategic brilliance.

For those saying practice in skirmish mode with the decks, I can't play a meaningless game with no story or background as to WHY it matters that my tank battalion and infantry regiment should succeed on this map. That's also why I don't play MP. It no fun to have to practice in skirmish.

TL;DR This game is punishing and hates you for trying to learn it. It is blatantly unfair, punished you for lack of mastery, and gives you little chance to learn. If you can suffer through it, and can accept defeat after defeat for the smallest of imperfections, you will learnt o fully grasp the game and can enjoy the brilliant tactical and strategic depth of Wargame: Red Dragon.

P.S. Eugen, RELEASE MORE CAMPAIGNS! Some of us don't give a crap about unit packs we will never see because they don't show up in a campaign!

Original Review:
Wargame: Red Dragon removed the ability to adjust AI difficulty. I do not play frenetic, multiplayer RTS clickfests so the campaign is the only thing I loved about the Wargame series. Airland Battle was a stellar accomplishment and set the bar so high for me, I was looking forward to this one. But without the ability to set difficulty, I will never be able to compete with a cheating AI and finish the hardest campaigns. This is a strategy game, so it takes several hours to decide what the game is all about, in my case 10. Steam will not issue a refund for a game played more than two hours, which is BS since I can beat an FPs in two hours, and I haven't gotten past the character creation screen in an RPG in 2 hours...

You have to look for Mods. 1991 is the best one out currently.
 
hgnkater Feb 9 @ 4:25am 
I have found after many hours that game difficulty is really controlled by the custom deck allocations. I always use custom decks I create myself. The type and number of units you assign yourself and the enemy AI is critical to the difficulty. An example is tanks. If you allow the enemy AI to have cheap tanks but give yourself only the most modern and expensive tanks (with say only 4 available), the enemy will throw a swarm of tanks against your four and you will die. I recommend using a very restricted deck (for the player and the AI) to start with, say only 6 unit cards available. This will drop the difficulty down and a wise selection of units will enable the difficulty to be adjusted by the user by trial and error. I am pretty happy with my custom decks. I no longer have games where I am anihilated by a vastly superior enemy.

The good:

- Replayability from a multiplayer experience. Though the maps remain the same, the way MP games play varies each and every time. Sometimes it's a cake walk. Sometimes it's a good fight. Sometimes it's a kick in the teeth contest. Playing with people you know (even if you don't agree with their personal views on a regular basis) is a satisfying experience. 

- Pace. Again this varies from match to match but it's not a ""who-can-click-the-fastest"" game. The game rewards a player who can view the situation at hand and respond correctly to it. Thinking two steps ahead can be difficult at times and if anything it's this constant ""what next"" mentality that rewards a smart player. By far situational awareness is one of the most challenging aspects that I still struggle with each and every time I play. Tip: Play as zoomed out as far as your eyes can handle it. 

- Unit selections. The number is staggering of the number of units you can get your hands on in this game. From Cold War era to more modern entries, chances are your infantry/tank/etc is in this one. 

- Deck builder. One of the best features of the game is making a deck from scratch and then seeing what works/what doesn't work/etc. Because there are SO many units to choose from it isn't easy as it sounds. 

- Best played with friends. Months ago I would have said some type of voice communication was essential to play. Now it's an extra bonus. It's easy to meet people who do enjoy playing and despite the community (that part coming) it's rewarding to help people who are new to the game and made the same mistakes that either I still make (lack of recon/AA/etc) or did make in the past. 

The bad:

- Toxic community doesn't do the word ""toxic"" justice. For someone new to the game the best advice I can give you is immediately mute Wargame chat (the in-game ""twitter"" feed is about the best way to put it). If you like to associate with racists, bigots, and people who apparently have nothing better to do than spread hate then maybe that appeals to you. For me I muted this a long time ago. Absolutely no good can come from trying to start a legitimate conversation in wargame chat. And for the toxic players you will meet in a game. Click the mute button. You have been warned...

- Learning curve. The game itself (from a single player perspective) doesn't do a good job of teaching what should be fundamental basics. Using recon effectively is such a key to a good multiplayer experience that you can almost tell a person is new just by looking at their recon percentage. And that's just one small aspect of learning the game. Successfully attacking a heavily defended position, using air assets, using artillery are just some more components that come to mind. On top of this, in a multiplayer experience, you need to be aware of how well your teammates are doing (or not doing). The pay off is when it all comes together, it is a rewarding experience. 

- A lack of map editor/campaign editor. I bought this game back when it was released in March 2013. Why the Developers didn't allow modding tools for these two things boggles my mind. Just these two things alone could bring new life to this game but I doubt the day will ever come since the publisher/developer parted ways. 

- Lobby simulator. Do yourself a favor. If you're a new player join or make a lobby for players at your level. And enjoy the waiting game. Depending upon the time of day your lobby could almost instantly fill. Or you could wait 15-30 minutes (and sometimes longer) for a lobby to fill up. 

The indifferent:

I don't know how many hours I have logged on this game. 4000 plus easily over a 5 year period. And with that much time under my belt I still have my days where I just plain suck at it. I learn more from my losses than my wins. And as such I try to review replays as much as I can to see:

1) What I did wrong
2) What the other player did that I couldn't answer to
3) And then use that information to learn to hopefully learn from the mistakes that I made

That being said it's okay to have a bad game. You're going to make mistakes. And chances are you'll repeat the mistakes because there's no ""predictability"" when it comes to different people you face off against. As much as I have tried to learn the game from an SOP stand-point (Do A, when A is done go to B, when B is done go to C) it simply doesn't work. It's taken me years to finally realize that concept. 

All in all I have to say this game ranks up to one of my all-time favorite games to play. If you have the time and patience to learn the game you will enjoy it too.

As far as multiplayer goes, you can play 10v10s on a few maps and feel safe that whatever you do isn't going to matter very much, unless it is a 'tactical' match. These large games attract people who typically will specialize in tank rushes / plane rushes / helo rushes, or the most cancerous of all, the artillery support deck.
This is mostly played as a destruction game mode where points killed achieve victory.

Tactical matches have very low points given to each team, which allows you to 'role play' a small force in the game, where you can practice micromanaging a tank and mortar combination, a single bomber to use sparingly, or a group of infantry etc.. Some even can play as a 'medic' delivering supplies to injured / out of gas / out of ammo units. 

Now for conquest game mode:

You need to divide the map up in a way to where you can control more zones than your opponent, so your opener is key and aggression and and speed or patient combined arms usage will allow you to push into a fortified zone.

You can play 1v1s ranked and over time earn ELO and may play against some of the top players in the game who still remain. I would recommend starting out playing in non-ranked lobbies you create yourself until you feel comfortable with the game. There is no one to put the blame on but yourself, and learning the 7 maps in the rotation are vital to success.

Once you have the basics down, make some friends or join lobbies for 2-4 vs 2-4 others. You can use smaller maps but it is suggested to play as they are labeled. Double-pushing one side while one of your teammates defends typically gives you an advantage. 

There is a little schism and elitist attitude towards what type of player plays each game mode, but as the developer has made ranked conquest with 1000 starting points, 40 minute, medium income games on 7 mostly balanced maps, it really does become the game mode requiring the greatest skill, and once you learn how to play conquest and attack, going back and playing destruction seems like child's play to a good player.

I feel sad that I missed the heyday of this game, but it seems to be in a revival this month due to some popular youtubers.

I only get 5-10 games in a week, and through trial and error and practice am learning via the 'bootcamp' mentors, razzman and others YT videos, and hopefully will feel comfortable enough with the game to play anyone anytime and it will feel like second nature again, assuming Eugen doesn't have to shut down the servers as a result of a lawsuit they are facing and go bankrupt.

A note on DLC: Israel and The Reds Double pack are slightly OP/P2W, having unique jets that do stuff others don't, stealthy tanks that are high powered, ATGM squads that fire fast and hit hard, and Infrared AA units that are not susceptible to SEAD bombers.

My 2 cents: buy the game while it is on sale, and all of the DLC. Worst case scenario you will fall in love with it and become another salty grizzled vet, best case scenario you will shut off warchat lobby and stay out of 10v10s and git gud :)",1549850317,1549850317,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I made the mistake of early judgement when i started to play CoH2 and i didnt wanted to make it again so i waited to review the game until i can prperly play with it.
And its good.

So first of all this game has a huge learning curve and not just becouse you have to get use to the controls and hotkeys and tacics. It has more then a thousand unit (more than a 1000) so you cannot predict what you gonna go against from the lobby until you familiar with the nations and its units and its decks when its a specialized decks. 
So i can fairly say that you not gonna be good at this game, not even decent until you hit above 200 hour.
But if you are new there is plenty of noob out there to test your metal, just make a lobby with noob in the name and check profile.

So the game is a strategy game with a huge chunk of tactical elements. You basicly command at least a battalion sometime even a regiment size force on a huge map  (couple dozens square mile).  You can order units pretty much like any other rts, but you dont have to build anything, you capture zones and those zones will provide income to spend on your units.
Zones are huge, and to capture it you have to deploy a command unit on it. But if you doesnt secure the whole zone the enemy can do the same rendering the zone to netural and no one will get income out of it.
That means that gameplay is build around fighing in the zone, securing the flanks and harrasing enemy reinforcments.
There are some cheesier way to win, especially against noobs (helirush, mob rush, air support abuse), but you will learn to counter those.

Units are semi realisticm, they in a way represent how that unit works in real life, and the impact of that unit on the battlefield.. In the same time they have health bars and stay operational until those bars vanish.
To be clear the units have health, armor, moral, accuracy, range, he damage, ap damage, optics, size, visibility, a chance to be amphibious. There are special things with special units, for example some artiery and air bomb is filled with napalm causing huge fires that demoralize and hurt units in them while preventing visibility. Many anti air units using radar to hit its target, but some planes are using those radar sign to lead there anti aa rockets on them. So you have to constantly turn in and out the radasr systems.
There is many little tips and tactics around the net and you should look them up if you wanna play this game.
And of course there is the smoke wich is a must have in attack. Without it your unis will walk into a killzone and they will be destroyed. So learn to use shift + v a lot.

Graphicly the game is aéright, and not demanding. A very mediocare pc can run it high on 1080p.

Sound is generic, i personally dont care.

Multiplayer is alive and well. There are even 10v10 servers where you will  see real warlike scenarios. 
But ofcourse like any other game where you have to rely on your team mates, there are moments when you just shake your head the stupidity of another human being, or get trolled by some miserable creature who try to ease his sorrow over its pathetic life by killing friendly units.

So all in one, thats a good game. Thats a hard game. If you like modern warfare, have patience and a will to learn than its for you.",1548233793,1548233793,True,2,1,0.500572741031646729,0,True,False,False

The Wargame franchise and esp Red Dragon show there's still a spot for technical Strategy games. I don't know of a single other RTS game that gives you a seamless blend of tactical unit management and strategic collaborative combat.

RD is not a quick digestible game with heavy handholding. The single campaign is intuitive and definitely a fun way to introduce yourself to the game. The AI gets predictable at some points but it's a chance to see what every deck (nation) is made of. 

The multiplayer is where sh*t gets real. First understand two things:
1. Building decks is a big deal and part of the experience. You can easily find cool videos online (personnal fan of Stealth17) that will walk you through most nations and units. It can take 5 min to 1hr depending on how technical you want to get. 
2. Strategy is something you can easily pick up. Again ytube is your friend - you have some pretty decent players as well as some of the champions. 


I've played a fair amount of RD. I've tried to move to something else but keeps bringing me back. You start getting techie about maps, units and players. In the beginning, it's tough. You're looking for your strengths (airborne, infantry, armoured...) and you end up in some crappy games. But Game types/maps are very varied and you can start with large 10v10s to see how other players play and move on to 2v2, 1v1 when you know you can carry a team. 

The community is a mixed bag. You get some absolute legends - high-level players who are happy to help you learn. Others are special cookies. Thankfully you've got tough skin right?

But I wish the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber was in it, and also recon aircrafts. While having bombers and atack jets are great, you almost never have a reason to keep your craft out very long due to the dangers of AA and Low Fuel.

Information is everything in this game, So I think they should try adding Recon Crafts, Radar Crafts, etc. Things that have really long range vision and can ignore vision block, but have no weapons and contain high fuel.

It is just something I had always thought about ever since I started playing, that would make taking out AA more of a priority as well as using aircrafts. Most jets are fairly disposable and I really only find myself holding onto heavy bombers and napalm jets, but everything else tends to just be expendable.

The idea is to cover Air, Land, and Sea combat. We have scout units, and those are useful, but they feel underwhelming and not as interesting as the idea of a Sonar Truck relaying coordinates to atillary or a Radar Plane giving a quick data relay on a tank platoon to the east.

Aircrafts are great for offensive use in this game, but I feel as though the ""Support"" Catagory is really missing out by not having Utility units.

But other then that, this game really does drag you into tactical cut throat scenarios. It's quite exilerating.
Just wish they'd keep bringing in DLC and make some more campaigns.",1544157144,1544157190,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

To quickly sum up the graphics: it´s good, the game looks pretty nice, but not overwhelming. The unit models are partly very good, partly not at all (GB tanks).
The basic gameplay is quite easy to understand. The problem is that there is no way to learn the game. When you try to get into a public game, you will face nearly only players who are rank 20 and above (200h+ multiplayer). And they completely destroy you, while you are sitting in front of your screen and have no idea what´s happening. You just look as your entire army disappears. 
If you want to fight against AI you can do that too. The problem is that it exploits the fact that it is an AI as often as it can. From remembering everything, seeing everything, knowing the exact distances so that you can´t shoot it, the AI just spams as many units as they can, attack you in so many places that you just can´t keep up as a player. On top of that the AI cheats with the points they start with (confirmed) and the points they get (I have read it, but no proof), something that imo happens way too often in strategy games.
It´s fun when you are playing with your friends. Maybe try out the game on a sale when a lot of new players are trying it out. Otherwise, better not buy it",1523114671,1543966758,False,1,0,0.466243952512741089,1,True,False,False

..so here we are - officialy dead game - rights have been split there will be no more work done and the game is in great shape - 
Multi player - 
 Left unbalanced  with pay to win nations giving a huge advantage.
 Some of original content cannot even compete with their non paid counterparts.
Single player - 
 AI is mindlessly spamming units until they ran out of them.
 Campaigns are left unballanced as some ""balance"" changes were made for multiplayer but left the campaign untouched. 
 The AI difficulty just gives info about your units with no recon, more units to spam and more income (the AI will keep spomming units even tough game is set to have 0 income).

 The game would be so much better if devs would give us mod support - new nations, units, maps, so far the only thing community tries to do are balance patches that noone can really agree on.
 
 Basicaly this game has one and only plus that makes it sell - it is the only one of its kind - there is no other competetor on the strategy game set in (post) cold war era.

Not too complicated to step into, but deep enough to keep even the most hardcore wargamers satisfied.
Pros:
- modern warfare era! not many games introduce it in such a great way
- wide variety of units (land, air and sea) with stats as historically accurate as possible
- pretty well balanced, lots of tactics and counter-tactics, and all of that does make sense comparing to the real world warfare tactics (as we know it)
- intense and challenging, especially in multiplayer
- fun naval battles
- multiplayer provides pretty cool
- it is beautiful! and zoom is perfect, the game does look like an aerial view of the battlefield
Cons:
- takes some time to get familiar with unit decks, stats and tactics that actually work
- single player campaign battles become quite simple and repetitive at some point
- if not playing with your friends, waiting for a new multiplayer game to fill up may take up to 10-15 minutes basing on the game type and players' levels

BUT...
There are some caveats. The community on the in-game text chat is absolutely psychotic. There is no playable tutorial, just a set of text documents that tell you about the game mechanics and unit types. The difficulty curve is like trying to climb a 90 degree cliff while wearing roller skates, and for the first few hours you're not going to have any idea what is going on. And finally, the story campaigns are lackluster and honestly not what you're really there for. 

Are these deal breakers? No, they aren't. I still love this game in spite of its faults.

With the inclusion of naval battles largely improved graphics with a new and improved campaign system it has to be my favourite wargame yet.
It takes a learning curve and even more so for non RTS players but if you get into it, it can be very fun, and you can obviously play online in multiplayer with your friends and do skirmishes with the computer with lots of AI.
I love the campaign briefs and battles, they feel challenging and very rewarding to win and beat with different types of victories to be achieved at the end depending on how well you do: Total victory, major and minor.
Lots of maps to choose and loads of nations with more available via buying DLC to unlock. (I'd recommend Israel since they have amazing units)
Some negatives are that it can suffer from input lag when you have lots of AI going on in skirmishes and it also resource intensive. To get the best experience, aim for a faster PC with a decent graphics card and processor. A GTX 1060/ RX 480 would allow a great experience with higher graphics and a smoother framerate, but you can play it with lower obviously.

Pros: Gorgeous graphics and well-designed units, great feel for modern combat, great concept for the campaign with the strategic resources, naval battles, and amphibious landings.

Cons: WAY TOO FAST PACED!!! I understand people like games fast and interesting, but when you spend literally every second of a 20 minute battle micromanaging every last little unit or else they will kill themselves, there is no time to enjoy the game or it's beautiful graphics. In fact, you'll never get to zoom in and enjoy the game itself, so it might as well be a top down strategy with hexes for what it's worth. Also, there are many many broken features in the game. Recon does so little to spot enemies you might as well not use them, ships are clunky and difficult to understand, infantry is next to pointless, and the air mechanic is rather hard to master too. Throw in the fact that there are dozens of units, all known by their native name (if you don't understand Korean or Chinese, don't bother) that you have to literally study and memorize in order to understand how to employ them effectively.

We've almost blew ourselves up several times by nations carrying nuclear arsenal from across, sharing hands and guns to each other while someone from afar just laughs at you for being dumb? As if there's any hope left in humanity, you should drown yourself with this game instead. [i]Get it? Drown yourself cause this game got ships? Haha... ok ill stop[/i]

But for real though, if you've been playing the past Wargame titles, the only additions here are the factions on the far east, with the dlcs offering more factions at the same time as well. I had my fun with this for a long time, and I thought the Soviets would remain to be ridiculous per strength till Israel came along to prove us wrong. [i]oof.[/i] Read about the other reviews about the core gameplay, but as for the naval combat it's not that much attractive per say. 

Goddamn I love and hate the naval combat on this game, and it all depends on which side you serve on. REDFOR would obviously win naval confrontations unless you play smart against them as BLUFOR. It's an obvious difference of comparison for the opposing navies however, as the BLUFOR ships are more oriented for naval confrontations from a distance while escorting carrier groups, whereas REDFOR ships packs up a punch for direct ship-to-ship combat. Now this sounds like Soviet bias, but it's an obvious advantage by now that unless you have something to fight off their missile attacks, they will always have the seas under their control. This does not exclude them for being attacked from land and air however, as even a freaking M1A1 Abrams a year ago from the match I've played just sunk a cruiser not too close. You obviously have units exclusively armed with anti-ship armaments and BLUFOR obviously includes this with their fighter jets. 

And that's just about it, should I really recommend this game to everyone? Yeah. It's a good game, better than it's predecessors, but goddamn was this game left out on the cold and didn't bother updating it to Post-Cold War conditions like the latest technologies of today right now, would've given it more of a life for a year or two.

Facing units can be a problem at times, I will tell one repeatedly which way to face and he ignores me and keeps his weak side armor facing the oncoming enemy for some reason, seems more buggy playing game at a slower speed which i usually do. Issue seems resolved in normandy, which they reverse engineered it to this which is probably the best of all the wargames IMO. 

To capture and hold a territory you need a command unit and it has to stay in there motionless forever. They are pricey and make it feel somewhat like a burden to hold captured territories to me, though I guess that is probably reflecting a real world feel of the ease at which you can take land but the difficulty to keep and control. Really bothered me at first, but after you get used to them it does make you choose between holding everything or having a giant fighting force.  

NO TUTORIAL. That is the biggest drawback to this game, it desperately needed one that is playable and instead you only get a few pages to read. Its just not enough to teach you the game. Years later I found and bought the predecessors to this game and you really should buy and start with European Escalation, if you dont you will need to watch some you tube vids to learn how to play. 

Pros

Lot of available units
Lot of diversity in units
Will teach you a lot about military units, the hard way ;)
Great campaign mode, especially if you played and liked axis and allies. I love the setup and wish they had made more of these. They get fairly hard, and there are sadly too few.  
Campaign adds another level by not giving you access to everything, instead you have battleunits that must be in province to allow you to take those units. Chopper for choppers arty for artillery etc. Is great if you can focus down say their anti air one battle and then enjoy the next mission where they have none and you rule the skies with impunity. 
Good graphics when you zoom in for a game that didnt really need to since no one but me ever does lol 

Game has come a long way since release when I gave it a thumbs down. After revisiting this and playing again I am changing this to a thumbs up because I really enjoy that campaign mode.

Expect to stink when you're new but you'll get the hang of it pretty quick too, you'll be busy as a bee managing the battlefield when you play this game as well especially with certain decks. 
 The AI cheats like crazy so keep that in mind, you have to be a bad ass at the game to beat the AI on the hardest difficulty when it does stuff like spawn KA-52's the whole game and have more units on the battlefield than it should be allowed.  The rumor is that they're not coming out with another Wargame and this game looks really good graphically too so even grabbing it at full price isn't a bad idea.  

I haven't been into RTS games in a very long time and the fact that they base this game on real life (other than the story that makes the Cold War break into a hot war) is what makes this the closest to a 10/10 game and maybe my favorite I've played in the past decade.

-Large unit variety
-Interesting stats and quirks
-Stunning battles

-There used to be a strike going on at the dev's headquarters
-Some maps are terrible with one choke point

-Warchat can be funny to some and triggering for others. I personally find the warchat funny but that's because i'm used to politcally incorrect jokes. So if you're ok with that then the warchat shouldn't be an issue. If you're not just ignore the chat completely.

It's a super niche game with a lot of quirks but if you're willing to learn this stuff you will have a lot of fun. The best part of this game is the deck system.

Im only listing cons on this so assume anything that isnt listed here is a pro.

A.I. being omnipotent and problems with artificial difficulty - this is literally my only complaint. How the heck can the A.I. always know where im at or what im doing without scouts. I wasnt so angry about it initially because I really loved this game but hooooooly crap I didnt realize how bad it was until I had beaten all the campaigns and started doing 1v1 or more.

Look if i spawn units the AI should not be mortaring the position they are going to before they get there. 

Also why does my smoke blind me but not them but their smoke blinds me but not them???? 

Next im getting hit with mortars so I slow the time to find were they are firing from and as soon as I give the fire POS  command.... the mortars stop and I cant find the anymore. OK IM SURE THEY ARENT WATCHING THE VISION CONE OF MY CAMERA GUYS.

Next how come when im literally just reeming the enemy they magically seem to develope this weird as fuck ability to override LOS and Highground to make an enourmous comeback and even out the score. Yea thats totally not artificial difficulty.

In general the game is great but the AI becoming a super gamer and glitch manupulator when I am destroying it is totally not fair. I even took all the recon units out of a deck I made and gave it to the AI and it just spawned infinite helicopters to make up for the fact it had no scouts. I checked the kill count on my way out and I had shot down over 100 aircraft... he only had 25 so yea guys thats blatantly cheating.

Anyway, today I decided to give it a go but I just loaded up a 2v2 skirmish match, I put a ""very hard"" level player on my side with 2 US pre-made decks against 2 Russians bots and let it roll. I wish I did this before as it made it much more fun and easy to learn than long videos or lots of reading. There is no pressure because your ai bot will handle the other team. 

The first match, I just watched my ai bot rip apart the other 2 players and was impressed with the graphics and the way it played out and it made me keen to learn. I didn't even know how to deploy my units but my ai handled the other team whilst I just zoomed in on stuff and was in awe of how good it looked. 

Next game I'd looked in the controls and found the button how to deploy my units and then over the next few games I was free to experiment with different units and the controls. I've slowly picked most the basics up and have notched up it to 2 medium bots as i've improved. Still alot to learn but it's been nothing but fun so far I see myself playing this a lot. I don't mind watching some videos or reading on deeper tactics now as I have a point of reference and desire to learn to the game even more because it is a masterpiece. 

I think I got it in a humble bundle so it's great value for the level of detail and sheer amount of different units is amazing! I would say for me it would be worth full price as I will get at least 30 hours out it and I rate acceptable value at £1 per hour played for a game.

EDIT: I decided to give Steel Division a go after i liked this much and I like that even more, it's a bit more polished and easier to get into. I will still come back to this because of the modern units but Steel Division is even better for me so I will be clocking up more hours on that first.",1531617304,1532182723,True,61,6,0.845770776271820068,4,True,False,False

The scale is amazing!!

You have Infantry, Navy, Airborne, Armoury, and so on!

You have to pay attention for fuel and ammo for the vehicles, 
they run out of ammo and fuel (just like real life)
And supply them with Helicopters or Trucks to keep on going

I have to say this game is differently my most played. I love that you game pick most well armed and terrfing countires to battle against each other ona battle group level (as in mass number of units) field of this kind. Yes yes yes I know to, there are other game out there like this. But some of them are more SI-FI or old age game (like total war ROME for example) but this is likst kinda like modern day. ( it's only really goes to the 90's era level tech for ground, air and naval assest and most of them are un a prototype classifcation) but still, this game is alot of fun to play.

I mainly play just against the AI with my own custom decks with friends. I also write this with about 592 hours in this game alone, I've got like 400+ (I think) on the air land battle game before this one. They are just both so good. that's why I'm finally writing this about this game.


If you wanna play as the USA, UK, German (west germany that is), Sweden, Denmark, France, Canada, South korea, Japan. (few more I'm sure) you can and most of the units are unquie, Some people might say it's not but that's again to be fair they have to banlance it out for all the PVP players out there, but there's alot to learn about all the units. same goes for the other side to. So again you can play as the USSR, North Korea (you know best Korea) China, Polan, East germany. (again a few more). 

THe one thing I will say about some of hte nations is that you have to buy them, Just do it because they are worth it and you have more potenial to then have even more fun it's great. I own them all and have played most of them. I say most because for me I love playing as the UK (born and bred here) but I'm still learning how to play them. So if you like a nice big scale fight with great maps and a boat load of conutires to play, with either yourself, frends or against other players. Then this is the game for you.

PROS: 
- Very large unit variety, 1470 units main game, I'm not sure about DLC cause I don't have any
- realistic gameplay and units, units are generally how they are in real life down to the stats and looks, gameplay is realistic, 
-lots of different play styles, like tanks? Well then a armoured deck is for you, like urban warfare and infantry? Try motorized, like fast paced chopper assaults with lots of air support? Then there's airborne, there's many more but I won't go in to all of them speaking of different play styles
- Very fun deck building: I could spend hours creating and customizing decks for different types and different coalitions

THE MEH:
-pretty steep learning curve: with so many units in this game it's hard to remember all of them, and without knowing them you don't know what your up against (but there is a menu in match to see any units stats which helps)

THE BAD

Naval combat:very barebones, currently the redfor navy is much more powerful then their blufor counterparts and the only good tatic is spam missiles till you kill them, would love to see Eugen expand on naval however

The community: this is probably the main thing that turns people away from this game, rather toxic with too many ragequiters or early quitters to count, I haven't been through a single semi large game without someone quitting early in a long time, also the chat is probably the most retarded place I've seen,

CONCLUSION: overall I really like this game but it takes skill to learn but once you do its very fun, one of the most realistic RTS you'll find, if you do end up purchasing, I recommend watching some vids and guides on how to get better, my personal favourite is Sandy gun fox's ""200 page guide to wargame red dragon"" that has everything you'll need

The game is worse than European Escalation in that Wargame: EE handled much better and the UI was far more accessible. The game felt much more engaging and would submerge you in the action-packed atmosphere far better than Red Dragon does. Furthermore, Red Dragon has too steep a learning curve to it, and the developers seem uninclined to make further developments/patches to RD aside from the periodic DLC releases that usually carry quite the price tag for adding a sole nation to the player's card deck. 

Red Dragon handles worse and I feel at this point its less about wargame and tactics that the brand was built upon, and more about wreckless carnage and destruction in multi-dimensional battlefield engagements. 

Don't get me wrong, Wargame: RD was a necessary breath of life into the dying genre of RTS and it was a relief to have spent time playing this game and re-experiencing what a quality RTS game could deliver.

Items of mention
A the lack of single player (thats worth a shit) makes it not worth the full price in ANY WAY single player AI is not worth playing against, super predictable and generally just irratating it was even released. eaisly beat nothing to gain by playing against it.

B the AI in a units stand points requires more micro managing than one can bare its pretty ridiculas.

C lack of basic functions such as 
 I. cannot bind a 5 button mouse to anything no mouse binds that really got under my skin.

 II. total lack of an ability to play matches that are equal its either a total win or total loss in between balanced matches are stupidly rare  its what I call pringles *their stacked---needs a total xp counter on each side, In fact You will very specifically find that noone wants to play pact side period and people litterally purposfully stack the teams and litterally talk about it specifcally that it is the only way to play. The multiplayer is the most cancerouse thing i have yet to experience its even worse than counter strike. lack of room settings and ability means expect to get kicked for essentially nothing.

III. they never released for multiplayer that I can see a ""total unit"" deck, guess what noone wants to play pact in a NA time zone so have fun trying to play NATO.

IV. kindof anoying that as a game that is starting to pretend it wants to be in a competitive gaming ring, they provide no voice over coms and the text coms to players is godauffel and everyone seems to forget about discord over shitty teamspeak

V. certain units appear to be so randomly OP at times

VI some people try to say this game is realistic or something idk what they smoking but it must be good; its a very ""know the game not the expectation or reality"" to win which is fine frankly i just despise communitys that just assume that a game looks real so it must be real too,  I think these kids think they are actual commanders some times, sad really.

VII ships are rarely played and really had to operate properly.

VIII helicopters have such bad sight its laughable

VIIII lack of quick click waypoints for units and or basic macros like it could relaly use a command like (ROE = no fire till fire upon, engage at will, hold unless compromised etc.) like you place a rocket recon and you dont want to lose pos. you click to turn weapons off LOL, but they wont fire and get rekt by a hummer and sit there for 2 min just because they cant even understand a basic concept of self defense (well niether can americans so no wonder). EDIT* waypoints do exist but it is not mentioned at all eugene expects youtubers and streams to explain this.

I like the concept and the possibilitys, but I cant recomend it because you HAVE TO WANT TO LIKE IT to like it; period. If i would suggest it to anyone I know they most would probably be pissde that i said they should get it, so taking the deffinition of reccomending to be recomending to others i just cant. Basically if your life is gaming (you know those super productive types) ok this game is for you, you can practice and grind all day everyday and then when you finally get some skills you can use those skills to play stacked games all day. hell why not. also this company is suffering from a strike and some ongoing issues with rights or somehting as well so doubt any thing is gonna get better soon.",1522815712,1523159328,False,3,1,0.346485912799835205,5,True,False,False

Pros:
- One of the best tactical RTS games out there and it should be an RTS genre in its own right
- Active online community, very easy to find mentors and players
- Looks good, plays as smooth.
- DECK BUILDING!!! Build your army to your taste, half the game is preparing your army, the other half is putting that army in action! 
- You can enjoy the game competitively or casually, especially when partnering up.
- Cold War period piece, if you're not a military hardware fan this game will teach you to love what you use.

Cons:
- The studio is dead, don't expect patches or balancing their paid DLC. (community modding efforts exist)
- Too many Edgelords in chat spamming cliche crap and trololo
- No map editor
- Campaign rather limited, totally a wasted opportunity

Singleplayer is fun if you enjoy the deck building part of this game. I like to crunch numbers and compare, see which units would best fit what playstyles. But I hate actually playing the game. The unit icons are still mostly the same from ALB, confusing. It would be nice to have a circle indicating the range of the unit when you are selecting fire instead of a single line. There is a way to tell if your units are detected, but it's the icons flashing opaque. Which is just confusing if you have multiple units stacked. 

For the multiplayer, it takes quite a while to find a match. There's only ~500 people in warchat on a weekend, not sure if that's everyone online, but it seems like a pretty small playerbase. Add to it that most of the small percentage of players will just stomp me with the DLC factions, it comes out pretty a unenjoyable experience. I don't have the patience to queue for 15mins and then get stomped in the next 5, and that's not counting if the lobby fails to launch, my game crashing, or the server lagging out. 

Asking for a refund.

However, there are some important flaws which I think should be pointed out for anyone thinking of buying it.

Cons:
- the toxic community: A lot, if not most of the experienced players display elitism and gatekeeping by kicking anyone who doesn't have a favorable Win-Loss ratio. While it's understandable that they'd want to play with experienced players, it ends up being counterproductive by preventing new players from ever getting the chance to gain MP knowledge and experience, thus driving many would-be fans away to other games/genres. This negative trend is only compounded by long wait times to fill a game, and that games generally last between 40 minutes to 1 hour, in which time many players simply quit once they feel like they're losing, which makes dealing with this community all the more aggravating.

- not as tactical as previous Wargame: in my opinion, Wargame: Airland Battle is the best Wargame (I didn't play European Escalation), only because it was more tactical. Decks were smaller (fewer units could be called), and much more specialised, which meant it was very important to know how to use your deck to win and to prevent losses. While the importance of tactical knowledge has not been erased in Red Dragon, it's certainly diminished. Since units are more numerous, there is greater incentive and ability for players to simply spam units and rush the enemy because losses are much more bearable this time around (fortunately, this is somewhat offset by the income rate, and most players don't do this and choose to play tactically anyway).

-the AI cheats: Many new players will first try to take on the AI in skirmish mode or campaign in order to pick up the basics. Unfortunately, this is not a good introduction to the game. In skirmish, the enemy AI invariably rushes your positions with dozens upon dozens of cheap units. No matter how many you kill, eventually you'll be overrun by the sheer number of units the AI throws at you. This is not how MP games go (usually) and does nothing to help develop players' offensive tactics (as the AI usually force you into defending).

TLDR:
-Pros: semi-realistic, tactical, addicting af
-Cons: gatekeeping community, less tactical than previous Wargame, bad AI",1519555742,1520867342,True,7,1,0.573084652423858643,0,True,False,False

I don't have the problems with the AI everyone else seems to, but at the same time, I just can't get behind a game with so many mismatches and historical imbalances. There are units in this game that are able to kill things that they just can't in real life. I understand this is for balance purposes but I feel there is better ways to go about this. I think what did it in for me is one time, right after I dogfought playing as a tomcat and won (what?), my two squad team of navy seals got wiped by an equal sized element of VDV despite light vehicle support. After that, all the game felt hollow to me, I felt like no matter what I did, I was playing with absolute luck as opposed to anything. Not to mention that the line of sight mechanics bother me, even recon struggles to pick up most non vehicle units until they are in knife fighting range. Eventually it just felt like an exercise in frustration, trying to game whatever small exploits I could and praying that my counter actually did its job, or that my SEALs didn't accidentally somehow get wiped by peasant infantry while fighting entrenched. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't, either way it never really felt like what I was doing was happening because I outhought and manuevered whoever I fought, it felt like dumb luck, even if I was making a tactically correct move.

Ultimatley I have a love hate relationship with it, so I can't just rag on it either. The campaign is pretty good, the most fun I have though, is deck building, deck building is probably the most appealing aspect, something about assembling your army really clicks with me. I also really like the artillery and air game, they are probably my favorites to play, despite the fact that some things in air really don't work like they would. Navy is fun but wickedly imbalanced, like, REDFOR air is pathetic, and BLUFOR ships are equally worthless for their point value. F111G spam can control the game in most cases.

Again, I really wanna love it, but its just far too inconsistent and I never felt like I was playing with tactics, I felt like I was playing with dice, and thats not good in a strategy game.",1519876268,1520540023,False,5,0,0.462194830179214478,7,True,False,False

Highly suggested for fans of the RTS genre. This is a new, rewarding and realistic spin on the old RTS genre. Base building is replaced with a deck building system that allows for interesting scenarios and seemingly more realistic battles.

This is still my favorite RTS game, from my favorite RTS series.

I would still highly recommend this game despite its problems and its dwindling active player population. If you are an enthusiast of military history or like to nerd out over military vehicles, small arms, or aircraft, this is the game for you.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Variety[/b] - Huge variety of units, deck types, and countries to choose from
[*][b]Historical Accuracy[/b] Lots of effort put into accurately reflecting each country's military within the time period
[*][b]Visuals[/b] - Wonderful details on units and environments
[*][b]Gameplay[/b] - Fun gameplay mechanics, that in my opinion have been refined over previous titles to near perfection.
[*][b]Replays[/b] - Records replays so you can learn from your mistakes in multiplayer
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Always Zoomed Out[/b] - There's never a real reason to zoom in and see the nice graphics outside of watching replays, it makes more sense to stay zoomed out for maximum awareness
[*][b]Learning Curve[/b] - Steep learning curve if you're new to the genre or to the series (I've ran tests with introducing this game to people familiar with the genre who have never played it, as well as non-gamers and the user experience in these cases is incredibly rough). 
[*][b]Lots to Remember[/b] - Knowing unit types and individual unit stats is important for competitive play and there are over 1000 of these in the game.
[*][b]Multiplayer Lobby[/b] - The multiplayer lobby design is poor, you can view players' stats before you begin a game so if you have a high win rate your opponents will likely immediately leave, and if you have a low win rate, your team mates will likely immediately leave. This can create situations where you have to wait 30-40 minutes to get past a game lobby (and this was when the player count was higher than it currently is).
[*][b]Progression[/b] - Probably only a problem for the most die-hard players, since there are hundreds of faction and deck type combinations to experiment with. Beyond this though, there isn't any meaningful progression to keep things interesting or fresh other than DLC drops.
[*][b]Feature Bloat[/b] - There are some features that aren't really necessary from my perspective, the effort spent on naval combat and having different time-period categories seems like time that could have been spent better elsewhere although I'm sure others would disagree. I'm also not a fan of the single player campaign but I realize others enjoy it.
[/list]

My #1 dream in life would be to re-create this game with a great tutorial, a progression system for your individual decks, and a persistent multiplayer campaign similar to Heroes & Generals or For Honor (seriously Eugen, drop me a line).

I think people are missing some of the intuition behind wargame and they're used to RTS games like C&C or Starcraft.

This game models 'real life' warfare fairly well (I don't have military experience but speaking out of things I've read, plus the game just feels 'realistic' given the scale of distances with respect to the units). So you need to get some intution behind how 'IRL' tactics work. 

I've tried to compile a bulleted list of basics that new players should understand:
-Units must be spread out (preferably, don't have more than two units per selection). Artillery and air strikes can punish clumped units

-Recon is mandatory!!! You cannot see jack shit without recon units and your units will be less accurate without them. One recon unit per ground unit 'block' is fine; turn off their weapons and keep them alive and behind your units

-Keep your non-infantry ground units on the edge of forests

-Tanks project power in open ground; mobilize them in a line spaced out so that they can support each other. 

-Infantry have two roles in this game: defend/contest urban areas and forests. Spread out infantry as much as possible in a town; tanks attacking your town without infantry support will seriously be in for a nasty nightmare. Likewise, when you attack towns, roll in with APCs/IFVs and unload - it's a deathwish to send tanks to take urban areas

-Anti-air is mandatory if the enemy has aircraft, especially helicopters, but keep in mind that these are not hard counters - enemy aircraft can still fight your AA, and your AA generally cover a small range. Spread them out and keep them forested if possible

-ATGMs counter tanks since they have much longer range, but they are generally not mobile (they can't fire on the move). Your infantry and ATGM carriers are defensive units that should be kept in towns (infantry) or forests and look over long distances of open ground

-Aircraft are so fucking powerful, as they are in war in real life ever since WW2. Use attack aircraft  / other CAS aircraft  to interdict enemy armor in open ground that are outside the range of your tanks. Fixed wing aircraft multiply the effectiveness of your forces. Helicopters are very supply-hungry, and if they catch units in open ground they will generally shred them. But they are vulnerable to machine-gun fire and especially autocannon AA. Manually order evac on your attack aircraft as soon as they run into AA or enemy superiority fighters

-Artillery are very situational and I rarely find myself using them. They force units to move and they stun units. They're good for putting pressure on a place where you know the enemy is hiding. Air strikes are generally far more effective than artillery, but you need to watch out for AA

I would say this game is 'total war for modern warfare' and it really shows how a combined arms force is vital in that every single tool at your disposal is needed in battlefield tactics. You can't just roll down the plains with tanks; they will be destroyed piecemeal by enemy air power. You can't roll tanks into a town without getting heavily bogged down by infantry armed with RPGs/ATGMs.",1519034816,1519034816,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought a new PC just to have it. I like to play ""what-if"" scenarios. What if the modern French Army had to fight the Chinese? Or Russia versus Japan? I don't care about political correctness (I think that nobody who plays wargames does) and hope that Eugen Systems produce a more up to date version of this great game. But actually I was surprised how easy it is to recreate a modern army with a 1980's era equipment. It just requires a bit of imagination. The Russians are still using AK-47s (the latest version - I forget the name, but it still looks like a 47 all in black). The truth is that until very recently, the British Army (my favourite wargame team) was not that much different from their 80's army, which is a shocking statement of how underfunded and in great need of modernisation the Brits are. In fact the Harrier is still operational with the US Marines, so even that aircraft can still be utilised in a modern war game. Amazing. Love this game. Hope they do another one - Wargame Dragon 2! Asia is a good map still. But other maps-scenarios are welcome. It is highly likely the next world conflict will be in Asia somewhere involving America and its allies. Europe's wars are more likely to be of the civil unrest kind this century or fighting as US allies in foreign lands. I don't want to see a terrorist scenario faction. Terrorist's by definition are not an army. World leaders do not have sleepless nights about terrorists.

An interesting take on alternate history as seen by other games like valkyria chronicles and animes such as ""Gate"" and features similar time traveling story elements like how the finnish and yugoslavian arsenal consist primarily of fictional equipment they never actually had or come from outside the games timeline. The game also has an interesting story element that the developers forgot to include where the entirety of the world is fighting over Korea for reasons unknown, this will likely be elaborated on in the future in a stunning plot twist where Korea is secretly home to a rare natural resource that gives powerful abilities to its owner. This would explain why the armed forces of the entirety of Scandinavia, Netherlands, Finland, Eastern Bloc, and Israel are fighting so desperately over a theater they would otherwise not be involved with.
The setting has an interesting mix of realism and fantasy. Similar to how Cyrodiil in the elder scrolls used to be a jungle and was later transformed into a fertile european landscape, this game also has an interesting alternate take where the vegetation and climates of Korea and Japan have been transformed into a tropical paradise with rice paddies, palm trees, and stilt houses similar to what you would see in vietnam. At first glance you would assume this was the developers being ignorant and basing the art assets off pop culture and assume the entirety of asia looks like vietnam, when in reality this is played as a clever plot point which requires understanding of the extended lore of the universe. It's obvious upon further inspection that this is clever climate manipulation, after seeing the defeat of USA in vietnam, USSR tacticians indentified a crucial weakness in American soldiers, an inherent distaste of tropical enviroments. As such, redfor scientists installed several weather machines to transform Korea and Japan into tropical enviroments which explains the absoloutely horrendous performance of American infantry in game. 
The game has an interesting storyline told through patchnotes, currently we are in the ""dark ages"" era where a team of finnish refugees from the far future come to 1995 bringing with them countless amounts of fictional XA-185 variants armed with Bushmaster II autocannons for incredibly low prices. Will this be enough to change the tide of the war? or will their efforts be in vain? also featured in the dark ages is the complete abandonment from the developers leaving the game in an unbalanced state giving an immersive sense of hopelessness.

That said, I'm going to tell you the bare bones basics to not being a complete handicap to your team should you just join right into the multiplayer.

First off, you need some variation of these units all the time.

A recon unit or two is not optional to be honest.  Always have one hidden in a tree line somewhere overlooking the battlefield.  If you can't see a unit, your units can't target it, even if you know it's there the best you can do is call for fire missions on the location you think they are at and hope you hit something because they forgot to move it.  They are not for combat.  If your recon are fighting something has gone wrong.  If you think their weapons will target something, turn them off.  If you think they'll be attacked, pull them back a little.

Infantry are extremely powerful when handled correctly.  You must keep them in cover at all times in combat and if anything outranges them then you'll need to pull them back to where they can't be spotted.  Remember that blinking units are hidden and infantry are really good at hiding.  It's generally always a good idea to have some infantry on hand but consider taking less if you face a lot of open terrian or few structures.  If you face large portions of forest or city sprawls they will decide the battle in those areas full stop.

AT comes in a variety of shapes and sizes (ATGM are generally the best but others do their job as well) but are usually critical in holding areas with little cover (like roads or fields) against vehicles.  These open spaces are harder to hold with infantry alone unless they are small like a road going through a forest as any vehicles that stumble upon the range of infantry are generally toast.

AA also comes in various shapes and sizes and more so than AT.  You will need a little variety here so mix some radar with some infared and some guns with some missle (guns are versatile and can fight ground and air usually but missles handle air better) Radar usually is better ranged and accuracy wise but can be countered hard by SEAD (kills radar based AA by following the radar signal back) and ECM (makes radar locks less stable/accurate).  Place them just behind your main units and keep them supplied with ammo as they run out quicker than you might expect.

Supply units sit behind your lines and resupply/fix stuff.  Turn off what you don't need to save supply for stuff you need.  Send them next to a FOB to refill their supply.

The rest are more conditional and have more complex mechanics but I'll let you figure them out as I have to go.",1515990953,1515990953,True,12,0,0.646261870861053467,1,True,False,False

Pros

Great and complex gameplay 
Detailed units 
Mostly historically accurate 
entertaining community 
Wide variety of nations to play 
extremely high skill cap , you can play for years and still be terrible 


Cons

Hard learning curve
Developer has left it for dead
Some units are quite unbalanced 
DLC is essentially a must to perform on the same level as everyone else
No matchmaking system
Ranked play is dead 

If you enjoy RTS games and history this is the series for you but don't expect Company of Heroes levels of simplicity or to be good in the first few weeks.

I would suggest buying Wargame when it goes on sale and to join the Wargame Bootcamp discord to have people to play with and learn from.

Got this game with zero expierience in this sort of RTS. The ingame tutorials are sadly less than helpful. Just pictures with text.

In my case, lots of AT and lots of supporting Arty and choppers. I am around 10 hours in and can now beat AI Ass, albeit on easy mode. Don't let the steep learning curve put you off.

[b]Pros[/b]:

- The game is smooth, it runs good, and it has it's good qualities.  Like C&C series without the construction.

-Most of the player chat is some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen.  Like Barrens chat, but a little more raunchy and very little substance.  This could just as easily be in the cons section if you expect helpful and straight answers if you ask questions, but generally don't ask in chat.  You'll most likely just get some fool trying to talk badass and never actually answer the question.

-Challenging is the basic name of the game.  It has an impressive learning curve.  

-Units are well defined and have their key applications in realistic fashion.  I find it is more fun to play with your ""Deck"" build in skirmish mode than it is to play the campaign.

[b]Cons[/b]:

-A logistical nightmare.  You can have a FOB, but it has limited supplies that does not replenish itself.  Fuel, ammo and parts are all pooled into one number, hence the logistiacal nightmare part.  You can toggle what gets delivered, but honestly it doesn't matter because every supply guy knows that it will all be equally needed.  What rubs me the wrong way about it is how the FOB doesn't replenish itself.  I mean, that is the purpose of a FOB (to be the distribution warehouse of the battlefield).  After a while, you're gonna have a bunch of 88Ms with nothing to do and a bunch of vehicles that can't shoot or move trying to hunt down the remenants of the opposition (Grunts FTW, although it takes forever).  I could understand a supplies on hand concept, but not a finite stockpile for the entire match, especially with total destruction as the win parameter if that's your thing like it is mine.

-(For singleplayer) The AI is too predictable, though that doesn't mean it's gonna be easy.  Once you have first contact it is gonna throw anything and everything it has that can fly and shoot at you all at once.  It's gonna be a quick burst of Anti-Aircraft, then it is gonna throw every piece of armor it has at you.  If you can survive the several waves, it will try to flank you with infantry while it pounds you with artillery. Then it's just a matter of going objective to objective that they hold and cleaning up whatever is left. Their recon will usually be and stay hidden at that point and it turns into a seek and destroy mission, if you have the fuel and ammo to keep your vehicles functional...

-Unit orders are pretty limited.  I couldn't figure out how to group different units, like M1A1 Abrams with M11P Abrams.  Or Abrams with Bradleys.  Not a huge deal, but I would rather be able to make preset battle groups with a single click than a click and drag that tends to select more than I want.  if you control click you will select all units of that type in that area, but you can't control click to quickly add another type to that selection, it will be either or.  Shift clicking single troops takes too long for this kind of RTS.

Really, those are the biggest cons I can think of that I experienced.   I'd recommend this game to someone who really likes RTS.  I'm sure with the right groups MP is awesome.

Pros:
1) Unique Strategy game ""gameplay"" = Unlike most RTS Strategy games, Wargame isn't about gathering resources on a certain part in the map and building factories to spend said resources to pump out units. Instead, before you would go into a match, you'd need to create a ""Deck"" of unit cards... kinda like YuGiOh except with Real life Military units. Once on the battlefield, you are assigned points depending on the game settings of the host and spend those points to deploy your ""Units"" from the Deck that you've made. Deck making is somewhat complex and won't be mentioned here. So after you deployed your units, you'd maneuvre them around the map and beat up your opponent on the field. Keep in mind that you do earn income to purchase more units overtime and it increases depending on the gamemode, or not at all.

2) Nice Graphics and Unit models = The map designs are clean enough and looks good enough, typical of your average everyday modern Strategy Game... but the real charm lies in the details of the ingame units... for the creators have faithfully stuck with the real designs of units as they are real life, all down to that tiny little hook and hose you see on that tiny tiny tank, indeed it would be there too in real life! and there are about like 500 units in the game so...

3) Diverse units and tactical layer = There are around 500 units in this game, each with their own categories and uses. And the thing is, almost every unit has their uses, from the cheap Militia to the deadly Special Forces; the deadly T-72 with upgrades to the lowly T-55; Don't let the prices fool you, no one will buy the most-expensive thing because they aren't ""Cost-efficient"", so you'll pretty much see every unit in the game thrown at you or used by you by the time you hit 200h gametime.

4) Well-paced game flow = Wargame Red Dragon is a quick RTS, it ain't slow as there is not wait time to purchase and train units then a lag before it spawns out of the Barracks or some mumbo jumbo. Once you place your units, SCRAM! issue those orders, get them rolling, you want to be the FIRST to the battlefield (If possible) as Sun Tzu once said, but I forgot his full quote... goes something like reaching there by noon and digging in or some ching chong. Anyways, the units aren't slow and sluggish either as the game speeds them up compared to their real life counterpart. The idea is that the battlefield you're in is actually raging on for hours instead of the 40m the game timer is set to.

5) No Microtransactions = Thats a Pros right? folks these days like to make a fuss about em

Cons
1) No good tutorial offered by the game itself = The game offers no decent tutorial so you'd need to learn from either others, guides, videos. Maybe this could be a pros since it forces the person to adapt, get creative and formulate his or her own playstyle along the way after absorbing many lessons as there really isn't a ""1 way to win all games"" playstyle.

2) An odd community = From my own experience you will encounter lots of people who will either keep silent or cuss at you the minute before the game begins. It get's worse by a cube root in team games and then multiplied by pie once a team starts winning and the other starts losing as they taunt the loser and the loser taunts the ""weakest"" player in their own team. Rarely is there any chivalry in the community, 1v1s are silent commanders facing each other and team games are ""I did well but my teammates squandered my efforts so I abuse them"" You rarely make friends here... but, there have been a few exceptions.

3) A community that are frightened easily = In most multiplayer game lobbies, it takes 3x longer than usual to finally start, the issue for this is that people always leave. Why do they always leave? because they checked the stats of their opponents and go ""Oh, he's 30 levels higher than me and has an 80% winrate, I'm gonna lose so I'm gonna f**k off."" I see this attitude everyday, complaining about ""stacked"" teams. Sure, they may be stacked but they might be friends and just want to play together, and neither are they stopping you from bringing a stack of friends. And if you're afraid of losing, how do you expect to learn? what will you gain? will you only play ""Easy"" games with people that are low in level and horrid winrate? This attitude needs to stop and people should just play the game regardless of the statistics of their opponents. So what if you lose? Atleast you learned something, you're marginally better than your previous self before the game started. Be happy and never Stat-check and leave, Commanders in real-life don't check their opponents stats too ya know.

4) Random unit debuffs = I get that in real life, plans never survive contact with the enemy, but can you be blamed when you're launching an assault and for some reason your most-expensive tank or Anti-Air vehicle gets ""Detracked"" or ""Stuck in Mud"" ? ... This is a rather bad feature in my opinion and should be removed. 

5) A small proffesional army = By this I mean a small playerbase. The game is rather... old, but gold! Nonetheless, this game really does not appeal to many RTS Gamers except oddballs like me I suppose

6) The Navy = As in real life, the Navy cannot win wars by itself. They merely support campaigns. It gets worst for the typical Napoleonic-era Admiral as Battleships really become obsolete compared to the Aircraft Carrier. Now to win Navy, you'd either bring submarines (nonexistent in Wargame) or Aircraft Carriers (Also Nonexistent) and have an Airwar but with Frigates at the bottom shooting. That's pretty much what Naval battles are like. The ships also turn oddly if you were to issue an order to turn 180 degrees. Gunboats do have a part to play too when providing coastal Fire support. If you're looking for large naval clashes, don't bother because they too won't happen in real life.

Neutrals (Can be good or bad depending on the individual)

1) Steep Learning Curve = This game is hard and requires skills, knowledge, and luck. You will lose a lot. So this means if you're a casual gamer, you're gonna eat dirt a lot. This is bad as well, hard game, hard life for you but good in a sense that you'd be facing dedicated players who are in to win and of high quality (somewhat).

2) Cold War Era = This game takes place at the end of the cold war (1990-ish) and a clash of ideologies occur. Either pick Vodka, Champagne or Rum

3) If it is your cup of tea, then I hope you won't mind spending hours of your life on it.

4) Warchat = In the main menu of the game when you first enter, you can chat with players around the globe to the left. This chat is rather hard to describe. It's a mixture of everything imaginable if the North Pole and South Pole were squished and launched into another dimension. There is everything there from Geopolitics, Holocaust Remembrance, Stalinium Production Protocols and How Mao Zedong invented coconuts. But don't worry, if you do ask a serious game-related question, you're going to be given a serious answer (From the answerer's point of view anyways)

5) The Battlefield goes East = In the previous game, it was in Europe. In Red Dragon, it's mostly in Asia. I hope you enjoy generic Asian house designs.

I give this game 9.5/10 and put em at my Top 5 Strategy Games riiiiight next to Supreme Commander. It's a fantastic game for someone who is looking for a unique RTS and a platform to test out their Tactical genius (or stupidity). So I employ you to look at gameplay videos for an hour and if you think it's too much or ""Lame"" Well, off you go to your own life.",1511533358,1511567920,True,61,1,0.840533196926116943,1,True,False,False

the setting is nice, it plays out in Asia not like the other 2 games
Campaign : the campaign is revamped, you now control groups of one type seperatly, so you can for example concentrate your artillery in one region and your infantry in another one. also there are 4 campaigns, 2 of them are very challenging and you can lose hours upon hours on those.
multiplayer: never noticed problems with ze multiplayer, also 10v10.

Gameplay works by, you creating a type of deck of cards and utilizing them in the battlefield, each has a veterancy system that ties into how many you get, so you can get 1 Elite Leopard 2A5, or 2 Veteran Leopard 2a5s, but for lower end cars they go much higher like 5 Leopard 2a4s, each has a price for use in the middle of the game like the leopard 2A5 costs 170, while the 2A4 costs 135. Generally people will find something to dislike about each nation, due to all of them having a certain dificult to deal with unit, from airplanes to very heavy tanks, and even elite infantry.

Very fine details for a RTS game but it goes beyond your average RTS and reach in to the realm of RTT.
There was a lack of tutorial so it is best to read guides online and watch some youtube videos.
But I was too lazy for that so I just played the well schemed solo player campaign. Managed to beat the first 3 but still struggling on the fourth one.
For multiplayer, deck building provides lots of specializations for your own play style. You can go for cheeses like heli rush or tank rush. Or you can take a serious deck that is formidable in almost every situation. 

The first deck I fell in love with was the British Armoured deck. Great weaponary and Armour..... but the fuel balances everything out. It struggles to assult far into the enemy terriory as it is hard to defend the supply lines from flanking and gureilla attacks.

Really challenges players to adapt to every situation as resources are limited and the rapid change in the situation calls for you to counter your opponents move preemptively.

     Wargame Red Dragon is one of the best RTS games I've ever played with friends, allowing you to make your own combined arms ""Deck"" of military forces from around the globe to wage war on a massive scale! As a cooperative experience against the A.I, you will work as a team to outlast and outgun the enemy forces that you can personally tweak through their own seperate decks. This allows for near limitless types of battles you can wage! 

PROS: 

* Land, Air, and Sea Warfare at its finest in RTS form 
* compelling 'deck' crafting for unique gameplay experiences 
* a wonderful cooperative RTS game 
* vast selection of military factions and units from each to play
* I love the smell of napalm in the morning

CONS: 
* You need to learn EVERYTHING in this game on your own, no meaningful tutorials 
* The campaign scenarios will kick your butt until you actually learn how they are supposed to play

* Have I forgotten to mention this game is not casual friendly?

Players ether have 1 or 1000 hours, 1 or 50 level, can have the same units. This seems fair but it isn't, it could lead to very unbalanced battles.

Use of air force is a joke, like rolling dice. You can't use airplanes in pairs. Naval battles is the same.
Tank moving back is another joke, you must use special reverse button, while in the older game when tanks were retreating they did this move with front side looking to enemy.

The keys to having a good experience in my opinion are:
1. Try to play with people you have played with before. Teamwork is important especially recognizing where a push is happening and where a push needs to be made.
2. Stick with 4v4, 10v10's tend be either spam fest or a stacked team vs random players. (If you see mostly the same players on the same team in a 10v10 two or more games in a row avoid it.)
3. Play conquest where arty spam is not rewarded nearly as much and playing offensively is rewarded more. 
4. Medium income! This to me is the perfect balance of being able to purchase enough units without becoming too spammy. 
5. If your new you will most likely suck, but here is what you can do to avoid being flamed. 
Don't buy a bunch of arty unless your team has control of enough zones and ask what is needed where first. 
Don't buy arty at the start of the game.
Don't buy a bunch of planes at the start. 
Let you team know your new and ask where you should go and what units you should buy.

Unlike other RTS games, Wargame has no base building, instead you call in units from a reserve pool, which is determined by your choices when you build your army or 'Deck'. Deck building is a great part of the game and one seldom seen in any other RTS. There are many different Deck types for each nation, allowing you to specialize in one particular type of unit or warfare with choices all along the way about trading off quality for quantity. This makes deck building a worthwhile task where striking the right balance for your playstyle is a rewarding exprience. 

Although I can't speak for singleplayer, the multiplayer of the game is also well thought out. The main mode is destruction, where the principle objective is to desroy a certain amount of enemy units. Some might think this is encouragement to camp, however the game gives an incentive to fight over the strategic territory because control zones dictate point income. The person who simply camps at his base will lose because his opponent will have many times his income and can simply overwhelm him with sheer numbers. This forces players to strike a balance and use units intelligently to gain the upper hand.

The only complaints I have with Red Dragon are some minor graphical glitches, very weak sound design in many areas, and the fact that some of the multiplayer community are not the friendliest to say the least, but this is not the game's fault.

But in conclusion, I think  Red Dragon is a worthy sucessor to Airland Battle. The maps are huge, and the unit and nation slection is unparalled. This mix allows for an insane amount of tactical diversity. One minute you could be ambushing vehicles in a mountain pass, and in another you could be fighting a fleet action. Combining this with well thought out multiplayer modes and great looking graphics and you have a recipe for one of the best RTS games out there. Although the steep learning curve may turn off some not willing to learn the game's intricacies, If you stick with it you will find that Wargame is a rewarding and satisfying experience. I only wish that Eugen will return to it after the failure of Steel Division and continue to add content to this fantastic game.",1504404036,1504404036,True,20,0,0.711878836154937744,3,True,False,False

- You have to watch the game from a height that the units are sized of a pixel. Zooming in to the point that you see something visually pleasing from the units will make that view totally impractical. Not much fun.

- Controlling the game is not straightforward as in other RTS games. It is overcomplicated for no benefit.
- You have to deploy troops both on the strategic view and the combat view. Very odd behaviour.
- The game itself is not fun. This is my personal opinion, you can fan-boy-cry a river about it, but still I didn't find this game fun at all.

WG feels like a cross between World in Conflict and Company of Heroes, and has one of the widest and most accurate military arsenals I've ever seen in a game. 
The scale can be daunting, and it's a game which is fairly easy to understand but very challenging to master. The challenge of micromanaging units can be almost panicky, and the tension as you try to reverse your panicked Challenger 2 tank out of range of a T-80A can be nerve wracking.

True strategy is a must, far removed from games like C&C where it can be a matter of massing 100 tanks and doing an attack move across the map. All units have strengths and weaknesses, and a strong tank charge can be slowed or even destroyed by a few well placed infantry and AT weapons. 
The need to monitor your supplies and unit resources can be frustrating at times, especially when your infantry run out of AT launchers during a pitched battle for a town, or helicopter gunships fire their precious missiles into the bloody ground because they lost sight of the enemy for .0001 seconds. However it's this need to monitor, adapt and strategise that makes Wargame a top notch RTS.

As for the multiplayer community, some might argue it's not the best, I haven't had any serious issues with it, in fact many players are friendly and helpful to newcomers, it's just a matter of asking. However team stacking is something of an issue. If possible I recommend playing against friends, or with them on team speak.

Unplayably complicated with no tutorial, this game drops you into the fight straight at the deep end.

If you want to spend two hours trying to figure out why you have no troops to command or lose thirty seconds in, buy this game. If you want a decent Real Time Stratery game, look elsewhere. I'm sorry I atually paid money for it.

- Updated

Because I paid for it, I stuck with it. It took me about five hours of blundering around and re-reading the tutorial section, but I finally worked out the resource mechanics, how you have to secure sectors to call for reinforcements and the incredably complicated rock-paper-sissors system of weapons and counter weapons. I am, at last, enjoying it, although I still think it desperately needs some better introductions for new players. I have had some stabilty issues with crashing graphics, but infrequently, its not a massive problem. 

Overall, its a pretty decent, highly complex, combat simulator. Be prepared to sink a few hours into reading the online player guides, and more hours into learning the systems by losing repeatedly. This game will eat your time up.

Wargame is my first real RTS (Read: Not a 2D flash game) and in retrospect that may have been a terrible mistake, because this game will flat out annihilate you if you don't know what you're doing, which you probably won't because there's a LOT to know. In other words, if you're new to Wargame, expect to lose a few times.

The trailer was not joking when it said there were over oople-bajillion units in the game. Admittedly, a lot of them are similar or are reskins, but most of them have vastly different stats. For example, there's a cheap, baseline T-72 which is basically a hunk of garbage with tracks and a gun on it, that bursts into flames if the tank commander sneezes. Then there's the highly modernized T-72s that will rip other tanks apart from 2000 meters and shrug off rockets as it roars across the battlefield, powered by diesel, the screams of the innocent, and human souls. Now, you can easily check the stats of a unit in-game by pressing ""i"", but memorizing them to some extent is helpful. But that's not the point. The point is, if you don't know what you're up against, there's a good chance you're going to get absolutely destroyed.

Once you have a vague understanding of what each unit does sort of, you have to learn how to counter each type. It's kind of like rock paper scissors, except nothing completely beats anything and there's several ways to lose. For example, tank beats infantry unless the infantry are at short range or have an ATGM. Infantry beats anything at short range. Infantry that are good at killing other infantry, beat infantry. Artillery also beats infantry. Plane also beats infantry but not infantry with MANPADs. SAM beats plane, unless the SAM is radar and the plane is SEAD.  Plane beats SAM if the SAM is garbage but only if the plane is ground attack, in certain situations, maybe. Everything on the battlefield plays a different role and you have to find a way to make that role work for you in the grand scheme of things. Learning how to do that can be difficult.

Not only do you have to know what kills what and when and how, but you also need to know the gameplay mechanics too. For example, you need to understand how combat stress affects your units, and how to use that to your advantage by making your enemies scream and cry and soil themselves before you start actually seriously trying to kill them. You need to know how reconnaisance works so you can find your enemy in the first place so that you can actually kill them. You need to figure out how to resupply your units so they don't turn into 60 tonne paperweights, and how to keep your supply units safe so they don't turn into an expensive and tactically ineffective fireball.

Those are just basic gameplay mechanics too. That doesn't even scratch the surface of using tactics and mindgames to actually defeat your enemy.

Wargame will throw you for a loop. This is the only RTS I've really gotten into and my friends who I've suckered into playing it all agree that this is something else. It will take some time to get past the learning curve. No matter how many hours you sink into it, your tactics will keep changing, you'll keep trying different things, but you will never perfect your strategy because a perfect strategy does not exist. This game will challenge you to learn. It will challenge you to think. It will challenge you to adapt, and it will challenge you a lot. But once you start to overcome these challenges, it becomes extremely satisfying to finally win. To lay crushing defeat on your enemies. To know you came from knowing nothing to feeling like a master of warfare.

As I'm typing this, I have nearly 600 hours on this game and I'm finally almost sort of good at it.

Wargame: Red Dragon is a lesson in that.  Each multiplayer game contains lots of stress and nail biting maneuvers when player skill is balanced, but for the inexperienced it’s a dredge.  The learning curve is less of a curve, but more of a vertical line, when passed you can hold your own against another experienced player.  This is a target that I am still trying to hit, while I pride myself as a quick learner every map, every game, and every encounter is a mix between luck, recon, and unit composition, which I haven't quite nailed down yet.  A huge variety of units is at your discretion, from the absurd to the very practical, and all of them are worth giving a shot, provided that they are utilized properly.  The controls are simple and endlessly customizable.  The UI is a bit big by default but you can change the size to fit your preference in the options.  The game allows you to make everything just as you like it, which is great for someone who is moving from another game and wants their hot-keys to be the same or someone like me who wants less clutter on the screen.

The AI that you can fight is not a very good opponent, it makes stupid decisions but it's a great way to learn the controls, and test performance (which unless you play on a potato is great).  Take a quick run through a campaign that is intrigues to you and then try the multiplayer.  I also suggest sticking with the default decks, or if you are so inclined building your own, be warned every unit has a ton of info, and some aren't as good as the prices suggest, read each stat and use the compare button as needed, also check out the competition through the armory, it lets you see every vehicle you could ever want to know about or kill, also hover over icons if you don’t know what they mean, sometimes they have multiple definitions that change between units even if they look the same, they can also give hints to the role of the unit.  Alternately if you tire of the provided decks but don't trust your building skills, you can import them, all it requires is a simple copy and paste and there are great resources online.

This game is a wonderfully strategic, if you have the cash pick it up now with the Israel DLC, otherwise wait for a sale.  Any new players would be a great help in revitalizing the player base, and I can promise that this is the best realistic strategy game you can buy.  This game offers hours of endless–admittedly stressful–fun which I personally love, while games can run long, on a weekend it's a great way to break boredom.

A couple of quick tips:
RECON EVERYWHERE- there is no sense in charging blind

CHEAP UNITS FIRST- when advancing it makes no sense to put your valuable units first, let the replaceable stuff take the hit, it can save you from a bad advance

DO NOT FORCE UNFAVORABLE ENGAGMENTS- unless you’ve been forced back to your spawn there is no reason to keep throwing units at a wall, you can always retreat, reorganize, and then soften your enemy with artillery or airstrikes

IF YOU LIKE IT HIDDEN DISABLE ITS GUNS- if you want to keep a unit hidden in a forest or some other type of cover, make sure that their guns aren’t on, they stop being hidden when shooting, this is especially important for forward recon that doesn’t really have a need to fight, if you want it to fire just turn them back on.

COMMUNICATE- if you are doing an air heavy rollout tell your team, so that they don’t waste points on their own aircraft, or if you want to take a specific point, call it out, so that your allies can focus efforts elsewhere.",1487128275,1501677091,True,12,0,0.599224984645843506,1,True,False,False

Multiplayer can be fun however in my experience the player base for this is just awful. Sportsmanship Nation Bashing, Racism, and really just a boatload of trolls more than usual are what you are likely to find. This can make learning the game a frustrating experience. In single player your aircraft bombs are not likely to wipe out an entire garrison of infantry in a town however in MP a bomb will wipe 40+ troops out in a single drop. It can be a challenging and fun game so I can't say it is all bad. It is also clearly biased in terms of units to make the European soldiers and equipment more favorable. Being that it is designed by a French developer   that it is to be expected.  For Instance the American Infantry in the game are mediocre in terms of accuracy and training compared to their French, and English Counterparts. While U.S Equipment is not invincable the lack of decent Infantry in the U.S Deck can be a major problem ingame if you choose a U.S Deck.  The Single Player campaigns are fun but in terms of replayability they don't offer much. Nation pack DLC for multiplayer often being offered for free is a bonus however they do not come with additional singleplayer campaigns to broaden the SP experience.",1501442734,1501442734,False,8,1,0.566632926464080811,0,True,False,False

Even on the easy AI (which on other RTS games gives you some space to breathe), the computer will swarm the map and take all the points. 

There are dozens of units named only by seven-digit numbers, each with specific roles to play. The game doesn't help you out with that. 

The tutorial is laughably non-existent, consisting of five pages of text. 

For the length of time necessary to get something out of this game, an equivalent effort with an actual tutorial and some help with what units do would be useful. 

I appreciate that the game is purposefully difficult, and that war is meant to be neither fair or easy. But the amount of time I think I'm expected to play on this just to make some workable combinations, and the lack of a beginner AI means that the game really requires a lot of investment to become fun.

It's very pretty, battles can get very intense, and there are tactics you need to learn in order to survive in the game. The maps are well designed and the campaigns have believable stories behind them. The community also isn't as bad as communities in other games. There's a good deal of military and political talk in chat, but mostly it remains civil. All in all, it's a good game that has more good than bad, so I can recommend it. However, there are several things lacking...

- The economy for unit summoning is out of whack for the stated goal of ultra realism (Abrams, I'm looking at you). American and Soviet units cost the most to deploy on the battlefield, an attempt by the developers to not have the game dominated by those two armies. However, the time period WAS dominated by those two armies, and they had the capability to deploy their best units (M1A1 and A2 Abrams tanks, T90's, F-15's and 16's, MiG 29's) in vast quantities. This simply is not represented well in the game's battles. You can do better as North Korea than you can as the Soviet Union because of this. That being said, I've had some AWESOME battles where it's, say, Israel and France against China and North Korea.
- The AI is not programmed well. In fact, it's programmed like AI were programmed back in the early 2000's. It knows exactly where your units are down to the last soldier. As soon as you fire upon it, all your forces are immediately 'visible' to the AI, even if they wouldn't be to a player, and attacked overwhelmingly. The AI acts like a player using hacks to see all your units and give itself infinite resources. Harder difficulty levels don't mean more advanced algorithms are used. No, harder difficulty levels mean more buffs for resources and unit stats for the AI.
- There's no taking into account some of the superior technological strengths of either side. Units are balanced for a more arcadey feel. For example, NATO tanks have thermal optics that allowed them to see through smokescreens at the time represented in this game. However, because the Soviets did not have this tech, the tech is not represented in game.
- Aircraft performance is still completely idiotic. For example, the aircraft do not naturally try to evade a missile on their own when fired upon, as a real piloted aircraft would regardless of what orders you give. And ground attack fighters armed with specialized anti-tank weapons will abandon the battlefield too early (A-10, I'm looking at you). THey'll expend their missiles then break off and RTB without using their anti-tank gatling guns. And, going into anti-air, you will NOT see any dogfights. The jets do not go to engage each other and enter into spectacular dogfights. No, they fire their long range missiles, and once those are dry, they strafe at each other. Think ye olde knights in a jousting tournament.

Despite these flaws, it is a fun game, especially when you play it with friends, once you figure out how to actually succeed.",1500526103,1500526103,True,4,0,0.523539423942565918,0,True,False,False

Bear in mind Wargame Red Dragon isn't like classic RTS games we've known so far. It is more like Blitzkrieg style but with more immersion, freedom of pace, and visuals. 

Here are my in-depth gameplay review.

There is no Fog Of War. Use recon.
Planning your assault requires planning especially when recon unit is vulnerable to everything else. However, you your troops cannot survive an assault and ambush without recon. You use recon to detect hidden tanks, incoming aircraft, or to find enemy's artilerry. There are several type of recon. Each type has it's purpose realistically.

Tanks rolling enemy infantry in forest? No and don't do it.
Just like real modern battle scenario, tanks usually used in open field. Never ever a commander stupid enough to send tank into forest and urban areas thinking their tanks is some sort of god. Except the terrifying veteran superheavy when it wasn't flanked. Still can be killed. Use your ATGM plane.

Air support. No longer save from ground unit.
Unlike any other classic RTS. Wargame Red Dragon offered a lot of killing opportunity when using airstrike on your target. And unlike any other classic RTS also, aircraft and helo isn't a magic which keep spawning after every cooldown. A helicopter however are useful only in certain situation. You can helorush the infantry and tanks but not a bunch of anti-air support. Also, a single helo shouldn't do a flyby over a forest and urban in happy manners. 

Naval.
To me and several other players. Naval is actually a mistake made by Eugen. There aren't alot of tactical option in naval battle. Which make Total War series naval battle superior. Naval unit's pathing are also the most terrible i've seen.

Artillery and infantry.
These two units always have close relationship even in RTS like Company Of Heroes. Which is why you shouldn't exposed your infantry in the open field and to enemy recon. Or else they'll get raped. However, artillery smoke is my choice when commencing an assault to urban areas using infantry.

Multiplayer.
Here is a few tips. If you looking for large scale unfair batlle, try a server with 50000 points destruction and high income. If you are looking a realistic tactical gameplay, then a server with [Tact] title is for you. I've felt  overpopulated maps are less in entertaining and unproductive compared to low income and scarce in point maps. Be aware that some of player like to leave their keyboard after deployment. 
But in online multiplayer, whether in game or not, community are very cheerful and revolutionary. Warchat sometimes defeat the purpose of the game.

Pros
-Realistic rock-paper-scissor battle system compared to any other RTS.
-Excellent graphic and framerate.
-Lot of unit choices suited for several playstyles.
-Immersive sound.
-Decent background musics.
-Joyful (and hateful) online community.

Cons
-Naval battles are the terrible one.
-Too powerful artilery.
-Uninteresting single player campaign.
-AI were using mongols running towards player.
-Naval units are too powerful to be taken down by anti-naval ground missiles.
-No electronic warfare. Which make modern battles felt less creative.",1500298126,1500298126,True,20,0,0.703028678894042969,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, i'd play this version any day other than the previous ones, but its the same concept. This just has naval units and more stuff. There is one issue though that I'm having but no one else seems to have touched on it. People are saying the AI cheats, in my case I don't think so. I haven't legitametley lost a battle with an AI (I sometimes end the game halfway through to do something else thus its not really losing right?). But I have noticed that when AI is put on easy, it throws everything it has at you, whilst on very hard, it uses strategy but its quite easy to see what the AI will do next.

Pros:
-In depth strategy game which rewards good teamwork and mirco/macro skills.

-LOTS of units.

-Large scale battles.

-About as good as a Wargame simulator can get, and offers a huge amount of different ways to win and have fun.


Cons:
-Teams; players giving up the moment their good unit is killed, putting more pressure onto their teammates, which in turn causes them to get salty as their stuff gets murdered, often leading to them leaving which worsens things for everyone else. It can feel like a 50/50 chance of getting a toxic team or an alright team, which can mean that you can go literally days without seeing a team that doesn't arty your units for shits and giggles.

-A lot of hard counters. This is kinda a good and a bad thing, but it's in my con list mainly due to death stacks being impossible to counter if your losing (due to points decreasing as territories get taken off your team which decreases your options in terms of units). Get 2-3 players who know what their doing on the enemy team and you'll be stuck, often on your own as everyone 'conveniently' moves their stuff to the other side of the map, facing down endless waves of bombers, tanks and artillery as your units get utterly flattened. 

-The global chat. This is more a personal gripe than a problem with the game itself, but some of the stuff that got posted there during the time I played regularly was actually disgusting, and I had never seen those levels of hate in any game I had played up to that point.

I am going to redownload it sometime soon to see if anythings changed about it for the better, in which case I'll delete this review but my hopes are not particulary high.

There is also a great mix between ground battles and naval warfare. The only downside that I faced with this game was in the beginning during the learning curve. Once I started to understand more of the tactics used in this game it began to get a bit easier to win, especially the campaign modes. Skirmish mode however...

The single player missions are hard as hell and does not hesitate to show you everything the game has to offer in the first mission by artillery and armor spamming the hell out of anything you have.

And also, I can mention, fighting against AI in various versions...it far interesting from other games.
The period chosen..Cold War..it a really good choice, I didn't find many games from that 50 years period.

Wargame: Red Dragon is an awesome little realistic RTS that simulates war on a scale rarely seen in such a genre, spanning miles upon miles of territory. It forces one to use real logic and strategies to outfox and eliminate the enemy. For example, approaching the enemy without combined arms is a disaster waiting to happen- e.g tanks without AA will easily die to helos and planes, infantry without armoured support gets obliterated by tanks, etc. 
The game can be split into two parts- building 'decks', in which a player builds a force using 'cards' of various units, and actual combat. The battles, on the other hand, are (quite literally) bloody fantastic. Every small detail from the whistle of the Katyusha as a salvo of death gracefully flies across the map to the empty cartridges ejecting out of an infantryman's rifle is faithfully modeled, as Soviet-backed Warsaw Pact and allied countries engage in a massive showdown of epic proportions against NATO nations and their supporters in the beautifully depicted landscape of East Asia. A huge number of units from both sides feature, compelling the player to make several crucial decisions that could turn the tide of battle- whether it be to risk sending an unsupported force against what you hope is the last thing the enemy has, or to pin your hopes on a small squad of recon infantry to find and take out the enemy's command vehicle before they can call out more reinforcements. 
But something one can really appreciate about this game is the diversity of the units, allowing the player to send out more or less any kind of unit fielded during the era of the 80-90s- whether it be surplus WWII-era T-34/85 tanks supporting North Korean reservists armed with Chinese PPSh-41s, all the way to the cream-of-the-crop T-90 tank and elite troops armed with grenade launchers. This could lead to some interesting realistic strategies, such as sending out cheap 'meatshield' tanks to weaken enemy defenses and waste their ammunition, before deploying a proper, competent task force to finish 'em off. 
Of course, like any other RTS, the game suffers from a couple of balancing issues, such as a pathetically underpowered North Korean military (even though it's 1980) and a rather controversial DLC pack, but otherwise most nations are similarly competent against eachother. Usual issues such as kiting isn't very common, since ranges are very strictly controlled (e.g all tanks in the same class have the same engagement range) but issues such as the infamous ""helo spam"" (self-explanatory, some jackass sends a ton of Hinds your way, can (sometimes) be dealt with by spamming your own AA but unrealistic and not very fun nonetheless) remain. Also worthy of note is the extremely shortened engagement distance in this game- the longest ranged tanks in the game have a maximum range of 2.275km. 
However, the game really isn't new-player friendly. The community is your best bet for learning this game- the ""tutorials"" in W:RD are among the worst I've seen, simply being pure text about how to use the menu and introducing the naval units, with nothing actually explaining how to fight! Thankfully, an AI skirmish mode featuring some of the most incompetent AI I've ever seen exists, so that can be used as a stepping stone. Many guides exist on the Steam and Eugen forums about how to actually play, along with many excellent videos one can find on YouTube. 
Overall, in conclusion, this game is great albeit slightly flawed, but it's a perfect fit for RTS fans and military enthusiasts of the Cold War. Granted however, it's quite difficult and frustrating- but playing it properly will reward you with hours upon hours of fun. Oh, and one last thing-
Expect most of those hours to be in menus.

There is quite a learning curve with these Wargames but once you get an understanding of them, they are great games. I've played RTS games all my life and this one was probably one of the hardest to learn just based on how they use their mechanics and the sheer amount of stats for each unit as well as the unit diversity. It's just a lot of info to process before you can really dive in, but once you do, its hard to put down. 

When you enter a match (non campaign), you use a unit deck, kind of a deck building process. You have access to every unit in the game to add to your deck, and each deck is generally the same size. You can modify the size of the deck with modifiers such as only using units made prior to 1980, which will allow you to take a few extra units. Or you can choose to only use Sweedish units which will give you bonuses to using those units. Overall its a very nice way to let players customize their armies.

The actual gameplay is fun too. After the initial learning curve, the gameplay is pretty straightforward as RTS goes. Move recon ahead, locate enemies, and blow them up. Units in this game are fairly vulnerable at all times and it only takes one mistake and a few seconds to lose 4 main battle tanks sometimes so patience in this game is a must. Graphics are on point as well. Adding in the naval aspect to this game was great too.

Overall this is a fantastic RTS series that you can solo or play with friends for hours and hours. My friends and I have each made about 4 to 5 different army decks to play with to keep things fresh. Buy with confidence.",1494605089,1494605089,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

After playing 700+ games (on a different Steam account), I must say though that it suffers from a horribly fatal flaw -- you can see the statistics of other players in the lobbies.  Why is this a problem?  Team stacking.  It's horrendous -- I might have played one game in ten that was balanced.  With all the others, the ""smart"" players (myself included), click around to see which team is better, then go to that team.  And the cycle repeats until you get a team of noobs against a team with 5000+ games of experience between them.  This leads to other problems.  It can sometimes take 30+ minutes to fill a lobby, as skilled players join the team destined to lose, realize it, and quit.  Or they linger hoping a spot on the to-win team opens up, then quit en masse right before the game starts.  Or anonymous lobby hosts will kick newer players and people they aren't buddies with off of the stacked team.

~Graphics are goregous
~500+ units
~Fun community(arguable)
~Sounds are amazing
Cons 
~No dedicated servers
~VERY high learning curve like i said in the beginning 
~Some armies such as Australia and North Korea are unbalanced

Very amazing addicting game but takes alot of time to get good or to even learn the basics of the game but even then skirmish is fun and you will spend most of your time building a good deck/army but its a fun game if you love rts games btw little to no structures to build so its not like a c&c game its mainly all units.

Positive
+Better maps: there're less silly chokepoints, more open space
+More units
+Better deck building system : Now it makes sense to actually use coalitions or nations, branches are very useful as well
+Infantry is very viable now

Negative
-Special Ops infantry is a tad too viable now
-Tanks still too expensive to compete against the cheap ATGM onslaught
-Naval is shit, thanks for trying Eugene
-Some coalitions too well rounded, I'm looking at you Eurofor & Commonwealth

Neutral
~USA & USSR are not really superpowers here


For ~20 bucks you're in for quite some fun. Also no one is playing ALB or EE anymore so you're somewhat out of options.

Fun tactical game of modern warfare, with just enough realism to be enjoyable while still being more of a game than a simulator.

One option of score keeping makes your soldiers's lives valuable so that zerg rushes lead to defeat, not victory. You have to attack the enemy where he is weak and without suiciding your units, like in civilized countries in real life.

I applied lessons learned from modern war veterans to great success. Noobs get steam rolled, veterans are dueled in the realm of psychology (feints, bait and trapping, counter-attacking).

Unfortunately the interface is trash, memorized key commands a necessity and air defense requires micro-management, so it's not the perfect game, but still fun occasionally.

The reason I can't recommend this game is due to the community that surrounds it. There is no moderation in the wargame chat and there is no punishment for team killing. Team killing a command vehicle can sway an entire battle and there is nothing stopping it from happenning. To report someone you have to have a copy of the replay and create an account in the forums but it doesn't do anything. 

One particular player literally had a change.org to get him removed from the game. That's how bad it is. I literally can't even post the chat here because it's too explicit and racist. I can't play a match without constantly moving my command vehicles because I'm worried for friendly fire from my team. I would return the game if I could.

Key lesson: If you don't utilise the advantages of each unit, they will die quickly and you will lose. 

In a nutshell: This is a real time tactical game with over HUNDREDS of real world units to choose from. It is the perfect sandbox to employ modern millitary doctrine with said units to kill the enemy. The way you would build a British Army is different to how you would build a USSR army. How you use soviet infantry is differnt to how you would use US marines. Soviet helicopters are different to the US helicopters. The key to this game is building a deck that is optimal for your tactics, and understanding your units pros/cons.
 
If you are unsure the nature of this game - watch some pro replays and see how the macro/micro mechanics of this RTS works. It is quite unique. TO ease into it I recommend playing some solo skirmishes before playing some 4v4 online battles.

One of the most satisfying games to learn to play, with a competative multiplayer community. As an RTS fan, this is one of the deepest games out there that has captured my attention.

I'd say of all the RTS games I've played over the last few decades, the one this is closest to is World in Conflict.  However, there are way more units, and the high level campaign is really well done.  It's like a game of chess, even more so than in any Total War game I've played, since you don't have an economy / research you can lean on to stack the odds in your favor.  It's all about how you set up the board.  You can recruit new units, but there are only one of each type in the end that can be used on the map.  The name ""Wargame"" isn't just a cool sounding title; it's very, very apt.  

The simplified rock, paper, scissors approach of traditional RTS (i.e. calvary beat archers who beat infantry who beat calvary) is greatly enhanced by the variety of real-world units.  You'd need a lost more nouns than rock, paper and scissors to make that metaphor apply here.  This game is very well done.

A couple very minor gripes, mostly with lack of documentation on gameplay mechanics:
1) the manual doesn't explain a whole lot.  I can't figure out of there's a way to issue complex movement commands (waypoints) like you can in every other RTS game.  Maybe shift right click works, but there's no clear indicator.
2) What does R&R do?  Does that give you more command units?  I think there was a pop up somewhere that migth have told me, but I can't find that online, and it's not in the manual.
3) How precisely does Line of Sight Work?  How far from the edge of the woods does you scout need to be?  Do you need to zoom into the scout to see what it sees?  Does it matter which direction it faces?  I frequently find my scout units fail to find targets I would think they should see.",1488673601,1488833856,True,5,0,0.522821485996246338,0,True,False,False

Also 1 guy on the team gets stuck with all the leavers units, so when say 2 guys quit it snowballs. 10v10 is just horrible. Also mostly it's private servers with no random teams so you're going to play against 10 guys with 55%+ win rates on Teamspeak. Good luck with that.

I really really really love this game, like, alot. When I saw this game was on sale i bought the pack for me and two friends at a grand total nearing 50 bucks, a total fucking steal honestly.
I had seen this game before on youtube and i knew it was something that id love to play. when i installed it and loaded it up the first thing i noticed was that the tutorials are more like simple manuals than anything, infact im really happy i had airland battle because that game comes with a playable tutorial, that showed me many of the basics, afterwards i spent several hours on youtube learning about all sorts of different stuff in the game like tactics, unit types, how to build a decent deck, etc etc.

Once I thought i had the basic idea of deck making down i made an american deck and went into a 1v1 against the AI and got my ass whooped, i revised this deck several times and have since made dozens of decks for america, with just as many for other nations as well.


This brings me to the AI, it is extremely frustrating and seems to carry the same issues with it that the previous games had. it seems to have limitless points and it will always know where your units are. if youve got an ambush set up with whatever unit type, when the enemy arrives, if ever, it will also happen to bring with it what it needs to fuck your shit. In other cases they have a large attack elsewhere that forces you to redirect your forces and right when you do that, they come rolling through the now lightly guarded flank you just moved forces from. another thing i noticed is that its either to easy or to hard, medium and easy bots i can steam role so much so that it normally ends in a 15 minute man hunt with every single unit i can muster searching the whole map in one large net that covers everything, however if i play agaisnt a hard bot my units are always out numbered out preformed and destroyed with ease.


When i got this series i also bought it for two friends, we hopped into airland battle first and had fun playing the defense game mode and the multiplayer campaign, both of which i was heart brokento see didnt return to red dragon, which is fine, because the 3 it has are fun to play regardless, just kina sucks i cant play those great modes in this new game.


The first issue i ran into in this game was deciding what units to use and what nations i should play as. i eventually settled on maining the US and brits and making specialized decks for pretty much every occasion, and decks that covered more than one specialtty and were more generalized. this game has way to many units for me to even begin to memorize honestly, i look at youtubers or listen to players who can identify a vehicle just off of its fire rate, mobility, or its black outline. each of the larger nations have its own one of a kind units, while smaller nations not only use some of their own, but have a large slew  of tech from other nations, one of the most common examples are leopard tanks. some nations even get really old units from WW2 and that makes for some fun custom games with friends or against bots. each of the large nations has its own specialty, with the US your airforce is unmatched and for the UK you have some of the most powerful armor in game. while the game doesnt showcase exact armor values, speeds, or preformances of vehicles, it gives you an accurate representation in values much easier to understand. rather than saying that tank A has this much armor at this angle and this ATGM can pen this much at this angle it will say tank a has 12 armor at the front and this ATGM can pen 20. same thing carries over to planes with their values. there is honestly so much when it comes to units its very overwhelming to many players.


one of the biggest issues this game has is the spam of one unit type, it can either ruin your forces because its a shit idea or ruin your enemies fun because its fucking cheap. something that bothers me heavily is jet spam or heli spam, the first half is more true for american forces while the second half more so for russians. with the jets they comletely fucking ruin your ground forces and your AA normally cant kill them, or tank all of them out. when it comes to heli spam youll have tanks or infantry roling into a city or jungle and out of nowhere there are dozens of rocket choppers ruining your forces before the enemy sends in its ground forces to slaughter any of the remaining stunned units, and to be fair this is a legit tactic, but  9 times out of 10 your AA cant handle such a large task and will get killed by the choppers. the same can be true for arty, something any nation can spam, but with that you can actually pinpoin the enemies location so generally they either have to move after a volley or two or risk getting killed by counter arty or some kind of plane or heli.
another thing is the spam of cheap as dirt units, 60 jacksons, hellcats,chaffees,T3485s, or any other out dated unit costing 10 to 15 points they are often wasteful and its great when your enemy does it but infuriating when your ally does it, now there is nothing wrogn with sending these units onto the exposed flank of heavier armo to take them out or sending them against APCs and such, but spamming 60 or so and rushing the enemy with SU76s is fucking stupid.


the community itself is very much alive in this game, and is, interesting to say the least, you can meet some great people playing this game  but ill say this, enter warchat at your own risk.



all in all this game is excellent, and the issues i listed really get overshadowed by the pros. this game is a super in depth and fun to play RTS i seriously suggest it for any hardcore gamer who likes these kind of games and really wants a challenge.

The game also tries it's best into balancing units and depicting the real life counterpart's stats, and not many RTS games has this, even the so called ""Realistic"" ones (Men Of war series), unfortunately it still uses an HP system for the units, but that's only natural considering that making realistic damage models & system would mean that the game needs more higher specs to play, which is not really that great since i am on a Low-end Macbook 

Pros :
+ A fuck ton of playable nations
+ A fuck ton of deployable units
+ Different nations varies in tactics and special units and they're still taken from real life
+ A large variety of multiplayer maps
+ Multiplayer matches are hosted everyday by players and dedicated servers alike
+ Affordable Price (The summer sale Discount makes it really cheap)
+ Outstanding unit control and user interface 
+ Active developer that adds more playable nations (even if that you'll have to pay extra for it, the developer knows what
   a DLC should be, unlike other game developers *cough* EA *cough*)

Cons :
- No Tutorial, recommended that you play the first 2 game series (European Escalation & Airland battle)
- Unforgiving AI for new players
- Only 5 campaigns (repetitive after a while)
- No mods & no community map creator (yet)
- No matchmaking system (recommend you play w/ a friend first before you plunge into a random match
- Bland after battle screen (shows only stats of the game, tbh i would prefer a national anthem to play after a match w/
   the current nation you're playing)

The game or more correctly the entire 'Wargame' series has the player either play as a country or coalition from NATO or the Warsaw Pact, as the game takes place during the Cold War era. Specifically for this release of the 'Wargame' series the developers have you be in East Asia, focusing mainly on the relations NATO and the Warsaw Pact through the Korean Peninsula. 

In the several months that I had played 'Wargame: Red Dragon', I found that the game has an amazing assortion of different units from both sides and from many countries, inside that assortion were tanks like the Centurion to the M1A2 and infantry equipment ranging the early L1A1 to the modern C7. 

Playing the game I also found that it has your brain working and improving overtime, this is the case because the game expecially in multiplayer where you're pitched against expierenced strategists, has you thinking critically on where you would or could be moving your assests you, where could that enemy mortar be, what would the enemy throw at me this time. Like these questions I have just said even if they sound vague to you right now is something that has you seriously thinking and probably in-game could possibly have you panic depending on the situation. This is an even more accurate statement as even though there are a few assortion of maps that people actually play, the maps themselves could even if you have a superior force could have you play yourself, everything from difficult terrain to forests, strange terrain angles and small towns, perfect for an ambush or an artillery bombardment or aerial strike.

However playing the game, I have found that the naval assests no matter how amazing that sounds like, is utterly bland there is variation of naval units strangly from 9-12 different nations on the NATO side and there is also no variation of units from the 6 nations of the Warsaw PACT side. In addition to that I have also found that the ships on the PACt side are utterly overpowered, you would find it impossible to kill their ships compared to those on NATO. 

Nonetheless, I find that 'Wargame: Red Dragon' is a highly enjoyable game especially once you actually put yourself into it.

I don't even need to entail why. Look gameplay footage of this game. Now compare that to spamming bunch of units of one type in a tight cluster attacking another set of units in a tight cluster with a 5 inch distance between the two groups like you see in other RTS's. Case closed.

If you're a scrub-weakling like me then I hope you have a lot of patience and love for the game element because this game is ABSOLUTELY ruthless and you really have to dig across the internet to get every bit of knowledge needed just to figure out what to do. Then comes execution and I find this game challenges your micromanaging abilities but not so much that it's Starcraft AZN APM or die level. It's just that you need both to do well.

I still recommend this game to beginners because there are valid alternatives via doing comp stomps (You and rl people versus the AI), Single-Player Skirmish Mode or just simply finding a weaker player than you. Just note that you should pursue 1v1's instead because 10v10's diminish your ability to influence games. Plus, all RTS's are a pain to learn so really seeking easier RTS to get gud at will still leave you feeling frustrated, especially since this is the BEST RTS ever in terms of realism, graphics and gameplay YET YOU DON'T OWN IT because you're still playing Battle of Toontow...err I mean RA 3.

Expert RTS'ers should buy this because I'm obviously qualified to tell you so. Really though, I'm not a expert RTS'er so I'm in the dark about everything.

Watching replays is quite a satori though. Especially if you're a beginner and you win you first match and it's well executed.

Also qualifies as a educational game. Good for the children to teach or just those who like learning new things about real life military equipment and outfits.

Community is toxic. Much worse than the World of Tanks community from my experience.

Tl:Dr: Best RTS ever with the same hard af learning curve. Good for beginners because all RTS'es are hard to learn either way and might as well pick up a S tier RTS. Extreme challenge with extreme rewards.

The good:

This is the most detailed, tactical RTS you've ever played. It is quite well balanced even for multiplayer, with no single team holding advantages that can't be counteracted by other teams. The community is generally pretty good. You do occasionally find people surrendering too early in multiplayer games, especially 10v10, but if you're playing 10v10 you're not taking advantage of how tactical the game can be. 

Micro is somewhat important but not to the same degree as in other RTS - tactics is at least as important. The wide variety of nations and coalitions to play and the variety of units within them will see you not get bored. 

This game rewards attention to detail, well-planed logistics, knowledge of each army and general tactics, and dedication bordering on study. 

The multiplayer community is still active several years after release. 

The bad:

There is a steep learning curve to this game. It is likely more complex than other RTS you have played before. There is no build queue so preserving your units, accomplishing actual objectives and getting your logistics right will be unfamiliar to someone coming from other games. However, you can download other people's decks (army composition), watch replays online and there are extensive beginner and advanced guides out there.

Wargame Red Dragon provides a unique RTS experience that is plenty challenging, and frequently rewarding. The playable units are beautifully detailed, in both form and function. I loved learning the difference between semi-active and f&f air-to-air missiles, and the paint jobs on the Leopard-2 models look phenomenal. Players who value detail and authenticity will be in for a real treat. Each individual unit has its own set of statistics and abilities that a good Commander should be well familiar with. What level of optics are your recon infantry equipped with? What is the dispersion rating of your long-range artillery? How much armor penetration can you get with your anti-tank guided missiles? Are your APCs amphibious? Are your surface-to-air missiles radar-guided? What's the turning radius for the F-15 Eagle? Do your main battle tanks have enough top armor to withstand enemy artillery bombardment? What may seem like an overwhelming array of available choices to a novice player is actually a true tacticians dream. There are a dizzying number of play styles, but it's up to you to make your tactic successful.

The Bad:
The learning curve. Everyone complains about it, and rightfully so. With each new Steam Sale comes an army of new players who insist on throwing units at the enemy, Starcraft style. The instant gratification type players typically choose the most expensive units to feed the other team, and it's not uncommon to see fighter jets casually sailing over the enemy lines, only to be effortlessly swatted out of the sky by enemy AA. Worse, is that after the novice player has squandered all of the state-of-the-art units in his arsenal, he will promptly quit, leaving teammates to pick up the slack for the rest of the battle. Since the game has no form of quit penalty, this behavior often goes uncorrected.

The Ugly:
To this day, the game is punctuated by occasional bugs and crashes that the developers do not seem to have any intention of fixing. Units get caught on bridges, planes will clump up inside each other so they are destroyed by a single missile, sometimes selecting multiple units also selects a random unit on the other side of the map. And a match can be ruined at any time by a single team killer. Bomber aircraft can drop bombs on friendly units, but there is no way to target that bomber in response. Vote kick? Report player? Nope. The game has nothing of the sort. Players must visit the developer's official forum site and post a complaint. So instead of fixing glitches, and adding critical game features, the developers seem content with rolling out a new DLC every now and then, to rake in more money. I bought 0 of them.

Conclusion:
In spite of these shortcomings, I'm glad to say that I own and still play this game. I can't believe how much I've learned about battle tactics and modern war from the detail offered here. If you have more patience than a twelve-year-old, go ahead and pick this up the next Steam Sale. Be patient, have good Recon, take smart positions, and read the unit stats!

On my third review, this is still mostly a negative experience. Which is a shame because this game has so much potential to be a GREAT game, rather than a mediocore experience.

Let me keep it simple:

-Small attempts have been made to balancing, but frankly it needs a complete overhaul, especially with Infantry and Prototype units (more so with DLC nations)
-Power difference between Nations and Coalitions is shockingly poor.

-Navy is officially dead.

-Terrible gaming community full of pros and new players, leading to extremely one sided games.(great game tho to play if you have a group of friends to play locally).

-Pointless Cat C and B decks/theme. Dont expect a Cold War game, this is now effecetive a fictional game of Cold War going into the mid 2000s.

-Poor single player experience.

If they fix these issues, this could be one of the best strategy games in my two decades of gaming. It could be up there in e-gaming with Starcraft, Company of Heroes.

For a single player experience, I highly recommend World in Conflict which has a fantastic campaign. The multiplayer is good too, but I think given its age, its probably a empty scene.",1397734176,1482293596,False,1,0,0.53233569860458374,0,True,False,False

This game has a very steep learning curve but is well worth the time investment.

I would recommend that you start by watching youtube videos of the mechanics because of the lack of a good tutorial involved with this game.  The next step would be to play some skirmish against the AI to get a feel of the game.  From there you should probably venture into 4v4 or 10v10 games.  I personally don't like 10v10 games as they are nothing but arty spam fest.  As for game mode, Conquest is my personal favorite.

As for the community, this is where the game needs help.  The main game chat hub is not moderated at all and is filled with nonsense.  It really needs to be cleaned up but it is what it is right now.  The other problem is that finding good, balanced games can be tough sometimes.

The developer for the most part is really good, I just have a slight problem with the recent DLC Nation Packs.  My problem with them is that they feel more fleshed out then the OG Nations of the game and I would like to see these Nations balanced against the new Nations of the game.  Overall though, they do a good job keeping things fairly balanced.  I do wish that the series would have stayed in the European Theatre.

Lastly, I really wish that this game was looked at for competitive gaming.  It has all the tools to get there, just needs a couple things.  The first thing is to clean up the community and get rid of the cancer.  Secondly we would need a few maps that offered a balanced match, so maps that mirrored each other on each side.",1398651601,1481984573,True,2,0,0.491699308156967163,0,True,False,False

You may think it's bad, may think it looks bad from its difficulty, or just don't like it anyways. But all your cool friends say it's great and you should try it. So, you being curious, you decide to try it to fit in more with your friends. Turns out that it's better - [i]much[/i] better than you expected it to be, and you want more. You say you'll only do it once a month, but that turns into once a week, which turns into once a day, which develops into an addictive death trap. Even if you're a newbie to it you still do it since it's so damn [i]addictive.[/i]

You do it more. Do it alone. Do it with friends. Do it with strangers. You can never stop; saying ""5 more minutes"" soon turns into 5 more hours. Once you get the hang of it, you start experimenting more with other things - things that will make your little gateway drug of a Wargame look like a vitamin gummy. Your friend shows you one such thing. It's some strange pill in an orange bottle called ""Israel DLC"" that's supposedly way better than the Wargame you've been smoking. Pretty soon you've devolved into some froze vegetative zombie state like someone dependent on Opium. You start taking risks, challenging other people, and, worst of all, you cheat. You troll. The warchat - previously the area where all the other junkies like you gathered, has self-destructed into a hotspot of hatred and vice. Your whole personality has changed  just by taking that one choice - something that'll haunt you for the rest of your life. And even if you quit, it'll still haunt you forever.

Take my word for it. I was a Wargame addict for some time - I quit a while back, and I've limited the toxicity coming into my system. I still do it, even if it's wrong, because it feels so right. Every waking hour on this planet I'm thinking of Wargame. It is my only love, and my only life. Nothing can change that. Even as I write this review, I can still hear the voices of my troops, calling out my name for their next objective. I still see rows and rows of tanks on the roads to certain doom, just so that they can satisfy me. And- oh god.. The artillery. The MRLS... The apaches... All those units, all those points gone in an instant, for what? Fame? Bragging rights? Money?

I'm going to have to leave now. My army calls me. I leave you with this message: Don't be like me. Don't be the guy sitting on his ass writing reviews for a video game for humorous effect. Don't overdose so much on Wargame. Go outside and ride a bike or something.
