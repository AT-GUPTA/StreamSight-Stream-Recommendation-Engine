Game is so rEaLisTic says the dev, my team hits enemy bar 4-6 times per match. What a developer, Neil >>> CDPR.

Dont buy this game yet even if it's on discount.

Dev too lazy to fix problem or create a new class in their programming codes regarding of active/non-active play.

So many times already I complained about my players NOT in active position, but flagged as offside.

Even I post the thread about it, it's just gone like wind, ignored.

That's why I bought this game like once every 4-5 years, hoping they fix the problem that last years. Cause this game is like FIFA, same sh1t different cover.

Update: Dev has his bodyguard in the discussion forum. So whenever people post a critic regarding of the flaw in the game, this bodyguard will come and attack you say there is no flaw. They will even provoke you, and make you get banned (while they cant even speak English, god), while the one provoking is not banned, so you get silenced, your thread goes lower... Well, guess what Neil ""Fookin"" Dejyothin aka Neil Brock, you now enjoy my review. Try to stop me here, too.

The dev even deleted some of the comments that showed their bodyguard admitting that there is a flaw in the game they can't fix, which later he denied saying so. Lucky I take pre-caution and screenshoot.

Some negative points are: 
- calendar days move very slowly and the biggest issue is that you cannot simulate matches and have to sit through them instead, so you are more coach than manager and it takes a big chunk of your time to watch the calendar 
- you have no real control over emails you receive, for example you get  spammed with scout reports and there is no possibility to stop them, it´s a waste of time cuz you can see them all in your scouting section when you need them, but it is just spamming your email inbox

neutral:
- talking to your team has a huge influence on the outcome of the game and I don´t know how realistic that is, I think some players might be more susceptible to speeches than others but in general they push themselves with music or meditate themselves quietly before the match and won´t listen too much to the coach anyway right infront of the match because they are professionals, but I might be wrong so I take it as it is
- press conferences get repetitive but this is realistic because ""journalists"" are clueless and ask the same stupid questions all the time in reality too

Positive aspects of this simulation:
- the simulation is very accurate and obviously done by professionals, if some coaches would run this before their season, they could easily see weak spots in their systems, all the data are right there
- the player attributes are very accurate, in 2014 for example Timo Werner was a noname in Stuttgarts youth team but the Football Manager had him listed as wonderkid and he is a national player now, this applies for other wonderkids too, the simulation really foresees developments of high potential players
- you can influence matches to a certain extend by your decisions to replace players or change tactical approaches, but not too much, so you won´t win unrealistic matches, which means some matches just cannot be won",1607809657,1607809657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wasn't even particularly into football before I started playing - it's an excellent strategy/rpg even if you ignore the football aspect (which it simulates brilliantly for the most part). You can manage in a variety of leagues from around the world, each with slightly different rules and challenges. This acts as a ""difficulty setting"" - you could choose a top team in a top league with fabulous wealth and world class players, who will probably win most games without needing much from you. Or you could choose a dirt poor team in a poor league which will require all kinds of managerial tricks and shrewd planning to succeed with. 

The game itself can be very daunting with the number of tasks you have to perform, but you can delegate most of these to your backroom staff (essentially automating it) until you feel ready to handle them yourself. This makes FM a fairly easy game to pick up but a VERY difficult game to master. You will still be learning new things after hundreds of hours. 

I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to throw their life away.

- Load into custom club
- Create ""Scouse FC"" A team composed of only players from Liverpool, the area itself.
- Added former players such as Carra, Fowler and Gerrard to the field as my commanders for the youngsters (with the help of Workshop mods)
- Produced a hardworking but flair struck midfield composed of Curtis Jones, Stephen Gerrard, and Trent Alexander Arnold (After training to alter his position)
- Made a special exception for Ben Woodburn as he is just a quality player from the Academy and it's his only club. 
- Proceeded to play the Liverpool way with less regards to defense.
- Champions League Final Arrives.
- It's been a fair season so far and the final is Liverpool VS Barcelona (They had made plenty of great signings and look like a strong force)
- Half time whistle comes and it's 3-0. Liverpool is losing off of two goals from Coutinho and one goal for Mbappe.
- Me, your dashing manager, gives a rousing half time speech to rally the players to fight for the win.
- Gives instruction for the team to hard tackle Coutinho as revenge
- Fight back the 2nd half for a win and come back with two goals.
- The closing minutes of the game were winding down till Liverpool academy graduate Trent MF Alexander Arnold beat the defense and slotted the shot.
- Overtime commences.
- Both teams score but besides some early shots it was just two teams sluggishly but ruthlessly battling for the ball.
- Penalties...


- Barca proceeds to miss every single PK thanks to our dear Goalkeeper (Trial player from academy)
- Liverpool misses the first but scores all the rest

Having played a few thousand hours on this engine, since it's release in 2011, I have noticed the match engine simply can't replicated the beautiful game in any convincing way. I could go through many reasons for my opinion on this, but I can sum it up simply by saying physics don't seem to apply to this universe, and it shows, the game looks like it should be from 1998 - 2004 and that's probably where we should send it.",1581732324,1581732324,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously, If you like the football, most likely you will enjoy playing this game. Perhaps some people might prefer playing a football game to managing it as they find it boring. You will have to bring in decent coach assistants who will allow you to gear up for the upcoming match and to be given good advices in terms of potential players that might come in useful for your team in the future.
Needless to say, if your team doesn't come up to directive/fans expectations, they might put it down to you, and as a result of it you are gonna be fired xD",1568159545,1580051238,True,2,0,0.535452306270599365,0,True,False,False

Even if you don't like football, the games are still giving you a good gameplay experience as a slow strategy game.

It has football flavour, and you will likely enjoy it if you like football as well, but it is by no means required to understand a lick of football before diving in.

If you consider buying this particular version of the game, only buy a new version of Football Manager every other year at the most. Going from 18 to 19 or 19 to 20 is likely not worth it.

Won CL with KFC uerdigen twice , cl with dundee united 5 scottish leagues in a row first upon promotion.
The match engine was at times hectic from patch to patch and you have to find the right tactic that works best in europe (4-1-4-1 usually does it) but here if know what you are doing you could succeed.
Some patches were absolute hectic but in the long run this REALLY GOOD compared to that ROTTEN PISSSHIT 20.2 patch on fm 2020 .

Sure there is nothing amazing visually, but everything is neat and well presented.

I must say I preferred the layout from FM18 visually as it was just well neater and you could get more on the screen. 
But still it's fine.

As you would expect all the latest players are in the game, all the transfers, all the new young stars, all the old pro's.

The game plays out as you would expect without to many surprises.

As with all updates it took me a while to find the things I had got used to, I like to tinker with other teams and I find the staff screens a little more confusing (In the sense whilst it is easy to drill down and search for players with current and potential ability I can't seem to find where that has gone in the Staff side especially for managers? 
Oh well no biggie.

For me about this series it is about not breaking what works, the rest is fluff, I can't spare the time to manage all the training sessions, scouts and other things, I just want to tweak my team, find the odd player and pick a team and play a match using generic tactics with the odd tweak and whilst there is a lot in there that if you havent played the series for a long time will overwhelm you, you can pretty much get your staff to do all the bits you are not interested in and that eat in to precious game time!

So for me, the layout is a little more compressed than previous versions, FM18 had the balance right however the game seems to run a lot better than Fm17 (especially in game) so if you skipped a few updates this is worth picking up just for that.

Don't be put off by training, news and media, duties, tactics etc etc, you can set your staff to deal with 90% of it and just casually pick it up and play, you just need to tweak the settings a little and bang you are away!",1574845282,1574845282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just call it ""tutorial"" please. For those who are familiar with the Football Manager series, manager inductition is nothing but a time wasting excercise. For those who are new the series, an in-game tutorial is the least efficienct and effective way to learn the game. Just have a seperate tutorial.

Besides manager induction, there is not much new in this edition. The feature that the developers rave about is training. Well if you are interested more in being a member of the coaching staff than being a manager, it will be a thing for you. Another newish feature is tactical styles. It is not exactly new. Tactical styles are just pre-packaged sets of team instructions. The feature helps you save time. As such, it does not belong in the full-featured Football Manager. It is more of a Football Manager Touch stuff.

Please note that my review is based on the beta. However the commercial version is not likely to be any different other than having bugs removes.

1 YEAR ON UPDATE
The stable release version of FM20 came out yesterday. Having given it a try confirms my assessment of FM19. SI improved player development engine tremendously in FM19 but failed to make that an enjoyable part of the game. FM20 builds on that.

Tactics feel responsive as do changes in games and the ability to play a certain way. As ever the game, is tricky to master but possible. It also seems representative the higher you start, the harder it is to sustain yourself. 

in addition, the features of Drafts and additional game modes add an intriguing aside. Albeit, to my mind slightly flawed. 

In short, this is the first time in a long time, I've played football manager and it's felt real and enjoyable. Of course, the repetition of conversations can get tedious, just as I imagine it does in real life football management. 30 years on from my first managerial simulation, I still punched the air in this one when the club I managed scored a later equaliser away to Barnsley, or when we knocked Chelsea out of the cup, or got promoted.

It's fun, if you like football and enjoying thinking through problems, as opposed to the more instant gratification of the more mainstream FIFA or PES. In fact, it's so good I don't really see the need to buy the new one.....which looks like mostly a data update.

The only reason this ""game"" works, is because you think it does.  There are so many options, customisations and unknowns that pretty much anything is possible, and when anything is possible, the only way to explain why that thing happened is by making excuses.

Lets say that the game engine is absolutely perfect for a moment (it isnt, but lets assume it was).  Well, then everyone playing it would be absolutely terrible at the game, unless they were actually a Premier League manager in real life.
So it can't be an actual simulation or it would be a nightmare to play, with all the players in the world shouting at the screen while Jurgen Klopp logged in and gave everyone a spanking.

However, what this game is NOT, is a game.  Because a game would be a simplified version of reality that gave the player a chance to shine in a field that they actually are not that good at, simply by learning the rules and using their brain.
Imagine a World War 2 game written with the same engine as FM19 and you'll understand what I'm talking about.  You are a completely inexperienced 18 year old from France, thrown into the trenches on the Western Front and given a rifle and no helmet, go win the war.  Oops, you're dead. Every.Single.Time.

So it is with FM19, it gives you the illusion of control of everything about a football club, and when something stupid happens (and it will, a LOT) then you'll blame yourself for your lack of skill/understanding and you'll either switch it off and go and do something productive or you'll keep playing and get more frustrated.  What you won't be doing is having fun.

I have a suggestion for the developer if they ever read these things.  I dont WANT to be an ACTUAL, real life, honest to goodness Premier League Manager.  If I did, then I would have chosen to do that in real life, and I probably would have been terrible at it.  What I DO want to do, is play a game that gives me a chance, and the illusion of thinking that maybe I could have been a Premier League Manager.  I want to look around for what I think are decent players, buy them cheap and put a system together that - if I follow the in game cues, generally gets me winning.

I really don't see the sense in the frustrating and annoying parts of this game, whereby - for example - a non league team on a 5 game run of abysmal results, with no manager and a 15 year old defender up front, can hold off the European Champions, 35 shots on target from an $80m front man and then win by two goals in the 95th minute.  Presumably because the manager chose the wrong option on an obscure Press Conference page saying that he was ""Pretty confident that my $1bn team will spank these dirty hoof merchants"".  What follows is then the game of their life for the hoof merchants and $1bn of football talent that, suddenly, inexplicably, cannot pass, head or weirdly, even run fast.  That, is not and will never be fun.

Would it be SO BAD, to let us actually give those non leaguers the thrashing of their lives?  Would it be so terrible to allow people a quiet smile in their darkened bedrooms as their fantasy football team spanks Worcester Western Terriers 83-0?

I go back to the quote at the start of this review -> ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"". 
 Could the above scenario have happened in real life?  Sure.  Has it happened in real life?  Maybe.  Is it fun to spend your precious leisure time feeling like you don't understand and just aren't clever enough to play a game that you spent money on?  No.  And since most people don't like to assume they are stupid and below par they will predictably blame the game for their problems.

- A lot of balls hit the woodwork, not realistic at all
- I can sense if I will win according to the match engine or I will draw no matter how many shoots I take. Not realistic at all, out of 40 shoots 2 should be goal at least or should not be able to shoot 40 times.
- VAR animation is completely unnecessary, should have the option to cut the scene and get the result directly, in matches you dominate it gets really boring to wait
- VAR checking if in the box or out is totally irrelevant, it s always outside the box
- My love is Trabzonspor and I will never manage another team except national teams BUT even if I manage it so well and increase the budget like a lot, I can never compete with top teams. This is unrealistic, at least after 5-7 years I should be able to compete with them.
- Players cannot develop after a point if they are in a certain league and not at the best one. This is not realistic as well, of course there are differences between the quality of the leagues and the players MAY not be as good as if they were in premier league for instance BUT the differences should be minor and MOST players should be able to reach a similar potential. IMAGINE a star player spending his life in Trabzonspor. This talent MAY (or he may still be) never be as good as Mo Salah BUT there is no reason for him not to get very close to Salah. In the current game, it is impossible!!
- Player ratings drop for no reason and most players do not even reach their potential no matter what level of training facilities, coaching team you have. If they are in Turkish league instead of Premier league they for sure deteriorate easily to STICK to your unrealistic development system both in actual rating and in potential rating. This is not logical, there is no reason for the players to deteriorate so much in reality. Particularly for players with determination above 15!

I played FM12 from November 2011 till January 2017 and didn't wish to stop. FM17 also had fairly palatable ME but from FM18 it all tanked and FM19 was like the developers completed the destruction of the ME that began FM18.

Some plus to SI for adding tactical styles to FM19 , this was genius as it really made tactics and strategy fun and exciting but the inability of the ME to translate this styles to the game play in ME is main fly in the ointment. Maybe it was a rush job but this edition left me really dissatisfied.

SI should invest in fixing the match engine, even if it takes building it from the scratch all over, heck it costs 50 quids and they sell boatload every year.

If your thinking of buying this wait for the sales or buy an older version and get a data pack update to bring it into line with the current season teams and players. 

This game company have run out of idea and i don't see it getting much better as FM2019 has too many sub menus and poor data display. what more the AI will Rob you out right. as I have been winning a match more than once and the notice board go up saying whatever mins of  Extra Time(lets say 4 min) but computer allows 6 mins and 7 mins of ET allowing them to score a late goal to win draw the match.

   Some irritants then (albeit nothing new hence the initial comment): Shots on Target ratio (you vs. opponent) gets really noddy over time. Not un-common for the AI to score 1/2 goals out of 2 or 3 taken, and then my Spurs team to fail to score with nearly 20 on target - thats with Kane up top whose finishing and composure are meant to be pretty decent. You also seem to hit the woodwork an insane amount, I have literally counted 11 times in 3 games - a semi final and then two key league games. 
   Add stupid amounts of training injuries (with light workloads). My record in a week is four: a fractured skull!?! 2 twisted knees from sprinting and bruised ankle. Player contract requests are a mess, they keep asking for new ones with no logical reason. I.e you grant one, then 2 months later they are now apparently far better than when they just signed their most recent one. Not being funny Jan you are 34 and actually worse. Do these make it unplayable? No.  Do they make those lovely long saves I used to really get into viable? Also no. 

Plus - get ready to concede on the break. All. The. Time. It is unavoidable, repetitive and happens multiple times a game.  Seems to be little tactical variation in opponents. Just gets boring over time. 

I think its time these underlying mechanics are addressed by SI, rather than the fugly skins, avatars and scouting menus that did not need changing. First new FM since 2015 and it is a little disappointing. Worth the discount sale price though.





UPDATED: 

So after far too much free time recently I have been playing a fair bit. Just to give some statistics calculated from my last 5 games, two of which against 20th and 16th at home in the PL. 9% of my shots have been on target. And of these, only 12% have resulted in goals. That is frankly ludicrous when considering the stats of the players in my starting line up. In-fact that has to be scripted and broken. To compound the issue, 63% of the opponents shots are on target, of which a whopping 74% resulted a goal. Of these goals they are nearly always on the break, or a cheeky effort from 25 yards. Opposition forwards are inexplicably un-marked on the half-way line, one bloke attacks the win and squares it. Goal every-time. This happens even on a 'defensive' formation setting, so why the team is all committed only SI knows.

I am currently losing a player a week to some stupid injury gained whilst sprinting in training. Nothing major usually 1-3 days, but its always conviniently the day before a game, when the workload says they are not even training. On top of this, it seems to be the same position too, so you quickly run out of options even if you have at least two solid choices. It has intensified as I enter the business part of the season and chasing a 3 point gap to Liverpool at the top. I want to re-iterate, I am still winning titles etc, I rotate players, I know what I am doing basically but this has to be broken, its not fun to play when it starts being so clearly to me anyway, scripted. And don't mention the contract renewals, again that has to be a bug. Its noddy as hell. To top it all off, they must know this is broken, but they cna put adverts for FM 20 into the game.

And all six of my goals came from outside the box. 6 absolute worldies. This should have felt amazing, but as every single shot flew into the net my heart began to sink. This was just silly. Sillier still, the game ended up in a 7-7 draw. Every game since then has resulted in high scoring games. Seemingly most direct free kicks fly into the goal, most long range efforts result in a goal and occasionally, VAR is consulted for no apparent reason whatsoever.

Other games, however, can be easy to 'cheese', in that a certain tactic or type of player can be exploited for massive gain.

Football Manager 2019, on the other hand, is an exception to the rule. It's repetitive and difficult to find a working formula because every game, regardless of tactic, plays out the same. You instruct your players to build patiently, working the ball through the middle of the pitch, waiting for that key pass to unlock the defence - what this translates to on the pitch is for the ball to the played out wide and crossed in whenever possible. You change your tactic to be a fast counter with a target man laying off the ball to your inside forwards - what this translates to on the pitch is for the ball to the played out wide and crossed in whenever possible. It is a fundamental flaw that makes matches difficult to watch, much less win through tactic prowess.

Aside from the match engine, the off-the-pitch interactions and dynamics with players, other managers and agents is a rewarding and much-needed aspect for a true managerial simulation. These aspects of the game are often improved year-by-year as they become more polished. The fear that arises is that it could become unreasonably time-consuming, creating larger gaps between match days with excessive busy work. Hopefully Sports Interactive acknowledge this and keep it under control.

Overall, I don't feel like I can recommend this game based on how bland and monotonous the game engine makes match-days.

In this one I haven't really noticed anything too glaring. 

I've seen a lot of reviews that say ""crosses don't work"" and ""my defenders are useless,"" I honestly think most of these players are just bad. In my second season I have more goals from crosses than anything else and the second best defense (as Lyon in the French League). I think a lot of these players don't know who to buy, how to set up their team, etc. Not that I'm some expert, but I've been far more frustrated with previous match engines (12 and 16 in particular).

My biggest complaint is a bug that I only I seem to have - the first goal in almost every match is accompanied by the offside whistle, whether or not the goal was offside. That and the player interactions are just horribly written and nonsensical, just expect to have 2-4 players angry at you at all times for things that will be out of your control.

Your other option is to play a match with instant result, Which takes out any possible excitement over what happens because 99% of the time you will win if you use it. And something else I've noticed is all the random little features they have removed since fm17. You can't simulate your match anymore, England's under 23 league is now non competitive so you can't actually know how good your under 23 players are doing in the league accurately, there's so many random little things that you don't care about individually but when you add it all up the game just feels emptier than the older ones.

You answer questions about new employment in many jobs and you get no new job no matter what you say, it is a bad thing about the game you have spent a lot of hours to no avail. And you have to start all over again.

I miss the tools one does as a manger to correct misunderstandings between players and management. there are so many gaps in communication between management and player - manger. it would be great if you could fix it. You guys who made the game. Sega

- Criminal initial price of 55e, 
- Slow gameplay pace became even slower with highlights and training. So, you'll HARDLY finish one season playing less than 70 hours, 90% of the time out of matches ...

Game feels scripted, player morale has far more effect on match outcomes than anything else - for example if your team's morale is less that ""okay"" you will lose to teams 5 leagues below you easily. Even worse than this, once your team's morale is low you will keep conceding the same goal for x number of matches.

I just hope for the next few iteration sof this game they improve the 3D engine, especially all the clunky animations. I hope they look into the excessive corner kicks and the crazy amount of 90 minute goals that happen week in week out (not just for my team but around every league).

I also hope they tone down the media - because I can always make my rivals lose by praising them and making them complacent.

Sometimes the game is absurdly easy and at times it's randomly difficult - to the point it makes no sense. 

Also they need to look into the ""promises"" in this game. I signed a world class player, promising we would ""win the UCL"". We lost the final becuase of so many injuries and a red card.  Now the player is eternally unhappy - its been 6 months and he is still unhappy - his morale is very poor and he just plays crap. I have no way of talking to him this entire time and no way to tell him ""look we lost the final, it was bad luck - lets keep on working toward winning in the future""

Nope, it won't let me even communicate with him.

This is leading me to wanting to buy the editor just to remove that unhappiness because it's unrealistic. It makes me feel like some things in this game are annoying this way because it drives sales of the $7 and overpriced editor - which should be included FOR FREE as the game is already expensive as it is.",1558167389,1563959521,True,0,0,0.455228567123413086,0,True,False,False

The tactics format is better, probably the best I've interacted with - it is not simple, nor too complicated, but as a manager you truly want to stamp your own philosophy on the team, this is the magic of Football Manager, and so I appreciated the improved tactics aspect. In truth, I'd like the tactical side of the game to become even more in depth and complex. If you want to build a philosophy, you must be willing to engage with a more complicated tactical set up. 

Injuries! I have often experienced that you'll have a player, call him play Z, he is in your first team squad, but he doesn't get anywhere near the first team, he never gets injured. But, if you put him into your starting 11, I swear he'll pick up an injury two days before the match. I think a lot of FM is scripted, we deny this to ourselves, but some results are just predestined. I guess in an effort to make the game 'more exciting'. 

Transfers - absolute nonsense - you are a mid range Premier league club, you will offer £15million + generous add ons for a £4million rated youngster, the owning club will reject you. Then you'll see some random club like Swansea paying £7.5million for the same player!!!

the core game thats been unchanged for last 10 years is still robust as ever, but these needless changes to systems that were never a problem and not fixing or expanding ones that are is wearing thin.

tactics have got streamlined over the years and feel more general, and this year has changed again, but im not sure why because the system isnt any better or easier to use. 
same goes for training, its become more obtuse, and i cant see how it benefited from the change besides trying to look like they added something new
why change it when the match engine still looks like headless chickens running all over the place?
it breaks immersion when you see a CF run in a circle or miss point blank for 7th time in a row. always having 26 shots vs their 3 but losing 1-0 grows old.

id like to see how a teams countering us and use the match day engine to change my tactics, but what you see doesnt have any relation to the tactics, its just an abstract screen with players running around.
often i see my teams destroying theirs, peppering the goal but not scoring, but i have no options left because what else can you do if your strikers keep missing sitters?

ive only played 5 hours of this version, and i tried to get a refund but id played longer than 2 hours. 
but to play a couple of games and set up everything takes longer than that so im stuck with it.

i would have prefered to give this a neutral rating but you can only give up/down vote.
i just wish they would make the 3d match engine look better, fix the algorithms of the players so they look like human beings who are professional footballers. 
make meaningful changes that impact whats already there
and dont streamline or complicate but give more options and make them easier to use.

i hope i havent come off to hard to please but i have played these games for years and lost interest last 2-3 years.

I felt thrown into an interface with hundreds of buttons and there doesn't seem to be any introduction to where to go or what to do.  Spent a couple minutes reading, but there was so much information with no context that I was forgetting it as fast as I read it.  I apparently have to opt into advertising, which confuses me because I'm pretty sure I paid money for this game and I don't usually have to watch targeted ads when I pay for games.  The default character looks like an unhealthy mime and after fidgeting with it I still couldn't get it to look like a human.  Eventually after clicking around looking at words and buttons and not figuring anything out, I gave up and exited.  Also, there's either no sound or the sound didn't work (worked on the last game I played and the one I played right after).

Perhaps seasoned veterans of management/simulator games that already know what to do would enjoy the game, but as someone who isn't specifically a fan of this genre and thought it looked interesting when it popped up in my discovery queue as a highly rated sim game, I didn't enjoy the experience.

I continue to play them in every single game, they are still unhappy because of lack of first team. At half season, there is a 2 months break in the Romanian championship (December to February, only friendlies, no official match). Around 20th of January, another 4 players, first team regulars even if some have Rotation contracts, start crying because they lack first team play. I promise to give them first team play, what can I do. After a week, they say that I didn't keep my promise, they are upset and they want out - I must mention that there was NO OFFICIAL GAME IN THIS PERIOD, so absolutely no possibility to give them first team play in official matches. Now my entire time is unhappy and half of them want to leave. What the... I can't even.... This game makes no sense.

The injuries seem to be less destructive in duration than before. From my experience, the game appears to have nerfed the one-top formations, where I used multiple variations of 4-2-3-1 as my primary formation. In a one-top formation, my world class strikers have a tough time scoring 20+ league goals in a season. Hat-tricks are extremely rare even with world class strikers, wingers, and inside forwards. Wingers cannot be relied upon for goal scoring. Without good crossing stats, the wingers and fullbacks are turrible at crosses into the box.

The game is obviously the best football simulator out there and I think that is starting to get to the devs' head. Most of the additions of this year are sugar-coating and unfunctional features that improve the aesthetic aspects of the game rather than its playability. Despite all of the players' complaints on common issues regarding the game, SI mostly ignores such negative feedback and keeps on adding in unnecessary sauces without cooking a decent main dish.  

The match engine probably is the worst among the last few games. Even a top-flight team's five-star rating player can go ahead and pluck in an own goal from midfield. Your striker with top finishing skills will keep on missing the target from a yard. Your defenders will be caught dumb in almost every single counter-attack and you'll concede since they'll decide to stay away from the opponent's striker all of a sudden in the penalty box.

Most of the instructions you try to impose on your players are just ignored. 

No matter your managerial skills, some players will keep on bringing you irrational matters that'll piss them off whatever answer you give them and therefore reduce the atmosphere of the dressing room.

I personally think that it doesn't really matter that much since the game isn't meant to be realistic in graphical aspects, although the animations in the 3D match engine are really terrible and way behind the current tech. If the devs also think the same way as me, then they probably should stop focusing on such trivial matters as ""improving the UI"".

Although obviously, this game isn't just a piece of garbage that is full of cons, despite all of these annoying and frustrating problems that lie within, there are also tons of great stuff about the game going on (hence my playing time). The problem is that every year, while the fans expect from the devs some fixes on these problems, the devs just go on and feed us some unasked for features that they just go ahead and decide for themselves. 

The training interface is a great overhaul, really adds to the realism aspect, although might be challenging and hard to get intuitive with for new players.

Also the new tactics induction feature is a really user friendly addition to the game.

The game absolutely has one of the best player rating and scouting systems out there. It's a great way to expand your real-life knowledge on players.

The cons might appear to be outnumbering the pros of the game, although that definitely is not the case. The game is still the best football simulator out there, and tons of fun. The reason that I've written so much about the cons is that despite all the years that went by, the game is still way too far from its complete potential and it's just disappointing. 

Still, if you're a footy-head, you should totally go for the game. If it's on a sale (which was the case when I wrote this) definitely go for it. Even if it's a rainy, cold Stoke night.",1561894230,1561894230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me Football Manager is a huge time investment in an alternate world which I enjoy with a couple of years' break in between sessions.  The most recent FM game I sunk myself into was 2015, although I did buy 2016 and feel it was pretty much the same, 2019 however is not, it is a massive step into complex world.

I started playing Football Management games as a genre in the late 80s thanks to shareware bundles on 5.25' disks that my parents would give me and through the 90s favoured Player Manager (I loved seeing myself as a player at the time), Ultimate Manager (the Stadium building was awesome) and the Spanish game PC Futbol (my best mate is Spanish and ran the translations until I could figure out how to play and playing the games was fun). In the early 2000s Total Club Manager which became Fifa Manager dominated my spare time with the personal wealth building side, owning a team and having a kid come through the youth system which was a blast. My hands down personal favourite feature though was the create a club feature where I built the ficticious Portsea Pirates into perennial Champions League winners while enjoying a more modern take on some of my favourite features from earlier games including playing the matches in Fifa in 2004.

In 2012 and 2015 I sunk as much time into Football Manager as I had in earlier games and while not burning through as many years I found the level of engagement and feeling of ownership over the progress of my team to be far greater.

After a few years away from the genre I've returned and spent 45 hours playing through July and August trying to find my feet in a game that feels simply larger and more involved but the reward has meant that I cheer on forward movement and goals like never before and feel ownership and pride for the 17yo winger who just scored his first goal after the board wrote him off as a poor signing.

To my family, I am sorry...I'm awake and not at work so I'll be loading it up in a minute and will have it on all day, but thanks to the turn based nature of the time progression some semblance of real life will continue to take place in the background for the next couple of hundred hours or so while I worry about my relationship with the dressing room more than the lounge room.",1561848553,1561848553,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Looks good, tactics customisation seems a success, the game seems more challenging but has not been helped with some niggling annoyances.  
I've come across frustrations this year that almost made me stop playing.  I've seen defenders for no apparent reason split like the parting of the red sea and let the opposition score.  Please, please investigate the game's crossing mechanics I don't expect a Wing back / Winger to get past the defence and have a clear crossing opportunity to stop abruptly allowing the defender to catch up smash the ball against a defender.  I've also seen some suspicious games where things look seriously scripted - I'm hoping this is not the case and the engine gets looked at and refined.  It would be such a shame to put people off playing if issues are not looked into within the game engine.
I felt the game this year didn't give enough to justify the full game price.  I would still like to see them do more with the game format surely more can be done with an online format so managers can pit themselves against each other and take FM to a whole new level?

Training now has meaning and depth.

Only things to say are that the game engine seems to have not progressed as much as SI shouted about. Newgens also feel rather bland with similar models/hairs regardless of where they come from and their age.

I've previously played the 2012/2013 releases--which at the time felt like a novelty--but the 2019 release brings very little to the table, and I'm sad to say that it feels like it has a lot of recycled code from earlier releases.

In a nutshell, FM is about releasing new versions of the game each year where the main change is the updated database (players, teams, etc). The retail price is around €55 and you're not paying for a brand new game, instead, you're paying perhaps for the 10% new code. Compare this with other games, such as Sid Meier's Civilization, that are around the same price, and are released every 6-8 years, and introduce true novelty and a complexity and depth like FM could never dream of reaching, and yet Firaxis' team (which develops Civilization) is a fraction of Sports Interactive.

The take-away here is to realize that Sports Interactive cannot fix FM without recoding it from scratch and by bringing someone with great vision to take charge of the steering wheel. Recycling old code and old design is no longer feasible, nor is it charming. 

So what's the problem with FM? The main problem is that the simulation is not presented well. The presentation is done through animation and it is mainly from the animation that we, the players, ought to understand how the game works. It shouldn't be from the database. When people pointed this out in earlier releases, the hardcore fans came to the rescue by saying that despite its flaws, the game has an enormous depth that many weren't capable of understanding, and that the real depth lies in how the variables work in the background. 

This is the wrong approach. The animation should offer an accurate representation of the back-end. Period. How do we know that the animation is not working? We find out not by playing English teams, or Italian teams, or any other major football nation. We find out by picking a small football nation (in terms of its leagues, not its national team), we then pick an inferior league, and then we check how the lower-end football players interact with each other and the opposing team. We do this because it allows us to check how the smallest parts of the product works (ie the qualities of football player). 

If we were to check the best players in Premier League, for instance, it would be harder to notice the simulation deficits because a poor play coming from a high-end player, or even a poorly managed team with good players, is engineered to make sense, meaning that unlike the lower-end players, their absurdity is not showing, even though it's there. When I say absurdity, I'm refering to the poor and unrealistic decision-making that players make in order to simulate a low skill. For instance, in the 2012 release, it was usual for a poor goal-keeper to give the ball to an opponent, or for a player to kick the ball out when no one was near him. These flaws are not bugs, they're a part of the code, and Sports Interactive have been trying to paint them over by changing their behavior instead of redoing their logic. Sometimes this works fine, like when the injuries happened too often, they decreased the probability for injuries to happen; other times, it works poorly. But when it comes to decision-making, a poor player needs to simulate poor play, not absurd play.

As for micro-managing the game, the dashboard has been given a modern look but feels more confusing than older versions. To determine corner kicking and how the players should position themselves has become a mystery. Hours pass by as you click your way through and skipping the news from other leagues and your own league, and even when you choose not to be informed, you still get to click your way through a lot of nonsense.

In a multiplayer scenario it might be fun, especially if you play with friends, but in single player the game is not worth it unless you're an ardent football fan and really need the stimulation.",1561598059,1561598082,False,11,0,0.527578115463256836,0,True,False,False

1. Aguero was suggested to play as an advance forward but doesn't score despite 20 odd shots per match. Changed him to a complete forward and he was became a machine. Same thing happened with Leroy (suggested to be used as a winger, but I made him an IF and he won ballon d'or) & Raz (top assist).

2.Ended one match 1-1 and the end game report stated that my GK was fortunate to get a clean sheet from the last match.

Overall I think this game is pretty damn good, it runs better for me than FM18, the match engine is way better (no more people shooting the ball at the corner flag, lol). I have not had any annoyances with clicks not registering and I have not had rampant injury issues that make no sense, I barely even hit the post and the most shots I've seen from one team in a game is 30 and thats when I was severely outclassed (and not even all were on target).

This game has a lot of depth, you can manage almost every aspect you like about your club, move to other clubs and influence the game around the various leagues you have loaded. Build up your youth, bring your team from the lowest division to the top, win the CL and more! I say the best way to do this is without using any exploits that some users have found, it can ruin some of the game for you and believe me you will enjoy it and feel much more rewarded when you succeed without using any exploits.

The only annoyance I really have with this game is how some players decide to sign contracts. In my save it is the year 2024 and all the wonderkids and such are now CPU generated players. France seems to have a disproportionate number of wonderkids but that aside trying to sign them is one of the stupidest experiences I have had. My club has an equal reputation in the world to Newcastle, we both matched the release clause for the player and Newcastle offered them 6.9mil/year, reasonable for an 18 year old who can already come in and dominate the league (not always ensured, you can have flops). Anyways I saved before I sent in my offer to try some things out, I offered an equal amount with standard bonuses and clauses that the player wanted, they went to Newcastle, I offered an equal amount with exploits in the bonuses (things they wont reach with a huge money sum but they will like it a lot, not sure if you call this an exploit, I do) and he still goes to Newcastle, I decide to go all out just to see if it will even work and decided to give him all of the things I said before AND a 50% salary increase per year, that is an insane amount of money I highly doubt that Newcastle would match, guess what, he went to Newcastle.

I think some of the players in this game are just fated to join a certain club unless you maybe offer them 10x what they're asking for, it makes no sense as I was in EL competition and Newcastle was nowhere near that.

Overall I do recommend this game, it plays really well for me and I haven't been running into many of the issues that other people have been,  and you probably won't either (vocal minority).

You then give this excuse that this is not about watching the team play but managing it. Are you insane??? Do you think players will complain if you give them good graphics and watch the team they trained look like they are watching the game live? where did you find this theories? 
Don't you see what game engines exist out there and what they can do? 
What? you did not manage to have enough money to fix graphics, code and add music? then don't try creating a game with focus on management since you are not good at it!
All players want is very simple!!! Create a beautiful environment for them to navigate without getting blind. create beautiful graphics as close to reality as possible (yes I do want every detail).  Collaborate with PES, or Fifa if you can't do that part by yourselves.Fix the online part of it, currently we don't know when the game will freeze again!! Don't deliver the game in one year, you will need more than one year for this. Ask from the football players that you put their faces in game to support the game by sponsoring it. I am sure most will support, especially since this is Marketing for them. 

After you create and deliver this ""dream"" game. Guess what!! we will gladly pay subscription for you to update the game for the next 10 years. while you add new context, update players, and improve the game with new options and more stability.

My top games are FTL, Binding of Isaac, various MMOs, any survival/crafting games. There, now you know what I normally like.

FM19 is a superb game, made by masters of the genre. Sports Interactive have been making this game for a long time, and it shows. The detail and depth in the game is astounding, and all of it is presented through a pleasing, responsive interface. As this game is basically just clicking hyperlinks, the flow of the various menus is of paramount importance, and it's done well here. There are multiple ways to get to the screen that you want, and plenty of customization of the information you want to present. It can be hard to find that one thing you're looking for sometimes, but that's just a learning curve and to be expected from a game with so much data to present.

It's thoroughly addicting. If you commit a few hours to overcome the steep learning curve at the beginning, you'll be rewarded with an experience that will last many years. If you look at streamers and fans of the series, you can see the commitment the FM series generates with it's fans. Once you get the hang of it, it's extremely hard to put down. There is a constant flow of success and failure in the game, meaning it doesn't get old. The next challenge is always right there for you. Win promotion, balance the finances, develop that new player, improve the club facilities, sign that impossible transfer, scout the new wonderkid. The list of immersive gameplay experiences is endless.

I could go on praising the game for pages, but I'll end with a pros and cons list:

PROS
Value for money. This game is worth every penny, as once you crack the learning curve, it'll give you hundreds of hours of enjoyment.

Authenticity. It is astonishing how much real life data this game has. Everything is in there - every player you've ever heard of, every manager, coach, physio. The database is staggering, and the research it must have taken to build is astounding.

Interface. To make such a wealth of data accessible to the player must have been a massive hurdle to overcome, but they've done it flawlessly. While you may occasionally get lost trying to find a piece of information, it's in there. You just haven't found it.

CONS
Audio. There is none, save for the sound of the ball being kicked, the refs whistle, and the match crowd. The vast majority of the game is completely silent. It's very confusing when you first start, as the only feedback you get from the engine is visual.

Team-talks/Dynamics. In some ways, this game is a morale manager, and while the system is deep and complex (as is everything in this game), it lacks nuance. You will often repeat the same talks over and over, changing statements so as not to bore the team, or regularly praising/criticizing them to win the numbers game. It's not bad, just repetitive, and the lack of variety in the various statements your manager can make gets old quickly. Your personality is lost when speaking to the players, as the game forces you into a few choices which may not represent what you really want to say to the squad. More depth is needed in this system.

Set pieces. The worst part of the game, for me. Apart from feeling a little broken in matches (they are ridiculously successful), the interface for creating them, changing them, and varying them is very bad. It's needlessly confusing and limited in scope. You are forced into making a few choices from a small pool, instead of organically growing your set piece plans. If you want to be inventive with your free kicks, you can't do it here.

OVERALL
Worth every penny. Experienced players may take issues with some of the changes in this version, but newbies will love it. It's a game made by masters. Great job SI!",1558630399,1558630399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whether players do not recognize the ball's location or whether they approach the ball at the speed of a sloth and a player farther away will sprint and tackle them and then score. The finishing of your own AI is terrible compared to that of the opposing AI. Also the heading function of this game is idiotic. Players would rather just head the ball randomly and lose possession needlessly instead of attempting to control the ball. The players inability to cross or more often just not attempting to cross at all.

Unfortunately, i am not the saving the game discs type, otherwise i would have had all the collection from 1999 till now. Some of them were on different steam accounts others were on CD's others on DVD's.

I consider this game the most complete football experience you will ever get! Simply amazing, realistic and emotionally capable to successfully get you to love ""a complete stranger""!

Please keep in mind that i have THOUSANDS of hours in other FM games so any issues I point out are relative to other games, which have all had their fair share of problems. I'll try to run through the issues; 

-Performance is worse than FM18. It's by no means unplayable, but it is noticeably worse
-Bugs where you can't click on anything, or where for some bizarre reason only about 1 in 4 clicks register
-A match engine that actually beggars belief. Hit the woodwork 7 times in a match? Check. 50+ shots on goal in a match? Check. I could go on, it just sucks. People will probably read this and think ""maybe your tactics suck"", but if you are regularly getting 20+ shots on target and not scoring with a striker who has 18 finishing, I can't see how this could possibly be an issue with tactics. This is avoidable by meta-gaming but that isn't acceptable 
-Player interactions that are so unrealistic it is almost as if the person who wrote them has never had an adult conversation. In what world would a player respond by saying ""maybe my standards are better than yours"" when you praise him for being THE BEST PLAYER IN TRAINING THAT WEEK. He has a 9.10 rating in training in a game where a 7.6 match rating is Ballon d'Or territory but is willing to insult his manager for praising him? What the fuck

But it is different for football manament games. I have been playing in this genre since 1997. My addiction and love started with Premier Manager 97. Then follows the CM98/99, CM99/00. FM 2005 is still fresh in my memories. Hours of gameplay... Lots of soul breaking matches played...

And now it is FM 19. I pre-ordered it. Big expectations. Bang. Incorrect squad registration roles for Turkish League. Totally unplayable in Turkey. I said ok. Football is universal. Go play somewhere else until they fix it. Took my favourite team in BPL which is Liverpool. Bang! Salah is injured for 11 months during a pre-season match. Re-started the game. Bang! Mane is gone for 9 months. Re-started the game. Bang! Salah is gone 7 months. I said ok, I will keep playing this time. 27 players in the squad. Total injuries were 145 throughout the season. Salah couldn't play a single match. Sturridge played 25 matches and scored 4 goals. The most shocking thing was I became the champion with 11 matches lost and 7 draws. I said ok. This is a pre-release game. They will fix it. They always did.

But no. Not this time they did. Last time I checked I am in 90 hours in this game. The further I came with a team without deleting the save is fifth match in the second season. Here is why;

1. Poor match engine optimisation
- Your striker is very unlikely to score in one on one situations. And by unlikely I mean %5-10. 
- Your probabilty to score goals from rigth wing/left wing crosses are much higher than to score a goal from the penalty kick.
- During a highlight you are very likely to see that one of your players is running completely opposite way from where everything is happening. Sometimes it is same for the other team's players.
- You can easily bet your home on that if your defenders started to pass the ball back and forth, you will concede a goal.

2. Poor VAR optimisation
- Around %90 of the key moments in a match contains a VAR situation
- The refs very unlikely to give a penalty decision without consulting the VAR.

3. Player's penalty
I call this ""player's penaly"". Let me explaing what I mean. 
You take Chelsea. Trying to land a big name. You offer a big sum of cash. Rejected. The same transfer season your rival lands the same player for less. In another save you are Man City. You are after the same player. Offered a big sum. Gets rejected. Chelsea signs that player for less. 
Same scenario is also valid while negotaiting with a player. You offer 4m euro per year to a player. Gets rejected. Same player signs a contract with an AI managed club for 2m euros.
One question here is very necessary. WTF?

4. Translations (You don't have to read this part if your mother tongue is not Turkish)
- Since the first Turkish translation is introduced, I have been forcing myself to play it in Turkish. But after a few continues, I go back to English. The very first time it was introduced, the translation was disgustingly bad. I don't remember the year, I think it was 2014. Clearly a google translation. In comparison, now it is a lot better this year. But still there is a major problem with the translation that must be addressed. And that is; I don't feel myself that I am reading the news from a Turkish newspaper or conducting a interview with the Turkish media or listening the commentary from a Turkish commentator.
It feels like a word to word translation of an English sportsman commentating or asking questions. What I mean by that is there is no translation of the jargon. It is like you read a translation of your new rented property's contract. Just word by word. Even the English idioms or figurative phrases are translated to Turkish word by word which doesn't make any sense when you read them in Turkish. 
""They leave with a win in their bags"" 
What bags? They brought their own bags before the game? Interesting huh?
I mean no offense to English culture and literature here. But this doesn't give me the same vibe when I play in Turkish.

5. Unjustified buzz before the release
- On youtube I watched so many videos about the new purple background and a new picture in the introduction page and also a new layout in the menu.
The purple background; it is just a skin
The new picture(s) in the intro; just a picture
The new layout; took me 3 seconds to adjust

I am a veteran FM player and don't give a fuchsia about any of these.


With all being said, I will probably keep playing the game as it is the only AAA game in this genre. But I can't recommend this game anymore. I don't even recognize it as a game. It became a database for real proffesional football clubs with some 3d match engine in it.

Definitely the UI has changed to accommodate the additional features, the tactic are more complex and the match graphics and engine has improved (at least on the surface)

Pros:
- Nice match day graphics
- Many options for tactics
- Lots of things to keep the manager busy
- You can choose which areas to handle so that you do not feel overwhelmed by too many things to handle.

Cons:
- Gameplay feels a bit too easy. I basically choose the same strategy that seems logical to me and do not deviate much throughout the season.
- The team talk is a mystery to me. It is hard to determine how a player will react to what you say until you try it.
- Absolutely hated that the players took long breaks post season, and are unavailable for the pre-season friendlies.
- if you choose to handle everything on your own, the game starts to feel like a full time job.

I was hesitated to buy the game as there are bunch of players said it is not possible to score in open-plays. I was worried for a second about this, and this really happened during my first few matches of the season, the team only know how to score from set pieces.
Things have been changed significantly since I focus on building team cohesion and keeping a good relationship with my players. The team is having a good spirit and players are willing to give out their best in every match. I didn't mean not to bring in your tactics and philosophies to the team, this is equally important. You might find a huge turnaround when you put your time on team building, relationship bonding with your players and tactics preparation altogether.

The other thing you need to bear in mind is Training. Try to focus more on match tactics preparation and general training, you might find something special from these features. 

So after I applied these changes and focusing on these bits, I scored a lot from open plays, set-pieces still playing a part in the game but it is not as important as you imagined.

Unfortunately, I can't help but feel Sports Interactive are just as controversial with their match engine and company standpoint on it as VAR has been recently.

Upon release the game was very enjoyable and tactical tweaks seemed very intuitive,  however since the recent ME updates have been rolled out, pressing is akin to watching my friends under 5s team swarming towards the ball with no regards to keeping shape. Through balls and off the ball runs are seemingly non apparent, and crossing - possibly my biggest hate of this years game, a wing back in acres of space with all the time in the world will stand and wait for the opposition to close them down 9/10 times, either resulting in a corner or throw.

I think the most irritating thing of all though is the Sports Interactive forum stance on these well known issues according to moderators that regulate the forums - the official response I have seen on several occasions is ''send us more PKM's of these known issues and we will look to balance this better in fm2020''.
Bearing in mind there is probably 6+ months left in this game's cycle, not to mention it was a much better working product at release SI have seriously dropped the ball with this edition of football manager - and I worry its going to take a minor miracle in the match engine department to tempt me to fork out another £40 or so for next years game, when if this year is anything to go by, any match engine tweaks will cause more harm than good and render any purchase a waste of time.

Lots of bugs carrying on over the years..
Grey players you sign, never originate at your club according to their bio. This has always been an issue.
When playing online with a friend only the host will see the kits graphics files. Yes, we have graphics files installed on both. Always an issue.
Over the net play is getting slower and more lag each year.
Despite changing my avatars skin colour, I'm still white on the sideline during the game. A small thing but hey, with the depth and detail of the game and you notice it.

Good game when played with friends online. This gives it the potential to be the greatest sports game ever!
Very good editor, once you know how to drive it. It's worth learning! Can make some amazing tournaments, awards, media outlets and more. This really adds depth that no other football management game touches. Although SI games should make sure that each year edited database is compatible with the last. This avoids the grief of having to re-create the leagues. Which I had to this year, even though I tried moving raw data etc as per forum work arounds, data still got corrupted. My leagues and tournaments are about 30 to 40 hours of work in them.
3D engine is chipping away with improvements each year and version. Matches are getting very watchable and you yell at the players, this is a good sign. The explosive gloves of goalkeepers of 2019 is a tad weird where the ball can fly off the gloves harder than the ball hit them.
The Social Feed (Twitter replica) and News tabloids are very good and I'm sure will only get better with each version.

What I think the game needs...
Does need a stadium editor. Yes, we know managers almost always don't do this. 
You should be able to take a tour of your stadium. It's your club or your employer!
Journalists need to be more involved and dynamic moving to other media outlets etc. With avatars
I really would like to be fat as a manager and yes eventually forced into retirement. Making yourself short and heavy, turns you into a brick. I want to be grossly fat. You can pass Methuselah in age and still be calling the shots. At a certain point, you should hang up the clip board and have your spirit possess a more age appropriate manager.

In my opinion the most fun part of a manager simulator is to make attractive attacking football. By having a game that seems to be against good football? You cant have fun. SI NEEDS to realise flaws in a game are fine, as long as the game is fun. The game in its current bland state is not fun.

The match engine is absolutely terrible and looks tailored towards new players and kids. SI is dumbing down the ME every year.

The company wants you to play the game the way THEY understand the football, which is old school English style crossing and direct football. I highly doubt their development team's understanding of  modern football and tactics because it is non-existent in the game. 

- You have no control over build up play. The central attacking midfielders keep dropping deep because they hard-coded to do so by the developers. They don't understand the build up play. PERIOD.

- The defensive positioning of your players are hard-coded and depends on your player roles 'in possession' instructions. Seriously? Who came up with this genius idea? So if you want your strikers to drop deep when you don't have possession, you can't assign them 'attack' duty because apparently only support duty strikers drop deep. Is this how teams which use narrow 4-4-2 in real life play? No, they don't. The defensive positioning should be INDEPENDENT of your 'in possession' instructions.

- You can't recreact Sane and Sterling roles because in FM they don't stay wide in the final third. The wide attackers roles are hard-coded to stay inside no matter which role you use, no matter how much space is available out wide. In short, you can't create Man City's tactics. PERIOD.

- All wingbacks are hard-coded to dribble with the ball like dumb brainless non-existent league footballers. You can't recreact majority of wingback roles from real life. 

- You have no control over pressing. No pressing triggers. Pressing is hard-coded to the very basic.

I noticed some problems how the match engine can't seem to cope with direct and high press, which leads to massive overachievement. But I only have one save and I haven't tried other circumstances. I will update this after I properly play including with the recent updates.

Comparing with the demos I've played from previous versions, this has major quality of life improvements, specifically scouting a player until complete report. Lots of other promising features and I can't think of another management/sim that could ever touch this. Recommended so far until I see how the big boys play.

1. Graphic engine? “It looks worse than some much older versions.”

2. New, more realistic animation? - A nightmare! Players, sometimes, make five turns on their own axis, before picking up the ball. Goalkeepers do not touch the ball if it hit the post. 

3. Crosses from the flanks - just fabulously good! 99 out of 100 will fall into the nearest defender!

4. Playing a short pass, tiki-taka, combinations - NOT IN THIS YEAR SON...

5. Referee ... They ... Like ... R*t*rds!!! 

6. Extremely terrible match view. When fixing offside, I must to believe the referee, because there is no replay. Dangerous shots to the goal, hitting the post - are no longer interesting, according to the developers, because there will be no replays, again. 

7. Mountains of unnecessary, useless, repetitive press. It has never been so boring.

8. New - non-working role for players.

9. New, useless, tactical presets.

Me finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.

Allow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: ""Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?"" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.

This will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.

Fuck SI, Fuck their beloved ""devs"" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",1546868635,1552905408,False,185,252,0.87491077184677124,8,True,False,False

They made some good changes, expanded tactics, training, a few little UI things here and there and as always a massive database.  I usually get about 1000+ hrs in each version but in this one I'm only around 300.  
First off, I love the changes to training.  Creating schedules and adjusting them, while time consuming, adds an extra layer and almost takes me back to cm 03/04.  You can really target certain areas in the buildup before matches which I really enjoy.  Second, adding transition options and defensive width is quite helpful with tactics.  Allows for a lot of customization and tinkering with tactics.  
Finally, I think the game runs a bit smoother than previous years.  Or at least it does for me.  Not saying the animation is any better than previous years, I actually think 18 was better, but it seems to glide? along nicely.
After that, I don't have many good things to say about FM19.  
Press conferences, social feeds, team interaction, player interaction are all still brutal.  Press conferences are the same 5-10 questions that you always get asked with the same responses.  Social feeds are just a waste of time because they are the exact same formula, 1 good comment, 1 middling, and 1 negative.  It doesn't matter if they make sense or not, they are just always the same.  Really lazy SI!!!  Team interaction and player interaction are the same since the very beginning.  Same accusations and same retorts that never actually target what you want.  Team is dropping points in the last 10 minutes consistently, team meeting, isn't even an option to mention.  Player makes horrendous mistake that was so stupid it borders on comical and ends up with a 6.3 because of it.  After match conversation when you want to give him the hairdryer treatment, can't mention it.  But these have always been issues that SI has ignored so don't expect it to change anytime soon.  The same can be said for salary, contract conversations as well, and playing time.  It's always nice to have a guy come back from injury and take the hump because he isn't back in the first 11 immediately.
Transfers are also the usual headache.  AI teams will come in with a low ball bid and refuse to offer a realistic amount for your players.  You will identify a youth worth 500k and they will demand 55M pounds.  I found last year to be much better about this but it is really annoying and has been an ongoing problem in the series.
Finally, the actual match.....well.....the less said about that the better.  It is nowhere near as good as previous versions.  Players will not make space or create space for teammates.  In and around the box, just expect to hammer a ball into a defender.  Your guy will not dribble or try to create space.  The guys around him will not make runs or try to make space.  If it is knocked out to the wings, your guy will wait until he is closed down or he will dribble to the nearest defender he can find to hammer it off of his legs.  There are no through balls, lofted balls for strikers to run on to, or balls played low across the face of goal.  It just doesn't happen.  If a ball does flash across the goal, nobody will try for it.  Your striker will sit there and watch it roll by.  Defenders with space and time, the nearest opponent is getting a pie and tea, and they will head it straight to him, knocking his pie and spilling his tea.  Forget controlling it sensibly.  But if he does, whoa, watch out.  He will scream down the wing, surge into space, then, then, then, look for the nearest defender so he can smash the ball into his legs.  I've also found that strikers and wingers like to do the same.  If they are running onto a ball, the minute they get to it, they look to smash it straight at a defenders legs.  I've had strikers turn and run the other direction when they are involved in a two man counter.  The winger took off.  Loads of space for the striker to run into.  Only the two of them.  Then the striker saw a nice shiny 50p on the ground and decided to take off after that.  
I could go on about the decision making flaws that really take a lot of fun out of the game, and for me actually broke the game, but it's late and I've already rambled enough.  And this isn't an I can't win I wish it were easier point of view.  I've actually won the league 2 years in a row, reached the semis of the CL 2 years in a row, and won the FA and league cup twice each.  I'm at the top of the table again in my 3rd year.  I just don't like this years game.

Update : 06Nov18

1 - Email SEGA Support Team, They give me solution and instruction to follow! then it is working !
2 - Even It is working , DLC purchased data between FM and Steam seam not to correct but anyway , continue giving them info for further investigation

Update  : 02 Mar 19

After 500 hrs into this game, for me who play since CM. FM19 kinda disappoint, It is fun
but many many thing is to strictly i knew its improve versatility from FM18. but still for me it seem that what ever i change during game play dont matter much in game  it still kinda RANDOM

Frustrate List   (things that hardly happen in real world)
- world class ST 1-1 with goal or have clear chance ........... NO they wont score just shoot to nowhere
-Selling Player : This is HARD   (maybe to prevent player to exploit money farming ) 
-Buying Player : High Cost,High Wage Overpriced ( but real world lately seem kinda look like game now haha)
-injury : i feel like they fixed it (at some point while ago what ever i do injury like half of my senior squad )
-so on and on ( be back for more later)

Summary : If you never play FM  before  you will love it, But i would like to see more improveeeeeeee for the price i paid it is okay to use same old code for 1 or 2 gen 

 TIP : FB WB is Freaking OVERPOWER CROSSING buy the best players you can get

And for that i have to get this a negative review. i appreciate the devs making this wonderful series as true to real life as possible, but when they take it just that little bit too far it ruins the fun. it is a video game after all.",1551221636,1551221636,False,1,2,0.454545468091964722,1,True,False,False

Again after a quick browse of the reviews it appears the haters are brigading one of the greatest games ever made and arguably the best football simulator / tycoon game.

A lot of people cry about this game being scripted or random and I can assure you this has been a regular complaint and just comes down to people who don't understand the game and how it works.

I am able to take any team from any league and get them to the champions league. I have done consistently with Barnet, Coventry and Wrexham. I do not use any guides or shortlists and always play with random CA and PA if its available. My main critique has always been the game is far too easy when you understand how it works and I was hoping this would be addressed and in this game steps have definitely been made to address this.

This feels like a big improvement on last year so far with several upgraded and changes that have added to the realism. Here are some of them:

1) Tactics

Love the new tactics creator. Has all the same components as before but allows you to choose from more styles and breaks the tactic up into attack, defence and transition.

As a player who watches the games I really could see my decisions in action and found changing tactics led to visible changes on the pitch.

2) Training

Training feels a lot more hands on. I am yet to see the direct results long term but being able to completely tailor your training routines definitely adds more immersion to the game.

Feels a lot more realistic.

3) Scouting

Again not played enough to get the whole picture but it appears they have fixed OP scouting which has again made the game feel more realistic and increased difficulty.

I could literally scout 100 players and get all there reports in over the next week in old versions, it definitely feels like scouting is more realistic and report cards are staggered depending on your scouting team and network.

My friend says that top regens are also now a lot harder to buy, rather then being able to buy the next Messi for nothing from argentina these players come with a much higher cost or future costs associated with them.

4) Engine

I have noticed some improvements but never really had a major issue with the engine in the previous games personally.

I have noticed the back pass bug hasn't occurred yet. This is when your defender under no pressure passes back to the GK and just passes it out for a corner. Would happen a lot and is incredibly annoying and immersion breaking. 

I have only just started playing and am thoroughly enjoying FM2019 so far. Just feels like I have more control over things and feels more realistic so far.

Will update review as and when I notice improvements or critiques.",1551022325,1551022325,True,0,1,0.455228567123413086,0,True,False,False

Primarily the match engine is embarrassing. A defender, with no other place within 20 yards, will head any ball in the air straight to the opposition for no reason. Goalkeepers will run the opposite direction to a back pass and concede an own goal. Strikers will get confused on a counter attack and jog instead of sprinting. The amount of times the opposition score with their only shot...

Outside of this expect to be spammed with the most pointless information about a 1 star players development to a 1.5 star player in your youth team coming straight to your inbox, meanwhile you have to hunt down information on the Champions League if you are not actively playing in it, even if you subscribe to it!

If you have played any version of the game from the past 10 years you will be familiar with all the press-conference questions and hand that, and many, many other duties over to your staff.

The most fun thing about previous games was signing players, shaping a team and seeing results with the formation you either developed or downloaded. I have developed and downloaded several so far and results are at best inconsistent and at worst comical.

The graphics are either a web browser or a Fallout 2 football mod. 90% of players don't have a photo.

The sounds only exist in matches, and the ""ole"" chants that fans do for passes when a team is winning by just 1-0 is ridiculous.

The issue of scripting goes far beyond just the match engine and can easily be seen in the transfer market too. There is far too little instructions that you can give to your players, and sometimes these instructions appear to have little effect if any at all. The game gets so many things wrong it untrue, some players can't even play positions, that I know for a fact that they can play. The biggest example is Cesar Azpilicueta, who can only play at RB??? Despite being world class for two seasons at CB for Chelsea, they won the title the first season with him in that position. Its actually laughable; they don't put the effort into the graphics and instead put it into the database, that's all well and good but they can't even get that right. My advice would be don't waste your time or money on a game that isn't much different or better to the 2018 game, which has the same issues. Quite simply a lack of development here. We will change the colour of the background add a few little feature and give them sophisticated names to fool people into thinking we have made ground-breaking changes. This game series has had issues with scripting for 2 decades, it feel like its not testing my football knowledge but instead my knowledge of how to bet the match engine, that not football. Perhaps they should call it Match Engine Manager 2019. Don't waste your money! This really is a poor excuse for a football management game, safe to say I will never buy another game from this shambles of a game series. Same old, same old issues and I can't see them ever being rectified, as the game maker are clearly incompetent, lazy and lack football knowledge. Rating players out of 20 is such a rubbish concept and does not even begin to account for the varying degrees of ability in football, not that this really matters because they mess up the player ratings anyway.

If you look at my Game Library, you can see that i tend to skip 1 or 2 versions of this game at a time, purely because they dont really add/change fix the game enough over the course of 2 versions to warrant a full price buy.
The game itself is ok, lots of cool stuff from the community but the game mechanics are the same and are as broken as the previous titles.
Watching the games are incredibly tilting as whatever you seem to do, no matter how much better your side is, will simply be a rng away from giant killing. The Instant Result seems to negate some of this RNG  thats added to some of the public skins that have been made, but that limits you to actually watching the game after you know the result and you lose a lot of that Football Manager feeling on the touchline.

The graphics for the games hasnt changed at all, its still a simplified mess and has 0 detail as ever version fo the game has had since they added it.
The hierarchy system just adds another aspect to juggle which is ok, but seems very one dimensional. 
Overall, the game is ok, but I could have easily just continued with FM17/16, whichever one i previously had, because it simply hasnt changed enough, none of the areas have been fixed, they simply update the squads and roll it out for another £30, they seriously need a overhaul of this game and take it in a different direction, its getting extremely stale which is a huge shame.

After an okay amount of hours on this game I'd say this is the best version of FM i've ever played. It's fun, realistic, editable and challenging (not so much after a while but yeah). However, this review is for Sports Interactive more than it is to the customers.

The first MAJOR problem is that the online modes are absolutely useless, I've tried unreal internet connection speeds and the game is still super laggy, and as far as I know, everyone's facing the same problem. It's 2019 is it REALLY THAT HARD to have dedicated online servers? who still makes their customers host servers?? I swear if the game cost 100$ but had dedicated online servers i would definetly still buy it.

Another problem is the finance being not realistic, as I knew from some reasearch, if a team with low income is promoted to a high division ( for example; Championship, Premier League) it is given a bulk amount of money to match a point of being the lowest possible yet efficient level of finance for its league. How am I supposed to be in the premier league and have like 6k max wages p/w? also needs more work.

I really hope this reaches sports interactive because it will definetly make the game better if they act on these issues.",1548931576,1548931576,False,4,0,0.522844493389129639,0,True,False,False

Yes I recommend this years version but honestly I don't enjoy it any more or less than I have past versions, 
It's Fm it's always been a solid game, 
To note some negatives for developer feed back if they even read these, 

Crazy goal keeper errors at premiership level happens far to often to be considered realistic, 

Sloppy defending from elite defenders, heading the ball to the opposition attackers even tho they have loads of time to take the ball down and lick a pass, 

Goals in under 30 seconds happened quite a lot,

Match engine does not seem to be synced right, player animations are not synced with play, seeing a ball fly off a player even when he does not kick or head it lol, 

Contract demands, now this one is stupid, sign players on a 5 year deal and a week or month later they become unhappy because you refuse a new deal and results in a unhappy squad.

Whilst at times it might be fun, the scripting is unreal and spoils any realism. It isn't user friendly. It's overly restrictive in some area's whilst overly detailed in others. To top it off, it has a truly cancerous community and dev team that don't seem to want to make any fixes or changes to the game.

The match engine is completely broken. If you are going to have 3D view and animation, at least make enough varients that it isn't repetetive. Make idiotic things like 40 yard own goals almost impossible to happen (has happened twice in two different cup finals for me, the odds of that ever happening irl are minute). Tactics make no difference. None. Results seem pre determined before the game has started. Players seem to do the opposite of what you ask. Some games reloading and changing things yields different results, but in most it takes at least 20 games, if not more before you ever get any sort of result. It took me fourty games - yes, FOURTY - to score a single goal in one tie, despite me having comfortably beaten the very same team 2-0 just a week before. One on Ones are broken. 90% of the time they will miss or hit it straight at the keeper. The amount of shots, especially long range ones that are clearly saved by the keepers and magically, every time, clip the crossbar are given as goalkicks instead of corners. Kick off goals are insanely common. Strikers are broken, as is crossing the ball. Your wingers will get 20 goals a season whilst your striker struggles to get 10. Corners and freekicks are the main way to score, and even the worst players deliver a world class free kick 80% of the time. You can never win an appeal for a red card, injuries are far too common.

I can't speak for other entries in the series but this game's modeling of real life is absurd in the extreme, both on and off the field. Players get upset when you complement them. They whine that they want to go to a better team then get upset when you try to transfer them. Players are made of paper, they get injured way way too much. I've had players go out for 2 months during a match preview session. Red cards are handed out for nothing and egregious fouls are ignored. Teams you should be crushing blow you away and teams you should get crushed by don't even show up. 

The general impression I get from this game is it's all random. All the player interactions, the stats, the tactics and strategies all mean exactly nothing. You might as well be playing Blood Bowl rolling dice. At least in that game there's no match engine pretending to simulate a result - you know it's all RNG.

I've read that the Football Manager series is one that takes a while to cook. That after 6 months of tweaks and patches the game starts to improve. If that's the case we're not there yet. If you really really want a management game I'd suggest looking elsewhere for now, or maybe even to older versions of the FM series that have their engines fixed already, because right now, FM 19 is just an exercise in random number frustration.

Football Manager 2019 is the worst version of the game ever.  There are many reasons for this.  

Firstly, the match engine is terrible, and has been the subject of countless bug reports and complaints on Sports Interactive's Football Manager forums.  One particular annoyance has been the problem of getting players to cross the ball; they will seemingly do anything but.  But it would be wrong to focus on my 'favourite' bug in the game, as there are so many problems with the match engine, and other areas of the game, which explains why, at the time of writing this review, there are more than 20,000 posts on the bugs forum. 

One of the big claims to improvement by SI for this game was the revamped training system.  However, it is shambolic.  The sheer volume of choices, which should be a good thing, becomes an issue when the decisions you make either have no effect, or trigger immediate problems. 

The AI controlling player personalities, driving interactions with players, is simply broken.  One of my favourite examples is a player who was a few months into a five-year contract.  I was given a heads-up that he was unhappy, because he wanted a new contract.  He hadn't asked for a new contract, much less been refused, but was unhappy anyway.  I opened a private chat with him, but the chat was over immediately because his reaction was that he was so pleased I'd come to talk to him, he didn't want a new contract any more.  There are many threads on the forums devoted to the nonsensical and plain silly player interactions, which really mar the game.

Press conferences are the most tedious, pointless aspect of the game.  There is an option for allowing the AM to handle them, but it doesn't matter how good your AM is, he will make a mess of press conferences. 

The much-vaunted dynamics on the game are equally ridiculous, with players showing unhappiness on one screen appearing to be entirely happy on another. 

As a tactics buff, I expected great things when I first saw the new tactics screens on FM19.  However, for all the choices you have, you might as well not bother, because the don't seem to affect matches in the slightest.  It's not just the crossing problem.  Pressing, possession play, marking... it's simply broken.  On a tactic I used, I had instruction for two of my players to man mark specific positions on the opposition teams.  I played many, many matches, and never saw my players make a single attempt to mark those positions; in fact, the opposite seemed to be true, with the opposition players being given huge amounts of time and space. 

The daftness of the game permeates every single element.  After I played a Community Shield match, I got an inbox message stating that my keeper had set a new Community Shield record by keeping one clean sheet, as the previous record had been zero clean sheets.  I paid good money for this game. 

I am not alone in being infuriated by paying for a game which is simply not ready.  Unfortunately, there are limited opportunities to make complaints.  The obvious option in to use the Sports Interactive forums.  However, the level of dissatisfaction over the game being raised on the forums seems to have triggered a policy of moderators silencing complaints, and banning forum users who show any dissent against the full on barrage of positive propaganda being spouted by moderators and developers.  It suggests SI know they got this game badly wrong.  

Personally, I'm so infuriated with the way SI have milked the fans with this poor iteration of the game, which has compounded the problems that surfaced with FM18, after the brilliant FM17, that I will not buy any further iterations.  One bad game is a blip, but two consecutive bug-ridden games, compounded by SI's apparent policy of silencing unhappy paying customers has made me completely lose faith in the company.",1546785343,1546787162,False,286,11,0.896914422512054443,0,True,False,False

Although I do enjoy the game and have played it quite a bit, there are some little flaws, like when my preseason ended mid July and the season started at the end of July, then we had a mid season break from mid November to late December with all teams playing friendlies, another one was when the penalties were taken 2 each at a time - all in all not a bad game, if it weren't for the press conferences I'd be saying 8.5/10 and recommended, but with the press conferences being the way they are it's a 6/10 and not recommended",1546659218,1546659218,False,4,0,0.519845664501190186,0,True,False,False
872790,48082485,76561197962740348,0,14,5985,0,1821,1611775248,"Problems with match engine everyone is talking about can be summed up by this:

Post match stats
Man U - 34 Shots, 12 On Target, 52% Posession, 75% Pass completion, 93% Tackles won. 
Spartak Moscow - 9 Shots, 2 on Target, 48% Posession, 65% Pass completion, 84% Tackles won.

Here's how it played out: First half we destroy them. Shot after shot after shot. They cant get near our goal. We take every ball off them. Half time? We've been unlucky. Second half starts. They score 47th minute. 

That's ok though, because we are destroying them, we are basically just sat in their box firing shot after shot, header after header, corner after corner. There's nothing to change.

Minute 70 rolls around. I'm powerless. It's one way traffic and we are peppering them with shots. 

Minute 80 rolls around. What do I change? Do I want to? We are peppering them with shots. Their goalkeeper has got PTSD by this point. He's a nervous wreck. 

Minute 84. We score. Phew. Minute 86. We score. Phew. And we win.

But this is not an irregular occurance. And this is a good moment in a sea of bad. 

You see, sure, I won on this occasion, but there has been many occasion like this where I am sieging them, the shots are on target, the corners are greeted with one of my players headers, they can't even get past the half way line, but I still lose.

And it's that feeling of powerlessness, that despite everything in the game telling you that it is one way traffic, that *IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME*, and then it isn't, and they counter attack once and win. 

That's what you see everyone talking about. FM is a puzzle game at heart, but it's a puzzle game where it tells you that you are doing everything correctly, but gives you one thing when you know you should be getting the other. 

The match engine has something fundamentally wrong with it. Loads of people seem to be able to master it after a while, but then it arbitrarily keeps you from winning. It's like they know they messed it up and made it too easy, and so made your ability to score harder than it should be. 

The depth of this game is astonishing, and creating your way of playing football is fantastic, but something is rotten in the state of Football Manager, and it cannot be ignored.

Stats-
Man UTD - 34 Shots, 20 on Target
Southampton - 10 shots, 2 on Target

Unfortunately it's very negative, due to one of the most boring and flawed ME in recent years. The biggest issue is always strikers movement, it's just not there and there's really no difference between DLF on support or AF. Lack of strikers movement obviously has a negative impact on central play and especially playmaker types, as most chances will come from set pieces (corner kicks, free kicks and attacking throw in), long shots (quite effective on this update) and the old far post crosses. Other old issues in other areas (AI squad building, tranfers logic, terrible regen faces/hair) as well as new promising additions (more tactical options, revamped training) become less important when ME is in such state. I want to be optimistic though, the new live beta experiment might prove to be a very good thing for the development of ME if SI is smart enough to listen to the right people.

Thank you dev for good and quick response! You made my day and my ""cons"" are solved.

I really love this game. Actually, it is pretty good football manager with big BUT:
Boards expectations are totally unrealistic. I can give you small example. I won playoff place in league by a short head and I managed to move up - next season board expectations in much more stronger league were playoff place. This is totally unrealistic. It's killing player opportunity to develop your club slowly, see your yongster career and so on.
Basically, it's impossible to stay in some lower league and enyoy small clubs football because you will get SACKED! And after new club, you will get SACKED also after about 2 seasons (traditionally sooner).
Good game, it is good game but do not spend your money, if you like lower leage football, slow club and players development and all, what makes football so fantastic. I played this game a lot, every time starting over and over but I'm done. If there is no official nosacking dlc (touch do not intrested me), patch, option, whatsoever - I do not recommend it.

I can safely say that FM 2019 is the best version of the game yet. With the new training and tactics systems the game is way more fun to play. I am a Barca fan, and while I have been able to recreate Barca's play-style in earlier versions of the game, it has never been more accurate than in this one. And the best part is that it's really easy to do (Much less fiddling around in menus). The new UI and Game engine upgrades are also worth mentioning as pros. 

The only real con I can think of is that now the game feels a bit easier. While this may be more applealing to casual players and newcomers to the franchise, it reduces the enjoyment for experienced players. I finished my last season winning the treble and all the pre-season trophies without losing a single match in the league (while some of those have been done in real life, it's extremely rare and shouldn't be this easy to attain). The SI team should probably try and address this somehow. Maybe make it harder to get your players to follow your tactics? Create dressing room tension based on your tactical choices? Create some top-level drama from the board regarding your tactics, forcing you to make changes? Something to make the game more dynamic and challenging, please.

It's a great entry into the series that adds a lot of much needed improvements for hardcore fans such as myself, and it's also (in my opinion) the most approachable edition for potential newcomers to the FM community. Definitely worth a purchase if you haven't upgraded in a while or if you're a football fan who has never played FM.

My rating - 9/10

P.S., If you bought FM 18, I won't recommend the upgrade to FM 19 (Although if you do choose to upgrade, you won't hate yourself for it).",1545154701,1545154701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First season with liverpool on previous editions i usually find myself in a battle for 4th (yes i am aware liverpool have a very good squad compared to 3 years ago)  however on this one i have won the league with 95 points a mere 20 points above Man U in second with 75 (City finished 4th with pep being sacked ater 12 games) not only this i also won the FA Cup and the Champions League which inlcuded a 5-0 win over real madrid, 4-1 win over Napoli and a 5-2 win over spurs in the final.

Also players demanding ridiculous contracts seems to be a thing?

Despite Alisson being a new signing in the summer he demanded in december that I doubled his wages and even funnier than that Joe Gomez demanded he went from 20k odd a week to 160k and trent from 40k a week to 250k a week a long with a number of other players wanting new contracts and when i decline these hilarious demands they all want to leave and it drives morale down but i still when everygame anyway

Seems to be an insane amount of injuries as well 

Finally Man Utd seemed to be desperate to sign every striker in the game adding Icardi Kane and Morata to their ranks and being linked to others despite playing one striker

 2nd December 2018

FM 2019 has managed to earn my approval, after 100 hours of playtime. At first the training sessions did not make sense, but as time moved on I realised its great benefits to my squad, allowing me more control over how my youngsters develop.

The last couple of years have seen lots of changes that did not really seem to change the way the game was played. New staff roles, scouting changes - all of it seemingly just in the way. This year they have fleshed a lot of these features out more, and they feel more substantial than when they were introduced.

FM19 is not content with merely tying up loose ends from previous editions! It introduces completely new modules for tactics and training. These are brilliant. Especially the training module, which moves the entire FM experience more towards realism and makes it much more transparent in terms of understanding how it impacts individuals and the team. It is a bit overwhelming, though. Fortunately, an assistant manager can competently lead training for you.

The shake-up in the tactics module also attempts to make this component more legible and logical. It has come a long way since the sliders of yesteryear. Now we can control how our team reacts on and off the ball with much more granularity, which should help players who have not played the game for 1.000 hours already. It also offers a bunch of premade tactical systems that playes can choose as a starting point for their team.

To preface, I had so much fun with it during the beta, everything was relatively perfect (bar some minor bugs with interactions, but given the complexities and frequency of interactions thats acceptable to me).

And of course, patch 19.1 comes out and the game turns to literal shit. It is now impossible to score goals using strikers, or by creating chances from open play in general. Strikers miss sitters, corners are more likely to score than one on ones, defending is out of your control as your players will all swarm the ball no matter what you tell them to do, and goalkeepers are way too overpowered (will literally save every one on one or shot in the box).

Honestly a shame, because everything not gameplay related is great and the training changes are excellent, but there is literally no use to having better training if when my players become world class strikers, they cannot score and instead go on 15 hour goal droughts.

Before anyone says I havent tried different tactics, trust me I have - I've tried everything, 3 at the back, 4 at the back, 5 at the back, defensive mids, pressing, tiki taka, etc and none of it fixes anything. Just get a 6'7"" cb and youll win games from corners, but thats not a fun or rewarding way to play.

Give up on tactics, they make no difference anymore

Players are contantly injured, an unrealistic amount

Your team will have 15-20 shots on target and might score one goal, your weak opponent will have 2-3 shots and will beat you with 2-3 goals - Seriously, test it with an editor, give yourself the greatest striker and goalie in the world and watch yourself lose and score no goals.

The bugs that have been occuring for me are:
Pausing in middle of matches for several seconds, occurs a few times.
At the end of a match sometimes I get a 'players are warming up' message pop up and I am unable to continue resulting in me restarting my game, tried a few things trying to fix it however it doesn't work.

On the scripting side of things I am suspicous of it being a scripted result as my players on some occasions stand still with the ball cluelessly like their soul as left their body and just lose the ball, thus resulting to the opposition getting a chance on goal or majority of the time conceding a goal.

VAR in my opinion is over-used and needs fixing as it gets very annoying after a while.

The depth is ridiculous but my main issue is that nothing really seems to matter when it comes to match days. I decided to manage chelsea.  I made some good trades bringing on john stones and some lesser known players.  My tactics were well known by the players.  Somehow in my preseason matches i dropped four of six matches to MLS teams including a 4-2 loss to New England who absolutely sucks this year.  I would lose matches despite a 26 to 6 shots on goal differential with about half being on target.

Skip to community shield.  Holy hell....four main players missing from Man City's roster including debruyne and their starting goalier and somehow i still lose 2-1.  I dont know wtf is going on with  whatever engine decides who wins and who loses but the stats are absolutely insane.  I doubled every offensive stat for man city yet still lost.

This to me is a huge issue.  While I never expect to win every match, I think when 4 of your starters are out, you should maybe expect a win.  And you never think a top 3 team in the prem is going to get run by Philadelphia and New York.  

My suggestion is buy the editor and just stack your fucking team.  Whatever little engine that decides winners and losers is fucked.  These matches make no sense but ALWAYS lean towards the side you are playing.  Its kinda fucking ridiculous.

I've got 151 hours in game, minus the times when I left the comp to do other stuff and I'd say 35 is about fair.  That is utterly ridiculous.  You spend so much time watching the dates scroll by, the movement of time is interrupted by so many faffy little messages.  I can't sit down and play this, I need something on in the background or it's just a bloody slog.
The gameplay is actually better, I love the way training is done and I love the tactical depth.  Transfer negotions feel like they have a little more push and pull too, but there's still a lot of really daft demands and people always wanting yearly raises.  The graphics are decent, there's a good variety in what you see and the stadiums aren't too bad either.
I don't know if i can complain with 151hrs in the game, but at the same time, there's a lot lacking.  My main bug is that big teams always hammer me, but the rest is competitive.  That's just not realistic.
This is the best FM has ever been, but it is just far too slow.  And no, I don't want FM Touch, because there's hardly any game there.  On a top end gaming laptop like mine this should be much faster.
So I'm deleting this, I don't want a game that takes 35hrs to run a season, I don't want to have to have a tv show on that I am only half paying attention to because the game I'm playing is so slow.

I'm not going to say it's a bad game, there's a lot of good in this, but man, you need so much spare time to get through it.",1541875425,1541875425,False,19,4,0.538358330726623535,0,True,False,False

Major problems with injuries. I manage 2 teams and both teams have had 4-5 players out 3-4 months and 2 players each out for the season. 

Major problems with match engine - On both teams in my 4 months of management i have scored 10+ own goals against myself and had 5-6 scored for me by the opposition. Which is just as well because your stricker no matter how good they are will miss every single one on one or blaze miles over no matter what the stats. You will also at least once a month have one of your players on the 3d engine pull off a great tackle taking the ball. Get a foul against them have the commentary Say ""that didnt look like a foul"" then be sent off for ""a dangerous two footed challenge"" Constantly happens. 

Same issues as previous years teams 2 divisions below you in a cup will have 40 shots against them 30 on  target but you wont see 4 highlights all game and lose 1-0 although this time that goal will 100% be an own goal as per the other issue which makes it even more frustrating.

I haven't had that famous turn in performance yet, but my hope and expectation right now is that the information screens I see will also give me ways to turn things around, which I felt really was missing in the last version I gave a good try (v2015 I think).

Stupid AI trading logic makes Serie A boring and dumb. Serie A team would never buy famours players even with billion dollars in the pocket, the only thing they knew is loan. I start with Milan, in my 2nd season, Juv had sell Rugani, Costa, Cancelo, De Scigilio and only loaned pauliniho. Now Juv only have 17 players in first squad. 
In my beta version game, same situation. 4th seasons, Inter had sale all the players that worth higher than 30M, but did not buy any famous players, Juv had sale every famous players except Ronaldo. Serie A became extremely boring and that's why I start a new game. But the same thing happens.
This is ridiculors, and it is discrimination to the Serie A teams. DON'T YOU EVER NOTICE the investment of Serie A teams for these years???

Seriously, I would never suggest any Serie A fans buy this game unless they take corrective actions.

Atleast in the 2D part I'm seeing better saves from keepers, better longshots and individuel actions that even once turned into a goal and not into a shot 50 meters wide like everytime in fm18.

Tactics seem to be followed better and changing tacktics really changes how your team plays even if you have the same formation. This could be because for the beta I'm playing as Ajax and with pretty good players it has that effect, can't say if it does for worse teams.

The rest of the game just feels much of the same, training is nice for those who want to go really deep into it, but for now it feels like a part of the game that I really don't want to put 10 hours in, just so the game can tell me I did it all wrong and so have wasted months of players training. So I just keep it on automatic.
There are alot of smaller changes that really make it alot better to play, like the scouting reports, giving contracts to players that don't demand anything (you can get advise on what a good first draft can look like), the game running a bit better, etc. etc. 

Right now it just feels better than fm18 and that is great seeing as I will play this game alot in the coming year. So even the smaller changes make me really happy that they made them. 

Look, it's not a totaly new game and the graphics are not like fifa or PES, but it did make alot of cool little changes and even a few important ones that make this game feel alot better than fm18. So if you liked that one, you will like this one even better.........but who cares? because you already bought it and are playing it for 500 hours or you don't care and just want to hate on it because it has not so great graphics.

Ow and all this is just me playing for a few hours, so things might changes and if they do I will update this............maybe, if I feel like I care enough.

For now, have a nice day.

Edit #1

After playing a bit more here are the other things I have noticed:

not only are the longshots done alot better this year, you can also now score more than in a blue moon from corners and indirect freekicks.

A thing I have to see how it will develop are the injuries. Right now I feel like they ramped them up, but could be just bad luck. If they are ramped up it could be because they are factoring in your players being tired alot more. in FM18 you really did not care about a player being at high risk of injury, but it could be in FM19 you really have to keep an eye on that.
Although it would be nice if you would not get a message after every game that some players are tired........Yes I get it and I will rotate them next game, please stop bugging me to talk with my players about it because they will just get mad at me for it.......

that was it for now, maybe will be back later. (ow, I allowed comments, did not know those are disabled if you do not check the box, so if you feel I got something wrong or right, let me know)

Edit #2 (last edit)

These are my last thoughts about the game:

I did not get any gamebreaking or really bad bugs, just a few weird things with the stats, but I don't care that much about those and those are already fixed with the full release or are easy enough to fix later.

Like I said in the last edit, you really have to look at the injury risk in this game. If injury risk is high than it's better to give that player a rest next game or you really have a high chance of getting a injury of a few weeks atleast, but I find this to be more realistic than it was the other years. Now players will get tired if they have to play 2 matches in one week and the injury risk is a real thing you have to look at, not something that did not matter and did nothing.

So yeah, in my eyes this is one of the best if not the best FM game in years.

The new tactical system is brilliant . Now it feels more than ever that you can watch the game and make intuitive tactical changes easily on the fly to counter your opposition.

I love how this game isn't just about the numbers anymore and how man management can transform your players for better or worse in realistic ways. 

In fact all the small things can change what happens on the pitch.... training, media handling, mentoring groups, friendship groups, languages, transfer pressure etc. there's so much depth to this series now!

It feels much better and the response to the things you do seems to make more sense and feel less like a robotic time wasting exercise in doing stuff just because you know it's better if you do despite the mind numbing tedium. In summary, bearing in mind the crap we've been putting up with this last decade or so with this lot, this is definitely a step in the right direction. I think they knew the writing was on the wall and have tried to improve things and listen to their customers rather then take them for granted, so applause for that, but there's still work to be done.

Remember every bug in the game play? Crosses, One v ones always missing, needing to create 30 chances to score 2 goals while the cpu beats you 3-2 with two shots total? - Yeah well all of that nonsense is still there as it always has been. The engine still needs a tear down and rebuild, but they clearly don't have the balls or the will to do so. Niftier graphical representations of action are not going to solve this. It's time to evolve lads and consign this engine to history imo. You've polished this turd to a shiny gleam, it will not polish much further methinks.

Apparentlhy the injuries were sorted for release. I'm a (game time) month in and i've had ten, TEN! 2.5 a week! We haven't played a competitive game yet, my training intensity is low, and i've been giving the players 45-60 minute run outs. It's bloody bonkers! If this is the injury issue fixed, then you need to look again. 

All in all, at first glance it feels like we're getting there, but i feel like it's just better stuff bolted onto the same old problems tbh, and when i've had a decent amount of time to assess what's what, i'll probably end up hating myself for being such an idiot again and giving my cash to people who probably don't deserve it all things considered. Right now though, i like most of what i see.

What these lot need is some decent competition to give them a proper kick up the arse, but i don't see that happening any time soon tbh. If like me you've been bitterly dissapointed with pretty much every release in the last decade or so, then probably you'll see past the gloss, however, that said, this feels like a much better effort and whilst it won't make up for feeling fleeced by these people over the last decade or more, it's certainly now approaching the game it needs to be.

And the alternative skins that come with it? They haven't even taken the time to make sure the text is properly coloured to pop against the background. I, could literally have done a better job at designing the colour schemes of their user interface. Am I some sort of genius who can do anything? No, I just realise that SHOCK purple is a bad idea to fill your screen with and that the colour of your font should be markedly DIFFERENT than the backgrond!

This really speaks to the level of, or rather lack of level of effort.

The interface itself is worse this year. Less intuitive. Less response. Missclicks are the order of the day for tasks you will repeat countless of times.

I bought 2018. Didn't play more than 10 hours or so before going back to 2017. The UI was shit. I got 2019 because I guess I'm an idiot fanboi. And I'm already back to 2017 because the UI is even worse this year.

At what point are you people going to fire whoevers in charge of UI and hire someone with ANY relevant skillset?

The rest of the game is probably fine. I mean it's not as if they change much or need to change much. The match engine looked a bit better than 2018 (did they get a new colour guy? Oh god 2018 had colour issues! it's not perfect this year but it's better at least).

I have probably played this series since FM 07, so not a newbie to the game overall. Also note this review as yet, is for the initial beta release (though gameplay doesn't change through editions, so don't expect it would change for beta-final).

1. New Features -
Tactics and training has been overhauled. Overall this ""looks"" to be a really nice addition. Increase in level of detailing is a nice step too.

2. Tutorials -
Having played every release of this series for over a decade, turned off initial induction module. The new feature induction on the other hand, was pretty annoying. For the polish and overall UX the game gives, this seems very very badly under-designed. Too much text, No way to go back to read again, doesn't sound like great idea. Just play a video reel if navigation is too difficult to code.

3. Match Engine -
Maybe its my tactics or maybe something else. But actual game play is ridiculous. I have had GK miss balls they should be catching in their sleep. Even with high intensity tactics, players would rather die than get into tackles. Track back at corners is ridiculous. In short absolutely no improvement over last year, except perhaps a bit smoother gameplay. 

[UPDATE] : Injuries are frustrating. Even with average workload, I keep on having at least 2-3 injuries per game.


While I completely understand that it might be difficult to add value on every iteration, SI really needs to revamp its match engine which till FM 12-13 was its major asset. If you can't add value to the game there's no need for yearly full releases. Just sell newer databases. UI/UX is always pleasing change, but to be honest its overhyped for it to be the biggest selling point.

As someone who was not planning on purchasing the game this year once I saw the revamp to training and the tactics system I was happy to give it a try. It adds so much more depth to the game and you feel like you actually have more influence over the team. 

It would be helpful though to start with the option to use the tactic closest to what is used in real life. As someone not adept with knowing what tactics many teams use in real life when I begin as manager I'm asked to set up a tactic. I have selected some then realised that it doesn't suit the players I have so I have to scrap it and try something else. A default option for each team would be handy for less experienced users. 

The medical center needs to monitor minutes played NOT games played. Telling me a player has played 4 games in the past 2 weeks isn't helpful when I know that I have only used the player as a sub for 10 minutes in each of those games. And saying that this player is at an increased injury risk because of this tells me there is some seriously flawed programming. Switch it to minutes played so I can better monitor game time for my players. How this hasen't happened years ago baffles me. 

The ball physics are improved and some nice skills with the ball are added for the players. The highlights are slightly more interesting to watch...though I am sick of still seeing players kicking the ball into the back of players infront of them as if they didn't notice they were there. Sometimes the players act as though they are stuck in mud, a missed penalty that is blocked straight back at the penalty taker and they do not move, there needs to be that reflex action, this happens in other areas too. 
I would have liked to see the press confrences improved as they're just as boring as ever and I'll skip them every time, though they have added more visible response by players. The few that I have taken has left me puzzled by some of the player reactions and even less inclined to ever answer a question. 
I would love to see more interaction with players available, as a manager I would like to be able to talk to players differently based on their personality. Everyone is different and can't always be treated the same, having the option to encourage a player to improve in training without having to first tell them that you're unhappy with their training would be useful as there are too many negative responses when criticising training. 

The social feed is an absolute waste of space, immediately turned off. I don not want or need fake social media in any game I play. How does fake twitter users tweets help in any way? It doesn't add anything to the game except the hassle of turning it all off. Time wasted that should have been used improving other areas, though it seems the same as last year so no wasted time this year really.

Will come back when I am more into the game but so far I have not regretted my purchase.

Wow! This match engline is the best I have ever seen, players riding challenges and dribbling on through, more intelligent movement off the ball, box to box midfielders that are good at it being all over the pitch but getting tired as they should after putting a shift in. 

The passing at times is a joy to watch even with my moderate passing ability Aston Villa team, nice one twos, balls played into space down the channels, little balls being played backwards into space for an oncoming runner. really impressed so far, I am watching game highlights on comprehensive and im actually tempted to watch full matches because its been that good to watch.

Example: 0-0 at half time in pre-season friendly in a game we are expected to win - we've played ok first half but looking a bit shot shy up front and a bit laborous in the build up.  I tell them at half-time to keep going and the win will come. Instruct the strikers to take the game by the scruff of the neck and make the difference. Ask for a quicker tempo and a more attacking mindset. Ask my best winger to up his game and start  getting in more crosses.  Tell the full backs to push on and support the wingers.  I kid you not - everything I asked for was apparent in the 2nd half - crosses start flying in - 2 goals from my strikers - my best winger much improved.  I shout from the touchline a few times to praise the team - and they seem to up their game with the added encouragement.  Last 15 mins we start to tire and the opposition start to get more of the ball - we are too open now so i stick on a DM and tell them to keep it simple, mark tightly and see the game out.  We win 2-0 and I praise them to the hilt for a great 2nd half.  This isn't just a one off, but it's the best example I can give of you actually feeling like you are making a difference.  I have never felt this in an FM game previously.

I'm in no way a fan-boi and have slated FM somewhat in the past for some piss-poor attempts.  This year though, things are looking very promising.  Training too - oh my lord - it's what I've been looking for for ages, a joy to micro-manage if that's what you want.  Sending your players on team bonding days and for community outreach sessions to build morale etc - superb stuff. Also, the 3D match, while not making huge strides forward, certainly feels far more polished.

If you are in any doubt about purchasing this year, as I was, I can wholeheartedly say that you are safe to take the plunge.  While it may not be perfect - it is certainly far closer to it than ever before.

I can say that this year's game is one of the best improvements from the prior year's version.    Outside of all of the new features the game runs much smoother overall.    

If I had to pick out one new feature that adds to the game I would say the training system.   I really enjoy setting up training as a team and for each player.  The system makes sense and allows you to add some variety to specialize as needed.      It is still too early to tell as to how may training choices will work out,  but I feel more involved then ever before with the system.

FM19 keeps the ""futuristic"" complicated interface that makes it hard to see the simple stuff, but improved it massively. It solved most of the issues I had with FM18 - like the fact that compared to FM17, you had to go to a separate menu for opposition instructions rather than being the first thing you see before a game. They fixed that and I am so happy! 

The 3d match engine is WAY better. Regen faces seem better, but you will still need to install a mod pack to fix them and make them actually good. 

What I love is the new tactics system - it will actually create a tactic for you based on a preferred playstyle.

The training system is so much more complicated, which means it will work better than previous version once you completely understand it.

Also, FM19 beta seems to work quicker than FM18 full version(less lag - playing on a high-end computer, btw. No need to play down my specs and say that's why FM18 was lagging - it was not, unless an 8th gen 8086k paired with a 1080Ti and 32GB of Ram are not enough for it.)

For now, I like it better than FM18, but still prefer my simplistic FM17 save. Great buy tho! 
PS: Remember it's still beta. It will improve massively over time.",1539967052,1539967052,True,4,0,0.487102359533309937,0,True,False,False

By far the best version of the game I have played in ages. The immersion level is immense, The UI is way better than FM18. The game smoothly on my 8 year old Windows machine and my 2014 model Macbook. The tactical creator has been revamped with visual indicators that actually tell you why there is a big gap between attack and defence. The tactical presets help the noob player + the veteran player who understands the Team Instructions is just gonna pick it and race ahead.  New set piece instructions. The match engine is an improvement over FM18, though i still think there are some improvements that can be made. Eden Hazard plays like Eden Hazard in real life.


Training is very immersive, with more control. Tactics and training are linked, you can actually see the style of play work.Scouting what a change, more helpful scouting centre. And lets not forget the small little QOL changes in the view, like tab reordering and separators for custom views. 

Negatives: Collision physics not in the game, which is disappoininting was hoping it would make it. The graphics engine looks good, animations still need a bit of work, some iffy animations that can be improved. 

Where FM18 was 5/10 for me, FM19 is a heavy 8/10. I would definitely recommend this game to any diehard FM fan. If you want great graphics, play FIFA. If you want an immersive all action game that makes you feel like a manager on the sidelines, FM19 is the best version to date",1539956077,1539956077,True,4,1,0.546351075172424316,0,True,False,False

Pre orderd and started right away from day one (beta).  Played 4.5 hrs and would probably continue but it was too late. Let me say this is by far the best experience in recent years. Tactics really matter and are wonderfully done. What I like is that is actually visible in 3d match. Training is maybe most refreshing cause it 's onteresting and you can tailor it as you wish. Change it when you want, just many options. 
Oh lets not forget UI is best default ever. Larger fonts for clubs and changing colors in general look very transparent ... good choice SI.

All in all 9.5/10.

Highly recommend!",1539931657,1539931657,True,4,0,0.527128040790557861,0,True,False,False
