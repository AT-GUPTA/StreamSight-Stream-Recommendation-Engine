Story-wise, I recommend researching Black Ops lore before playing or playing previous Black Ops games for the full experience otherwise you'll find yourself quite confused in some dialogues. Overall, you'll be treated to a bunch of hallucinations similar to BO1 and Cold War, which will become increasingly vague towards the end of the journey. It's not quite the same writing style as previous BOs, so you'll have a pretty new experience. Btw the loadout are really flexible with new techs, but I still prefer the guns in BO2.

BO3 was one of the best zombies experiences to date. It was so good that at I purchased it on Playstation & PC. Custom Zombies used to be so fun to play with friends on creative community made maps or even the Treyarch DLCs were really good but with the recent influx of cheaters able to grab PRIVATE Information and execute scripts on other Players Computers. This game, imo was the greatest zombies game to date and provided unlimited value with the map developers putting in work for the community has been ruined my hackers/cheaters whatever you want to call them running rampant and treyarch/activision don't care. DO NOT BUY. Anyone recommending the game in the condition it currently is in is no one you should trust. There are multiple videos online explaining the current situation from known youtubers in the space if you are more curious but otherwise buying this game is just a MAJOR RISK that is not worth to play some zombies. I am sorry if you missed out on the time when this game was secure as it is still the best zombies game in my heart but I can not in the right mind recommend this game.

TL;DR

Game ruined by cheaters/hackers as they can grab PRIVATE Information (such as IP) & execute harmful scripts on computer.
DO NOT BUY! IT IS NOT WORTH THE RISK & IN THE STATE THE GAME IS IN. IT SHOULD BE PULLED FROM THE STORE AS IT IS BASICALLY UNPLAYABLE.

EDIT:
The Developers seem to have patched the RCE Exploit but at the cost of tanking A LOT of performance. My best guess they did a ""duct tape"" type solution solving one issue but creating tons of others which are albeit minor but they do add up. Game is playable at this point which is great for the zombies community but be prepared for performance issues in menus but I would still not play multiplayer as it is still riddled with cheaters that can do all types of things to you and only allow people that you know into your lobby.",1664600933,1708898741,True,0,0,0.660136997699737549,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER, there are RCE's (Remote Command Executions) that can be ran in multiplayer mode to run RAT's (Remote Access Trojans). There's a 3rd party patch for zombies from Serious that at least makes zombies safe. Regular multiplayer is not safe to play so play at your own risk. This game should not be sold until Activation / Treyarch fixes these exploits. There are multiple security issues (RCE's) since the last game patch in early 2023. If you do play MP I would recommend playing in a virtual desktop, however that's not very practical.

Call of Duty I believe is a dying franchise, but what I can respect is the game it put out in 2015. Yes, the campaign is not super good, but everything else is just perfect. Multiplayer is fun as hell and my personal favorite exo COD to date. I enjoyed the seemingly endless amount of weapons that were added during this game's lifecycle. Yes, the supply drop system is dated and pretty trash, but it was fun for a little bit. 

However, the real meat and potatoes of this game to me in my opinion is zombies (I am very bias to zombies). Zombies is one of the first things I ever really nerded out at. Every video online I've watched. Every secret and easter egg I've seen. The lore I can recite like its the back of my hand. So imagine my surprise when one of the most unique storylines I have ever seen came to a close. BO3 zombies is without a doubt one of my favorite times of my life. The maps were amazing. The story was amazing. It was so amazing that they even remastered eight classic fan favorite maps two years after this game had come out. The dedication the team at Treyarch had for zombies really showed and it was a time to be alive. The Z House. The ending. Zombie Chronicles. Man, good times. Time really does fly. 

This is a very bias review for one of my favorite games in my entire life, mostly just for my favorite gamemode in all of gaming. I won't ever forget the excitement and fun I had/have still playing this game to this day. When I built my PC thanks to the help from my friends in 2023, one of my first purchases was BO3 AGAIN. The custom zombies maps had always been a dream of mine to play and let me tell you it is just fantastic what people can come up with when given the materials to create. That alone is a selling point for me. Endless fun even when the game is done. Yes, this is a love letter to this game, but I hope this love letter finds the right person when considering buying an older COD title. If you are to buy any, buy this one. Do yourself a favor and play zombies, especially custom zombies. You will not be disappointed.",1708582675,1708582675,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Developed by Treyarch, this installment in the iconic franchise offers a compelling blend of campaign, multiplayer, and zombies mode, each delivering its own unique experience. Let's delve into every aspect of this action-packed title.

Campaign:
The campaign in Black Ops III takes players on a mind-bending journey through a dystopian future, where mega-corporations wield immense power and augmented soldiers fight for survival. The narrative is complex, weaving together themes of technology, identity, and morality. While the story can be convoluted at times, the stunning visuals, adrenaline-pumping set pieces, and memorable characters keep players engaged from start to finish.

One of the standout features of the campaign is the introduction of cybernetic enhancements, which grant players new abilities such as enhanced strength, speed, and hacking capabilities. These abilities add a layer of depth to the gameplay, allowing for creative approaches to combat and traversal.

Multiplayer:
Black Ops III's multiplayer is where the game truly shines, offering fast-paced action, diverse maps, and a wide array of customizable loadouts. The movement system has been revamped, introducing advanced mobility mechanics such as wall-running and thrust jumping, which add a vertical dimension to the gameplay. While some purists may lament the departure from traditional boots-on-the-ground combat, the new movement mechanics inject a sense of fluidity and dynamism into matches.

The multiplayer suite features a variety of game modes, including classics like Team Deathmatch and Domination, as well as new additions like the objective-based War mode. Additionally, the Pick 10 system allows players to fully customize their loadouts, selecting weapons, attachments, perks, and scorestreaks to suit their playstyle.

Zombies Mode:
Zombies mode makes a triumphant return in Black Ops III, offering a thrilling co-op experience filled with hordes of the undead, elaborate Easter eggs, and challenging boss fights. Set in a variety of imaginative locales, from a medieval castle to a futuristic cityscape, each map presents unique challenges and secrets to uncover.

The mode features a progression system that rewards players with new weapons, perks, and cosmetic items as they survive wave after wave of zombies. With its blend of survival horror and arcade-style action, Zombies mode provides endless replayability and cooperative fun for players of all skill levels.

Graphics and Sound:
Visually, Black Ops III impresses with its detailed environments, realistic character models, and stunning visual effects. From the neon-lit streets of Singapore to the war-torn landscapes of Ethiopia, each location is brought to life with impressive attention to detail. The sound design further enhances the immersion, with powerful weapon sounds, atmospheric music, and dynamic voice acting adding to the intensity of the experience.

Conclusion:
Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a tour de force in futuristic warfare, offering a compelling campaign, exhilarating multiplayer, and addictive zombies mode. While the campaign's narrative may be ambitious and occasionally convoluted, the gameplay more than makes up for any shortcomings with its tight controls, diverse customization options, and adrenaline-fueled action. Whether you're a fan of single-player storytelling, competitive multiplayer, or cooperative zombie slaying, Black Ops III has something to offer for everyone. It's a testament to Treyarch's skill and creativity, cementing its place as one of the standout entries in the Call of Duty franchise.",1708495857,1708495857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Custom maps, imaginative weapons, and inventive game modes transform the Zombies experience into an ever-evolving adventure.

The modding community's dedication and creativity shine through, offering a diverse range of player-generated content that caters to every taste.

The depth and variety of user-created content enhance the replayability, ensuring that no two encounters with the undead are ever the same.

The thriving modding community not only extends the game's lifespan but also fosters a sense of community among players. Sharing and experiencing custom content with fellow enthusiasts elevate the overall enjoyment and sense of camaraderie within the Call of Duty community.

Beyond Zombies, Black Ops 3's multiplayer component delivers fast-paced, strategic engagements that cater to both casual and competitive players. The diverse selection of maps, well-balanced weaponry, and the introduction of Specialist characters add layers of depth and excitement to the multiplayer experience.

In conclusion, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 isn't just a game; it's an immersive journey enriched by a dedicated modding community.

I always wondered why I was never able to remember the story of this game, but now I do. The start is BORING as hell, but when the main antagonist reveals himself, the story gets good but really surreal. It's very weird, but I love that they tried to do something new with the series!!!
I haven't started with Zombies yet because the campaign is a bigger grind than I thought but eh. Just more playtime to distract me from being bored!!!

Recommendation for the campaign if you're going for 100% it as well: Start playing Realistic from the beginning and play as safe and slow as you can since you literally get one shot and only use the Drakon with a Thermal Sight + Suppressor to stay hidden while seeing the enemy incredibly easily!

And as always when I write a review for COD games [spoiler]FIX YOUR DAMN PRICES FOR COD GAMES. IT'S STUPID THAT I HAD TO PAY 40€ (deluxe edition on discount) FOR A POORLY PROGRAMMED GAME WITH MAJOR SAFETY RISKS FROM 2015!!!!!!!

Ok so Black Ops 3 is a game I wasn't really sure how to feel about it when I played it back in 2015. I liked the game but truth is the only futuristic Call Of Duty game I actually really enjoyed genuinly was Call Of Duty black ops 2. It was a way better game and honestly It just felt like Call Of Duty but it wasn't overly futuristic either. Truth is never minded Call Of Duty going futuristic it is just kinda meh for me. I enjoyed Advanced Warfare but I was never really the biggest fan of Black Ops 3 it was ok, It was decent I can recommend it as a fan of the Black Ops series, but I certainly will say we will never get a game again like Black Ops 2 that game was fucking magical.

First off, $60 is crazy for a game that came out 9 years ago, and it's not even a good game. I'll admit it, zombies was pretty fun, or at least the chronicles dlc was since they make you pay for the dang maps which isn't the biggest deal, but I just wanted to throw that in there. I did however enjoy the custom zombies map feature so bonus points for that. I didn't play much of the multiplayer but I've heard is hacked as flip (idk what the policy on cursing is), and apparently there's like a 90% chance your IP will be found so that's no bueno. As for the campaign, confusing and BORING!! This might just be me so take this with a grain of salt, but still. I would say it was because I played this when I was 14, but I played the Black Ops 1 and 2 campaigns and I was able to enjoy those and I could follow the story the whole way through and Black Ops 2 is one of my favorite games ever just for its campaign, however every single time I went to play the Bo3 campaign, I felt like I was gonna fall asleep. I didn't even finish it and I'll tell you why that is. First off, I just did't care that much so I stopped playing it for a while. That was like a few years ago. The other day, I decided to continue the campaign, went to load up the game, nothing. I tried everything. Verifying game files, running as admin, compatibility mode, running steam as admin, uninstalling the game, clearing the entire Bo3 folder from my pc, nothing has worked. Maybe I'm missing something but I think I know the issue. I have bought 14 cods, 5 gave me issues like this. What do all 5 of those have in common? They're all for PC. In total, I have 8 cods on PC, and 6 cods on Xbox (360 and One/Series X/S) none of which have given me problems. Out of the 3 PC games that haven't given me issues, 2 I've only played once so who's to say if I tried to open one of them rn, and the other one is Cod 2003 which is for PC only so it would be weird if it didn't even work for the system it was made for, but it is cod so... This could just be my computer, but lemme tell you why I think it's not. First off, I don't have issues like this with any of my other games, and if I do, it's something I'm able to fix easily. The other reason is cuz I've heard that cods are not very PC friendly games. Wish I'd known that before I spent about, and I kid you not, 5 HUNDRED dollars on games that would eventually not work. If your curious, this nonsense caused me to have to wipe my save file when I was on the last mission of one of these games making me have to redo like 5 hours of gameplay at least on a game that wasn't even that good, and making 3 games unplayable, including this game, and Bo2. I wouldn't be too mad about this since it's not the best game if A: I'd already finished the campaign, and B: if it didn't cost me $60. To get us back on track, If you're thinking about buying this game, it's not the worst game out there, but personally, I wouldn't recommend it, especially if this is your first cod since there are way better ones. If that's the case, I'd recommend starting with an older game like Modern Warfare ORIGINAL because the campaign starts off with a tutorial showing you some basic mechanics which is helpful. If you've played Cods before, but this is your first Black Ops, I'd recommend starting with Black Ops 2010 and working your way up to Bo3 from there if you really want to. If you do decide you want to play Bo3, don't get it on steam.

This feels like the definitive Zombie's experience, however multiplayer and campaign fall short. Didn't like the campaign, and multiplayer when it came out ... Still don't however at times I was finding it ... ""amusing."" The main selling point for me was the Steam Workshop support, and the modding community did not disappoint. If you and three friends pick up the Zombie's Chronicles Edition on sale then I would highly recommend going crazy with all the modded maps.

Pros:
-The zombies maps are creative and pretty and fun
-The multiplayer maps are pretty good
-The guns are punchy and feel good
-The ""time to kill"" an enemy is about right. I hate that so many modern games feel like I'm shooting a weak squirt gun.
-There just isn't a game like Call of Duty. People can call it stale, but there aren't games that have that feel. I don't want a Battle Royale or massive maps or 64v64 battles or vehicles or lasers or super powers or any of this ""bigger, better, badder"" type nonsense. I like my nice and tight Call of Duty formula.
-Even if they are very few, there are real people playing. They are not bots. There are real people.

Cons:
-Even on sale, expensive for what it is
-There should be more maps, especially classic maps. They marketed ""Zombie Chronicles"" like you were getting a ton of old gems. Not really. You get some, but there are many missing that will die off never to be seen again. The map I miss the most is ""Five""
-Multiplayer can't be played as of me writing this. I can see it says there are people online, but it says there are 0 matches. -You have to download a thing called BOIII client to play multiplayer. Multiplayer does work there, but you're stuck playing with the same small group of people over and over, and I'm pretty sure they're cheating. 72 kills and 3 deaths in Team Deathmatch? ADSing around a corner where you can't see me and obliterating my face the moment I pop up? Come on.
-I do not like that in multiplayer, some of the player models are robots. Shooting robots is not fun.
-In multiplayer, the players have jetpacks or something all the time. It makes players jump super high constantly. It's not a hack or a mod. It's part of the ""futuristic"" feel. I hate it. I want more grittiness and less futuristic nonsense. Same reason I hate shooting robots.
-I'm not sure if this game has multiplayer perks like older CoD games. What it does have is various heroes you can choose from who have different abilities. I hate that. Just give me the old CoD formula that made Blops1 and MW2 and MW3 so great.
-People tend to say that multiplayer is dead and zombies is the only thing keeping the game going. I don't even know if zombies is keeping the game going. There are very few players. I go on and see like 5 people playing zombies at any given moment.
-There is some kind of dangerous hacking thing going on. I don't know how real that is. I play through a VPN and scan my computer often. Supposedly, the danger is that a hacker could get your IP address and/or your steam username and mess around with your computer. And the developers refuse to close this vulnerability despite selling the game still.

I am currently attempting a refund. The biggest reason is that I want a multiplayer/co-op game and there just doesn't seem to be enough players for that despite the Steam charts showing that there are a lot of players.",1708065523,1708066055,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have originally brought the game as a treat for myself because of the incredible examination results from my college sessions last half term

[h2] Thoughts on the game:[/h2]
The game wasn't able to load the main background until a few minutes later from the initial installation, but all the DLC's and pack(s) have been applied to the game no problem.

And finally, the game seem to be great so far from start to end.

Stack-based buffer overflow in Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 before 2018-04-26 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets.

CVE-2018-20817
SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request. This affects Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 1, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.
Bo3 is also included as it does not protect you from any security breaches.
For anyone who isn't experienced with this kind of thing, RAT stands for ""Remote Access Trojan"".

The maps they remade from past games are shockingly well made and faithful to their original counterparts (although with some weird minor visual changes).

I got the game along with Zombies Chronicles for about 28 bucks and it's probably the best dollar-to-hour ratio I've ever had. I originally thought the Gobble Gum system would be intrusive and ruin the experience but a few of the effects that aren't busted are actually kind of fun and helpful to have.

Don't let the game's file size requirement deter you from installing the game too as you have the option to completely leave out Campaign and Multiplayer, leaving you with only zombies installed. Doing this halves the file size required to install and it's pretty great!

If you're on the fence about buying this game and you're an old zombies player or want to try something new (especially with friends), I'd say it's a must-buy when it goes on sale.

Zombies is Kino. An excellent game mode, the only reason to get the game. Shadows of Evil is an excellent map, with loads of cool mechanics and design. The DLC maps are mostly good and have a lot of interesting stuff, and some of the easter eggs are fun and challenging, but not as comfy as the classic World at War and Black Ops maps; given they are remastered though, this is the best zombies game now.

INFORMATION FOR THE BUYER IN 2024:
Boot the vanilla version once, then get a community client and NEVER boot up vanilla ever again, reasons being multiple security exploits endangering your entire PC, worse performance and a lack of players in MP.

Immediately lock your fps to 60, regardless of version. Otherwise, your FPS will fluctuate rapidly, certain parts of maps break and game just runs worse for whatever reason.

Also, only buy the base game AND at a discount, you can get the DLCs online for free, Acti doesn't deserve more money than needed.",1707003049,1707003049,True,192,2,0.933136582374572754,28,True,False,False

The multiplayer is pretty decent with some fun guns to use, and a new iteration of hijacked and nuke town.

Have you ever dreamt of a game where you can seamlessly transition from a [b]stealthy sniper mission[/b] to accidentally pirouetting through a hail of bullets? Look no further than [b]Call of Duty: Black Ops 3[/b] – the unexpected masterpiece that turned my virtual soldier into [b]Bob, the Accidental Ballet Dancer[/b].

[b]Pros:[/b]

[b]Immersive Storytelling:[/b] I never thought a game about military ops could make me question the meaning of life, but here I am, pondering the universe between headshots.

[b]Character Customization:[/b] Forget bland soldiers; meet my custom character, [b]Sir Prance-a-Lot[/b]. He's here to waltz through war zones with style.

[b]Zombie Mode Extravaganza:[/b] Because nothing says survival like dodging undead creatures while executing a perfect cha-cha slide. Bonus points for including dance-offs with the undead.

[b]Cons:[/b]

[b]Physics Gone Wild:[/b] I'm not sure if the developers attended a dance class or a physics lecture, but the unintentional twirls and spins my character does are worth the price of admission.

[b]AI Dance Partners:[/b] The AI comrades could use some dance lessons. Instead of covering my six, they're busy perfecting their own interpretive dances. Teamwork, right?

[b]Weaponized Confetti Missing:[/b] With all the chaos, where's the option to equip a confetti launcher? Imagine turning a firefight into a celebration of bullets and glitter. A missed opportunity.

[b]Overall,[/b] [b]Black Ops 3[/b] is a rollercoaster of emotions, from the gripping storyline to the unexpected dance recitals on the battlefield. If you've ever wanted a game that combines tactical warfare with inadvertent interpretive dance, look no further. Just don't forget your tutu and tap shoes – you're going to need them.",1673403556,1706708064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

zombies is the best zombies experience in the cod series made infinitely better with custom zombies but unfortunately due to hackers crashing your game and potentially even worse, logging on to this game alone is a security risk

there is a patch to fix this but it is unofficial and requires a lot of setting up which shouldn't have to be done in the first place but this is how old cods are treated, it is an absolute joke that activision still sells these games at full price without even maintaining to be playable

update: RCE issues have been fixed but crashing and low fps are still an issue but third party fixes will be available in the future

although the fps issue is still present, treyarch are unable to fix the issue with crashing so bummer...

with that being said, if you really wanna play this game, download the t7patch, the game is a great deal when its on sale considering you get at least 9 zombies maps + 5 extra with dlc and endless content with customs

But the other 2/3rds of it are the top of their game. Multiplayer feels more fluid than COD has ever felt before or ever has since; along with such a great assortment of weapons and class systems. Zombies is also I think literally the best version of the game mode to date. It has the most New/Old maps and custom maps, for endless possibilities. It also helps that the game's mechanics are also the most solid, in terms of movement and zombie mechanics. The only problems that plague this game are the HORRIBLE microtransactions and kind of ruined online mode, due to hackers.

UPDATE: I now have 600+ hours and well, they are deserved, every time i jump on there's new zombie maps and new content, thanks to noahj456 there's even more maps than we hoped due to his contests he's been doing. well worth the money for the game plus zombie chronicles, well worth for all the FREE zombie maps you'll be downloading, playing and even making for yourself, you get all the tools you need to create whatever you want, whenever you want.",1588022825,1706206035,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story and plot of the campaign of this game irk me greatly. It doesn't feel like a well-fleshed story with liekable characters, character development and causes to fight for. It honestly just feels like a giant showboat tactic. Graphics are above average, modeling is phenomenal, and the voice acting is not half bad. But the story could honestly have been written by a 16 year old with anger issues. The campaign feels like something somebody at activision did merely to show off their skills rather than give us an entertaining game with good gameplay. The gameplay itself I find oddly frustrating, I don't exactly know why, but it feels clunky to me.

I would add that currently, I would not suggest playing online multiplayer matches through public match. There are currently security vulnerabilities that affect multiplayer, and it allows for bad actors to gain IP addresses of players in the lobby. They can remote crash, and ruin a gameplay experience even if you aren't connected to that individual.

I bought the game on PC since I lost my PS4

Not really enjoying waiting 30 seconds every time I want to look at weapons- 

Half of the game doesn't work anymore from lack of support

No zombies players that bother to stick around

Enjoy playing solo zombies with the shittiest menu system to date
Want to customize your gun emblem on any side other than ""Left""? 
Good fucking luck- you'd have an easier time wiping a hippopotamuses ass- while it's actively trying to kill you

Insta-kill will be active, and just start blinking- and- it's already off F***-nob, get s*** on you idiot. 
You thought you had insta kill active just because we SAID it was active? 
Go F*** yourself for even thinking of having fun- *the devs say to you every time you login*

Just imagine how much ***FUN** you'll have with the NEW games :D
SO much fun and definitely not sounding you forcibly with a railroad spike- definitely not that! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ftdu8yrKOw




Zombies are fun tho.... 

But, NOT THIS ONE- triple hits are SO much worse on PC than they were on console- zombies fall through the ground- it's missing some of the best maps from BO1- genuinely a waste of time and money to buy this.

If you think I'm overreacting- one of the PAID FOR DLC ZOMBIES MAPS - is completely missing all audio for guns firing- they just forgot and never bothered to look into bug reports

This company was dying a while ago- but with the latest BS and this still being unplayable, they're pretty much dead in 2 years

Seriously, if you can buy a used PS4 with this game on it- do that instead!

CVE-2018-20817
(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request. This affects Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 1, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.)
CVE-2018-10718
(Stack-based buffer overflow in Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 before 2018-04-26 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets)

The Safehouse stutters, the Main Menu stutters and almost everything else stutters. Running Steam in Offline Mode only reduces the weight of the stutters but they are still clearly there. Multiplayer in-match drops from 60 FPS to 18 FPS and always stays at 18 - 20 FPS no matter what unless you run an Offline MP startup function and run Steam in Offline Mode. Running Steam in Offline Mode actually improves the frame rate in the Campaign in-mission. Not drastically but noticeable. No Aspect Ratio option like in the other CoDs so a 16:10 display will forcefully squish the game. 16:9 is the ONLY Aspect Ratio that this game was designed for which you can't choose to use. The Black Market (IAPs) runs at 13 FPS and the game does NOT share the same save file for the Campaign when running Steam in Offline Mode so you must torture yourself and get worse performance by playing in Online Mode.

I would highly recommend this for fans of the CoD: Zombies: franchise due to my own personal opinion inquiring that this is the best ""Zombies"" game. There is a MODS feature built in to the steam workshop API that allows for easy installation of supported mods into the game. This can be a very fun experience when in solo lobbies, or even with friends! I do think that if you were deciding to choose one zombies game, it would be this one. But, if you are a fan of multiplayer (or campaign), I however would not recommend this game as the campaign and multiplayer are mildly basic. A more intriquite review would go along this basis.

Graphics: 9/10 (Very Great especially for its era)
Gameplay: 10/10 (Very smooth and does not require much for easy running)
Fun factor: 10/10 (Very enjoyable to play solo and with friends, boredom cannot catch up with the rapid creation of mods.)
Campaign: 4/10 (Pretty basic campaign, nothing interesting.)
Multiplayer: 4/10 (Basic CoD gameplay, everything is way too futuristic.)
Overrall: Depending on the person, a zombies fan would be a 10/10. A multiplayer/campaign fan would be probably a 2/10.

Campaign's story is all over the place and full co-op play and unlockable camo that carry over to other gamemodes don't really save it. [u]Forget about multiplayer, though.[/u][hr][/hr]

[b]Campaign:[/b] has full co-op through and through, up to 4 players and it's kinda bad. The gameplay is fine, the level design is cool and there are some very interesting set pieces overall, but the story is just really not there. I don't know what the overall goal with this story was, but it just does not work. It's memorable for the wrong reasons (""Train go boom."") and co-op experience is actually very barebones. I'm glad that, for once, a CoD campaign has co-op, but it's only worth playing ""just for the heck of it"". P.S.: The story has nothing to do with Black Ops 1 or 2, so make of that what you will.

[b]Multiplayer:[/b] it's dead and it's a hacker's paradise. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS FOR MULTIPLAYER! Hackers are rampart in Blops3 and without installing fan-made patch your multiplayer experience will be a complete disaster.

[b]Zombies:[/b] Y E S. Shadows of Evil? good stuff. The 4 DLC maps? amazing stuff. Zombies Chronicles? oh my, I can hardly contain my excitement! Steam Workshop and [u]mods[/u]??

I was pretty hyped to play zombies chronicles since it contains most of my favorite zombie maps but when the game runs like shut it's pretty unplayable and unsatisfying to play as a whole. People have adressed this issue and both activision and steam have done nothing about it. For those unaware of what I am talking about, I am basically referring to steam 12 update or something like that. So bascially this specific update makes the online part of zombies almost unplayable. Constant stutters, menus take so much time to load, fps issues and so much more. People have to rely on patches and all of that crap made by the community instead of treyarch stepping up and fixing the whole fiasco. Numerous creators dedicated to cod zombies have mentioned this issue, threads on the reddit platform have been created in order to adress this issue as well but no action has been taken whatsoever. Thanks activision this is the only fucking game I wanted to ever buy. P.S. I have requested a refund and until further updates have gone thorugh that will fix these issues I am not going to buy this again. Lastly let's not forget the various security risks that can get your pc hacked or infected with malware.

The reason that I and no one should recommend this game today, is for a few simple reasons. One, it is plagued with exploits, hackers, and SECURITY BREACHES, which could end up in your computer being hacked into via backdoor remote access. For that reason I would not recommend the average player to try this game. In order to play this game safetly there are multiple ways, the method In which I used was blocking black ops 3 servers from connecting to my device. If you want to play multiplayer with your friends, I'm afraid that's not very viable without risk of getting your data stolen. There are community based options, but you would have to trust those at your own risk. Overall, don't buy this game unless your willing to go through loopholes, and set it up so that you are not connecting to the official call of duty servers. You cannot definitely not play public multiplayer or co-op at all. Your best bet for playing with a friend is split-screen if you want it to be safe. This massive problem the is yet to really be addressed fully by the publishers/& developers, and their nerve to charge full LAUNCH price for the zombies chronicle version, and $100 for the complete version, makes this a game that would only want to play, if you very very interested in playing modded zombies and going through the security measures to protect your device and not play multiplayer.

Campaign: Campaign was easily the biggest letdown of any campaign that a call of duty game has ever released with. After the amazing campaigns of World At War, Black Ops, and Black Ops II, Treyarch really failed to live up to expectations. The story was completely uncompelling, many times making no sense, having to search up online to find out what the story actually was about. The characters are no where near as iconic, as Frank Woods, Hudson, Bowman, Alex Mason, David Mason, Harper, Briggs, Menedez, Dragovich, 
Steiner, Kravchenko, Reznov, Dimitri, etc. To sum it up, ""Train go boom.""

Multiplayer: The multiplayer takes away the standard boots on the ground play and puts it into a futuristic advanced movement similar to titanfall 2 gameplay. Although not bad, an I would even say its good, its still a step down from the previous titles. 

Zombies: The zombies mode is easily the best part of this game, it does have its flaws, such as the p2w  gobblegums, but luckly you can mostly avoid using them. The maps are great overall, the remasters bring fresh light and new gameplays features to classic maps.

Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend.
DO NOT BUY.
While it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.

*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*
They took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.
Opening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:
CVE-2018-20817
(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request. This affects Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 1, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.)
CVE-2018-10718
(Stack-based buffer overflow in Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 before 2018-04-26 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets)
These are some things they can do even if you just boot up the game and get to the menu:

Report every older CoD as harmful and put those 2 CVE's under the description why.
Write negative reviews to warn others not to spend any money on these CoDs (which are mostly overpriced for how old they are as it is)

Otherwise, I would buy it. Maybe when it's on sale tho because $60 for a game made 8 years ago kinda is a bit much, but probably worth it for the fun.
Overall Game Rating
---------------------------------
*Multiplayer
+Fun movement :)
+Servers are still alive for the most part
-You run into hackers a lot more than you did in the past (No severe threat to your personal info since they fixed it, but be careful)
-Everyone only really plays Team Deathmatch. No one really plays the other game modes

*Zombies
+Its perfect
+Perfect
+Did I mention perfect?

*Campaign
+Decent
-Kinda boring tho
-Pretty hard even on normal
-----------------------------------------
Rating: 9/10
(I wouldn't recommend buying the multiplayer starter pack. Even if you only play multiplayer, you can get the full game for sometimes $20 if it goes on sale. If you want to buy, just wait. You get more content :) )",1704227522,1704238875,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Call of Duty®: Black Ops 3"" takes the iconic franchise to new heights, delivering an adrenaline-pumping experience that seamlessly blends the best of what fans love about the series with innovative game-play elements that push the boundaries of the genre. Treyarch has truly outdone themselves with this installment, creating a game that not only honors the roots of Call of Duty but also propels it into the future.

The campaign of Black Ops 3 is a mind-bending roller-coaster that blurs the lines between reality and virtuality. The story's intricate layers of conspiracy and intrigue kept me hooked from start to finish. The addition of cybernetic augmentations to the game-play adds a unique twist, allowing players to unleash a range of abilities that elevate the tactical game-play to new heights. The level design is nothing short of spectacular, whisking players across a variety of stunning environments that range from gritty urban sprawls to high-tech facilities. The narrative's philosophical musings on the nature of humanity and technology are thought-provoking and add a layer of depth that's rare in the FPS genre.

Black Ops 3's multiplayer is the heart and soul of the game, and it's not hard to see why. The fast-paced combat, combined with the wide array of weapons, equipment, and Specialists, keeps every match feeling fresh and exhilarating. The introduction of wall-running and advanced movement mechanics adds a vertical dimension to the game-play, encouraging players to rethink their strategies and embrace a more dynamic play-style. Whether you're a fan of close-quarters combat or long-range sniping, there's a load-out and a play-style for everyone. The map design is exceptional, catering to various play-styles and providing a perfect balance between tight corridors and open spaces.

Zombies mode has always been a fan-favorite, and Black Ops 3 takes it to a whole new level. The maps are intricate, sprawling, and packed with hidden secrets to uncover. The inclusion of an XP progression system and customizable Gobblegums adds a layer of RPG-like depth to the mode, giving players more reasons than ever to keep coming back for more undead-slaying action. Whether you're teaming up with friends or braving the zombie apocalypse solo, this mode offers endless hours of eerie fun.

Visually, Black Ops 3 is a treat for the eyes. The level of detail in the environments, character models, and weapon designs is astounding. The game's futuristic aesthetic is well-executed, and the dynamic lighting and particle effects immerse you further into the game's world. The sound design is equally impressive, with explosive gunfire, thunderous explosions, and subtle ambient sounds all coming together to create a truly cinematic experience.

In conclusion, ""Call of Duty®: Black Ops 3"" is a triumphant entry in the franchise that manages to strike a perfect balance between innovation and the classic Call of Duty formula. Its gripping campaign, adrenaline-pumping multiplayer, and addicting zombies mode combine to create an experience that's greater than the sum of its parts. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer looking for a gateway into the world of modern military shooters, Black Ops 3 is an absolute must-play. In the sea of shooters, Black Ops 3 stands tall as a testament to the series' enduring appeal and the developers' commitment to pushing the boundaries of the genre. This is a game that will keep you engaged, thrilled, and coming back for more long after the bullets have stopped flying.",1693103325,1703981937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Opening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:
CVE-2018-20817
(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request. This affects Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 1, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.)
CVE-2018-10718
(Stack-based buffer overflow in Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 before 2018-04-26 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets)
These are some things they can do even if you just boot up the game and get to the menu:

after many matches of ddos servers and servers just kick off offline. mind you a server has like 5 people yes including you, and yes it’s server not servers bc there isn’t enough players in bo3 multiplayer to even fill up one match even on holidays, and weekends good luck getting in one on week days. now most ppl that play are the same as you, longing for the good old days and only are like level 10 at max, and then there is that braindead retard with mxt (a free mod menu that lets you get all in game skins, and dlcs guns that you would have otherwise happened to pay a arm, a leg, and both of your kidneys for, plus a shit spinbot and even more shit aimbot) that honestly thinks wasting the time of 5 random people that are not even trying that hard to win is funny.

Zombies is a different case. you can download mod maps a lot easier now due to them being on the workshop. a lot of them have care put in them and look fucking perfect. plus much zombies matches are fast to get into and are most of the time full. fuck it i even did the shadows of evil easter egg with a group of randoms (most fun i had in years). sadly most maps that have players on them are shadows of evils, kino, and origins. this isn’t a problem with people who only want to play those maps, but it sucks for people who want to play other maps with randoms.
now for the matches most people have mxt for unlocking, and getting unlimited amounts of all the overpowered stuff, and will rarely if even at all crash the server, kick you from the server, or use cheats like noclip or godmode, ofc this is great. nice change of pace from multiplayer. 


now for the game itself it stutters every second or 2 (dropping 10 to 20 frames it’s different person to person) this isn’t a setup problem too (yes my setup is low end) however ppl with beefy cpu and gpus have the same problem with the same frames being dropped. this is due to a update help preventing hackers from ratting (getting into your computer and controlling because you just online, i am not even lying btw) however like most things from triple a game companies it was a fix to for problem but replaced it with another.


(tldr if you want to play bo3 multiplayer it’s best off leaving your childhood memories as memories, and not as a reason to hate cod, however zombies is great and plays basically like it did years ago just with a stutter problem. wait for a sale not worth paying 60 dollars for a game with 3 modes that suck and one really good one.)",1703648481,1703648481,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients
1 whole rib eye roast (you can use boneless or bone-in prime rib) about 14 pounds
6 tbsp. olive oil, divided
4 tbsp. tri-color peppercorns (or any peppercorns)
3 sprigs rosemary
3 sprigs thyme
1/2 c. kosher salt
1/2 c. minced garlic
Directions
1
Preheat oven to 500°F. Remove the roast from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
2
Cut the rib loin in half (roast halves separately for more controlled/even cooking.)
3
Heat a large skillet over very high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil and sear both halves until they're a nice dark golden color. Place the tricolor peppercorns into a bag; use a rolling pin to crush the peppercorns. Strip the leaves from the rosemary and thyme springs. Mix the salt, crushed peppercorns, rosemary leaves, thyme leaves, and garlic. 
4
Pour the remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil over the rib loin and pour on the rub mix. Pat slightly to get it to stick to the meat. Roast for 20 to 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 300°F and roast until a meat thermometer registers 125°F for rare/medium rare, 30 to 50 minutes (the roast will continue to cook slightly after removing from the oven). If you'd like the meat more cooked, leave it in the oven longer. Just keep an eye on the meat thermometer and don't let it cook past medium rare! *USING A MEAT THERMOMETER IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE YOU COOK THE MEAT TO YOUR LIKING*

Intraocular pressure (IOP) refers to the fluid pressure inside the eye. The eye contains a clear fluid called aqueous humor, which is constantly produced and drained to maintain the shape of the eye and provide nutrients. Intraocular pressure is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the eye.

Normal intraocular pressure ranges between 10 and 21 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). Elevated intraocular pressure can be associated with conditions such as glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can lead to optic nerve damage and vision loss. Monitoring intraocular pressure is crucial in assessing the risk of glaucoma and managing the condition.

Regular eye examinations, including measurements of intraocular pressure, are important for detecting and managing eye conditions. Treatment options for elevated intraocular pressure may include medications, laser therapy, or surgery, depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition.

It is a pretty damn good Call Of Duty though, even with a botched campaign. 

Multiplayer is hard to get into now-a-days since every other player has all the best stuff so your starter weapons will be pretty weak by comparison. 

Zombies is good fun though I am not a fan of the gobble gums system.

I tried Zombies Chronicles and I don't know whats wrong with me but I dont really like these old maps, I have no nostalgia with these maps so I am sorry if that upsets you but they didnt have a lot of charm to me and they weren't super fun to play on. I don't really care for this complex zombies lore either so I can't really give an opinion on that

I think graphically this game holds up pretty well today for a 8 year old game (Which kinda proves my point that we've already peaked in most graphical advancements lol)

I think the best thing this game ever did was have easy modding and workshop support, I think they should do that with all the older COD games as soon as they leave their lifecycles, it really breathes new air into this game to have custom zombies maps and the like.

Black Ops 3 is a fast-paced and exhilarating first-person shooter, its got fast-paced multiplayer action, engaging cooperative Zombies mode, and a visually striking campaign with a futuristic twist. 

The narrative can be convoluted at times, and the emphasis on wall-running may not resonate with all players, personally I enjoyed it and found it to be the perfect balance of fun but the campaign is definitely why this score gets dragged down!

Zombies is perfect in every way imaginable from it's maps to weapons and everything in-between. Also bringing the storyline to a close.

The multiplayer is very fun when you aren't dealing with seats on ripper with a Brecci. All in all a fantastic multiplayer experience that kept me going back for more.

Guys, wow, this game is crazy. Last time I played this, I was eating a sonic foot long Chili Cheese Coney, Route 44 Ocean Water, and Mozzy Sticks. On round 11 in Kino Der Toten, a zombie crawler hit me by surprise. This startled me, and jumped which spilled my route 44 ocean water into my lap. With no other recourse, I began bending over in my lazy boy chair and started slurping the fluid out of my Dallas Cowboys bathrobe. My frantic movement caused my dog to start barking and jump up as well, which henceforth knocked over the coney dog and associated condiments into the spill area as well. the chili mixed with the blue ocean water formed at viscous soup - like mixture, whose texture and flavor was poignant enough to warrant sitting up and to cease slurping up the ocean water from the first accident. As this has been going on, the crawler hit me an additional 3 times, which caused me to go into a downed state. As I was playing with my guitar tutor, he was able to get to me before I bled out, which allowed me to live another day. as round 12 started, I attempted to stand up to get a towel to wipe of the ocean water + chili goop, but unfortunately I did not anticipate the mass of the mess, and fell on top of my poor dogs head. At the end of the day, the game should have done a better job compiling the sound files so that the file size does not exceed 50gb. I hope this helps!",1702236726,1702236726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Good news:  One of if not the most sophisticated narratives I've seen translated into a video game
- Bad news: Not a sequel to Black Ops II.

Seemed two story lines going on at once; actual events and Taylor's mind. The first and the last missions happen in our reality while everything in between was a reenactment of Taylor's mission, controlled by Corvus.

Why? Because Sebastian Krueger becomes obsessed with CIA mind control, Alex Mason, Nova 6 etc, so he and CIA collaborate on SP/Corvus. That's how all connected to The Black Ops Universe.

The standout feature is the robust mod support, providing players the freedom to tailor the experience to their liking – from immersive to silly and goofy, the possibilities are endless.

Playing Zombies is truly at its zenith when shared with friends. The cooperative nature of the mode transforms the undead chaos into a thrilling team effort. The camaraderie, strategic planning, and the constant onslaught of zombies create moments of shared triumph and laughter that linger long after the game session ends.

My experiences with Black Ops 3 Zombies have been a rollercoaster of emotions – from the heart-pounding tension of surviving high rounds to the joyous laughter induced by the unpredictable chaos. The combination of an engaging narrative, diverse maps, and the relentless pursuit of achieving higher rounds creates a formula that keeps players coming back for more.

It’s worth noting the rich history of the Zombies mode, originating as a bonus Easter egg and evolving into a beloved standalone experience. The lore, the iconic characters, and the ever-expanding narrative contribute to the enduring appeal of Zombies in Black Ops 3.

In conclusion, Black Ops 3 Zombies is a triumph within the game, providing a dynamic and entertaining experience with its exceptional mod support. Whether you’re seeking immersion or lighthearted fun, playing with friends amplifies the thrill. The Zombies mode is not just a game; it’s a cooperative adventure, a chaotic romp, and a testament to the enduring legacy of undead mayhem.",1701688893,1701688893,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

However, the main Campaign on this sucked & would be my final Call of Duty.

Multiplayer is meh 4/10 

I didn't realise how boring the Zombies mode actually was though. It is cool, the story was decent but man it is boring. 

I am not happy that this still, scummy, money hungry company asked for more money on the same Zombies Maps you paid additional charges for on previous COD's & never even included them all. 

If you do enjoy COD Zombies or are new to it, this is the go to game for range of maps, mods and visuals. But it does get boring once you know it all

Edit: I Currently have 688 hours of this game, I have played it on xbox, xbox 360, ps3 and new gen playstation. This game is what the call of duty community would call ""peak zombies"" because of the fact zombies was at its maximum hype when this game released. There are so many different zombies maps to choose from and they are all filled to the brim with lore and features, if you get bored there's zombies chronicles to replay a bunch of the old maps from back in the WAW, Bo1 and Bo2 days. And if you somehow get sick of this game welp you can just mod it with the literal 10s of thousands of mods people have made and make daily.

If you like call of duty this is the most important call of duty to own on PC due to infinite replay-ability from the literal limitless mods that exist for this game.",1649740059,1701299328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its story is solid and its characters are relatable, but core elements of the gameplay remain very much unchanged, specifically the guns and the accessories . Whilst the weapons are fun to shoot and offer a fair range of useful accessories to make aiming and precision better, other games offer more inventive addons for the firearms. BO3 presents enhancements to weapons that have been seen before and the lack of energy weapons makes the year 2065 look too dated to be believeable. The air fighter battles in the refinary level offer some exciting moments and a little change, but otherwise, nothing else is original.

The cybernetic suit upgrade system is good. The wall running ability, speed  boost and the rush attacks come in handy in the most intense encounters,  but the invisibility mode doesn't last long enough  and can lead to awkward moments in which the player can be caught off guard or trapped in between enemies.  

Overall, a step in the right direction that doesn't feel futuristic enough. Advanced Warfare does what Black Ops 3 should have done, in that it adds more innovative aspects to the game. I recommend this game only to the fans and those who want to follow the storyline and face a very contagious enemy, which ends up becoming the best feature of the game.",1701162204,1701162204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, since earlier this year, I have been entirely incapable of launching the game. I've tried reinstalling, running in safe mode, clean booting my computer. I've excluded it from Windows Defender, my antivirus software, I've excluded my entire Steam games folder. 

The game remains stubborn in not launching; it opens for perhaps five or six seconds to a black window, then closes entirely with no error report, no indication of a crash. It simply closes. 

I'd be more than happy to change my review, one hundred percent.

I followed the advice of everyone on the internet to get this thing to run on my PC (which is far above the required specs of the game); I deactivated my antivirus, put the folder for the game and the .exe file in my AV's exceptions list, turned off my VPN software, updated my graphics drivers, shut down background processes that may have been offending, and even reinstalled the game, to no avail.  So, again, not that the game itself is bad (although I think the campaign is terrible and the online multiplayer outside of zombies is a bit mediocre), be warned that this game may not work on your PC for some undiagnosable reason.  

I have no idea what I may have been doing wrong, or what options may have worked, but there is no reason that my PC should not be able to run the game, and whatever fix may have worked would likely be far too labor-intensive to perform every single time I wanted to play some zombies.

I thought it was awful. Definitely my least favorite FPS campaign I've ever played. Sure, visually it was very impressive, but the gameplay was so boring. I trudged through it just b/c I hate to not finish. You'd never play more than a few minutes a time before some overly dramatic cut scene. There was no flow to it. It was overly cinematic, overly dramatic, and the gameplay was overly simplistic.

Anyone who knows how to look up a YT tutorial can gain full backdoor access to your computer. It isn't common, but it has been an issue present in almost every older CoD game and Activision has yet to do a thing about it.

The worst part is that some people went out of their way to fix this mess (for free!) and were greeted by a cease and desist from Activision. Therefore I can't recommend this game despite how great it is, due to how terrible Activision is as a whole.

I’ve seen this message 10+ times in my 12 hours of gameplay, each time disconnecting me from a solo or multiplayer zombies match. It’s not just a disconnection; all progress is lost, no statistics are saved, I cannot level my profile or my guns. I do not gain currency for the Doctor’s factory, and I lose all progress in the Easter Egg. For those unfamiliar with the Easter Egg, it can take hours to complete, and the fact that on multiple separate occasions, both myself and my friend are disconnected two to three hours into the Easter Egg, losing all progress and being forced to start from scratch, is unacceptable. I’ve already lost connection twice this morning playing solo, and that was the final straw. I've spent hours on Google and YouTube, scouring the internet for a fix, but after that much research I've determined that no solution exists. I’ve forwarded my ports, run the game as administrator, run the game in compatibility mode, checked for system updates, checked for graphics cards updates, tried playing on three different internet providers at different friends houses, and the connection issues persist. The game is unplayable unless you are looking to play offline entirely, which means you’re sacrificing a significant portion of the game, as offline statistics do not affect your profile. Elden Ring, WoW, Starcraft, and Diablo 4 all run flawlessly; I’ve never been disconnected from any of these games. This issue is buried in the code of Black Ops 3, and it’s apparent that it will never be fixed or addressed. I hold no ill will toward Steam; I’ve been a loyal account holder for years, and love the service, but as I said, this game is unplayable, and I've requested a refund.

the graphics are decent but nothing stand out in term of designs.

multiplayer ? I've tried several match with bots in most modes , maps are overly chaotics in design , most games mode are things you already seen elsewhere and teams are hard to discern because everyone look the same in the heath of actions ... guess it's why games like Counter strike have specific and very dinstinguishable designs for the characters models of each team which this game doesn't seem to care about.

while the pvp gameplay work , it's so just ... been done over and over again by so many games already.

zombies mode ? eh , it's kind of okay ... but still fall flat compared to games like Killing Floor 2 and Left 4 dead , you gain points and have to use these points to buy guns that are just put on the walls and open doors to gain access to the different areas of the maps , it's got 4 players max , the maps are cramped as hell with obstacles everywhere and the zombies can kill you with a few hits , so it's usually goes in a ''get them to do the conga line'' and circle around the few open space you can find.

the campaign ? lot's of cinematic , lot's of talk and also a lot's of ''taking cover because I'm not sure how much health I have left'' , pretty much what call of duty single player mode ever been , nothing wrong , just not mindblowing either.

I've also tested this on the steamdeck and while you can play the single player campaign and the zombie mode , multiplayer doesn't seem to work and the game also seem to usually crash when you stop playing and exit back to the main menu , it's ''playable'' but don't buy this game specifically for the steamdeck.",1700452855,1700472549,True,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,False

Campaign: The campaign is confusing and plain-ol terrible, as you have to watch a whole lore video on YT to try and figure you the story. This makes the campaign bland, forgettable, and plain. Doesnt matter thoug, don't judge a Call Of Duty game off of its campaign (when time is actually put into it, looking at you MW3 2023)

Multiplayer: Likely the best movement CODs, with perfect jetpack mechanics. 4-player splitscreen makes this insanely fun when you have friends over, not to mention the ""pick 10"" system, which makes the multiplayer's loadout system simple & sweet. Progression is perfect, but I would like to complain that there is lootboxes. these make the multplayer much less enjoyable, and you cannot use DLC weapons (which you paid for already) without having extreme RNG to pull them from lootboxes. You cant even use DLC weapons in offline multiplayer without getting them from lootboxes for crying out loud!

Zombies: Perfection, practically every map is great. Every DLC in this game is 100% worth your money. Modding-wise, it is completely supported by the devs, which allows this game to have an abundance of content for F-R-E-E, even without paying for any DLCs.
