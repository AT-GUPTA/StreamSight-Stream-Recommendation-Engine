Prepare to be amazed by the stunningly blocky graphics that would make Picasso question his artistic choices. It's like someone turned a potato into a pixelated masterpiece and ran with it. Who knew that a world full of squares and rectangles could be so captivating?

Now, don't let the charming art style fool you. The game packs a punch when it comes to challenges. From fending off brain-hungry zombies to scavenging for toilet paper (yes, even in the apocalypse, that's a thing), Unturned throws curveballs at you faster than a clumsy outfielder.

But fear not, for the game's survival mechanics are as easy to grasp as a greased pig. You'll quickly learn the art of crafting weapons out of unlikely objects, building fortresses that would make Tony Stark proud, and driving vehicles that handle like drunk shopping carts. It's a recipe for chaos, and it tastes oh-so-delicious.

The multiplayer aspect is where Unturned truly shines. Grab your friends and jump into the madness together. Team up to create the most absurd bases, engage in epic battles that resemble a circus on steroids, or embark on zany quests that make you question your life choices. It's the kind of multiplayer experience that leaves you crying tears of laughter and wondering why you didn't become a professional clown.

Unturned on Steam is a game that never takes itself seriously, and that's precisely why it's so damn fun. It's a wild rollercoaster ride through a blocky wonderland, where laughter is your best weapon and silliness is your survival strategy.

So, if you're looking for a game that will tickle your funny bone and make your friends question your sanity, look no further. Unturned is here to make you laugh, cry (from laughing too hard), and question why you ever took gaming so seriously in the first place. Embrace the absurdity and embark on this hilarious journey. Your inner comedian will thank you.",1672004703,1686227170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son recently started Unturned and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

The star of this game is the curated maps. The base game maps feel tame and restricted in comparison with no quests and no NPCs. My favorite map has to be Elver. It was such a fun experience to play through in PVE and filled with the wonder and mystery that I thought I'd lost from survival games.

1. Singleplayer, which gets more and more boring the more you learn and the more good loot you get from scavenging and military bases. But it is fun to do the secrets and such.
2. Multiplayer, it's fun doing singleplayer but either making a team of people to do singleplayer stuff quicker or kill other teams of people or just people.
3. Arena, battle royale, teamed or solo.
Mods exist, which is dope as hell. As you can add tons of things that the devs can't do at the moment, and add content, or disappoint your family.
Servers can use Plugins to make Unturned different, such as allowing something like a GMod DarkRP to be done, and such.

Unturned is that weird lovechild between Minecraft and DayZ/7 Days to Die; hordes, base building, plenty of modding, PVE/PVP, with a vast community. Pretty fun.

Not to mention how the game's aged so well. Early Alpha of the game was brilliant fun, and when the ever-buggy 2.0 was released, the game was even more enjoyable.

I do have a couple gripes, that first one being that zombies don't free-roam between POI's, and there isn't a way to update this without setting the POI size to be the entire map, which only updates zombie spawning on a relog. It would be a nice touch to have this feature in the game, perhaps make it more challenging (or at least a mode with the feature.)

Honestly the game is screaming for more on the baseline. I think now that it's been a number of years since 2.0 (and the amazing Russia map) were released, I think it's time for a 3.0, or a sequel, with more in the base game itself.

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?",1638022913,1638022913,True,3,1,0.519855618476867676,0,True,False,False

But now, this game is a master piece in my opinion. The possibilities rival Minecraft's, even with no mods. I have put thousands of hours into it and still find moments that I relish.

While this game might not be your cup of tea, the endless possibilities just keep me coming back. While I don't particularly enjoy the singleplayer, playing on player-hosted servers is just the thing for me. Sure this might not be the game for you, sure there are the flaws and glitchy driving, but this game will still always be the first ever game I got on steam, and will always be there in my heart.",1485608611,1636389438,True,1,0,0.484431326389312744,0,True,False,False

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1487133922,1635741534,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This review will solely be for singleplayer and multiplayer coop with friends. I will not include experiences that you may get on the custom multiplayer servers.

In Unturned, you have to survive for as long as possible, get all your skills upgraded, get good loot, and whatever else you want to do on the way. It's practically DayZ, but blocky.

The game's really good for a free to play indie game, it has nice vehicle mechanics, nice building mechanics, good enough crafting, good gunplay and weapon modification.

But it comes with one glaring flaw. The endgame. After you do all the things you want, it just becomes repetitive to go from place to place, gathering food and desperately searching for top-tier items.

The great thing is that they recently added tasks to the game and overall also a smaller story, and I take that as a pleasant diversification of the game. You can play the game with friends and cover each other's backs in a rough landscape full of zombies and other survivors. This game is quite similar to Minecraft, but it is much more action-packed. You never know what pitfalls are waiting for you out there, so go and get everything you can.

   Unturned is a free to play game so that's a thumbs up , the gameplay is interactive and there's the multiplayer , where people dont have to play only on official servers and can make their own server as modded as it can be. In multiplayer there's voice chat so u can communicate easier to ur mates. The gameplay , the pvp in the most cases its easier when u play on third person (u can change to first person if u want to) and u can get ur loot from houses , military bases , or zombies.
  So yeah, I think u should really try this game and give an opinion just as I did.

amazing! There are three different maps that I truly enjoy the most. The first one is PEI a very simple and
relatively small map. It is great for learning the basics of the game as well as being good for

With the plenty of maps that you start with within the game, and the workshop allowing you to have access to hundreds more well thought out maps, play never gets boring.

It still has all the other mechanics of other zombie survival games, and even adds in it's own twist in some of the newer maps that have NPC settlements around the map for you to trade with and do quests with, and a reputation system. Some NPCs may not sell to you if your reputation is too low, or others may ONLY sell to you if your reputation is low.

There is also a full map editor in-game, allowing you to easily create your own maps to survive on and share with your friends. A user-friendly GUI also makes learning about the tools within the editor easy.

Although it has no impact on the game in general, I bought Unturned Gold, allowing me to have a couple of other cosmetic changes to my character, a gold nametag in-game, and access to Gold-only servers (Which nobody runs. Even if there are any gold only servers, I prefer to play on servers that have a large player-count.)

There's also loot boxes, if you're in to that sort of thing.

-Comunity
Unturned alternative: Just joined said hi to a guy he killed me with Assault Rifle. Rust alternative: Just joined too said hi to a guy he gave me some items to build small house. (Dont say its only 1 this time it happened mostly always so.)
-Graphic
Even if you put everything on ultra it will be worser than minecraft, will tell you why. There are just colored models without any texture, sometimes i think the dev did drew grass in Paint 3D.
-Optimisation
I have a strong graphic card and also a nice CPU (GPU:GTX 1050 CPU: Intel Core I3 6100)
and i have on ultra settings only 40-50 FPS in this game, but in games like GTA V or Battlefield 1 on Ultra i have 60-70 FPS.


Good things:
-Gameplay
Very nice and enjoyable gameplay you can easy find items and you can get very cool items mostly in 1 hour.
-Updates
The dev do very nice maps for this game and adds new cool weapons toom but theres one dumb and somehow cool thing and that is skins for items like pan or canned beans.",1487678597,1515277421,False,4,0,0.445789486169815063,0,True,False,True

I do enjoy the somewhat blocky graphics as it gives a new type of gaming experience. The reagdoll physics are pretty funny and commiting suicide in front of your friends is hillarious.


there are also many things that do need to be worked on in this game however. The sounds in the game are bad and very repetitive. The zombie AI isnt very good either. The worst thing about the game isnt the game itself. it's the community that hurts. the community is a bunch of 9 year olds that play on RP servers. If we can get official servers for the game, that would make for an even better experience.

Now I've put 60 hours into this thing, its probably my favourite game (currently). Its wide variety of servers is nice because rage quitting is something I do alot :3. The sandbox and skills element of it is a nice addition in my opinion, as it gives the game a bit more depth. It has frequent updates (one every friday/saturday morning depending where you live) and they are well done and actually add things unlike other games. Variety of guns is massive, and it has custom names for all the games (e.g Zubekanov = AK47, Heartbreaker = SCAR, etc). Its hard to get bored on this game, because their is always something to do. The PvP is fast paced which is negative for some and a positive for some (personally a negative). To make up for this, PvP does take skill, not whoever fires the first shots.

Would I recommend it? Yes. Unturned is a mix of a sandbox, looting locations, raiding and post-apocalyptic stuff (zombies, guns, etc). So, what are you waiting for? Download it now.

EDIT: I have over 300 hours on the game now, and it still has punch. My friend Liam has about 2k hours on the game and still enjoys it :) The updates every week are still going and the game has come alot from when I reviewed it and there is a new 4.0 Update soon.

Talk to Npcs,do quests ,find more about what happened

In any case, This game is like, how can I put this... it's a zombie game for people who can't handle true zombie horror. If you like Minecraft, this is for you. If you can't run Dead Rising, Resident Evil, Left4Dead 2 or DayZ, this ame is for you. If you're a big baby that can't handle exploding heads, maggots and worms and zombie amputations via shotgun then this game is for you.

I don't play this game because I want to kill zombies. I don't even play this game because I like survival crafting. (I don't.)

I play it because no one really buys Capcom's zombie games, and my friends haven't touched L4D2 in years. And they have no excuse, L4D2 was free on steam one weekend. So saying Unturned is cheaper is B.S.

It's hard to tell which guns are what, because they all have nondescribing names like Sabertooth and Maplestrike. the gun shapes could use real texturing to tell the guns apart.

Nevertheless, player interaction is best on small servers with friends. Bonus points if a few friends decide to go rogue to keep things interesting.

I would love for this game to get better. I would like to be able to play with friends. But everyone has different ideas on what they want to play and it's hard getting a group together.",1485715324,1504734566,True,0,0,0.469314098358154297,0,True,False,False

I feel like Nelson sees a new map, guns or cars as a way of avoiding the issue of optimizing and placating the community with shiney new toys.   If you have a fantastic rig you can probably play it with no issue however the general complain about optimization comes from people that could play but now can't because the games performace  as got gradually worse for them.

Nelson has done a wonderful job making Unturned by himself but if the reason he hasn't optimised is that he doesn't know how than maybe he needs to swallow his pride and  look for help.

Lots of weapon selection clothing selection vehicles air vehicles so and more
One the best parts are that it is free 

The physics are a but weird but went all Games? I really enjoyed how when shooting some one with a weapon they tend to bleed and eventually bleed out without using bandages or a med kit
The main thing that people don't like what I've noticed is getting stuck in walls or props 
One of the things me and lots more people hate the most are glitch bases they are a pain in the butt to get into alone I've done it before it took my 4 hours but other then that the game is really outstanding there are a lot of different map selections. My favorite map of all time is the map Russia there's a lot of room to run hide kill scavenge or base the best part about it weapon and clothing wise are the eastereggs and the liberator the liberator is an aircraft carrier where you can do missions for an liberation force. If you hit the current highest rank major you get clothing oh before I forget to mention the weapons the shadow stalker mk II is an advanced super weapon capable of killing a person with one bullet with explosive bullets no bullet drop and 20 bullets in the magazine I'll post a guide on how to get it on a later date last thing I have to say are the weapons you get when you get promoted.... You get a blunt force shotgun but it's silenced wich is awesome so no one can hear you creeping up about to end there life the other weapon you get it when you get promoted to lieutenant....

You need to collect a few basic materials to get your feet on the ground in this world, and you start by looting and pillaging whatever remnant of human civilization you can find. Depending on your difficulty setting (I played normal), you can either sneak into the zombie-infested towns to grab your supplies, or you can run in kamikaze style, fist-fighting the zombies to obtain what you need.

The zombie combat in Unturned was really fun for me when I started playing. Whether I had a shovel, a knife, a pistol, or a rocket launcher, it was always fun running into packs of the undead and slaughtering them to my heart's content. Nonetheless, I had a few issues with this game.

One of the issues I had with this game was building. Building yourself a proper base is a long, soul-grinding process. If you play on a PVP server and want to reinforce it with metal, you're in for a far worse time.

Another issue I had with the game was inventory management. Unlike games like Minecraft and Terraria, Unturned does not let you stack items. In fact, lots of items take up more than 1 inventory slot. A bottle of glue is small and consumes 1 slot, but a crate will consume an area of 4 slots (2x2) and most guns were 2x4. This made it difficult to manage the inventory and required a huge amount of storage crates if you wanted to keep what you found.

The final issue I had was performance. I realize my laptop is old, and an AMD APU isn't exactly superb for gaming, but my framerate wasn't the problem. Turning visuals all the way down to low and resolution down to 720p, I usually maintained 20-25 FPS. The issue that annoyed the heck out of me was input lag. I've played games with worse framerates than these and seen no real input lag from my mouse or keyboard. Adding this on top of the poor inventory design made managing my storage (and my inventory) a huge pain.

Once I had built a solid base and collected masses of weapons, ammo, and food, and once I had explored the map, the game became too repetitive. The only thing there was to do was hunt Mega Zombies or kill the normal guys in an acre's worth. There are a bunch of maps to play, so you can constantly get a fresh experience, but eventually you'll run out of maps. If you play a PvE world, don't expect it to last forever.

But PvE is not the only way to play Unturned. I played in two different PvP worlds with my friends. The general experience of looting was fun, but the combat experience wasn't great for me. My framerate always dropped during combat, which made it difficult to play competitively. Plus, unless you set some rules for taking items from the enemy, you end up losing hours upon hours of grind time if you suffer defeat. Even if you do set restrictions on spoils of war, it seemed a bit unsatisfying to kill my friends and wait for them to come back and pick up their items. If I'm going to be shooting my friends online, I'll do it in a game designed for FPS, where death doesn't have such high consequences. I'd play a game like Unreal Tournament, if my computer could actually run it...

All that said, even though the game got tiring for me after just a month or two of PvE gameplay with my friends, and PvP sucked for me, I still recommend trying it out. Assuming you can run it at 30 FPS or higher on your system, even with low video quality, you may find looting towns, airports, and military bases very fun and enjoy getting your feet on the ground by building a base to store your supplies and defend yourself from players, if you do PvP.

For a game that looks simple, it surprisingly ran comparativelt bad: not enough time put into optimizing.
The game is in a grey area of playable for me, more so when I switched to Linux.

Problems:
* Performs generally badly on medium-end system.
* Graphical flickering, which happens often when I stand near a tree (Linux only?)
* Turning on antialiasing is a cause for double cursors (an event in which two cursors can be seen -- the ingame cursor, the default cursor)
* Surprisingly takes up a lot of storage.
* Sudden freezes after graphical flickering
* Freezes when I press the voice chat key (Linux?)

All those I have noticed just after the first half and hour of playing the game on a Linux platform.
I would still recommend this game as it is free and as it isn't unfair in terms of gameplay.

Yes, the graphics are not great. However, I think, it should stay like this. It gives the game an identity. When I first played the game, I was not expecting much. I wasn't expecting a full on tactical rpg, or a racing game, or a base build survival co op, or a PVP open world deathmatch. I wasn't expecting any of these. Yet, it offered all of this. Survival is very rewarding. However, be warned, your stuff can vanish depending on the server. Dont get too attached to your items. Sandbox servers are the best as they allow you to do anything you want.

Unturned is a blast, you can really do anything. However, the community can be very toxic sometimes. Depending on how you look at it. In conclusion: The game does no other triple A game has done. H1Z1 and DayZ don't feel that friendly. Unturned feels friendly to new comers. Just bring a friend and scavenge the post apocalyptic environment.

Surprisingly there is lore in the world of Unturned. I'll leave you to discover the hidden lore.

          It began with the forging of the Great
          Rings.

IMAGE: THREE RINGS, each set with a single GEM, are received
by the HIGH ELVES-GALADRIEL, GIL-GALAD and CIRDAN.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
          wisest...fairest of all beings.

IMAGE: SEVEN RINGS held aloft in triumph by the DWARF LORDS.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners
          and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

          But they were all of them deceived.

FADE UP: An ancient PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE EARTH...moving
slowly across the MAP as if drawn by an unseen force the
CAMERA closes in on a PLACE NAME...MORDOR.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          In the land of Mordor, in the fires of

          in secret a Master Ring to control all
          others.

ACROSS the PLAINS OF DAGORLAD...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
          against the armies of Mordor.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought

RING on his finger, looms over the field of battle...

          But the power of the Ring could not be
          undone.

IMAGE: SAURON lays waste to the armies of the LAST ALLIANCE.
With desperate courage, ELENDIL leads a charge...THE BLACK
MACE OF SAURON LASHES OUT!! IMAGE: ELENDIL'S body falls like
a crumpled rag doll... IMAGE: ISILDUR cradles the body of his
father in his arms. The SHADOW OF SAURON falls over him...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
          Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON'S
          ARMOR clatters to the ground. His body

GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The Ring passed to Isildur...who had this
          one chance to destroy evil forever.

through DARKENING WOODS...the ONE RING glinting on a CHAIN
around his neck.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            But the hearts of Men are easily
            corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
            will of its own.

SUDDENLY!    ARROWS FLY!   They are ambushed by ORCS...ISILDUR
SCREAMS!

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP: ISILDUR MATERIALIZES UNDER WATER...as THE RING slips
slowly from his finger. Ripples of LIGHT play across
ISILDUR'S PALE FACE...he is DEAD.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            It betrayed Isildur to his death.

IMAGE: THE RING falls through the MURKY WATERS of the RIVER
ANDUIN.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And some things that should not have been
            forgotten...were lost.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            History became legend...legend became
            myth.

FADE UP: The waters of the ANDUIN RIVER lie dark and
undisturbed.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And for two and a half thousand years the
            Ring passed out of all knowledge.

IMAGE: SILT SWIRLS...A THIN WHITE HAND reaches
down...grasping the RING...

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
            new bearer!

IMAGE: THE THIN WHITE HAND opens to reveal one ring.

                      GOLLUM (V.O.)

IMAGE: MIST SHROUDED MOUNTAINS...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
          took it deep into the tunnels of the
          Misty Mountains.

IMAGE: THE GLOOM of a MOUNTAIN CAVERN..a MURKY POOL of

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And there, it consumed him. A RASPY VOICE

Plays and dies 5 times because you are stranded with nothing.
Blame everything on me.
Get a hold on the game.
Crappy UI and key bindings
Dies 2 times because of bleeding status effect and shitty UI
Had 30% HP I barely make the bandage and then die because it was stored in the bottom of the everything.
Has to open Inventory which has everything every time you pick up an item.
Game has inspect blocky weapon function which I find useless.

Untill some of the core playable sh*t is fixed, I do NOT reccomend this game. Even for a Free 2 Play this game is frustrating rather than enjoyable. 

To the Devs:
Fix crappy keybindings
Fix shitty UI in-game
Need a toolbar at the bottom to place items for fast access.

What attracted me in the first place was the fact that [b] Nelson updates this game every. god damn. week. [/b] That is serious dedication to a project he no doubt loves, and it shows in the amount of content in this game. I had great fun in singleplayer exploring PEI and Yukon, and I've just now started getting into multiplayer, which personally I only find fun with a friend while we talk with mics. 

[b] Mulitplayer [/b] is fun once you've fund yourself some good supplies from a big ciy, and once you've started building your base. I especially enjoy mowing down a group of players to the sound of screeching. Except when it happens to me. You WILL die in multiplayer. A LOT. but as long as you're careful around the cities you'll soon be in the possesion of some armour and guns.

[b] Singleplayer [/b] on the other hand, is remarkably easier. in the frist hour I managed to fill my entire inventory with food above 50%, and some good pistols. Now I just need to find a spot to build my base.",1488056210,1488056210,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The guns. The guns in Unturned are a bit too OP. If anyone has an Assault Rifle and you have a pistol you stand next to no chance to kill them

- For me, nothing else

[b] Pros [/b] 
- Building: Personally I love the building. In single player (and online) I try to make the biggest base possible. Except from a few annoying things (Placement) There isn't too much wrong with building 

- Graphics: Whether at their lowest or highest, this game looks beautiful (Especially since it's made by a single person)  

- Survival: There's always (Until late into the game) a sense of survival. You have to look for food and water or you'll starve to death or die of dehydration. You have to either stay away from zombies or kill them fast enough or you will die/ infect 

[b] Overall [/b] 
Overall I recommend this game and I feel that everyone needs to play this at some point. Now if you excuse me Imma get back to building bases and murdering zombies

I enjoy playing it, even if i dont know how to fight the zombies very well.
The only thing i dont like, is the controls. I feel like there is a delay between the time I press the controls, and the time the action actually happens, giving the game a slow and laggy feel.

Also you should probably play single player first. The mods are fun, especially Hushwood. I'm quite new with only ten hours but considering what I've seen so far it is going to be very fun if I ever man up enough to kill zombies. Their groans cause me to panic. Also no one is very clear on how to spawn things in so here it is, @give revan/4 to get the eaglefire as a example. Use your own name and the 4 is the id number of the eaglefire. @vehicle revan/92 is a example of how to get a vehicle. Use your own name and the id of what you want. The @give/vehicle is required and its not caps sensitive. Just look up the a id number list and your set. Oh, and click surviver in the main menu to change appearance and skill set. I started as a cook but changed it to a Spec Ops. and got cooler clothing and skills. Enjoy and get a gun if you want to live past your first zombie encounter. :-)            Edit. Forgot to say the surviver option lets you change your name and don't forget to turn on cheats in a single player world. I spent two hours trying to get a gun only to realize I didn't turn on cheats.

I mean its a free game and also developped by one guy. Why wouldn't I recommend it?

The combat system is smooth and the lvl up system is not bad, one thing that I recal that isn't good is that the stuff dosen't respawn unless you quit and come back (Note I don't know if he did fix this or not). You can also play with you're friends which makes the game even better and build a fort!

It has a workshop, so if you're bored of the same small map over and over you can always get different map made by the community and some of them are really amazing.

There are very few Pros to this game:

- It's Free
- There is Multiplayer

And then, the Cons:

- Developer is way too focused on bringing out new items/maps rather than fixing bugs.
- Not a very friendly community.
- Levels are way too easy if you are playing alone.
- Admins abuse powers on almost every server you play.
- It's pretty hard to set up a private server unless you know what you are doing.
- Battle Eye doesn't help very much at all, theres atleast a hacker on every server I used to play.

I have played Unturned for around 20 hours and I do a quick checkup after every update, and this game doesnt seem to be going anywhere. The game can get very repetitive and be very boring. I used to own a very small server and all I got was non-stop hackers.

To start off, the basic gist when I describe this game is ""minecraft with guns"", however the game for the graphics it has is extremely detailed. This is survival on steroids and its constantly being updated and changed. To start off with, initially your biggest problem is zombies. Supplies will be somewhat hard to come by at the start, as you manage to find food, water, and perhaps some weapons for zombies. As you get further into it and start building a base and/or collecting ammo and cars, you will quickly find your biggest enemy is other players. 

The one thing about this game is, you can spend HOURS building, and upgrading. Only to have literally every inch of your work taken away within minutes. However on the flip side, you can take away from others and very quickly build back up. Inevitably there is no ""end game"", multiplayer aspects. The game will continue on regardless of your choices. It is a ton of fun, and easy to get involved in, I would recommend playing with friends or a group.

It had quite positive reviews, so I wasn't hesitant about downloading it. After installing hte game, I started it, and was greeted with lots of lag. This is in no part because of the game, it is because the computer that I own is quite slow and old. However, after playing the game, the lag decreased significantly, but the sensitivity was too high for my taste. I was expecting a fps style of gameplay, similar to Counter-Strike or Battlefield 1, but I was surprised at the FPS & Rust Hybrid syle  of gameplay that I saw. It turned me off quite a bit, but that's because it's just not my type of experience that I find enjoybale. The controls were a little weird for my taste, but the gameplzy was ok. I talked to some people that played the game, and they said the game gets a lot better when playing with people in comparision to single player or tutorials. I played some multiplayer, and the experience was great. However, even though I enjoyed it, the style of gameplay was not something I personally would enjoy.

After playing for a large chunk of time Its taught me to not judge a book by its cover, or in this case, a game by its graphics. Its simple surfice is just a shroud covering its oddly large world filled with a ton of guns. verietys of vehicles, and a large and satisfying fanbase. The games simple graphics are easily justifiable by its instense gameplay and intruiging crafting system, and of course the Open World value that it boasts (for good reason). 

Pros- 
1- A lot to do.
2- Its vehicles, guns, and equiptment make it that much more entertaining.
3- The large fanbase, allowing for intruiging multiplayer servers.
4- Expansive mods and addons.
5- For some reason the water is beautiful...
6- Built in anticheat software.
7- Construction system for custom shelter

Cons-
1-A lot of 10 year olds play it?
2-Setting up servers is pretty inconvenient.
3-Graphics (but it does add to the charm of the game)

TL;DR - base building is ♥♥♥♥, raiding is far too easy, completing horde beacons is easy, weapon balancing is bad, third person is ♥♥♥♥, freeform building is cancer, equipment balancing, rocket, and low skill players.

The game, however, major flaws, such as :

- base building is pretty pathetic, no real reason to have exterior walls or gates, traps are pretty much useless, and the structures are very weak too, bases get raided very easily, 10 hours of building can be destroyed by just one hour of looting explosives, it's much more effective to just place lockers in hidden locations rather than to build a proper base for storage, not to mention it takes a lot of time and effort to build bases.

- raiding is extremely easy, a couple trips to the military locations can yield you enough charges and rockets to blow up an entire fortress, and you sometimes don't even need charges, as all you need to do is get an LMG and just shoot down the base, not much planning is needed, and you usually won't be harrased either by vultures or even the defenders themselves, and it's very fast as well.

- completing horde beacons is extremely simple, making them isn't too hard, and completing them is extremely easy, as all you need is a chainsaw to make enough wooden spikes, and after that you get the best weapons in the game, including enough ammunition to shoot down a decently sized base, combined with explosives every base becomes raidable.

- weapon balancing is rather bad, if you have an assault rifle such as the Maplestrike, there's no objective reason to use any other weapon over it, as most AR's deal high damage, have a high firerate (i'd say the Heartbreaker has average fire rate), have very low recoil, high accuracy and relatively common ammunition, as well as a high range meanwhile the LMG's, while being broken for raiding, are rather bad at pvp, as they have MUCH more recoil, much less accuracy, deal quite a LOT LESS DAMAGE, and are rarer as well.

- third person is rather cancerous, it wasn't needed in the game, and it simply makes guns way too easy to shoot, using a Maplestrike in third person has practically no recoil, and makes it far too easy, not to mention it allows people to camp certain locations, and peeking without actually exposing yourself. Not to mention you can barricade yourself in a vehicle and simply use third person to drive, making you practically invincible while you're in your vehicle.

- freeform building is rather ♥♥♥♥, it's pretty good if you want to build cool, special and/or unique buildings or bases like in the metro, but what it's mainly used for is griefing, and raiding. Most people while raiding simply make a big, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tower out of panels, which is both hard to get rid of, and cancerous to look at, and it also allows the raiders on the roof of your base.

- certain equipment has bad balancing, such as the umbrella, while being very fun and useful, is also rather ♥♥♥♥, as it allows for easy access on roofs and vantage points, as well as on the roof of a base, and it doesn't make you to actually be careful of where you walk, meanwhile grenades are extremely underpowered. Flashbangs are practically useless, as they have a very short range, awkward throwing and a long fuse, and it's extremely easy to avoid. The smoke is pretty tiny, takes a long time to get into full effect, and is practically see-through.

- rocket is ruining the survival aspect of Unturned, as nowadays there is a very little amount of vanilla survival servers, and far too many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rocket servers with overpowered kits, tpa, home, vault and/or shop.

- most players are pretty low skill, can barely shoot anything that is not an assault rifle, can't kill zombies effectively with melee, and don't play much survival, so it's very hard to find a good team.

Despite all that, i still love the game, but it has quite a bit of cancer.",1487370900,1487370900,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

- Well, it's because of the time I've spent on Unturned that I feel that I am more than qualified to say: ""it's absolutely f#cking sh#t!""

A once brilliant game that has ironically fallen to the greed driven, poorly thought through changes made by the developers as they attempt to cater to, and milk, the increasingly intolerable prepubescent community on which Unturned is built.  

Unturned has become a stale, filtered, dull, lifeless shadow of it's former self. A game plagued by unneccessary 'novelty updates' sourced from the devs' chronic fear of their audience losing interest.

The game has taken a steep turn away from competetive survival PvP that characterised it in it's early days, with each new update over the last year (2016) serving only to remove another quality of Unturned that I'd grown to love in the past. I've spent a thousand hours enjoying one key element of Unturned that I've always felt was most defiining of it, the 'Spawn, Gear, Die, Rush' sequence. Essentially, you spawn fresh into a server, you find gear to personalise yourself and weaponary, you get killed by another player, and a state of panic ensues as you desperately attempt to regain your hard earned gear that has taken you so long to ecumulate. This sequence, though frustrating, was what made Unturned thrilling, giving players a constant state of fear of attack as they interacted with the map and other players. Yet the devs have removed this sequence, and all forms of gameplay that it complimented, because it is less appealing to the dominant demographic of children. 

I suppose you think I'm salty. Well... I am. I enjoyed Unturned, as much as I have any other game, but it's been distorted beyond recognition from the game which I, and many others, loved years ago.

According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

With my almost 200 hours recorded playing this game, I have discovered quite a few things. A few updates ago, they had introduced so many new items that really added some new characteristics into the game. One such thing was the addition of tanks. A vehicle that could shoot had never been introduced before into Unturned, and it has proven to be a hit among players like me. The workshop content is absolutely endless, with mods ranging from the little things to some gamechangers. The multiplayer system in Unturned is really something else, with private and public servers alike. The texturing could be a bit better in the game, but I can understand that they want as many people as possible to be able to enjoy the unique experience Unturned brings to the Free-to-play section on Steam. To sum it up, Unturned has great gameplay, intriguing additions every so often, and a one of a kind experience that I am glad I can enjoy just as much as anyone else can.",1487215111,1487215111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game focuses on you being a little naked person with minecraft graphics running around looting and scavenging. If you're playing single player, you really lose out on the much bigger and more interesting aspect: the online multiplayer. My computer is a shitty 2010 prehistoric laptop that functions better as an oversized paperweight than a computer and it still runs this game fine. The online is a lot of fun, and there are plenty of servers for any way you want to play. Do you want to play in a server with no pvp and everyone is banding together to create the ultimate base? Go ahead! Do you want a brutally difficult server where you struggle through a harsh snowy canadian environment and just barely scrap together enough supplies to not freeze and starve to death in a day? Go for it! Do you want a regular meat-and-potatoes pvp/pve clan/faction server? There's plenty of servers like that! I even tried some of the survival/last man standing game modes. Pretty fun. This game appeals to the people that want a survival zombie game but don't want to spend hours and hours scavenging to get a wimpy pistol. If you spend hours and hours on this game, you'll soon find yourself with a healthy collection of guns, tools, a decent base, and some food and water. 

Pros: game looks like a saturday morning cartoon/minecraft adventure game.
Runs well on even the worst computer
Wide variety of weapons, vehicles, and towns
Survival is tons of fun when you get deep into it
It's free!

In the middle:
This game is casual. Take that however you want.

Cons: 
The flying vehicles operate like a whale with an eating disorder
Popular servers have clans that treat the game like real life
admin abuse is sadly pretty common
making a good base is very tedious
Actually taking the time to develop your character rather than just hoarding guns, ammo, and food is a pain",1487212396,1487212396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've been playing this gaming since early 2.0 and before Nelson closed it down, Deadzone on Roblox, and I could say that this game has come far over the few years that Nelson has put into it.

With my 151 hours into the game I can say, that it's a free to roam game and as it keeps updating it's becoming more and more like many popular games, like Arma and Rust, but let's not forget that it has it's own little kick to it.

With this coming ot an end of my review, this game is really good and people looking back on this review should know that this game is a zombie survival/free roam game which you can play with your friends on servers and get really good looking skins for what the games graphics are.",1487195462,1487195462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

DayZ in a nutshell. basically any good Dayz review will apply here with the parts that fit into the mold.

fun with or without people.

luck based. you may get something good loot, sometimes bad loot

its free.... why would you not want a free game?
[h1] cons [/h1]
frame rates.... i expected to be able to run this game like the witcher 3 with nothing lower than 60, but i was let down. even for my rig carrying a I7 6700k and a gtx 1070 both overclocked still wouldnt stop the drops. 

kids can get kinda annoying. (pray you are on a PVP server)

First of all, it's great. The concept and the attention to detail is just incredible! The addition of the batteries in cars was really useful, and personally I enjoy it better this way. But there's just one small issue that's pushing me away from playing this game - the zombies.
Now, the zombies themselves are perfectly fine, but I haven't played this game for a while and to be honest, a lot of making the game much harder. I was on easy mode, and before, I have never died using my techniques. In fact, for 2 hours yesterday, 3 resets, in every one I didn't die, so it's nothing to do with my skill. However, in the 1st try this morning, no new updates if I'm not mistaken, I needed to get a little bit closer to the zombies. But surpisingly, I did not.

I couldn't see the zombies. There were no zombies within one game metre of me and I was checking all around me, crouching. Then, out of thin air, it seems, a zombie popped up and started hitting me. My natural instinct was to use my knife, so I clicked both ways and it wasn't working. There came a new zombie, and when I walked to the door, it wasn't there. There was no gap, where I came in was a wall.
In the end, I died. With all the items that wouldn't have been lost if the game didn't completely glitch out. If this doesn't solve, I might not play the game again until it is, because I haven't got the time to wait around, getting everything I lost all over again.
Apart from that, great game. I suggest ya'll play it =3",1487087229,1487087353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

if you are in an online server. Single player is the same but with no other people unless it's you and a friend.

What I also like is tha Nelson keeps working on it and that we are informed of everything he is doing to make the game better for us in anyway that he can, and there are many server at which to choose from. Now are the dislikes, and there aren't many dislike that I have for this game. What I dislike is only the amount of hackers there are and there aren't many and it suck when there is even one in the server. I highly, very highly recommend this game because it's a survival game that you have never seen before.

OK, this is an angry review of the game and gonna be 100% honest.
The game, is good it really is, I mean the fact that this was developped by a 16 year old is amazing. however, it still has lots of bugs here and there but I'm okay with as long as it doesn't affect the gameplay. here's a small little shitty review made by someone who has nothing else to do but this review, enjoy :)
[h1] Awesome things about the game :	[/h1]
- gathering loot, guns (lots of them!), medical supplies and building supplies takes time and I personaly like that.
- a vast amount of vehicles
- really good maps. 
- game constantly gets updated with more stuff!
- awesome modding community.


This is why I gave the review a thumbs up,  [b] HOWEVER	[/b] , if you're looking for a game where you can just team up with strangers and communicate with enemies before fighting or to trade, Then I don't recommend this game at all and this  is why I'm not playing any more, the community is bad. Servers are filled with people who just don't give a fuck and shoot you on sight without asking if you're friendly or not, they take all your loot, making the time you took to gather all the loot worthless. If you happen to kill them they would follow to get their loot back at all cost and just ruin the game for you (I'm speaking of experience here, it might differ for you). If you ever do manage to team up with strangers they would find a way to backstab you  the moment you least expect it (still talking from experience). 

[b] time for a little story:	[/b]
 
I was playing with my cousin and we found a really friendly group that we teamed up with, we became an actual working group and all,then we found another dude who befriended us for few days, he helped us build a base, fight bandits and we trusted him, until one day we were at a campground and he told us he a had a friend waiting for him. He told us to regroup and to holster our guns, I started to doubt something and started backing off, he said ""what i wanna tell you is..."" him and his friend start shooting us, I was the first one to die because I pulled out my gun. no one from my real group survived and they took our loot.

You could find people you can trust but you won't find a lot. Since most of the players are preteen kids, they will just shoot you and piss you off if you happen to kill them.
Not to mention some servers are just abused by admins, admins who are kids and would ban you for attacking them and use god mode.
One trick people use as well is remove the grass so that they can see you a mile away and would ruin your effect of surprise. I find that so annoying. 
And last but not least, hackers, but that's old news with BattleEye working with Unturned.


All in all, it's a survival game, so I expected to kill, and to be killed but I love cooperating with survivors. Unfortunately  most of them would kill me for my loot, there's 0 cooperation if you don't play with friends. 
If you're like me and likes to be as realistic as possible, if you want to communicate with other groups, to wage war or make peace and to trade, this is not a game for you. It became a game where only the simple rule is to ""kill all"".
The game has potential, but sadly the community ruined the game for me.

The other 2 go towards visuals, I really like them and how Nelson recently updated the tress so that they don't just look like   3D rectangles anymore.

The reason i didn't give 10 is because I think Nelson should work on making the game run smoother, my old laptop that i had with a Core 2 Duo and 4GB of ram was only running the game at around 15-20 FPS but yet again could run Garry's Mod alot smoother.

Anyone who has been playing for over an hour knows that surviving in this game is easier than being a pyro in tf2 or having an awp in cs go (very easy).  It has become a more of an open world pvp game with zombies to spice it up.  That is why KOS is all over the place, nothing else to do but kill people and take their juicy loot.  Some may hate this but me and my friends have learned to like it.  It turns the game into a massive tense, high staked pvp match.  I personally like this more than no KOS servers.   Trash talking 10 year olds serve as free loot to me since they are easy to kill.  I could care less about skins.  I see many people complain about how easy it is to raid bases.  A smart and thoughtful player can easily make a base designed to make raiding almost impossible.  One can use hidden rooms, hiding the base its self, and strategically placed sentries to hide loot boxes.  Great combat accept the honeybadger is retardedly op.

The major problem with this game is not nelson, its the servers.  Around 90% of the servers if find are tpa, /kit, feasts, or some other plug in infested mess.  These plugins serve the people who don't are bad and prefer to have high grade loot just given to them.  This destroys the unique punch this game offers.  When you kill a looted military player in a vanilla server and take their stuff, you feel like a god with all the sick loot you got.  On these feast servers, military loot is so common that I would end up killing people so i can sell their inventory and get enough money to basically become an admin.  Bring back vanilla servers that show how great unturned can really be.  If you find a good vanilla server with a few friends who are good, prepare to have the time of your life.

Some minor complaints: there is no reason why lmgs should be able to shoot through walls.  Charges are for that.  Lmgs should serve the role of destroying strong vehicles such as apcs and military aircraft.  

-Calling card too rare at the moment. 
- Horde beacon gives too much reward.  
-Drop shotting is op and annoying, a way to fix it is make the player very innaccurate for a short while after going prone.  -Third person gets rid of 90% of the recoil.  
-Fire zombies are just annoying.  
-Shot guns need a tone down in damage.  
-Hind gun should shoot explosive rounds (like shaddow stalker).  
-Minigun needs buff. 
-Honeybadger broken
-buff suppressors
-Fix the broken and misleading rarity system. (example: aug is epic and the aug scope is legendary...?)
-Make bigger maps (even russia is small when you can fly accross it in a minute)
-Ekho should be found in military locations as well as deadzones (russia)
-Deadzones do not spawn enough loot (russia)
-Claim flags shouldnt be able to morph inside walls
-Make a hot bar at the bottom of hud
-To keep new players playing, allow people to spawn with flashlight and a small amount of foot (like in 2.0)
-Change the color of russia and pei military gear so it doesn't blend in with environment, this makes ghillie suit obsolete
-turn spec ops beret into a helmet
-tone down sniper damage to vehicles a bit (to keep the grizzly from being an anti aircraft gun)
-toxicity shouldn't decrease when below 50%, this is just annoying
-Have some dedicated servers for vanilla maps

All of these are simple problems with simple fixes (accept for the last one).
This may seem like a negative review, but if i made a list for the good things, it would be the length of the bible.

Sonic celebrates his 15th anniversary by blazing his way onto the next-generation consoles, with his first adventure set in the human world. Featuring interactive 3D environments and a large cast of returning and new characters, get ready for the reinvention of Sonic The Hedgehog, in his most intense, high velocity escapade to date. [Sega]. Amazing game. Could never say Sonic is a bad game but one thing that really ticks me off is the loading. Worst of all, if you do a challenge. It will load, then the person will give you a one liner on what you have to do, then it will load again! It's even worse if you fail the mission because you've go to go through it all over again. Another thing is the silly mini-games. Sonic has to save the world BUT before he does, he has the option of solving a silly puzzle? The Stages are amazing though. Beautiful graphics.You simply can't ask for more out of an action game. Mission accomplished. Sonic is born anew.

Starting off with nothing you have to loot things like City,Towns and military bases. Another thing I like is that you can only find certain things in certain places. Like you can't find a Sniper in just a normal city. But go to a Military Base and you will probably find one.

(Quick Facts)
Pros
-Basic Grapics 
-Good pvp and pve
-Easy to learn how to play
-Building is ok...(It could be better)
(Note these are some Pros not all :D)

Cons
-If your in it for just pvp it could be hard to find people and weapons
-With some servers I lost connection over and over but its just the Host server it has nothing to do with the game.
-If you dont team up with a friend it does feel kinda boring so if you have someone to play with you will have a better time
-If you died you will rage because you lose all your stuff :D

Unturned is a survival game about finding loot, vehicles, equiptment, building bases, fighting players, or zombies, and simply survivng as long as you can. Although the graphics are obviously not amazing, the gameplay is what makes the game fun and worthwhile. The possibilities are endless with this game, there is no set code, or way to survive you have to follow, and I really love that. Now to go in depth. (Pros and cons at bottom)

LOOTING: This is actually the reason I love this game so much, unlike DayZ or Miscreated, loot is a lot easier to come by, but it's still not to the point where everybody is OP and going to kill you in a fight. You can play on Easy, Normal, or Hard mode servers, and those will determine how obviously easy it is to survive. Here's an example, I can be geared to the point of being able to defend myself from players and zombies in about 30-45 minutes, on an easy server. 10/10

MAPS: There are a couple maps to choose: PEI is the smallest map with only a few cities, great for a Kit PVP server. Washington is mid-sized with many cities and landmarks, personally one of my favorites for survival. Russia is the biggest map, very great for survival, but if you don't have TPA, it can be hard to meet your friends and you may not encounter players often. On top of these maps, there is Monolith, Alpha Valley and Paintball Arena, which are all PVP arena type gamemodes (Hunger Games.) 

GAMEPLAY: It's so basic, but it just works, you gain experience by killing zombies and doing various basic tasks, you can upgrade your stats, such as Stamina or Accuracy. You run around and loot various locations to find loot. You can cut down trees to get wood and start a base, obtain more materials to upgrade your base. Surviving along the way, it's notn too hard, not too easy, it just works perfectly.

GUNPLAY: You can obtain various attachments for your weapons (Scopes, Barrels, Grips, Etc.) You obviously must have the correct ammo for your gun and from there just aim and fire. The gunplay is nothing special, it's often just who gets more headshots and can't bandage quicker, but for a game like this, that I feel is more of an Arcade survival game, you don't really need to be so in depth with gunfights as example Arma 3, where you have to zero your scope and account for range and all. 

ZOMBIES: Easy mode zombies: They all are the standing kind of zombie, most of them don't take too many hits to kill. Normal Mode: This adds Laying down zombies and ones that run on all 4 and chase you faster than the others.
Hard Mode: This adds zombies that can spit at you, catch you on fire and various other abilities.

BASE BUILDING: Very, very simple, you just collect resources, craft a foundation, craft walls and craft a roof, then add on from there, again, very simple, but it works in a game like this.

SERVERS: This is where this game has potential to be unfair, but there is nothing we can do about it. Often times what will happen is the Server owners will be admins, but disguised, and as you'd expect when nobody knows you're an admin, you spawn in gear, everybody will just think you're a great player, not an admin. As well as spawning gear a lot of them will TPA to their friends, because even if there isn't TPA plugin, admins can still teleport to players or locations. There are servers though that don't do this, it's really a rare occurance. 

SERVER HOSTING: You will have so much fun! Server hosting is so easy, even a fly could do it, as long as your pc can run a server, you and your friends can host private sessions, host servers with your own rules, or just test things out. It's really great, and I'm glad Nelson made hosting this easy. (Port forwarding isn't hard once you learn how to do it, and it's the same for every game except the port)

WORKSHOP: Tons of cool items and maps and mods to try out.

COMMUNITY: The one thing I dislike, the majority of the time the community either doesn't have a mic, or are young kids, half of which speak Spanish. 

PROS:
Looting is not too hard
Gunplay is not too in depth
Multiple Maps
Tons of Items
Easy server hosting
100% Fun
No 2 experiences will be the same

CONS:
Community is young kids
Graphics aren't the best
Often, whoever has better gear will be victorious
Admins abuse power sometimes
Occassional Bugs

Overall, for a free game, this is great. This game delivers more than some survival games I've dished out a lot of money for. Definetely try it out if you like Survival games that aren't too hardcore.

Back in Unturned 2.0 when this game first came out, it was not the only multiplayer open world apocalyptic survival game out there, but it was different from DayZ and H1Z1. Unturned wasn't a hobby it was a lifestyle, I know it sounds crazy but there would be these crazy vibes like getting up on a cold december morning on a snowday and skipping breakfast to just play unturned with all your friends. But later as the game developed on it turned into more of a game like DayZ and H1Z1, I think that the developer is doing a great job with his game despite being a student in school. But only recently I think that this game has taken a turn. First off you can't be very creative, building bases is boring, if you take a game like minecraft, you can do anything to hide a base because you could build secret trap doors and cool little things like that. Also Unturned is getting very repititve. The whole sequence of a unturned pvp server is:
1) Build a base
2) Get raided
No longer is it a challenge to raid bases when you could simply shoot the door with a LMG. Also the shooting and the action of this game has turned into something like BLOCKADE 3D. If you load our your skills theres no recoil on almost 75% of all full-auto guns, also adding to the third person aspect with people complaining about popshotters and stuff. Speaking of people complaining, the community is very toxic and hostile, everybody gets pissed when someone raids ther sh!t-shack on top of a hill. Thats all I have to say about this game, it has turned from a great idea in the past to a game that you'll play when theres nothing else to do on a boring saturday.

Final notes:
Don't get me wrong, I love this game and the idea of it
I've made so many friends in this game and some that I've even met with in real life
The platform it runs on is perfect for your dad's laptop that you play on while he's not working
Lastly, Nelson Sexton the developer is a very bright kid, I love what he's done and I hope he continues what he's doing, instead I think he should listen to the community a bit more, I know his email is spammed with a bunch of 12 year olds but he needs to solve a problem here and find a way to fufill what the audiance wants.

And for all of those who know me,
Love your good old squeaker,

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.

Unturned is like a modern minecraft with a primary focus on zombies.  

It is a work in progress.  The zombies stand in one place and stop at the edge of the city.  There is one big zombie but he is easily kited. 

There are parts for weapons that don't exist.  You can build a base but no one attacks it without a 'beacon.'  How do you build a beacon?  Do you feel like reading the wiki?   Does your steel building and tank trap base look cool?  Do you have several crates of assault rifle clips?  Why is this lake saltwater?   Does this hooded sweatshirt look cooler?   

Basically, a ton of possibility.  I read multiplayer is brutal.  Playing alone gives you a real solid you are last person alive sensation, if you're into that.  If you just want to kill zombies and pick up 57% grape soda at the post apocalyptic 711, this is definitely for you.",1485315962,1485315962,True,1,0,0.49853438138961792,0,True,False,True

Unturned is a post-apocalyptic FPS which takes place in a number of maps, e.g. PEI (Canada), Washington (US), Yukon (Canada), and Russia.. (Russia :P), and hundreds of others that can be downloaded from the Steam: Workshop. This game should be played (in my opinion) with multiple friends, although it is still fairly fun on your own Campaign map. I would say that Unturned is one of, or the best F2P on Steam, and if you like it enough, you can pay small fee of $5 for cosmetics and crap. So, now I'll take a look at the Pros, and Cons..


Pros:
The game gets updated almost every
week or so it seems (sometime faster)
It's... free
The PvP aspect is hyper-realistic
Zombies are cool
Simplistic graphics, and easy to run


Cons:
There are none, from my perspective


Overall, I would say I definitely recommend this game
to all kinds of gamers, whether you're Casual, Hardcore, or just don't know how to play games...

Very good Singleplayer but the most attractive option is playing on a multiplayer server with your friend or going to make one ingame. Fighting against other players is pretty fun and dying from their hands is not disapointing so you are still playing without that bad feelings you may have in other Unturned like titles. Requirements are really good but aren't that low as you may think... If you wanna play it in 60 FPS (on 24 players multiplayer) the ""must have"" is 4 core CPU and 4 Gigs of RAM. Graphics card is not that important,  512 MB VRAM should be enough. I hope my opinion will be helpful. I really recomend this game. If you like games like that, you must try it.

I'll start with cons;
Sadly this is one of those games i call 'What Next' because i have an enormous base everything ill ever need but alas What Next like Project Zomboid, Minecraft, 7 Days To Die, Terraria, Ark and sadly so many more I find myself stuck with nothing left to do there is no story and with multiplayer like Dayz just people shooting on sight

However 
Other than that the game is flawless no noticable flaws alot less hackers then back in the day 
Gameplay is smooth 
Graphics are retro-ish and great
Nothing too overpowered 
Realistic

There are 3 types of servers to play on. First is the normal survival server, You can find them vanilla or modded. Second Is the RP server where it can be  a survival expirience. Some RP servers are only jobs where as others are shops and survival. Third is the creatie server, kind of like minecraft you can spawn in anything you want. Normally they are modded but some are not. I will now list pros and cons.

Free
Replay ability
Multiplayer
Social
Fun

Sometimes there are gold server where you have to pay for premium
