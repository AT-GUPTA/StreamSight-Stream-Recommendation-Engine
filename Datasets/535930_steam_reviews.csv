Two Point Hospital is the perfect 1990s & early-2000s Tycoon/Management game.

[*] Square grid system⠀[i](none of that ""freeform"" modernity)[/i]
[*] Few but enjoyable gameplay mechanics⠀[i](not a job simulator)[/i]
[*] Beginner friendly yet fairly difficult to master
[*] Simple and fun customization⠀[i](no choosing wood type for 10cm of your wall)[/i]

Two Point Hospital is a hospital simulator game that adds just enough silliness to keep things interesting. The illnesses are all fictional so there is no worry of triggering content there. And even if you fail to cure a patient, they just turn into ghost and (rightfully) terrorize your staff until a janitor sucks it up in a vacuum cleaner. Each new hospital has three levels of challenges to complete and there are plenty of levels to play. Don't worry about being overwhelmed early on, as the different diseases are introduced slowly so you have time to collect money to build your treatment rooms.
There are additional game play modes with Co-op challenges to get special items, DLC locations, and an impressive Sandbox mode.

In addition, there are so many extra items in the workshop that you can download or even create yourself.

The repetitive nature of the game becomes apparent as you progress, with each level feeling like a rinse-and-repeat cycle of building the same rooms over and over again. Once you've optimized a GP office or a treatment room, there's little incentive to deviate from the formula, leading to a sense of monotony.

My biggest gripe with Two Point Hospital, however, is its lackluster solo experience. Many items are locked behind group projects, forcing players to either team up with strangers on Steam or pester friends to participate. Alternatively, some items are tied to social media groups, requiring additional sign-ups or logins.

This reliance on social interaction and daily tasks to unlock content feels more suited to mobile games than a PC title, especially considering the upfront cost. It's disheartening to see a game I've had for years become more about habit-building and fear of missing out than genuine enjoyment.

Despite its potential, the game's emphasis on social engagement and repetitive gameplay has left me feeling unmotivated to even launch it. For a game that promises a trip down memory lane, it's a disappointing realization.",1686058069,1707255743,False,58,0,0.731249868869781494,0,True,False,False

From a return-on-investment perspective, this game masterfully balances cost efficiency and revenue generation, creating a virtual healthcare empire that would make any shareholder swoon.

The financial dynamics at play here are nothing short of extraordinary. The revenue streams from patient treatments, coupled with strategic investment in state-of-the-art medical equipment, synergize to deliver a robust bottom line. The cost-to-income ratio is finely tuned, resembling the precision of a high-frequency trading algorithm.

The game's expansion packs are akin to diversified investment portfolios, providing additional revenue channels and shareholder value appreciation. Each new hospital is not just a medical facility but a lucrative asset in the portfolio of Two Point Corporation, delivering both immediate and long-term returns.

The personnel management aspect mirrors the delicate art of human capital optimization. Balancing staff salaries against their productivity, ensuring that the wage-to-output ratio aligns with market benchmarks, is a testament to Two Point Hospital's commitment to operational excellence and sustainable profitability.

While the whimsical ailments of the patients may tug at the heartstrings, the finance bro within remains laser-focused on the bottom line. The game offers a cathartic experience, where curing ailments is synonymous with maximizing revenue per patient visit, elevating the shareholder value proposition.

In conclusion, Two Point Hospital is not merely a healthcare simulation; it's a financial symphony orchestrating shareholder value maximization. For the finance bro seeking the thrill of strategic decision-making and fiscal prowess, this game is an exhilarating journey where every diagnosis leads to a healthier balance sheet. It's a financial rollercoaster, and in the world of Two Point Hospital, the only cure needed is the relentless pursuit of profit.",1704470814,1704470814,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUGS:

Don't know what DLC caused it but there is sometimes a bug in the game where a fired staff member gets stuck in the hospital.

Positives:
[list]
[*] The game is well optimised: it runs smoothly at full resolution on a Mac with M1, though I have to lower the graphics quality to reduce heat. It only lags a bit when I have a huge 20+ levels hospital.
[*] The graphics are great. The art style is funny and adorable.
[*] The soundtrack is impeccable. Relaxing and enjoyable after even 100+ hours.
[*] The illnesses, their visual and description, their treatment room, their curing, are all hilarious.
[*] Numerous items to design and decorate your dream hospital, ideal for those players who love building.
[*] For those who would rather focus on the management side, it will be reassuring to know that building and decorating effort is not strictly necessary to run a perfect hospital. This game allows you to create functional and highly optimised rooms without much ado. You can then use the same template in each of your hospital.
[*] Very well-designed levels, with an extremely smooth learning curve. You just need to play through the career mode to learn progressively different elements of the gameplay. I wish other simulation /management games have a similar learning curve! However, the game itself does not directly give you enough hints about how to optimise your hospital quantitatively. For that part, one should definitely refer to the greatest guide for TPH, written by Freiya: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1519429114. After mastering the concepts in this guide, the mechanics of the game basically becomes so transparent that one can easily obtain most of the achievements.

Negatives:
[list]
[*] The management side of the game is somewhat shallow. So it becomes a little bit repetitive (needs tons of micromanagements) in the late game, especially if you have mastered the concepts in Freiya's guide: in each hospital, you follow basically the same routine.
[*] The DLCs are too expensive, consider that they mostly only add new items and new illnesses but not much new mechanics to the base game. Up till now, TPH has 6 major DLCs. These 6 DLCs in total have roughly the same amount of content as the base game itself, but they cost twice as much.
[*] The AI of patients and staff has some bugs. Occasionally, they don't go to the toilet, or eat, or drink, even when they are desperate.
[/list]

All in all, I strongly recommend this game. For casual players, maybe just get the base game, and buy the DLCs later if you want more of the same experience. However, if you are fans of Theme Hospital or if you are into simulation & management games, I recommend getting all the DLCs to have the most complete experience of this title, and to support Two Point Studios for their upcoming titles! Two Point Campus is also out now, perhaps Two Point Theme Park won't be too far away?

More info on game length:
[list]
[*] The base game has 15 hospitals, which takes around 30 hours to get at least one star from each hospital. To get all the achievements from the base game, it takes around 100 hours. The base game has a sandbox mode, which offers even more replayability.
[*] Each DLC has 3 new hospitals, with tons of new illness (part of which are visual illness; they are as hilarious as those in the base game), new items (mostly cosmetic, only several items are of good value in terms of strategy), and new objectives to complete (some are creative and enjoyable to accomplish, and some others are excruciatingly painful). For each DLC, it takes 15–20 hours to get all 5 related achievements.
[/list]
So, in total, it takes nearly 200 hours to get 100% achievements.",1627226636,1704050913,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The idea is to manage a hospital from a humour point of view. But it totally fails in his attempt. In the end, it gets boring having to place a lot of random items in rooms over an over again in order to get prestige. 
The way characters behave gets annoying. Sometimes staff members can't find the ""Staff room"" even if it is in front of them. Another example are patients coming for an emergy, sometimes they will start walking to random hospital areas wasting a lot of time instead of going to their treatment room.

I can't say much possitive things about a game company when their game is divided in a lot of expensive pieces.

I came here for the same reason most of the people are here, for Theme Hospital. So, my disappointment was very big when I played this sad attempt to emulate a successful classic.",1535694327,1703867384,False,2,0,0.543630897998809814,0,True,False,False

Because the impacts of your choices, of placement of objects, amounts of doctors or rooms, are directly visible in the game play. It takes a bit of time figuring out on Wiki why happiness of staff or patients is important and how it affects the game, but once you spend a bit of time learning the basics, it goes uphill from there. (meaning it gets better).

The only 'beef' I have with this game, is that it does not clearly say what affects what or how. For example Two Point made a statement in not writing any numbers on any of the items. Which is annoying, but once you visit the Wiki enough, you will quickly find your favorites and will know what you are doing.

Copying items would be nice too, and I don't think they will implement it. But at least know that on the top left you have a ""filter"", so you can search for your items without having to scroll up and down to find it.

Overall, it is a very addicting game, with fun visuals and very funny 'diseases' and descriptions. But it is a good Sim as well, in a sense that it makes sense why certain things affect others and it is a great game for those who like to 'micro manage' their workers, as oppose to 'macro manage' (like two point campus).

If you like Sim games that are for fun but also make sense, then this game is for you!",1703860333,1703860333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fun, dynamic, plenty of missions to do and a sandbox. You can play this game for hours and you won't even notice. I like the funny sicknesses and the machines to cure them, very creative. Once you get into it, you know what to do for making a cool hospital. Even when each hospital comes with some new challenges, it's not something that you could manage once you learn how to deal with it.

If you want a game for having fun at your own pace and that you will be able to play whenever you want and come back to it, this is one great option to pick. Considering the competition or games that are in the same hospital management category, I don't think there's something better that Two Point Hospital. The OST is pretty cool, I love to play with it, but if you're into your own shit, you can play your music instead. That's a nice feature. There are collaborative tasks if you have friends with the game that unlock items very useful for your hospitals. 

I would totally recommend this game to any city builder's lovers, tycoon builder's lovers, management game's lovers, etc. And for the prize you can get this when there are offers, is a must.

I love this game, and I feel really relaxed when playing it. Some might complain about the difficulty being too easy. I might agree to a small degree. But really, this game would get frustrating really quick if you constantly had to fight the systems to stay on top of things. I do agree however that it is really, really difficult to play this game so badly that you'd have to start a level over. But then again, I don't really want to.

[h1] The Game [/h1]
Hospital simulator where you build and manage hospitals while completing different objectives and challenging scenarios.

[h1] The Achievements [/h1]
Be aware that there are several long and grindy achievements, which also require multiple DLC for completion. There are some guides and tips available but as you progress throughout the game you learn certain mechanics and strategies that will get you through most, if not all, of the hospitals. Estimated completion time depend somewhat on skill but you can expect well over 100-150+ hours.

[h1] Recommendation [/h1]
At its core, the game is pretty solid with good management, mechanics and scenarios. The problem lies within its length where you don't get much variation with every hospital and DLC. Due to the completion time required I wish I could give this game a neutral recommendation, but as it stands I will give it a positive recommendation.

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

When I first checked into Two Point Hospital, I was ready to scrub up for what I thought would be a whimsical jaunt through medicine's lighter side. I expected to perform complex surgeries and manage a team of quirky doctors. Instead, I found myself playing what felt like a never-ending game of whack-a-mole with bizarre illnesses and a hospital that runs with the efficiency of a sloth on sedatives.

Graphically, the game is like a cartoon come to life. The bright and exaggerated art style adds charm and makes the endless tide of patients with ""Light-Headedness"" (yes, their heads are actually lightbulbs) somewhat bearable. However, compared to the visual humor and detail of games like ""Theme Hospital,"" the jokes here feel as recycled as the hospital magazines.

Gameplay-wise, the game promises to flatline your boredom, but the vital signs aren't strong. It's all fun and games until you realize that managing the hospital is as repetitive as the PA system's bad jokes. The game tries to inject humor into the management sim genre, but it's like laughing gas at a root canal – it helps, but you're still in pain.

As for the management mechanics, they are about as deep as a kiddie pool in a drought. You'll find more complexity and engagement in a game like ""Planet Coaster,"" where every decision feels impactful. Here, you're left feeling like the hospital administrator who lost the manual.

In conclusion, Two Point Hospital might tickle your funny bone initially, but the humor is as superficial as a band-aid on a broken leg. It's a lighthearted take on hospital management that unfortunately doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors. It's not exactly malpractice, but it's not the peak of health either.",1699548334,1699548334,False,2,0,0.467308878898620605,0,True,False,False

First - if you are unsure, then just do it. It is a very fun game. It seems a lot of people compare this to Theme Hospital which I used to play as a teen. At first I thought it was a blatant rip off until I learned the original developers were involved with this. And it shows. The same exact quirkiness, humour and game play style is apparent, if not even more honed. I love that the same elements of the original game were kept, while adding many more new concepts and ideas. I also love the fact that alot of tings that just didn't function correctly in the original are now working as they should. I had to relearn some strategy as I assumed things worked as they had long ago, and I had to learn the hard way that these things function now. There are still issues of course. Nothing I feel is worth mentioning. I love this game. If I had to say anything negative, I would point out that the option to link amazon/hospital pass advertised on the main screen is outdated, the interface is a bit clunky - especially adding items and scrolling for ages, there seems to be a delay/freeze when opening menus and after month ends, and some things just are not well explained when you first encounter them.

Actually you build many hospitals in the career mode and with all the DLCs which add diseases, rooms and animations to the base game.

I think the most important thing about this game is that it's very, very funny. That's a rare thing among video games nowadays. You can't not smile when you see a cheerful Elvis Presley walking in the hospital halls. Add to that a hundred more funny disorders and hilarious audio announcements and you can get an idea about how funny this game is.

Otherwise, TPH is a classic tycoon game, with research, money and staff management and, of course, patient care and coaxing. The complexity is variable through the missions, some are hard or grindy, some are simple. 

Pros:
- graphics
- humour all over the place, no spot left untouched
- very long game, especially with all the DLC's
- customizable rooms very easy to build with many, many hilarious decorations
- addictive: when you finish a mission, you can't wait to begin the next one
- relaxing and satisfying to see your hospital going about its business like an ant farm
- music (I love it, one of the best)

- DLCs content is not integrated in the main game, i.e. it's available only in the DLC's missions.",1695974266,1695974266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I did spend almost 200 hours to finish the game with all 3 stars mission. It was fun.

The fact that some items are only activable by playing together seems a tad bit unnecessary and forcing the cooperative play mode.

Sometimes you simply have to wait to get to a 3 star hospital which seems a bit unengaging in the long term.

The illnesses and room to cure them are funny though. The problem is that it's always build A first, then B, then C. There's not really that much variation in the playthroughs. I don't see me playing the sandbox mode to be honest if it's similar.

Ingame ads for a different game is a bit much though.

 The design build characters rooms and system all works poorly for making people well and making money to do so. 
Fixing a broken Game put the cost of everything to Max all but GP Office lower it to about 10% and let that run until you have built almost everything and are doing good and later lower all them a few clicks to bring in more customers and another startup to do for sure is set the staff payment to the lowest amount and give them all their Promotion they ask for this sound crazy but it fixes the broken billing system this game has built in.  Noted that if you look it set to half way that is way to much to start out for sure.  One other tip to make the game work is later look at staff info they will start to get tired hire one added member for each room as needed and use training room to get more jobs they can do.  Note you will not need this room until way after all other rooms Cardiology room.   JUST DO THESE STEPS AND EVERY START OUT WILL DO FINE!
The #1 reason for thumbs down the older version i played way back in 98 windows was not so good looking but the game was super fun and funny this game has none of the core element in this game as the older version mostly in the way it plays.

Building the hospital is a tedious affair as you divide up the space and place the basic equipment, then you're introduced to the clutter - items the game categorises as 'decorations', most of which just exist to raise the hospitals 'attractiveness' and 'prestige' bars. They are largely gated behind a special currency that exists to drip feed you more clutter. Some of them give tiny bonuses to things but this is the only area any of the developer's innovation can be found as the rest of the game is pretty much identical to the 1997 release.

Gameplay gets old fast as you run into the usual management sim mechanics: balance your budget and wait to earn enough cash to expand your facilities to do more of the same. The game is littered with the same dad joke humour Bullfrog games were famous for which becomes tired by the 2nd of 15 levels, each of which follows the same formula of setting up the hospital and earning more than you spend.

Nothing special here sadly. The only substantive addition to this game is the aforementioned clutter system and when the developer's only innovation is on cosmetics that's a red flag. If you need proof look no further than the slew of cash grab DLC which can be sorted into three types: more of the same, reskins, and cosmetics.

- there are a few very tedious chores you have to do to 3 star every hospital, such as vaccinating epidemic patients (you basically have to stare at your screen waiting for someone to give off a rare symptom) or getting the hygiene rating up to 90% (one of the most difficult and boring tasks in the game).
- the vast majority of items in the game just increase attractiveness of the hospital. very few actually do anything else useful. would love to see a better mix of item uses.

Pros: (everything else)

- Balancing your economy and cure rate is fun once you have a working strategy for doing it.
- The radio stations and tannoy operator are hilarious
- Once the devs added room copy-pasting and templates the game went from tedious to fun
- The game does a great job of keeping the feel of the old Theme Hospital while updating the mechanics for today's audiences.

Overall a fantastic game but DOES take some getting used to. A lot of working strategies don't make a lot of sense, but once you figure them out it will be smooth sailing. That having been said, you basically won't run into any of the cons I mentioned if  you only want to 1-star the hospitals (which is all you need to unlock all the hospitals in the game).  You will only struggle (with both reasonable and unreasonable challenges) if you're a completionist and insist on 3-starring every hospital.",1644258379,1688037059,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That being said it's extremely gratifying and addicting, I even rage quit at one point and just couldn't stay away from it. Theme Hospital was one of the games that got me started as a wee lad so the nostalgia factor was present in the beginning, but man this game is way more difficult. Eventually I did ""git gud"" and figured out how to raise treatment prices and spam pharmacies, start very slow and work your way up, how to teach and maximise staff efficiency ect and man it feels so good to say I finished the whole base game. I love all the sound effects and music and the DJ/voice over is really cute and hilarious at times. Definitely some missions with real ""screw you"" tedious af objectives that were very frustrating and required multiple restarts. Also if you listen to your little adviser dude or giving patients what they want as they request it you'll lose, so it's kinda stupid the game doesn't give you very good advise past the first few missions I had to watch some youtube videos to learn how some aspects work. The DLC also seems pretty greedy and I ended up not buying any seems like a lot of bloat, totally fine with just the base game plenty of content. Overall this is the type of game I use to love but I kinda lost touch with, but maybe this resparked my enjoyment of the genre.

I have a doctor's appointment coming up and I'm going to bring it on my Steam Deck (yes, it plays on it, but I still use a bluetooth mouse with it in portable mode - can't speak to how to deck or a controller works on it as I use the mouse when I'm on PC too) but at my doc's appointment I'm going to bring it on my Deck, play it loud until they come check out what I am doing,  I'll be sure to point out how much better a little video game can run medically more efficiently than they do. :P  Then again if they didn't make me wait 3 hours after my scheduled appointment time I wouldn't have anything else to do except stare at other patients that are ahead of me and have been waiting since 1987.  Now I can play and set up a better medical experience than they offer; no patients bored waiting in my queue! ;P

It's a well done enjoyable and totally chill kind of sim.  Sit back and take your time, or rush through. It's your call and regardless of how you choose to play it, it's a lot of fun.  I wasn't sure about if I should get it, but snagged it on sale and can honestly say I would pay the full price for it knowing there's so much to it.  I'm only 9 hours in and know for a fact that this is a keeper that will long outlive a lot of my other games.  I didn't get any DLC yet but I like knowing it's there when I get through it.  That being said I know it will take awhile as I'm heavy into micro-managing in the game already so I can get every bit of fun and goodness out of it!

Good game, lots to enjoy with it - it's a game you can play however you want to without following a structured plan.  For me, it's in micro-managing (you don't have to, but I'm glad it's there), and getting attached to what I've created, the staff I've hired and I plan on being the top hospital company in all award categories there are out there in Two Point County.  Big tech, look out!  :D

I'd give it a solid 9 out of 10 in my book if you're really into simulation games and milking the game for every bit of fun you can get out of it.  That said, there's a lot to be had! Could be a perfect 10, but in this far I'm already happy with a 9 such a short time in.  Who knows, I could update my review after having spent more  time with it as I know there's so much ahead waiting for me to explore and crazy illnesses to cure ahead!

On a side note, I don't recommend getting it just for the Deck alone without using it docked in conjunction with a big screen or a larger monitor. It's just easier to set up the scenarios and hospitals on the  PC.  Once you get a hold of how it's set up and plays, the Deck is great and you can follow along well knowing about icons and stuff.  I must say I was tickled at how it is on the Deck, but the PC is better for initial setting up of your hospitals.  

No matter if you play it on PC or the little screen, (or enjoy on both like me),  it's a game of big fun - good times if fun and slightly silly sims are your thing.",1683925956,1683925956,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it has its moments of fun, it ultimately falls short in providing an engaging experience due to its lack of challenge. Money is not a true obstacle, as players can simply wait until they have enough money to progress. Additionally, the game does not present enough situations where players need to truly manage their staff, hospitals, and illnesses. As a result, the game can feel overly simplistic.

For example, having the ability to assign janitors to specific buildings would not only make the game more efficient, but it would also add a layer of realism. It's frustrating to see janitors running back and forth between buildings for small tasks when they could be assigned to a specific area to handle all the tasks.

Customizing each room in the game should be a major feature, but it falls short. While certain decorations give bonuses to a room, others don't provide any benefit. It's difficult to see the point of adding a decorative item like a plant that has no function, when you could instead place a medicine cabinet that improves the chances of a correct diagnosis. Although some players might argue that decor is important, I found that placing a picture behind the medicine cabinets achieves the same effect without sacrificing valuable space.

While Two Point Hospital is a decent enough management simulation game, it falls short in providing an engaging experience due to its lack of challenge and complexity. If you are looking for a game that truly tests your management skills, you may want to look elsewhere.",1567201529,1681561416,False,9,0,0.551893174648284912,0,True,False,False

The art style and atmosphere prominently displayed in its marketing materials feature a parade of gurning sub-Aardman plasticine figures and a Facebook feed’s worth of dad jokes; a distinctly British kind of cringeworthy. I am also one of the seemingly few millennials not to have played Theme Hospital in my youth, meaning I come to this unapologetically nostalgia-fueled management sim with a skeptical eye. Then, opening up the game, it promptly spams you with Sega-branded ads for Sonic the Hedgehog© and the dev’s follow-up game. The opening trailer features an American drawl and ker-azy antics at odds with the rest of the game’s humour. To top it all, the ECG trace on the logo isn’t accurate. But if, like me, you have the intellectual fortitude to overlook such superficial blemishes, how does Two Point Hospital fare as a management game?

It's fantastic.

Two Point Hospital offers a series of satisfying nested micro-challenges that add up to a supremely satisfying whole. Patients will first trickle, then flood, into your hospital with an increasingly challenging array of ailments. These sickly human cash machines will need to be filtered through a series of GP appointments and investigations before a diagnosis is made and treatment is delivered for big bucks. At first, a few doctors and nurses can staff a handful of clinic rooms and a pharmacy to quash basic ailments. As both each level and the campaign progress, however, you’ll need to expand an array of diagnostics and specialised treatment rooms in order to keep financially afloat. Patients will cr- ah, defaecate, vomit and die inconsiderately unless their needs are met, covering the hospital in filth and – more importantly – depriving you of the payouts associated with treatment. This means you’ll need to employ assistants to keep patients happy, fed and watered, and janitors to scrub the decks. But they, in turn, will demand wages, break rooms and even decent working conditions. All of which costs more money. So far, so realistic.

Adding nuance are detailed systems of interior design, training, research and upgradable equipment. All involve interesting trade-offs. Training makes your staff more effective, for instance, and allows you to cultivate the specialist diagnosticians, psychiatrists, surgeons and radiologists needed to keep your machine operating efficiently in the latter levels, but also pulls both teacher and student out of the workforce for the duration of the class. To increase efficiency, you can train multiple staff in the same field, provided they all need to study the same course, but this will deplete your workforce more acutely. Call in an external tutor to take off some pressure, or learn a new skill, and you’ll need to cough up a quite chuck of change. Each of Two Point Hospital’s systems likewise offers an array of balanced options to juggle, and while the game will rarely punish you irrevocably for failure, disaster can spiral outward in fun and unpredictable ways. A horde of prematurely mummified patients descending but nowhere to treat them? No worries, take out a loan, throw up a couple of decrypters, hire some skilled nurses and get to it. Ah, but your janitors were busy cleaning up ectoplasm on the other side of the building and can’t maintain the machines; now one is on fire. That’s okay, build an extinguisher and hire more janitors. Ah, but now you’re in debt again and your only surgeon is threatening to quit because his promotion hasn’t been matched by a salary rise. Best sell the research lab (just for now) and fire your researcher. What’s this mysterious new illness and what do we need to treat it? Oh…

Every session of Two Point Hospital offers a buffet of addictive, I’ll-just-fix-this management challenges, nested within a generous and varied campaign. The UI is wonderfully-designed, drawing your attention seamlessly to any impending crises, offering buckets of data to drill down into or ignore as you wish, and with a refined suite of quality of life features like room template saving and copy-pasting. What makes the game sing is its atmosphere, which is a far cry from its cringeworthy marketing. The visual style is clean and almost restrained, though with thoughtful animation and a dedication to visual puns that suggest it was something of a labour of love. The jazzy, upbeat soundtrack perfectly matches the good-humoured gameplay and can really get stuck in your head. It’s interspersed with radio DJ voiceovers and spoof ads that barely repeated for me, more than seventy hours in, and often raised a smile. There are lots of running jokes that reward close attention, but could be happily overlooked. Two Point Hospital, in short, leans into an understated and convivial kind of humour that’s distinctly British, with notes of both Monty Python’s absurdity and Peep Show’s nihilistic self-deprecation. Wonderful stuff.

Add a generous dessert of DLC for afficianados and well-integrated Steam Workshop support, and Two Point Hospital offers a huge sandbox in which to optimise systems, muck about or watch your ant farm bustle. It’s the most fun I’ve had with a traditional management game in ages. Beyond its offputting first glance, my only real criticism is that the core gameplay loop can become repetitive, and with challenge that tends to decrease once you’ve vaulted the early game’s hurdles. It can become a battle of attrition on even the most challenging levels. Yet watching the game’s hundred moving parts tick – with obvious care and attention gone into realising every one – offers its own, meditative pleasure. A wonderful jumping-on point for the genre as well as a feast for veterans nostalgic for the “tycoon” games of the 90s, don’t miss this gem.

you just do the same task over and over in different hospitals, you may find a new illness  once in a while that you need to treat but for the most part  is a easy and fun game. not sure if i want to play more so im not in a hurry to buy the DLCs yet.

Two Point Hospital is basically ""Theme Hospital"" reborn, along with all the goofy lovable, and gross monuments that made the theme hospital such a hit.

Pro - Fun, light-hearted, and sometimes bizarre. It will keep you busy and entertained for hours. New modes and goofy adds-on keep this gaming going even further.

The game starts with a tutorial that guides players through the basics of hospital management, including building rooms, hiring staff, and treating patients. As the game progresses, players must handle a variety of challenges, such as managing staff morale, treating complex illnesses, and upgrading their facilities.

One of the strengths of Two Point Hospital is its sense of humor. The game features wacky illnesses, such as lightheadedness (where patients have a lightbulb for a head) and cubism (where patients have turned into cubes). The quirky humor helps keep the game lighthearted and fun, even when the challenges become more difficult.

The game also has a lot of replay value, as players can continue to expand their hospital, unlock new facilities and equipment, and take on new challenges. In addition, the game offers a sandbox mode, where players can build and manage their hospital without any specific goals or objectives.

Overall, Two Point Hospital is a highly entertaining and addictive game that offers a unique blend of strategy, humor, and creativity.

The cartoonish, over-exaggerated style of the characters and the medical equipment makes for a great viewing experience. You'll never get bored watching your patients' hilarious animations and the doctors' silly expressions. It's just as entertaining to watch as it is to play.

The gameplay is addictive, to say the least. You're in charge of managing a hospital and taking care of your patients. From diagnosing their diseases to performing surgeries, you have a lot on your plate. The game does an excellent job of gradually introducing you to new elements and mechanics, so you won't feel overwhelmed. But, as you progress, the game does get progressively challenging, so you'll have to put your thinking cap on. One of the most impressive features of Two Point Hospital is the vast array of diseases that your patients can have. You'll encounter a wide range of strange and bizarre illnesses, such as Mock Star, which makes your patients believe they're rock stars, and Turtle Head, which gives them a turtle's head. The list of diseases is endless, and it's always entertaining to see what the next patient will come in with.

Overall, Two Point Hospital is an excellent game. It's funny, entertaining, and challenging all at the same time. The graphics are top-notch, the gameplay is engaging, and the variety of illnesses is simply hilarious. If you're looking for a game that will make you laugh and keep you entertained for hours, then Two Point Hospital is definitely worth checking out.",1678053075,1678053075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The original to this day still stands the test of time and this game will likely follow suit. While relatively simple and easy there's a good amount of depth if you're willing to dig into it although it's not needed to stomp the challenges. The beginning of the game plays similar to the end as you'd expect with nice variation on illnesses and problems presented. Plenty of customisation and decoration and many platforms such as Twitch throwing free decor at you. I'm not a fan of the DLC really as it doesn't add much and costs as much as many games that will give you 200+ hours playtime for a couple of hospitals. It's also on the base game map so you think you have another hospital to play, but actually when you click it that will be $$$ thanks. Guess I finished the game then, with 8+ hospitals to go... I think this is quite a dishonest and dissatisfying practice, why show it if I don't own it? ($$$).

The player is put in charge of running a hospital from the ground up. There are rooms to build, staff to hire and manage. There are also a whole range of items to place around the Hospital. A set amount of funds is given at the start of the game. It's up to the player to manage this money and, hopefully, make a profit!

Two Point Hospital looks and sounds great! Don't forget to listen out for the random tannoy announcements and the DJ's. Both of which broadcast around the place! The controls are easy to use.

Really though, it's a lot of fun. I find it best for when I just want to disassociate and not use a lot of brain power. I'll play it for a stint, go away, come back, go away - it's one of those games that I sort of crave to play around with at times. It can definitely get a little mundane and repetitive once you've played it for awhile, but it's really one of those games (to me) that I can always come back to after a break when I just want to have fun. I don't find it to be super punishing - you can decorate, only use multiple of useful items, slack around, or get competitive with yourself. Tear everything down and start over, challenge yourself in different ways, change up your play style. It's really easy to do whatever you really want with it.

I normally not go into management games like that, but 2 point Hospital is really in league of its own. Does require some planning in making your hospital efficient, and can be very unforgiving if you built it wrong. At the first impression it feels like relatively simple game with simple mechanics, but dont be fooled, there are layers beneath the layers. You can kinda leave your hospital manage itself or you can micromanage it to fine detail. 

Also the illnesses in game are absolutely hilarious. 

Graphics are bit candy-ish but pleasant for the eye, not some AAA cryengine raytracing madness, but it dont need it. 

also very well optimized, little to no bugs (I haven't encountered a single game breaking bug or glitch so far) Big hospitals can be bit heavy on CPU but game seems to recognize multicore quite well so it still remain playable. 

only cons I could so far mention is that sandbox options are quite limited, especially in chosing which diseases you want or not, so kiss goodbye on making small GP clinic in starting map, as 1 hour into play you will cover it just with GP's alone. 

also DLCs prices and number are criminal, only buy on discount as its relatively just few new diseases, new map and some visual stuff, just more of the same in different color basically.",1673412596,1673412596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The attention to detail in this game is also top-notch, with diseases and treatments based on real-world medical conditions.

And let's not forget the puns! There are so many medical puns and jokes throughout the game that it's hard not to laugh. I mean, who wouldn't crack a smile at a patient with a ""cactus-itus"" or a ""pandemic flu""?

Same humour (the receptionist, if anything, is only becoming more sarcastic with age), same feeling, newer graphics. Plenty of levels to play through, some frustrating if you want to get all three stars, different problems to overcome or location specific issues.
One fix I am so glad for is the infectious diseases. Thankfully now the infected can wander between your hospital buildings without triggering the health inspector visit (and then as rapidly as possible hunting everyone down and evicting them from the premises to avoid as much damage as possible). They are harder to find and vaccinate but at least it gives you a chance at success.

The only downside is I miss some of the old illnesses (bloaty head, invisibility and slack tongue especially). 

Now if only we could have some more spiritual successors to Bullfrog games!!

Made by Two Point Studios and published by Sega. A whole lot of DJ voice over work (In all that playtime it never repeated) plus revamped easy listening music. Technically repetitive as you have to rebuild hospitals from scratch across levels but it was fun for a long time.

-Quite long (Arguably too much content)
-Great value for money
-Mostly kid friendly (One instance of blue humour perhaps)

I really liked all the weird stuff going on here. Bought all the DLC's and not sure what's in what anymore. There's a lot of hospitals you can build-up. Some require unlocking first but it's up to you to decide to go fully in on one hospital at a time or toy around from one hospital to another.

Changes points:
* Give the janitors a grid working location. This would keep janitor in specific parts of the hospital, removing dead ends and unsupervised locations as well as janitor grouping. 
* Picking up patients. On bigger maps, they have a long ways to go to get specific treatments and when they get low on health. It would be nice to pick them up. 
* sand box option. Make your own hospital template. 
* Customize you hospital floor and walls that aren't in specilized rooms.

Pros
Nostalgic
Improved Graphics 
Humorous 
Mentally Stimulating at higher levels
Cosy Game
Creative Outlet
Some Nice CC on workshop

Cons
One save file per hospital - (If you nearly get a 3 stared hospital but mess up you cant load at the moment you got it two star you have to start from scratch rather painful in harder levels)
Art Glitches - Sometimes the doctors eyes disappear though in a way adds the the humour 
Repetitive  - If you are playing the same hospital for a long period of time trying to three star it, things get start to feel a bit stir crazy
100% Achievement behind paywall - Sadly if you want to 100% this game, you need to buy all the DLC, some of which don't have a great reputation.
Twitch Prime Rewards wont link - for some reason no matter how many times I linked the game to my twitch prime the rewards never got activated on my account after they were redeemed

The game starts with a tutorial that goes on for the first 3 or 4 hospitals that you build, every time getting a little harder. It starts very easy, though, so newbies won't have a problem. 

Pros: 
+ Nice comic graphics and animations 
+ Funny diseases and treatments 
+ Easy to learn 
+ You can play multiplayer and compete 
+ Many unlockables 
+ I haven´t encountered any bug yet 

Cons: 
- The UI at the bottom left has words instead of pictures (for instance: ""Rooms"", ""Items"" and ""Hire"", when it would have been better to have a square, a tool and a face, or something like that) 
- The game starts too easy, and you have to play a few levels for it to become a bit of a challenge 
- The loading page takes its time

Yes. Absolutely yes. Is it the Theme Hospital you remember? Yes, absolutely yes. Ah, so its still a lot of addictive fun yeah?

Welllllllllllllllllllllllllll lets take the rose tinted glasses off a bit shall we? For me, this game checked off every expectation I wanted and did it in an authentic way in the exact style I wanted but after an hour I start to get bored. So, whats the problem? Why can't I play this nonstop like the original?

... Did I actually play the original for 5 hour gaming sessions, or was that a fever dream? I think it was a fever dream because as much fun as I had, and as much as I loved the style of the game i don't ever remember beating it. 

I think the original has a lot of rosy memories and this game is a sheer tribute to that. Keep that all in mind. If you want a game that you expect to keep you engaged heavily for 30+ you will be hard pressed to hit that limit, but if you want to find a modern take on some of your favorite nostalgia, you'll definitely be happy. 

I don't think I'll ever beat all the missions on this game, and you know what? It was still worth the money in my minds eye. I wanted a modern take on Theme hospital and I think I got it, but this ain't Tropico and you're not gonna lose track of time while playing it.

TPH is a very accessible manage-sim, with some quirky humor. It also looks pleasant and is very easy to control. However, it also is really slow and tedious. You are basically just expanding you hospital continuously, which requires you to copy-paste rooms, build new type of rooms meant for specific illnesses and hire and train your staff. The game isn't hard at all, but certainly will feel like a slog if your machines needs frequent reparing because of earthquakes (and for some reason many levels have those) and training staff takes a while. It also doesn't help that some rooms aren't high priority in certain levels but others are, requiring you to demolish and build a copy of another room and place every mandatory item individually again (like benches, plants and radiators). You'll feel like you're constantly fixing problems. I never really took the time to appreciate the little details of the game or even the unnecesary graph tab in the menus. It is shallow busy work. 

However, as shallow as the game is, It is still decently put together with lots of content. The workshop is also a welcome addition. And for that, I find it too harsh to give this game a thumbs down.",1665238862,1665238862,True,8,0,0.616977393627166748,0,True,False,False

Update: I see too many dlcs now, it's looking more like a cash grab at this point 

There are plenty of annoying gameplay elements like: 
- objective mode (not earning anything except for finishing objectives and researches, it's really bad since it's very easy to be in debt in this game... and guess what the next objective is? pay money for research/marketing or training.. which requires you not to be in debt.. ugh). Another silly objective is watering plants and unclogging toilets... seriously? 
- pandemic (finding waldo in a sea of patients can be sort of a fun thing.. but shouldn't affect gameplay like losing rep's, because if you have a really huge hospital this can be more of a chore than anything) 
- year review should have an option to toggle-able, I don't want to see my game interrupted every year
- another policy would be nice to auto-raise the salary of those staff who are grumpy, I mean it's bad enough I have to keep watching tons of things that I just had to keep watching this vital part of the crew

Don't believe me? Go to the Two Point Hospital Steam Discussions. And yes, it exists.

I was here since almost day one of the release of Two Point Hospital, the game had some things that it was lacking of, for example, but not limited to, not being able to copy a room. Which was really boring! You would have made that Level 5 Room, and then have to make everything again piece by piece, just a waste of time. Calm down, that is past. We went to the steam discussions and they, not only listened to us, but also implemented the community's ideas into the game, And it continues until today. You know, after all of that, I am actually glad I paid full price for this game. Every game you buy should be at least half like this, it would be good enough already.

First some good things. Game is smooth and generally to play. It's simple and enjoyable gaming. So overall experience as whole game is there. Games won't need too much of a challenge as far it can keep you otherwise engaged. Can it?

There a lot of things that gets on you eventually. Before I go on some details that annoyed me I want to point out weakness of general design. Hospitals in this game feels more of a factory line medicine than actual place for healthcare. Whole point is to get people through which is logical but it kinda skips part of the game. There is little point having services other than keep quick comfort around. Your staff is only people spending time in your hospital. Patients just get through it with easiest path.

But now those little things I wished wasn't:
1) Research is not very innovative mechanic. It really is there to just unlock things and is very boring clicking game for money/kudosh which you rarely need like this.
2) Epidemics aren't fun. You don't want to visually find your patients and magically apply cure on them. Mostly not worth of the effort.
3) There is no logical illness tracking. Patients get checked randomly and head to treatment room. Certain illness should require certain diagnostics.
4) Building rooms and levels to them should be need based and attraction should be only one part of it.

So game is good but not great. Worth playing but not quite worth remembering. It just requires that last step for depth so you would like to build your own little perfect hospital.",1664015375,1664015375,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[h1]Prologue[/h1]
Health, something everyone wants to keep always the best possible, but unfortunately sometimes the body fails and one beautiful night for example your head turns into a bright lamp, to treat this you will need the specialized care of a medical team with all the hospital equipment. And that's why we came here, to offer you a job opportunity as manager of our company's future hospitals, accept today and help us diagnose and cure citizens across the country, but be prepared, because lines of patients waiting for the appointment and only the beginning of a long and crazy list of things that can and will happen. ^^

After all, the country is vast and you will find everything, cities, tropical islands, snowy mountains, deserts and much more, each region with its own challenges, and of course rules, as some cities made some rather curious demands to accept our services, so it's always good to be ready for really anything from people whose heads have turned into light bulbs, even lightning storms that somehow manage to strike inside your hospital, but don't let that get in the way of your mission to bring health to the four corners of the country. ^^

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ A fun hospital simulator that perfectly fulfills the mission of being a Spiritual Successor of the famous Theme Hospital, making the mission of managing a hospital something light and fun, with high doses of comedy.
+ A vast repertoire of crazy and creative diseases, some of them have visible signs and need very fun to see working machines, while others even without visible signs, have fun and funny descriptions, along with each of the DLCs add even more unique diseases.
+ It's easy to lose track of time, managing one hospital, then the second, the third and so on, especially since each one has different goals and many have their own rules of operation, including some rules that only exist in the DLCs.
+ It is possible for hospitals to help each other, for example in the case of a new disease, to return to an older one to research improvements to the machines of newer hospitals, without needing all the research structure in the new one.
+ Great freedom when building the rooms and decorating, making the use of space very efficient, I myself never had a problem with lack of space.
+ Beautiful graphics, it is possible to perfectly see everything that happens in the hospital because all the actions of the employees, patients and machines used have well done animations, and I must say that some made me laugh, especially the totally ""safe"" treatments.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- A few hospitals have some goals that can be a little tricky to do, fortunately they are a very small number.
- Unfortunately, the diseases of the DLC only appear in the hospitals of said DLC, not being possible to find them in the hospitals of the main game or other DLC.

[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]
A hospital simulator where we have to assume the management role, with each new hospital we start being responsible for using our initial budget to build offices, examination rooms to find out what patients have and thus treat them, and of course receive a small remuneration in exchange, after all the hospital has to support itself. It seems simple, but with each new hospital the player is challenged, as each one has its own goals to go from zero to the maximum score of three stars, allowing you to advance to the next one. ^^

Throughout this trip, attention will need to be paid to points such as budget, queues, patient and staff needs while trying to keep everyone satisfied until reaching the peak with the healing of patients, a process that can be helped with the improvement of equipment and training of the staff, including with some functions such as psychiatry and surgery being allowed only for trained doctors. After all, patients can have everything and more, heads turning lamps and just the beginning, be ready for eyebrows that come to life, clown outbreaks, patients that get pixelated like 90's games, and much more, who knows what the next patient might have, and they all come to your hospital looking for a cure. ^^

[h1] Art and sound[/h1]
Personally I found the graphics produced by the Two Point Studios team very interesting, following a style to make people look more like play dough dolls, matching the lighter tone of the game, along with the curious and fun designs of the machines, some of them have a very interesting to see operation. In addition to the graphics, we also have the sounds, I was also very satisfied, with very relaxing music and all the machines have their unique sounds when they are in operation. ^^

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
Two Point Hospital caught my attention since its first announcement, and for me it is a very fun game, I had already played Theme Hospital and I think this new one very well fulfills its idea of being a hospital simulator, but with a twist lighter, combining diseases imagined by the team with very dubious and crazy equipment and treatments. It is not a game for those looking for realistic hospital management, so much so that no disease here exists in the real world, but for those looking for a relaxing, fun management game capable of producing laughs with its madness and at the same time a sensation of duty accomplished by seeing patients healed, I strongly recommend this game. Even here I am anxiously awaiting the next game of the same team, about managing a university this time. ^^

The gameplay looks simple and is simplified; a parody of how hospital works.

The visual and art, for the lack of better words I have, are such an acquired taste.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Two Point Hospital is a superb hospital management simulation that takes place in Two Point County in what I'm assuming is pseudo-America, since the prices are so damn expensive (and you can make them even more costly). You are given fixed plots of land to build rooms in which cater to different ailments and diagnostics. You can also build various types of amenities like snack machines to feed your patients and employees, and water coolers to fulfill dehydration. The hospitals are meant to be prestigious and can be rated as such in the yearly reviews, so there are many decorations to choose from like dinosaur fossil exhibits, arcades, paintings, rugs, candy machines, and of course; benches for your patients to rest on while waiting for their appointment. Each item has different buffs it comes with, whether that be the increasing of room prestige, hospital attractiveness, reducing boredom, plus many more traits. 

Unlike other management or building simulators, it's kind of impossible to delve into a negative downward spiral and lose the game. You'd have to be extremely terrible. The game is really all about perfecting the flow of patients that come in and having enough specific rooms to provide treatment for them, along with making sure they and staff have comforting environments and plenty of activities to pass the time whilst waiting. Hospital layout also matters- patients must have enough room to navigate, and you have to figure out how to efficiently place rooms in whatever plot of land you're given. Low difficulty implies relaxation, which is true to this game in particular. It rarely gets stressful unless the artificial intelligence glitches, and the mechanics of the game are easy to learn. 

One of the game's selling points is that it is goofy and has character. It introduces loads of wacky diseases from ""premature mummification"" and ""monobrow"" to ""inflated ego"" and ""hurty leg"", which are all self-explanatory by title and exactly what they sound like. Each diagnosis has varying levels of difficulty to cure and patients can even die from each illness if not treated properly. The further you get in the game, the more you find out about, and you can unlock new rooms and tools to care for your customers. Staff also have different personality traits and professional specialties that dictate their interactions with patients and other staff members, creating human drama on top of every other intricacy to add to the mix. The game lets you hire 4 types of employees, including janitors, doctors, nurses, and assistants. 

Each level establishes new logistics based on the area and description. There are areas in the mountains that can only be accessed by helicopter and must be kept warm with radiators, beach regions that tend to be scorching, university hospitals full of inexperienced doctors and nurses that are meant to focus on teaching, and many more. Sometimes your buildings can even be afflicted by natural disasters, like earthquakes, avalanches, hauntings, fires, etc. The game can get a bit repetitive, but the DLC helps amend that and tends to be very cheap. There are always goals to work towards, but there is a sandbox mode available if that's more your style. 

Two Point Hospital is a very enjoyable game that I believe anybody who likes to play building/management/simulation games would enjoy. The illnesses, inanimate objects you can build, and other mechanics are a fresh and unique take on the genre and go on forever with the staggering amount of nuance and variety it incorporates. It's a little high on the price but I do think it's worth it, but if you disagree you can always wait until it goes on sale. Regardless, I think this is a must-have for anybody's video game collection, especially if you love these types of games.",1603175935,1661254735,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It took me years to work out why and it is simply down to the 3 levels.  You see each hospital has three stars that you can drive towards.  Whilst it is fun to drive towards the first star, it starts to become tedious towards the second star and then monotonous towards the third.  Doing so does give rewards in the form of Kudos points which unlocks more items.  Some are essential, others are not.

In Bulldog games you started a new level each time you completed a challenge.  To go back to a one star hospital later on in the game and have to virtually collapse it all to undo the mistakes you made, in order to achieve 3 stars is not fun and I found it to be like a form of punishment.

My advice to new players, on your first foundation, go through the game only ever getting one star and then move on.  Once completed then restart with a new foundation and aim for the 3 stars.  This way you have learnt all the basics and tricks and best strategies and can enjoy the second play through.

Two Point Hospital is a cute management simulator with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor thrown around. Overall it was a moderately enjoyable experience to play through once. Minimal bugs, and a good chunk of content. 

My problem with it is that as a management simulator, it's sorely lacking. There's not a lot of controls over your hospital or how it functions. You can restrict certain employees to certain types of work, but you can't restrict the areas they can go to. Ultimately a lot of it is just leaving the job to the AI. There's a pattern to getting the game to work in your favor, and by the time you're 1/4 through the campaign, you're playing every map the same way because it always works. The only thing left to do from there is to check off your little goal boxes. 

It's also lacking in the design department. There's no planning tools (that I could find) for setting up your hospital. You're either building a room or placing an item. No placeholder indicators for something you're reserving space for later, no templates to work with (outside of templates for the rooms themselves). 

So yeah, overall it was a fun little experience. But as a management sim: incredibly shallow, and little to no replay value.",1660869898,1660869898,False,4,0,0.548431217670440674,0,True,False,False

Setting up a profitable hospital is usually straightforward, and then there's a lot of waiting. Waiting to accumulate enough money for expansions, or to upgrade machines, or to complete research projects, or to raise staff experience, or to roll new staff with better traits. These things in turn allow you to incrementally scale up or optimize your facility, but the management tasks and decision-making remain mostly unchanged. Similarly, completing level objectives often involves doing things like curing X number of patients, which, again, just comes down to waiting. Each scenario focuses on some specific challenge, but most won't be demanding enough to force you to rethink your approach. I got all the stars in the base game but wouldn't really recommend the experience.

The humor felt very sanitized and was hit or miss for me. Regardless, the game has a lot of personality, and the radio DJs and PA announcer do a decent job of breaking up the monotony. I didn't have the audio on the whole time but I'm not sure I ever actually heard one of the radio DJ skits repeat.

This game is kind of a game of contradictions, in a very good way. 

It is both funny and cartoonish while at the same time being a very good management sim. 

Most hospitals can become solvent pretty quickly and easily but if you don't develop them properly you can soon find yourself bankrupt either because you expanded too quickly or haven't expanded enough or efficiently enough to keep up with growing demand as more patients arrive due to your hospital being good and having a good reputation.

Like most management sims there generally becomes a point you have reached critical mass and have in effect suceeded and then the challenge becomes fine tuning everything and seeing how good you can make everything and there are plenty of options to tweak and improve your hospital to make it even better...tweaking the hospital to make staff and visitor happier, tweaking rooms to make them more efficient, tweaking prices and wages to make the most profit, rerarranging the layout to make the flow of the hospital more efficient with the advantage that the game style is funny and entertaining so not only can you train the best surgeon in the world you can train a feckless idiot who smells so bad he makes people puke when he walks into the room into the best surgeon in the world.

The game does have an option to copy and paste rooms as well as save them between scenarios and certain rooms in particular you will be making over and over again, even in the same hospital.e.g. G.P. room but at the same time some of the building shapes can make this challenging but again you can just create some basic cut and paste rooms you use over and over again to complete all the scenarios as there is plenty of building space to not have to worry about having to maximise space but you can also fine tune every single room to maximise the space used in every hosiptal and make it as efficient as possible.

The game does have a progression/gating system which provides additional challenges where you have to meet certain criterior to progress and/or unlock new things although the progress/essential unlocks are pretty easy (if your having difficulty unlocking them you probably aren't ready to move on) unlocking everything can be challenging (or time consuming depending on your philosophy).

Overall this game should be enjoyable by most people where you can just play it casually and laugh while doing a basic playthrough of the campaign or you can spend spend hundreds of hours tweaking and refining the perfect hospital.",1660140495,1660140567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a lot of fun, if not sometimes a little repetitive. Not necessarily difficult (you can move on after 1 star on each level). But if like me you go for 3 stars on each level before progressing, some of the levels are a lot more tricky to navigate, requiring impeccable hospital optimisation and sometimes many hours of micro managing. It does however do a good job of gradually introducing new features as you progress, before throwing the ultimate challenge at you in the last hospital of each area. I did enjoy the challenge of building and managing hospitals in areas with frequent earthquakes for example and the differing climates.

The sound design is amazing, with great SFX and some memorable radio tunes. There's a making of the sounds video online where the sound engineers show their methods of creating the in game SFX, well worth a watch.

There are a few gameplay issues which annoy me and is the reason I have to keep coming back to the game, rather than putting all of my time into 3 star finishing the campaign:

- Queue mechanics are awful. Patients prioritise their needs (hunger/boredom etc) over their health. So patients close to dying who are next in line to get treated will still play an arcade game if they are bored, then die. It makes adding interesting items and things like the cafe detrimental to gameplay.
- A lot of hospital objectives are often ultimately time or money gated, especially later in the game. There were some hospitals that were much harder to achieve 1 star than 3 stars due to having more money at the end.
- The game infamously lends itself to min/maxing rooms. For example there's a tiny gold star poster that gives the most room attractiveness so it's ultimately easier to fill the every wall with a gold star rather than putting hospital themed items up. Also cramming various treatment rooms with medicine cabinets to improve treatment success.  Would have much preferred it if the staff skill alone determined room effectiveness.
- The ghost system is irritating. It seems to be about 50/50 whether a ghost spawns from a person who just died. This just adds another layer of micro management in grabbing janitors to hoover them up. Would have been nice to be able turn this off, or change it for a temporary hospital happiness debuff or something.
- The pandemic + vaccinating system is even more irritating and at times impossible. Fortunately this only occurs in certain hospitals and is not always very frequent. I just ignore it now.

Ultimately not game breaking and although I still recommend, the above have prevented me from loving this game as I feel like I should.

As mentioned I play each hospital until I have 3 stars. As of editing this review I'm 111 hours in and I'm on star 3 of the 2nd to last hospital. I have only played the campaign (no sandbox) and quit every hospital as soon as I hit 3 stars. That should give you an idea of how much of a time sink it is to 3 star all levels. Most hospitals take multiple sessions to beat and some require multiple restarts before you can get going properly.

Thankfully although the objectives can feel repetitive, none are ever overly punishing for the sake of it. The objectives are designed to push your ability to handle various different mechanics and there are normally multiple ways to go about achieving them.

There are of course many DLCs, none of which I feel add enough to the game for me to buy them until I at least 3 star all of the main game.

Finally, game performance is great. My rig is old now and was only mid ranged when I built it 6 years ago. For me it runs smooth as silk at 4k with highest settings.

My complains are mainly related to pacing. The game is painfully slow to progress but fairly easy to play. The size of objects and the layouts of the hospitals are very painful to design around and many decorative objects are locked behind a ""Kudosh"" currency system. What's the point of a game like this if you must unlock all the items? Decorative items level up rooms and makes your staff a lot happier but more importantly, if you make a hospital design sim like this, then you need to provide your players with adequate decorative items.

But all the stuff you need to do in the game are too slow to progress. Your staff takes a long time to train, and it takes a long time to meet all the map objectives. Since many items must be unlocked either through spending Kudosh or higher star ratings of hospitals, you are forced to play for a lot longer.

Of course you can sort of  make a nice hospital in the game. The items are relatively varied and there's a point to decorating your hospital. The game remind me of the old game ""Theme Hospital"" but the jokes are worse and the game is a lot simpler. This game is very PG and it shows. There's nothing necessarily wrong with being PG but in this case it makes the game feel extremely bland. The pixelated mess that is Theme Hospital doesn't have much personality, but it's still a lot more charming than Two-Point Hospital is.

The music in Two-Point Hospital is also a lot worse than Theme Hospital. I hate the constant elevator music in the game.

In addition, the developers made the game as a platform to sell DLCs through. They've tried hard to make the game relevant through ingame events. This is pretty blatant and might look like they're trying to sell the game piecemeal, however the game does have a lot of base content and is time consuming to play (if only because of grinding) and a few items (albeit thematically wrong otherwise) has been released for free over the years. I've certainly never felt the need to buy any DLCs, even though the developers invade my game with ""locked areas"" reminding me of that content I could have had. But I really don't care, I've had my fill of this game!

Even so, I recommend against buying this game. It shall be interesting to see if two-point campus is any better.",1659951187,1659951187,False,47,7,0.577011406421661377,0,True,False,False

Your staff will be curing a variety of weird illnesses, from verbal diarrhoea to inflated ego and much more unusual ones. You’ll probably discover one or multiple diseases which symptoms will make you chuckle. But giggles won’t pay the bills! You’ll have to play smart stay out of debt, keep an high reputation and retain a good cure rate even when the amount of patients increase rapidly.

The levels in the career mode will gradually throw more and more stuff at you to deal with, which makes for a really good way to learn the game. After having done a decent amount of hospitals, it’s very fun to go back to your older ones and improve them with your new knowledge.

Really late to the review on this. 

Bullfrog memories and company chat before review.

This was with out a doubt one of the games I looked forward to most of 2018. Used to love Bullfrog back in the day, even lived down the road from their Guildford offices. After EA purchased Bullfrog in 1997 offerings took a decline in quality then were shelved permanently (Standard EA) Rip, Westwood, Maxis, Bullfrog (Insert many other great companies here)

When I heard that two point studios were forming in Farnham (Down the road) with Mark Webley and Gary Carr at the helm (Theme Hospital / Bullfrog) I was hyped.

When the game finally released it was what I had hoped for. A true spiritual successor to Theme Hospital with the same albeit improved gameplay and wacky humour that the original had. The fear I had is that they would get bought out again and ruined like in the past. 

Then in 2019 they announced they had been purchased after only 2 years of being in business.  I was initial bummed out and a bit sad, but then I found out that SEGA had purchased them as a subsidiary. My love for SEGA is so strong at the moment for them publishing incredible games like Two Point Hospital and Motorsport Manager and also brining the incredible Yakuza series to the western PC market. When I heard this I was pleased for Two Point Studios and cannot wait to see what the future holds for them. They have already teased the idea of making games within the Two Point world based off of old Bullfrog titles. We may get a remake of the original Theme Park (Not World or Inc please)

The gameplay for Theme Hospital veterans will feel familiar and you will be able to jump right in and feel at home. The game has had so many quality of life improvements over the original and has Steam workshop to add community items and music packs.

If you want a real nostalgia blast add this music pack, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1745929263] Theme Hospital Music Remastered [/url] 

Instead of just moving from hospital to hospital around the game board like in Theme Hospital this time you make a foundation. Once you complete a level you can move to the next hospital but your original hospital remains as you left it and you can go back and play it anytime you wish. Loads of hospitals all with different challenges and illnesses.

A cavalcade of new illnesses. No Bloaty Head, Slack Tongue or invisibility here. From Mock Star (Great Freddie Mecury joke) to Headcrabidness (Half life headcrab yes) the crazy illnesses and ways they are cured is a silly and fun as the original Theme Hospital.

Friends leader boards, the Superbug project which allows you to assist your friends to unlock kudosh and special items. Yearly trophy awards.

The team at Two Point Studios are very active within the community. Listening to community suggestions and bug fixes etc. They just added room templates which is awesome! 

Their social media team even surprised me the other day by sharing my screenshot on Facebook.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2187518470

As an OG Theme Hospital player I really don't have anything bad to say about this game. Its a nostalgia bomb and just a fantastic game. I cannot wait to see what is next from Two Point Studios

This game is really fun for the first 15 or so hours but beyond that it starts to become a slow and boring process of making sure every part of your hospital is warm, has plants, ... Also, the break room makes it so much more difficult to manage and make sure you have enough employees of each type of work because you end up either hiring too many people or not realizing you don't have enough.

I think it's a good idea to make you build new hospitals from scratch IF these new hospitals were different enough from the previous ones to not make it feel repetitive but sadly that's not the case, each new hospital adds the potential for 1-2 new rooms you didn't previously have access to but that's it and honestly it's not worth rebuilding a hospital just to get access to 2 new rooms.

Each illness is presented as being new and unique BUT that's not the case, each illness is almost identical. Diagnose the problem and send them to the correct treating room, get them treated and voila, a ""new"" illness.

This game has a great potential that could easily be reached with a few tips:
- Avoid making us build new hospitals from scratch without having a massive game-changing twist or spin to mechanics.
- Allow us to choose what illness we want to tackle next instead of dropping patients on us.
- I hate mono-brows, It's just annoying manual work that we have to remind ourselves to do",1629379779,1657568100,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

It was mostly like a simulation/building game. You had to create your own hospital with rooms depending on your patient's needs and they came in with wacky diagnoses, like a lightbulb head or thinking they're a celebrity. They were ridiculous.

The announcement lady of the hospital was funny too. And I could build up more than I hospital in different areas. But I only got to the second one. There was still more to do.

My biggest gripe with the game is the fact that you are encouraged to reorganize your hospitals to make them work better after you have unlucked better facilities, but actually starting over is not a very fun experience.
The game throws you back into the same tutorial and generic objectives that you already completed on that specific level. Starting a new game is the same story.

It's a negative but only just.  

   It runs fine, I'm not aware of any crashes so far.  It's bright and colourful with lots of amusing animations.  As the game develops there are more and more rooms to unlock for both analysis and treatment.  There are lots of objects to add to rooms, some of which need to be unlocked by tasks - and a lot, disturbingly and irritatingly, of seemingly misplaced Sonic themed items.  There's a lot of content, some of it quite funny, on the incessant in game radio shows.  The announcer has a lot of lines too.

  So why the negative vote ?  This is an issue you'll only encounter after putting 20+ hours into the game.  The game is heavily weighted towards payment for cures.  Diagnosis is basically a loss leader with the expenses barely covering your doctor or nurse costs.  So the two most basic ""cure"" room s are Pharmacies and Wards, both available from virtually the start of the game.  But 2.0 Hospital unfairly in my view frequently starves you of the more basic illnesses so you constantly end up with that even with an overcrowded and understaffed hospital you're still not making enough money to cover costs.  You can end up spending long times just watching your hospital spiral deeper and deeper into debt with realistically nothing that you can do about it.  This isn't fun.

  For anyone's who's played Theme Hospital it's very similar but with obvious updates for a game made decades later.  The blatant sexism of Theme Hospital with all Doctors and Janitors being male and all nurses female has been removed in Theme 2.0 hospital.  Earthquakes and epidemics are back  but so far they've been nowhere near as lethal as under the previous game.  Research takes far longer but perseveres to all future hospitals - you never have to research the same thing twice.

  I've played a lot of Sim Games - Theme Hospital to conclusion multiple times, Theme Park, Rollercoaster Tycoon 1,2 and 3 and all versions of Tropico up to 5, completing 4 and 5.  So I know how to play Sim Games.  IMHO 2.0 Hospital is too difficult on the mid levels onwards to be fun.

REVISED REVIEW - REFERS TO ORIGINAL REVIEW

  I was wrong and dumb.  I'd been increasing staff salaries on promotion from content to happy which bled my profit margin.

  Game tips - start off with these basic rooms as soon as you have them and can afford them - GP's office, Pharmacy, General Diagnosis, Cardiology, Psychiatry (if you have an appropriately qualified doctor), Ward, Toilets, Rest Room all of which should be decorated and facilitated to a good to high standard.  There's a very useful button on the staff tab that allows you to meet all salary demands that should be used regularly to keep staff content.  Add research later unless you need to research a new disease to progress in which case it should be prioritised.  Add new doctors and nurses when you're finding that there are delays in staff answering the calls to a room.  This way you won't get overstaffed.  On the main option screen I reduced the queue warning from six to five - persistent queues of six and higher impair performance badly.  I made cure percentage 100% rather than 95% - death rates are high enough without guessing at cures but checked the option that patients who had 100% diagnosis didn't need to go back to a GP's office for a final diagnosis - you'll already need a dozen or more GP's offices in a large hospital and they're a loss leader, a break even at best.

  So further impressions having finished the game ?  First the good.

  Contrary to my dumb original review the levels are all logically winnable (maybe not the public level - see below)  with a set strategy taking you through all levels.  It's a question of prioritising purchases according to profit.  Note that an epidemic will normally more than pay for the room to treat it and at times you will have to take out loans.  My main joy was the huge amount of content in the radio shows - I think I hadn't heard all of it by the time I three starred the last level (what was in the box ?) and the content varied between mildly amusing and genuinely funny.  For a game that can get repetitive this was a worthwhile investment by the developers and much appreciated.  Earthquakes and epidemics are inconveniences rather than absolute disasters like they could be in Theme Hospital and epidemics are far fairer although in a huge hospital they're difficult to spot in such a mass of people.  The skill trees  were a welcome addition from Theme Hospital but research was more equivocal - narrowly in favour of 2 point hospital overall.  It remained colourful, robust performance wise, and endearing right to the end.


The bad ? The ""public health"" level is horrible - you don't get paid for cures but for arbitrary tasks which messes up your planning completely.  The last two levels were time intensive with much time spent just waiting for figures to clock up to progress level - similar to the original in fact.  There's no ""victory"" screen at the end of the game - unless it comes from three starring every hospital - just credits which was disappointing and a definitely worse than Theme Hospital which had a good (if now very chunky) end video.  The muzak that backgrounds the game is unlike the DJ commentaries repetitive and dull.

Having now three starred the final level I'm unlikely (1) to try and three star everything (2) to pay out for the comparatively far more expensive DLC.  The game is good, colourful fun but the 93 hours I put into it more than scratched my itch for replaying a Theme Hospital type game.  Now the new game with setting up a university campus - that I'm price tracking.

However for the current sale price of £6.24 or lower you're getting a good, fun game that should keep you pleasantly engaged for many hours which is definitely more than good enough.

And to the devs sorry for my original review.  I got it wrong.

Graphics - While this isn't an RPG AAA shooter, the graphics are of outstanding quality. The only thing I found a shame was when zoomed in, the wallpapers from the base game were a bit blury.

Animations - After a while I realised some of my hospital was on fire, because I was watching all the different kinds of swoops, swishes and devilishly mean animations some of the machines have. The Jab machine is most satisfying! ~Ofcourse the fire was my fault for forgetting extinguishers. ~

Theme Hospital fans will love the room templates, the nostalgic charm, new illnesses, and new game mechanics (Epidemic, R.E.M.I.X., radio customization, HOURS of radio host content, etc). The vomiting sound is also far less repulsive.

There is some room for improvement, however. DLCs only seem to add new illnesses rather than changing game play, and getting new items is challenging if you don't have any friends who play. The global research mechanic where you complete tasks for items is, while interesting, a hindrance to those of us who do not want to add strangers to our friends list and wonder who ""Bimbo Baggins"" is after a few months when they change their display name and icon.

I have two main complaints. First, the default prioritization of patients is a bit dumb. It's just first-come-first-served, so I frequently have to move patients around queues to treat the most unhealthy patients first, and this can be tedious. Second, the game is a bit slow-paced. I often wish I could run it at 5x speed or something because it'll probably take like 100 hours to get three stars on all of the levels. There are a lot of levels, and they aren't all that different from each other, so the game feels rather samey long before it's over.

I have three big issues with the game:

1: Every game plays the same. Despite the occasional map quirk every hospital can be built the same which means once you have completed 3 or so maps you will naturally want to design them the same. The game doesn't really provide a reason to change up your room designs or general layout of the hospital. This means for me I can only play 3-4 hours every couple weeks to keep it fun an interesting.

2: You are never in any real danger. Once you get set up the money just flows and you are simply waiting for enough to drop the next room. Some maps have specific events but there isn't any like a ""mass cas accident you are forced to take"" or ""someone is sueing the hospital"" etc. Its actually hard to lose a map and I have never come close. On that note killing patients seems to have little repercussions. I have 2-3 patients die a month and no one cares, I have fuming patients that leave because they haven't been treated in over a year and nothing happens. 

3: Friend assisted research. I am guessing this is hear to encourage you to get your friends to buy the game and help you? Since none of my friends play this game and I have no intention searching online for random people this whole feature is walled off to me.

Other points: No ambient life outside the hospital, only one level no additional floors or basement, no real personality with the staff (they have quirks but none of it plays out in game).

I recommend the game, its really the only good successor to theme hospital, but it does have some big dings against it.",1648787550,1648787550,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do understand each furniture takes a certain size of space, but I feel it's limiting. I want to efficiently use every space and corner. In comparison, Project Hospital's building design is more Sims like. I have more control and I can build smaller rooms which I really like. Also, this game has more cute assets but they don't represent the real equipments like in Project Hospital. I first played Project Hospital, but I got impatient and I didn't want to waste my time. I only had 2hrs to test it. I couldn't finish the Tutorial because I think there was a problem with the 2nd floor. I enjoyed building and managing in both games though.

   I highly recommend this game. Fun for all ages and eases you towards the tougher levels gradually.
   I definitely needed to read the guides and used the discussion pages often in the early days to help navigate my progress but quickly started to play and adapt to the positives and negatives of Staff, Rooms and Equipment etc.
   I also now know that there is an easier way or a funner ( is that a word ?) way to play, but for me I prefer the option of not loading up on ""gold stars"" etc and try to build a ""nice"" environment as it raises this old mans happiness level. ( Although I have gone the quicker fix at times )
   Having a Sandbox is great for building crazy stuff and the younger ones had tons of fun experimenting, creating havoc and destruction.
   All in all a blast has been had by those who have had a crack at my game.
   Good luck if you decide to have a go.

Two Point Hospital (Two Point Studios, 2018) is a hospital simulation game in the vein of old 90's games like Theme Hospital - indeed, many of the same developers from Bullfrog Studios formed Two Point Studios nearly 30 years later!

In Two Point Hospital, you play as an administrator hiring doctors, nurses, janitors and assistants, laying out the hospital and otherwise making sure that the patients are reasonably happy and not keeling over dead in the middle of the hall.

First things first: the animations in this game are great. From the little things like the walk cycles to the more obvious ones like the treatment animations where are pretty much all unilaterally funny. Unfortunately, you're often playing quite zoomed out and on 1.5x speed, so you don't often get to examine the animations close-up unless you're going out of your way to do so, but regardless, a lot of time and effort was put into this.

What about the gameplay? Well... this is where Two Point Hospital starts to fall apart a bit. The basic loop of a patient is as follows:
1. The patient arrives, and a front-desk assistant guides them to a GP's office.
2. The patient meets the GP, and gets a partial or complete diagnosis of their issue.
3. If the diagnosis is incomplete, the patient goes to a more-thorough diagnosis room, like a General Diagnosis or a MEGA Scanner. 
4. If the patient's diagnosis level is below the user-defined threshold (90% accuracy by default), repeat steps 2 through 4 until the diagnosis is above that threshold
5. Once the diagnosis is complete, they go to the appropriate treatment room and get treated.

This is the core loop of the game: making sure the above 5 steps go by as quickly as possible. As such, the game is really more of a layout simulator, putting rooms at appropriate locations such that patients don't need to travel far, duplicating rooms that are bottlenecks to increase patient throughput, and minimizing distractions to patients. And this is where the first major issue of the game rears its head.

Each patient has five sliders: hunger, thirst, and bladder, which are self-explanatory; boredom, which can be resolved via reading material, arcade machines, fountains, etc.; and health, which is essentially the patient's 'timer'. If their timer runs out, they die, you take a hit to your reputation, and you might even have a ghost show up, spooking your other patients and staff. And if any of the other sliders runs out, they leave the hospital angry, also taking a hit to your reputation. The thing about this is: because the most important thing of the game is getting patients through the medical process quickly, handling any of these sliders is basically pointless. Hungry patients will leave their lines to go buy snacks, even if they're next in line for the room, holding up not only their treatment, but the treatment of everyone behind them. So, counterintuitively, it's best to ignore all the sliders until you can easily afford good ways of handling the other sliders, like treating boredom with fountains, which take only a second per patient and can handle four patients at once.

Further, the money situation in the game is pretty shakey. When you're going for your first star in any given level, it's fairly good - your income is pretty low, but managable. But it's pretty trivial for the amount of money you get to snowball, leaving you with millions and nothing to spend it on in the mid- and late-game. Getting 2- and 3-star ratings in most levels was just a function of training up all my staff as best I could and otherwise keeping the window open long enough to meet whatever arbitrary goals I needed (usually some variation of 'cure 100 patients')

Maybe it's just me, but the game also has a lot of cruft that you should never reasonably use if you're trying to play efficiently. There are tons of lovely placable items to make your hospital rooms feel like real hospital rooms - but it's much cheaper and more efficient to just plaster treatment room walls with gold-star diplomas to get that important prestige rating up (so, maybe not that different from real life, after all...?). There are a lot of different diagnosis rooms - but you really only need three, max. I literally never used an X-Ray when I could just train up a doctor to use the way better MEGA Scanner instead, and I stopped using the fluid analysis when I realized the animation took 10,000 years without an appropriatly-good bonus to diagnosis. There are news stands, gift shops, cafes... none of which are actually useful, for the above reasons of just getting in the way of efficient play.

As far as the music goes, it's fine. Very catchy, but in a bad way. I found myself incessantly humming some of the background music, even though I didn't especially like it. The soundtrack, being diegetically a radio, has occasional ads and host breaks, which are mostly funny but start to repeat themselves pretty quickly.

There's a number of other things I didn't really get to experience, like the multiplayer challenges or Superbug System (none of my friends are playing a sim game from 4 years ago, bizarrely) or the REMIX levels, and I skipped out on the DLCs, which are pretty expensive for only adding 3 more levels each and a number of new diseases (which are, honestly, the least interesting part of the game, since it fundamentally just means you need to build New Room to treat New Disease).

If the game had more variety, I'd be more generous to it. There's one level, Duckworth-upon-Bilge, that I really loved because it turned the above loop on its head by preventing income from any source besides regular challenges and emergency treatments. But largely, most of the game's 15 levels are just glorified tutorials for individual game mechanics. ""This is the Hot Level"", ""This is the Cold Level"", ""This is the Surgery Level"", ""This is the Epidemic Level"", etc., etc. One-star ratings were more than enough for this, and going for two- and three-star ratings ended up being more tedious than anything else.

Oh, also, the game is WILDLY expensive at full price and regularly goes on sale for sub-$10. Don't buy this at full price!

Overall? It's okay. If you're a completionist, you're gonna have a miserable time going through the super-tedious and easy two- and three-star objectives, but you can have a nice time taking it easy, playing sub-optimally and only going for the basic objectives in each stage.",1644915443,1644973584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For those who know what it is - it's Theme Hospital. I mean, it's a new take on it, so let's call it Theme Hospital 2.0. I love Theme Hospital, have it on Origin and still play it from time to time, but Two Point Hospital is one of those 'remakes' that  actually really does scratch that itch.

I find it very addicting building the hospital ground up and trying new layouts, and the game has genuinely made me laugh out loud with it's illnesses and descriptions. The radio hosts and the reception voices, while repetitive after a while, I find charming and also very funny, especially if you enjoy dry humor.

The cons of the game are after a while it becomes the same thing over and over. While there are a few objectives that are harder than others, at the end of the day it's still just the same gameplay loop in every level.

Another thing, like many games now a days, is there are many different expansion packs that all give 3 levels, some fun, some meh, but if you are purchasing retail prices it can turn out VERY expensive for honestly not that much more content. To be fair it does go on sale often.

Overall it is one of my favorite games of all time, a worthy remake, and the base game is well worth the price, and even better on a deal.",1644547177,1644547177,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros -

#1.You get to manage a hospital



Cons -

#1.I found it to be boring mostly

#2.It is $34.99 full price as of 2/8/22 and it is worth $10 at the most and is over 3 years old







The Bottom Line -

If you into this style of game as many of the positive reviews are then I see why some like it.If I had paid $10 or less I would give it a thumbs up.

I would personally rather play other sim management games over this.If you want to risk it then just get this game for $5 when the sale/outside key goes on sale.

It has gone on sale for under $10 before and that is the MOST you should pay.If you buy the key outside of steam as of today it is around $10.",1644374849,1644493616,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Today i will review TWO POINT HOSPITAL. This game is a spiritual success to Theme Hospital. If you never played theme hospital, this game plays alot like it, but also has newer things, including costumes for doctors, epidemics, new diseases, even new illnesses. This game is more like a newer version of theme hospital, but with all the bells and whistles the original game did not have. There are also many things about this game that are quite fun. If you love micro managing games, this one you will really enjoy as a simulation game, even if the game does not take itself serious with all the funny diseases and such. The game can actually be challenging on the higher levels, or getting three star hospitals. Anyways, here are my pro/cons:

PROS:

- Cartoony diseases and funny ways to treat patients.
- Micromanging at it's finest.
- Silly costumes for your hospital employees.
- Challenging on harder levels and three start hospitals.
- Lots of dlc to add to the game new things.
- Steam workshop support so you can add even more items to your game.



CONS:

- A few minor bugs i ran into, including some lag, minor stuttering, and even a superbug project that kept staying in my superbug project page. It eventually went away though.
- Repetition seems to be the worst thing in the game. After awhile, every level and goals feel the same, even if there somwhat different. I suggest if you get bored, take a break from playing, then come back to this game after awhile.

RECOMMENDED! This game can be fun if you love micromanaging games and simulators. This game is not for serious hospital simulation players. There is another game on steam for that. The game is fun, but after awhile, can become repetitive.",1644370910,1644370910,True,21,0,0.68623727560043335,6,True,False,False

[b]Two Point Hospital[/b] is the spiritual successor to EA's Theme Hospital by Bullfrog. [i]However[/i], I don't feel that it's productive to directly compare the two, they're different games.

[u][b]Premise[/b][/u]: On its face, [b]Two Point Hospital[/b] is a satirical hospital sim/management game. But it's actually a [i]syndicate[/i] — or a conglomerate management sim of multiple hospitals going across all of Two Point County — there are 15 total Hospitals in the base game, each with their own climates and challenges. There's also a R.E.M.I.X version of all the hospitals which has a different set of challenges — a sort of wave mode. Ultimately, the main goal is to increase the value of your organization, not [i]just[/i] the individual hospitals.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The main mode is the career where you build multiple hospitals for the organization.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2479132513
But there is also a sandbox mode with a number of customization settings. There's also [u]Steam Workshop[/u] support.

The general loop is [b]diagnose, treat, expand, repeat.[/b]

[h3]Unique and positive aspects:[/h3][list]
[*] You don't specifically need to be aware or remember what treatment facilities are needed for specific illnesses that show up in the hospital you're currently working  in, they'll tell you what's needed if you don't have it. Of course, knowing would allow some level of preparation to occur.

[*] Any and all research achieved is used organization wide for any hospital.

[*] Though this could be viewed as a negative by some, the game can feel a little faster paced at times compared to many other management sims — this is due to the fact you're able to completely rearrange a hospital to suit the needs of any specific event as there is [u]no building time[/u] for rooms or items. Only expansion into additional annexes take time to build.

[*] When less pertinent research is needed for treatment methods, you can generalize research to generate both cash and kudosh.

[*] The Wallace & Gromit aesthetic is fantastic.[/list]

[h3]Neutral aspects:[/h3][list]
[*] The Super Bug Initiative is an interesting idea that requires collaboration between real life  players performing objectives. In the absence of players trying to complete those goals, it feels like a very tacked on feature.

[*] Sometimes genuinely funny.

[*] The UI is very clean, so much so that it feels like a mobile game.

[*] [u]It's very grind-y.[/u] Which means two things — there's a lot of [i]game[/i] to it, but your internal reward system i.e., dopamine, might get a little bored on occasion. The achievements are also pretty grind-y. Of course, they're completely optional.

[*] Some hospitals introduce or focus on temperature. It's not as in-depth as something like Prison Architect where you'd need to build a hot water heater and place a piping system in. In this you can just place a radiator anywhere and it'll have its own area of effect.

[*] Sometimes marketing campaigns feel like they only exist to complete odd objectives that don't fit the hospital's theme in what is an otherwise interesting feature used to recruit specialists.

[*] The game is always comparing your stats to other players on your friends list, which is cool for motivational purposes but it's also kind of grating.[/list]

[h3]Less than desirable aspects:[/h3][list]
[*] Each hospital gives you certain star ratings by introducing seemingly arbitrary objectives that don't inherently fit their theme. But this is largely only for ratings beyond 1 star.

[*] There's very little compelling reason to increase prestige beyond completing specific objectives or subjective cosmetic design e.g., fridges and filing cabinets don't actually do anything but increase room level/prestige. They're considered decorative items. Conversely, medicine cabinets, while not required slightly increase treatment and diagnosis percentage.

[*] Extra cosmetic [or otherwise] items not unlocked through regular progression are unlocked through redeeming “kudosh” points which are rewarded through completing objectives. Which makes early game decoration rather banal.

[*] Every room type essentially acts the same, regardless of extra furnishings. You're able to literally copy and paste them, making customization less meaningful as it won't actually affect much.

[*] In early stages of a hospital with numerous illnesses, it can be difficult to get started due to the need to train your employees or perform research on new disease treatment. While performing research or training, you don't have access to those employees. So you either suffer the loss of revenue and reputation by not treating them or you can take out a loan and hire people to do the more mundane tasks with the contingency that people with required skills are available.

[*] You're  unable to change the outer walls of any the hospitals, you can only to expand into pre-designed annexes/plots. You [b]are[/b] able change any inner walls, however.

[*] There are not many [b]micro-managing[/b] features. I list this as a negative because it can be difficult at times to get your employees to do what needs to get done. Essentially, there are only a few methods to do this, either disallow them into certain types of rooms or increase/decrease the frequency that numerous employees can take breaks at the same time. There's a fair amount of it being automated provided the needed elements are in place. You can manually tell them to go back to work or take breaks, but this can become tedious with large a staff. For patients, you can send them directly to treatment or move them around in the queue.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2478456737

[*] Employee's happiness boils down to amount of pay and breaks — that's it. VIP guests care about cleanliness and attractiveness more which can bolster or hurt reputation.

[*] Hospitals can get pretty big in the later stages. 10+ plots, which can be very chaotic.

[*] Some mechanics are not made clear, diagnosis seems to be based on skill of doctors, nurses, upgraded equipment — the EZ-Scan to Fluid Analysis. There seems to be some level of RNG. Even after all my time, I'm still not sure.

[*] I had a few bugs. — Ex: One of my nurses kept saying her path was blocked even though she was in the middle of an open ward.[/list]

[h3]Misc:[/h3]
I don't know if the game intended this, but when more elaborate hospitals were introduced, I ended up going back to older hospitals to do research to avoid needless loss of reputation and revenue in new hospitals — even after having achieved 3 stars on previous ones. Which makes the game feel very grind-y.

Between the time that this game was released and me writing about it, Sega purchased Two Point Studios.

[h1]The Gist:[/h1]
As a spiritual successor, I can understand why many are ambivalent. It simply doesn't feel that special. Furthermore, I wouldn't put money on “the kids of today” holding this game in the same regard as “us 30 year old millennials” do for Theme Hospital. Likely the same scenario for Bullfrog [in general].

That said, I think Two Point Hospital is game that clings to the past. I can recommend it as a filler/palette-cleanser. And while it has a fair amount of depth, it's not that difficult to drop and pick back up. 

The biggest issue is that I don't see many people playing it beyond their initial threshold, its longevity simply isn't worth the time investment. The variability between hospitals isn't enough to keep you coming back. After the 7th hospital, 25-ish hours in, I realized I wasn't having fun anymore. I was only after achievements.

It feels a little wrong giving it a thumbs down. But I don't think it's really worth your full attention.

To start off with, the art direction is fun, the ailments are silly and the basic designing of a hospital is satisfying. For both me and my partner that got us interested and in the door.

As the game progresses though, the optimization requirement really kicks in and it is both unclear and incredibly unfun. Things like ensuring you put up art on every wall, even if it's the same piece a hundred times. Training staff is clunky and annoying. The stream of patients seems to always test your max capacity, so unless I was missing some core mechanic, you could never be ""on top"" of the demand for hospital use. If you got more staff, you started getting more patients flooding in. It always had me sitting behind the curve of success. There was a level where all of your doctors started off poorly trained with the benefit that you got paid for training on the job. But the hospital was always brimming with patients, so I struggled to find time to do any training. Failed treatments lowered your hospital ratings, which affected your ability to complete levels and move on.

Some 20 years on we got a successor, and it has a lot to live up to.

TPH follows the same style as its progenitor - limited story, focus on management and completing objectives to unlock subsequent levels, very un-serious tongue-in-cheek style. So far so good right?
In fact, there's very little other than the (mediocre) graphics that has changed, and that's actually a problem. See, although Theme Hospital was (is) a very good game, it was released in the 90's, and as such had a number of issues and limitations that came with the times. These are all still here, but it's not the 90's anymore.
There are still too many bugs with patients getting stuck in places they shouldn't. The hospitals are too small and in weird shapes, making room placement problematic at best (and efficient placement often impossible). The staff available to hire are often made terrible with either bad traits, or training combinations that make them inefficient or ineffective. It tries a bit too hard to be funny and ends up in that awkward place of seeming bland. Animation time for everything is incredibly slow so takes ages for thing to actually happen - and it's not in line with other timers in the game (day/month progression, health decay time, challenge timers).

But worst of all is the queue and job management algorithm. This is so bad it gets it's own section in this review, and is in large part responsible for it being negative.
Here's a few examples:
-Janitors assigned to [i]only[/i] repair machines will wander around ""looking for work"" when there are machines that are not at full health. They will only take action when there is a machine below 50%. There is no way to adjust this.
-Sometimes the game will decide to send all patients to a single reception desk (even when there are 5+ desks, and 100+ patients). When removing the desk (to try and make it recalculate and fix a problem that shouldn't even exist), all 100 simple go to another single desk, instead of being split. This happened multiple times across multiple levels.
-When attempting to staff a room, it will sometimes pull staff out of an idle room 2 buildings over rather than the ""looking for work"" staff member (of the correct type) nearby.
-Patients being added to a room queue will get added to the far away room with a queue of 1 rather than the nearby room with a queue of 2. Why is this a problem? Because the walk time for this is often far longer than simply waiting in the closer ""longer"" queue.
-If a machine sets on fire and has to be put out, it will remain on low health. The janitor does not then automatically fix it, and will likely leave the room, allowing patients in to use the machine again. Which sets on fire again. How this got allowed to release I'll never know.
-Patients in a queue will wander across half the hospital to find a vending machine that has a queue of 0 rather than a nearby one in use. Again with a walk time that amounts to several patients worth of treatment time, for which - if the patient is at the front of the queue - the room has now been idle.
-The bug where a patient will just stand at the front of a queue and stop. And simply stand there until they die, holding up all the patients behind them (who are now nearly dead as well).


I fully recognise that these are very non-trivial problems and that making an algorithm that can solve these kinds of scenarios is difficult; but this level of failure is just not acceptable in a modern game. Yes Theme Hospital had similar issues, but that is not a modern game.

On top of all this, the price is too high. TPH released in 2018 and has a price (non-sale, at time of writing) of £24.99. PLUS all the not-exactly-cheap DLC on top of that (which don't have a whole lot of content for their price).

The game is also 'slow burning' as in it takes forever to actually lose which allows you to salvage it, but this usually means you spend like 5 hours on a hospital just to have to restart completely. If something like that enrages you (it got me to rage a couple times) then maybe not the game for you. It's still fun however and leaves lots of room for creativity and design. The game also has a lot of strategy and planning forward. 

[b] Gameplay & controls: [/b] Controls are simple, but there are a lot of options and shortcuts you will have to learn on your own. Pretty simple gameplay, you select an area, you have missions and to complete the level you have to do a certain number of missions. You can manage pretty much everything.

[b] Visual design: [/b] Lots of attention to detail, the people don't look completely copied and pasted and the art style is very good. The menus take a little getting used to navigating, but they are organized well. A really good example of the detail is the pictures for each staff member which slowly gets disfigured and ruined.

[b] Music and SFX: [/b] The game has this very nice radio with different radio hosts and many speech lines. The music is pretty elevator type music which can get annoying pretty fast though. You will probably need to play something else over top after your 10th hour. The Sound effects fit pretty well and are very well done.

[b] Multiplayer: [/b] There is multiplayer, but its pretty sad (although understandable, not sure how you make a tycoon multiplayer), essentially you can connect your hospital with someone else and complete missions together on your own hospital (Ex. we both buy 20 plants in our hospital). Your reward for doing these tasks is a plant or something pretty small. Its not really worth it to 'get the boys together' just to do these tasks, neither is it worth it to buy it just cause a friend wants to play with you.

[b] Enjoyment:[/b] The game is fun just it takes so much time to complete a level, obviously this could be me just being bad at the game, but still really hard. The patients rage quit and die so quickly and it gets annoying because we have the option to do something like increase the prices, but once you increase it by a dollar the patients just don't pay complaining about higher prices. Like I haven't had to pay at a hospital before, but like you can't just not pay for stuff right? Also the assistants cost so much why would I hire them, like one assistant brought in 200$ profits, but I was paying them like 2k a year and they were working at the store next to the entrance, so I never got return on investment. The patients would then complain about no food or drinks and its like I pay this guy 2k to feed you and you wont even walk like down the hall just to buy from him or use the water fountain or anything, so annoying. Anyways back to the game, it is fun and the game is very for a lack of a better word, goofy. You have people who have the disease known as 'bad breath' which is fatal apparently or people who have lost their colors which effects their clothes too? Then you also have when patients die they turn into a ghost which a janitor has to vacuum up.

[b] Bugs & other problems: [/b] Haven't seen many bugs, but the models and animations break pretty quickly. I think this is actually on purpose because it happens every time, but the janitor when vacuuming a ghost will have his vacuum perform the animation first then the janitor will do it so the vacuum will essentially be floating.

Overall pretty good, but enraging and hard.

You can choose to just beat a level and move on to the next. Or you can take on a bigger challenge and get those hospitals to 3 stars, and that can be pretty tricky. You basically just decide how hard you want to make it for yourself.

You do have to watch your cash flow early in each scenario, but once you have 4-5 treatment rooms, you can easily start upgrading your equipment, which means you can get your patients in and out faster, and by the time you have a few hours in a Hospital, your cash flow no longer is a worry because you're rolling in it.

However, each level does present a new primary object or focus (such as a natural disaster or a specific type of illness). Essentially, you manage a hospital by diagnosing patients and curing them. It can get quite difficult to hit a 3 star rating for your hospital. For clarification, each hospital level provides objectives, you complete them to earn a 1 star rating, 2 star rating, or a 3 star rating before proceeding to the next level. The primary challenge is to keep your hospital debt free while ensuring your patients are waiting in line for a long time. Otherwise, their health continues to drop and they eventually die. Overall, the game is a lot of casual fun. However, I do believe the game itself could use some quality of life updates to make things easier to manage. Regardless, I recommend this game and can't wait for Two Point Campus.

(EDIT) I now have almost 100+ hours logged in this game, I can confirm that getting a 3 star on every level within the base game campaign is time consuming but still fun and/or challenging.

6 tutorial maps followed by a relentless series of challenges, where the 1st Star is relatively easy, the 2nd Star is challenging and the 3rd ranges from tricky to almost impossible

For example there could be endless natural disasters or an algorithm designed to send only patients who require treatments in rooms you don't have (resulting in massive queues)

There are also a huge variety of rooms, illnesses, staff traits, management features (incl. staff break times) plus numerous upgrades, with a fully customisable soundtrack

Past levels can be revisited without exiting the current level to use old research facilities and acquire new upgrades in the current level - a feature almost no other sim game currently has

This all leads me to a huge appreciation for the game, but the developers adding achis from DLCs, even if you haven't bought them this gets a red flag for achievement hunters.

8/10 - a disappointing ending for an otherwise tremendously enjoyable game

I was addicted to Theme Hospital as a kid and Two Point Hospital's Developers prescribed a happy overdose of nostalgia!
From the base game to all the DLC's - I have enjoyed each and everyone one.
No game is ever perfect or to everyone's tastes, but for me Two Point Hospital pushes all the right button's. I love the theme, design, sound, all the management systems, all the puns and fun! 

My only critique would be the Superbug aspect of the game - Most of my friends are not into Sim type games and it's sad I have to  use ""Gyro-nut"" basically add strangers to my friends list in hopes to even do this part of the game. 

Yes it has a lot of easy to exploit systems for easy wins.  Yes Sony forces in shameless cosmetics (but at least for free). But the game keeps getting updates, keeps making new DLC's that don't feel like they should have been part of the base game, but truly creative, interesting and fun DCL packs.
The game is still getting constant updates and the developers are obviously working hard to improve the game and adjust it.

Its a decent light management with loads of options to tweak costumes, unlock objects to help your staff or just decorate the building. It has a good visualization mode to easily see guest hunger/thirst/hygiene/happiness/decor etc

My only complaint would be I wish it had a difficult slider as after you get the hang of things I don't find it super challenging to complete. Sure sometimes stuff goes horribly wrong but for the most part its smooth sailing. Good for a light challenge and relaxing management sim.

Very nice background music interrupted by the hospital's ridiculous radio station, and humorous tannoy speaker.

I've managed to beat the main game hospitals with three stars in all of them. I've started to work on the remix levels and the DLC but honestly, I felt pretty satisfied  with the main ""questline"" that I decided to take a break but I digress. The game is an absolute banger.

Starting off, you get a small scale clinic that with each progressing hospital gets significantly larger. The goal is to meet specific criteria for that level (like a specific cure rate, curing x patients with x disease, ect.) and when it's accomplished you get a letter from the health minister and a star. You are not obligated to get all three stars, you can continue to the next with one star, but the criteria gets harder to accomplish the more stars you try to earn. I personally never felt like it was unfair but some levels will make you pull out your hair because the percentages.just.won't.go.up. Not a bug, it just can be hard to figure out what aspect you are lacking that is keeping you from reaching your goals. Probably one of my few complaints of the game. The game is fun to play long sessions or in short bursts, it's a very easy ""pick up and play"" kind of game. You don't even *need* the DLC to enjoy it. You'll easily be able to figure out if this game is meant for you within the 2 hour refund limit, so give it a shot.

Just, a tip, there is a template tool in the game that allows you to copy and save rooms. Trust me, the amount of General Practitioners you'll need, this will save your fingers.",1637097249,1637097249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a good hospital building simulator with a wide array of objects and several options to customize aspects of the game. There's plenty of hospitals and challenges that come with each one of them, and an online multiplayer mode that has some local and global challenges. There are some downsides however, such as the lack of effective communication between the player and game, the fact that you often need 4-5 GP offices to get to a 1-star hospital, the necessity to go back into earlier more developed hospitals and spend some time ""researching"" new treatment methods in order to treat patients in later hospitals, and multiplayer challenges that require 2-3 friends on steam that actively play this game in order to gain access to some more items and content.

Two Point Hospital has a colourful and happy look. It is a good vibration thing in that you is happy to play. This is good. Play way is normally not hard but abnormally a bit more tricky. At first I was all in, but on hospital no. troi I got a bit... un-wahoo!'d? As building good but did not go up far so far as to win; put down bin, put down plant, put down sign, aaaand nothing up.  Fourth hospital was back in chaos, so hard to know difficulty throughout. Looks good, is funny with sick/ill-things not as was. Things not un-shift... Many thinkings... as thought...?

Okay, that joke might be a wee bit dark, but that IS the premise of the game. But honestly, I dont think that ""unibrow"" is a life threatening sickness....I Think.

Like most people, I bough this game because Im actually old enough to remember a game called 'Theme Hospital"", and this game can in all honestly be called a spiritual successor. It has the same kind of humor, build style and cartoony feel to it. So yeah, I was sold right away!

Now I do need to warn everyone, this is not heavy management game. It does require some management, like research, checking staff and making sure your staff is up to par with their training. But it is not nearing Project Hospital levels of management. Its very surface level management stuff, but if you feel like it, you could choose to ""optimize"" every hospital, by staying on top of training, making sure that certain doctors work at certain departments, etc. The management aspect is as deep as YOU want it to be.

The missions are varried, and new sicknesses get introduced on a regular basis to make sure that you stay on yer toes, and the number of DLC's out for the game make sure that you are NOT getting bored with this game any time soon. I love the fact that most DLC add new missions, with new types of illness, even though the main game is already pretty big.

 All in all, its a great successor to Theme Hospital, with even some multiplayer aspects like WorldWide Research. So, if ya liked Theme Hospital, make sure to give this a try.",1635231099,1635231099,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really like 'Project Hospital', and even before that, I used to play 'Theme Hospital' in highschool... now both of those games are really good, and 'Two Point Hospital' (TPH) is very good as well. TPH is a clearly bigger budget, more ambitious hospital-sim game, with better graphics and a much less 'hands on approach' than Project Hospital, but TPH is much more expensive, and for some reason, even 3years after TPH was released, it's STILL being sold at 100% of the original price (my guess is that you've got SEGA to thank for that).

Apart from TPH costing $35, there's over $70 worth of expansion DLC to buy, which is pretty egregious tbh. I think that the game is well worth $35, but it's NOT worth the $100+ that SEGA would like you to spend on it... I honestly struggle to think of [u]ANY[/u] game that is worth $100, so it's very obvious that TPH is NOT worth $100 or even close tbh. But, I digress... I can recommend the base game for $35 with no real reservations; it's a good game and is basically a better looking, much less hands-on version of 'Project Hospital'. So I'd recommend it, but SEGA need to catch a f*cking wake-up.

I'd be lying if I said it did not have a problem with repetitiveness, but the various different hospitals help mix it up; especially early on or with the DLC hospitals. In that respect, I suggest not being as stubborn as me and be willing to bounce around before you hit star 3. Plus, there are QoL things like kudosh and research unlocks being meta, as well as saving room templates. The latter should help largely when you get tired of building a new hospital from scratch each time.

I will quickly comment on the tone: if it is not already obvious, Two Point Hospital is pretty zany and light hearted. If you are looking for realism, this isn't your game. I personally do not mind it, and even laugh occasionally, but I understand the appeal of something like Project Hospital instead.

What I liked about the game is you can go into different locations to start a hospital, with it's own challenges. It keeps things exciting and there is always something new to explore, to overcome, and to solve the problems that happen. Looking at the graphics, I think it's pretty good. I like watching the patients getting their treatment with those funky (named) machines, and it brings some laughter. The developers' humour is appreciated. ;p The realistic-ness of getting a loan, not able to pay back and then file for bankruptcy... hahaha!

What I dislike (minor) about the game is that sometimes it gets a bit mundane to reach the 3-star level because things can get repetitive at times. I haven't played to the end yet (is there an ending???) and have yet to try more and explore more, so I really can't comment much on what I dislike.

I don't think this game is very optimized and may push you to lower your settings. There is a PG comedic tone with literal humor that will certainly grant a few smirks the first time you see them (even if it can be really stupid), but eventually the novelty wears off and you start associating them in terms of gameplay (I see goofy sickness X, I need treatment X). I think the biggest problem is the lack of variation within each disease type and how the patients interact with the doctors - the interactions play EXACTLY THE SAME each time.

Story/Dialogue - N/A

Gameplay (2/5) -Maybe I didn't give it enough time, but after 5+ hours, I could tell this is a pretty casual, repetitive game with little complexity. You build rooms specialized on certain needs, earn profit, hire staff associated with certain hospital needs, watch things play out, and so on until you build the next hospital, doing very similar gameplay to advance further.

the only thing i think the game is missing is a few more tools for employee job assignment. treatment skill is one of the more important stats and once you get a big enough place you want to keep employees lacking treatment training out of treatment rooms and its a pain to do for a bunch of employees at once. a cohort system would be neat, where employees of a particular cohort can only work in certian rooms.

For example, the hygiene stat seems to add nothing more to the game than a reason to put a sink in the bathroom and hand sanitizer in every treatment room or else have more failed treatments; there are no other relevant items or effects.

Benches and other items claim to ""improve comfort"", but comfort is not a stat for either staff or patients, and even though you get a pop-up warning you that people are having to stand in line, it doesn't appear to have any impact on happiness or anything else at all.

You gain hospitals as you progress through each ""level"" (level being hospital), and you can compete with other people on your friends list who has the game!

To get the most out of this game and to lessen frustration, *do* explore all the info options.  Yes, I recommend, but prepare to be annoyed at some things. You can lessen your annoyance level by looking at the tips below.

Possible spoilers

- Take a loan if you need one [$ tab] (essential for the objective oriented income eg. hiring an employee to train). Pay back your most expensive one first, deficits are ok, unless you are about to go bankrupt...
- Use the 'Patient' info to get a list of your patients [person tab], you can order them in terms of health and see the ones that need intervention because they are unhappy or about to die (eg putting them to the top of the queue)
- Also use 'Patient' info to select and manually send a patient to treatment that is just short of your diagnosis threshold (It could make or break completing your wave)
- Use Overview [$ tab], look at 'Policy' tab and make sure your treatment decision is fast tracked - otherwise you will have clogged up GPs, patients going back to get their illness named at 100% diagnosis and extreme vexation
- On Overview>Policy Set the Diagnosis level slider where you are happy, 85% works for me generally
- Do use Person tab>Staff>Job Assignment to ensure skilled staff work in the appropriate rooms.
- When trying to find aliens and paparazzi, go thru your Patient list>Log. These bludgers arrive, go to reception and then direct to a diagnosis room, sometimes straight to diagnosis. Legit patients will always have Reception followed by GP. [If they are in the Ward and can't be sent home, rename them for later eviction]
- Don't be tempted to upgrade all your machines when income is scarce. Work on the treatment ones that will get your income flowing first.
- Multiple small training rooms and staff rooms are better than big ones
- Think about your placement eg. nesting a 3x3 on at 4x4 when space is tight, too many GPs close together causing congestion, like treatment or diagnosis staff collected in the same spot for ease of going between rooms, patient flow from diagnosis to treatment - don't make the poor wee poppets trek back and forth vast distances.

There are a couple of terrible design decisions in this game:  fast treatment decisions default to off (why is this even a thing?!), and patients in the loo or cafe cannot be manually selected to send for treatment. I suspect coding convenience... don't mess with me when I'm micro-managing (lol!) let me designate what they will do, I don't mind if it happens after they eat/evacuate etc, but don't make me wait for them or come back to them. [ Ed. I need to mention the yearly reviews, which are painful - unavoidably interrupting your placement of rooms or movement of staff - this also, while possibly created to disallow idling, is horrible and infuriating design, the only positive is you get a 5k bonus per award] 

But overall, fun and worth the spend espesh on sale. If in doubt, buy the base game to see how you fare with the above vexations before dropping money on the DLC.",1628711941,1628908720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But that's by design. I write these things mostly for myself so I can read what I wrote when I revisit the game.

I complained about a lack of challenge and micromanagement but later levels certainly deliver on that. It's still not very challenging once you get the hang of it but the game throws more than enough new stuff at the player. 

I still have some complaints. The biggest one is that levels are too long. It can become boring. The levels also aren't varied enough, they play out the same which again can become tedious. The base game also doesn't have enough items, making every hospital and every room look alike. I'm still not the biggest fan of the game's humor (or attempts at making the games theme lighter, if you will) but it's growing on me. Personally I would have preferred a slightly more serious approach.
Hospital attractiveness is also very important but the game offers very little in variety of items to design the hospital. There's plenty to unluck off course (though not enough) but that means that there are very little options until you put in the hours and unlock them.

While the game is easy to get into it fails explaining anything but the basics. Very important features are never explained in any kind of tutorial. 

Steam offers two ratings: Recommended or Not Recommended. Thumbs up or Thumbs down. This one is either a ""recommended"" with a ""but"" or a ""not recommended"" with a ""despite"" behind it. I get not offering a 1-5 or 1-10 score because players only use the two extremes of that track. There really should be a neutral rating though.",1628479908,1628658574,False,1,0,0,2,True,False,False

Lots of little jokes.

My only really big complaint it the speed of things seems to be a bit wonky. It takes days to get a single patient to even talk to 1 person. So you can imagine how silly that can be. A consultation with a doctor that the animation shows him walking in, talking, paying 500 dollars for and then leaving could take 1-2 days. Meaning that for an entire year, a doctor may only have 150-200 patients. I had a patient that left after 415 days without being treated once. I mean its a bit stupid to have them being able to wait that long. Also the health, number of patients etc. Is a bit of a failure.

I would like to say this is the spiritual successor to Theme Hospital but I feel like its more like a fanboy tribute. It had a lot more potential but its still a fun game. However unlike the original, I can't just binge play it, I need to take breaks between maps and even during maps.

The multiplayer aspect is also just a joke. It would have been better to not have it but these days everybody is trying to connect online game mechanics with regards to working together, click here and invite your friends nonsense to games outside of web based games.

Although I don't remember Theme Hospital exactly, but I think, they recreated it really close to the original adding only good things including QoL. This is almost an ideal remake.
Also, they somehow managed to combine 3 things:
1. You can play casually, not really delving into mechanics and still get an ok hospital that gets stars.

As someone who played Theme Hospital back in the day, I can see that they've tried to recreate the experience of it in this game with varying levels of success. Regardless of that, I think it's important to review something on its own merits. The gameplay is straightforward enough with progression to more difficult levels as you play through. So far, so good. I think one of the issues lies with the difficulty, it's not that difficult to get all of the stars on individual levels and the requirements for doing so often just involve grinding away and time. I would have preferred more thought put into this. It gets a bit boring after two levels. If you have a game with a number of systems within it that have to be carefully balanced in order to play well, I just think it needs to be harder and that it should be more refined than it is in this game. Graphics were kind of meh and granted, the game was funny at times but overall, my impression was that this game is kind of boring.",1626432691,1626432691,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The way the game is made, you simply don't have to look much on all the details and so most people probably miss how bad some things really work. After all, it's easy to beat anything: Just put out more stuff of anything. Too long queues? Simply build another room and hire another doctor. Need higher prestige? Spam the walls with posters or certificates. Need faster training? Spam the room with training boosts. 

The ""challenges"" the games put out, are always similar: Achieve so much money in so much time. Treat so many patiens having a specific illness in a specific time. Not hard to beat those. And if you don't, there's no downside. You can even simply dismiss them or not accept them. 

Overall the game provides little to no challenge. I've been playing classic games of that kind, which all had some balancing and difficulty, with negative effects for your success. But this one doesn't have anything of the like. A bad rating somewhere? Doesn't matter. Bad reputation, so what? Too high prices, patients keep visiting you anyway. Balancing? I don't see it.

Take as example this: You can have the worst hospital, but then you can have one room, spammed with posters, certificates and other stuff (and this is btw the only way it works and what affects prestige all the time from beginning till the end), and while the rest of your hospital is Level 1, this one can count as Level 5000 (exaggerated to make it clear), without anything else affecting this rating. Not even, if you place in the staff's room like 20 radiators and burn your doctors alive, the room still counts as awesomely awesome and your staff is happy with it! 

Once you start paying a little bit more attention on what the patients and your employeers do, you start getting the feeling, things weren't finished or fine-tuned. People keep bumping on each other and they only manage to move forward, once they ""slide"" enough and other things. Similarly, other things feel missing or unfinished, especially since nothing has a real downside on your gameplay. In the end, everything is achievable, even if you are the worst hospital manager. Money is also never a real issue in the game.

I suppose, the game wants to make money based on the nostalgy of that classic game. Because, on it's own, without borrowing the enthusiasm of the classic fans, it leaves a lot to be desired. 

I kept playing nearly 30 hours hoping it would get better and somewhat challenging, but that's not the case. If a game does not achieve that in less than 30 hours, then... 

It's a simple simulation and not a very good one. The one thing, that seemed to be cool when watching the trailer, the different ""crazy"" illnesses, actually is only cool in the trailer. In the game, it loses immediately it's funny side. I'm really missing the ""fun part"" in the animations and in how the patients or doctors behave. 

Further, the game is very unpersonal. At no point you connect with your doctors or any of your patients, since it presents everything and anything in simple text-only popups, all being the same. This is another part that feels unfinished and as if no love went into it. 

And these annoying messages that keep appearing, you can do this and that, hundreds of times, when you already know, that you can upgrade machines, or how to hire another nurse. No way to deactivate them, when they come up. It will keep annoy you, over and over again.

So, you see, I don't understand all the positive reviews, with so many things not done very well. But like I said, at first, the way the game plays and makes you focus mostly on room-building -> hiring -> training -> hiring -> room-building, it is easy for anyone to miss all these negative sides of the game. And I believe, that this is what happening.",1625690605,1625691622,False,290,22,0.714562535285949707,29,True,False,False

I gave up on a level that expected the hospital to be a certain level of valuable, and look good, and cure one kind of disease.

II tried to a bunch of different tricks to just have a month where I made a profit and nothing worked, and eventually I gave up.

UPDATE 7/4/2021: I suppose it would be hypocritical to put this many additional hours into this game and still give it a negative review. I got sucked back in thanks to the trailer for Two Point Campus. My advice is: do not go for more than a one-star rating for each hospital.

You play as a hospital and try to build and manage it, mostly by building, furnishing, and hiring/firing/training staff, and try to balance your revenue with your expenses. There are a few sliders, like paying staff more or the diagnosis threshold before sending patients for treatment, but not that many. The maps also provide interesting challenges; new hospital locations usually come with interesting challenges, such as working in a place with frequent earthquakes or epidemics, working with a public health system where you make no income through normal means and instead have to meet arbitrary goals from a health minister, and where you take over a crumbling inner city hospital $10k in debt. 

There are a few criticisms, mainly that the balance is off; the vast majority of your queues, unless you seriously focus them, are to the GP office. A lot of the challenge is also based on when you first open your hospital, and once you get your money really flowing, it just starts flooding in and you can spend and expand as much as you want. On top of that, the items have no scaling, so you can, for example, put 20 monitors or medicine cabinets to stack that % treatment power bonus it gives, so the best rooms end up looking ridiculous, and if you have challenges like get a level 5 staff room, you can buy 20 Gold Award frames, get the challenge done, and immediately sell them. The number of things you can buy is also limited, although I don't have any DLC so that may be part of it.

Every patient who enters the hospital in the game has an illness that can be diagnosed AND cured, as long as you get to them in time before their health and/or happiness runs out!

The illnesses are amusing at every level, some more ridiculous than others. The in-game radio station is quite amusing. It is possible to listen to your own music, but since I like to stream 2PH on Twitch (as Karistina) I tend to listen to the default music most of the time. Two Point County's pop star, Jasmine Odyssey, has some entertaining songs that have been added to the music rotation, but I was disappointed once I actually listened to the lyrics of ""Nice-Smelling Face."" Despite its cheerfully catchy melody, the song is terribly ableist in its mocking of specifically autistic traits. As an autistic person, it's pretty offensive. I wish they could re-record it with alternate lyrics that didn't suggest the subject was a loser whose only redeeming quality is a ""nice-smelling face.""

But I digress. The DJs on the in-game radio station are quite entertaining, as each is a caricature of various types of radio personalities. They are all played by the same voice actor, and I'm quite the fan! The tannoy messages from the hospital announcer are amusing as well. The game has a wry sense of humor!

[i]I really wanted to like Two Point Hospital. The premise sounds so great: a reimagination of the more than two decades old Theme Hospital, a game I remember playing with delight. This can only be good, right? Wrong. Playing the first three levels felt so close to the original and I was positively impressed. The soundtrack was a bit more downtempo compared to the original and, for some odd reason, the game felt way slower than I remembered. Suddenly things start to feel off. And by the fourth level, it started to annoy me.

I started to realize that this game doesn't respect your time. I wanted to know why and I found the reason - gameplay and new animations fight against the player in more ways than just by difficulty. I started losing income even though I felt that I did everything right. Until one day, I realized that giving patients benches, vending machines and things to reduce their boredom with holds up the entire queue. I started to struggle with queues all the time and even 5-6 GP offices couldn't reduce the buildup. I had to initiate mass exodus from my hospitals every year because they would die like flies. Why? Because they hold up the queues. I don't understand. Why add a mechanic into a game that bites you in the behind like this? Why give the patients options to annoy the player more than they should? This runs against anything I've experienced before. And for the animations: bloaty head in the original is cured within 10 seconds, the recurvery treatment for cubism needs a whooping 50 (!) seconds for one patient. What the hell went wrong here? Remember emergencies? Good luck treating all patients in time because (unlike in the original) people can't walk through each other anymore. This all culminates in a painfully slow gameplay loop that takes up too much of your time and is not worth the effort. Avoid this game unless you really want to feel that tiny bit of nostalgia.[/i]",1624659065,1624659487,False,15,0,0.547173380851745605,0,True,False,False

Pros,

Theme hospital was one of the greatest games ever made, this just came along and matched it.
High amounts of content and hospitals, more than it looks when you first buy it.
Hilarious dialogue and treatments.
Awesome amount of freedom and control over what you do to a certain extent.
Perfect for anyone who has an OCD for micromanaging.
Graphically extremely relaxing and pleasing.
The best of British humour.

Cons,

Learning curve is brutal compared to the first game.
Micro controls can be frustrating.
An awful lot to remember in the later levels.
RNG based staff recruiting system which can be annoying and cause a few resets.
Some form of co-op mode would be awesome.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I love the look and feel of the game.  It's fun to design rooms, decorate hallways, and see all of the interactions going on.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

The problem is, for the most part, what you do doesn't matter at all.  You can design a perfect hospital and get all the patients/money available.  Or, you could let your hospital go and still get enough patients and money.  Patients leave angry?  So what, there are 10 behind him.  Employee quit?  Eh, there are six to take their place.

At the end of each mission I had so much money I couldn't spend it fast enough.  Most items didn't seem to have an impact.  Should I put a trash can down?  Why?  Litter didn't seem to matter to anything.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

It's a great game for the looks, but not for the gameplay.  As far as management games go, there just isn't anything to really manage, so I stopped playing.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.

It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.

For instance items like the medical cabinet which increase diagnosis power in a room by 1% stack. So you can simply build a giant GP office with 100 of them and a student doctor with no GP skill can diagnose most of the diseases to 100% immediately, rendering any other diagnosis rooms pointless. For the harder diseases it will get them to 60-70% meaning you only need one other diagnosis room likewise stacked with medical cabinets in order to diagnose everything.

If you do not exploit this mechanic however then you inevitably end up in a situation where half your hospital is filled with GP rooms and yet you still have massive queues for them due to patients visiting the GP between every other diagnosis room. This is the single most game breaking mechanic because there is no way of setting GP offices to just be used for the initial diagnosis and others for follow up exams so it's rarely possible to utilise the full space of the hospital and keep patients funnelled through it in a logical order. They'll walk to the GP on the opposite side of the hospital rather than the one adjacent to the last room they visited. So you end up with hallways choked so full of people going back and forth that it takes days for anyone to get anywhere.

For the harder diseases that often means they have spent half a year wandering about the hospital and are borderline dead by the time it comes to treat them. Whereas you can avoid this by spamming a single item in a single room. It's ridiculous. The game really incentives this item spamming and the best way to get a room to 5 stars is just to pick a small, high value item like the gold award and plaster every space on every wall with it leading to a very stupid looking hospital. Likewise you can spam medicine cabinets in treatment rooms and bring the cure rate up to 100% without bothering to spend ages training doctors to high levels of proficiency. It realistically seems to be the only way to not have deaths in your hospital and get the award for that. Or you dramatically expedite training speeds by spamming the same poster on every wall and training bookcases in front of that. The mechanic would work if it just didn't stack and it forced you to use a limited number of different items to achieve maybe a 10-20% improvement rather than 100 of a single item halving training speeds.

If you actually want to enjoy the game as a hospital simulator you could choose to avoid just spamming items and cheating it but if you do that the game will punish you for it and things will become unmanageable and unplayable. It's like only using a knife during a shooting game in order to deliberately make it harder for yourself. You really have to force yourself to do it.

After a few levels or playing the same one long enough you start to see how broken the game is and it feels pointless to bother playing it anymore so personally I've just taken to entertaining myself by seeing how broken I can make things. Whether that is making one hit diagnosis GP rooms or pharmacies that occupy a whole building with the corridors woven into a labyrinth such that people die before ever reaching the end - it's still more fun than playing the game as intended.",1623778296,1623778296,False,1,0,0.472049683332443237,2,True,False,False

I have no idea how there are so many positive reviews for this game.  There must be a lot of bots writing fake reviews, or accounts are getting hacked and used to write reviews.

This game is COMPLETELY plagued with bugs. I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes of the game - the bugs stopped me from advancing. You'd think these bugs would be worked out since the game's release date in 2018.

2 minutes into the game, the very first patient gets stuck by the road, the vehicle door opens and closes infinitely.  After 10 restart attempts, I was able to get by this particular bug 2 times.  Other patients got stuck the same way 10 minutes in - couldn't advance the game.

Another bug occasionally happens when you attempt to hire staff - a bugged ghost version of the staff is placed in the hospital, and doesn't register.

Another bug causes patients to stack and get stuck in the GP's office

Another bug causes staff to get confused and not do their jobs.

If you think you can save and reload the game to quickfix this, you cannot.  Either the came will continue to reload with the same bug, or there will be an error and it won't let you load your save, and you'll be forced to start a new game.

How can all of these issues still be here? I've never encountered so many issues with a game before, even in beta stages.  If I encountered all of this within the first 15 minutes of gameplay, I don't want to even think about how many more bugs await.",1623625458,1623625458,False,4,4,0.429373204708099365,0,True,False,False

but i would say that some things are quite frustrating like moving objects is hard when editing a room to the point where youll design a room and by the end you have to delete it because say you need to move the door. it is also hard to get the doctors nurses etc to manage their breaks well and this ehds in some characters taking 2 weeks breaks while others energy is red i wish these things were a bit more managable that and the little characters constantly running away while you try to move them also some of the rooms do not need to be 3x3 which is the minimum with all their equipment in them it makes it annoying to try and fit every room you need into the hospital and some of the cool stuff you want to spend money on for the patients and break rooms.",1623625358,1623625358,True,1,0,0.501036286354064941,0,True,False,False

The little radio inputs are, interesting. The lady on the speakers was also fun in the beginning but.. it's just the same over and over again and loses it's charm pretty fast. 

The game itself seems nice altough i've had a bad experience on my sandbox save. People started piling up in front of the doctors offices a few hours into the game and i literally couldn't do anything about it.
I built a whole entire building just for peoples diagnoses and they still weren't taken care of. I had enough staff with good qualifications too but yeah. 
I might not have figured the game out entirely yet but this definitely is a big negative part that stands out.

You can't move entrances and the building layouts are pre-made and ugly which is very annoying in planning.

It includes [u] a lot [/u] of sarcasm and humorism in general. The diseases/illnesses the patient have follow this line and are therefore more funny than anything of realistic. I mean we're speaking from illnesses like Cubism, Floppy Discs, Grey Anatomy, Jazz Hand, Premature Mummification, Cauliflower Ears, Flat-Packed etc...
And really, it makes so much fun to discover all these different diseases and everytime you experience something new you have to laugh because it's always connected with a funny anecdote.
And in general it has to be said that Two Point Hospital has such a lot of lovely details in it which makes the game only even more great. With that I mean for example the loudspeaker announcements- this woman is so funny with the little things she tells and you often have to smile about it, the same goes with the announcements trough the radio. And the stil of the graphic fits also perfectly!
And even if you only have the main game without any DLC, you can spend a lot of time in that game! I spent round about 100 hours only in the main game, because I had a lot of fun to collect all possible stars for every different hospital- it gets never boring!
I can also tell that the DLC are worth it too because there is also so many new things to discover, new diseases, new hospitals, new challenges, new landscapes etc...

It's a good successor to the original theme hospital.
The game is good. It's nice and relaxing (after you get the mechanics). The musics are nice.

There's easily a hundred hour of gameplay (if you try to get 2+ stars everywhere). 
It can get repeatitive after a while (what doesn't after a hundred hours?). I would advise to start with the regular game first. Then do the DLC one by one when you feel like more.

HINT: Get 3 stars in the first 5 levels, it's unlocking improvements. I didn't know and I played the whole game without Pharmacy 3.

---

The game has improved a lot since the original release and there are zero bugs today. The top negative reviews are outdated.

* There are room templates, you can easily copy rooms.
* GP queues were fixed, the #1 patient could go away to get a drink or cafeteria, and the queue would be blocked for a while.
* All bugs were fixed. I recall one where a doctor could get stuck on a cell, forever bugging a cell of the map, that was fixed a year or two after release.",1622205274,1622205274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even in a fully developed hospital, placing rooms differently is not too much of a headache, which allows you to experiment with different layouts. You can always pause the game, take a good look around and modifiy you layout without having to restart the mission.

You can gain 3 stars in each mission. Only the first star is required to unlock the next mission, and you only have to understand the new element introduced by a mission to get this. You gain additional rooms and items in new missions, so if you ever have trouble getting the second or third star, you can continue the campaign and revisit the hospital later, with your new items and experience to get it done (Although its perfectly doable to gain all the stars with the equipment you got at the start of the mission - switching between the hospitals is not required).

The artstyle is easily readable. This is great for a management game like this, because you still see and understand what's going on, even when your hospital is filled with hundreds of patients with wacky illnesses.
The humour makes even the jokiest of joking dads blush. If you dislike the focus on wacky, punny diseases & treatments, Project Hospital might me a better fit for you.

You can spend a lot of time decorating your hospital, if you enjoy this. The option to create room templates and use them in all other missions is great. Now you can design the GP office, Cardiology and Ward of you dreams, and just resize them a little, if need be. There are plenty of decorations, benches, entertainment and food options, allowing you to give your different hospitals different styles. When you gain new decorative items, you can put them in your room template and use them from then on. Every GP office of mine now has this fancy cocktail-bar-hidden-in-a-globe from the Bigfoot DLC. My Doctors deserve a pick-me-up now and then!
If you don't want to spend too much time decorating, you can also copy&paste the same item to improve the decor.",1622123892,1622123892,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I wish it were easier to place some items, but the controls are fairly decent. Clicking on rooms to copy them can be difficult.

I would have preferred the ability to modify my hospital in a more passive way while keeping the aesthetics visually appealing. As it is, items have to be placed in odd ways simply to ensure temperature and beauty requirements. I enjoy the game at times and continue to play it from time to time.

The bad: Some stages are almost unplayable but you can ""kinda cheat"" by pumping research in a previous map and cash out on your new map. There are also some imbalances in the patient inflow / hospital level and a steep learning curve but the fun provided heavily outweighs these issues.

Then people just started dying in queue never getting to cures. like 7/10 patients just queued to GP office and died on the spot after queueing to X-ray or something.

Even then the patients never got back to GP and just died waiting. And when the people just died in queue I never got the money to upgrade my stuff or even build a research lab to get the necessary cures to win the missions. Just odd. 
Oh and I hate how the cure machines just take too long to cure someone. I got a emergency to cure 4 patients in surgery and the surgeries took so long I got to cure 2/4 people. I had level 3 surgeon and level 3 treatment nurse working in there and that didn't do anything. So sad.

It was developed by a team that includes two of the original Theme Hospital developers and maintains the same theme and humor while updating it for the modern day. It includes a number of features that were desired for Theme Hospital including room templates, an easy to customize music, and the ability to easily run on a modern system. The skills and mechanics of the game have been updated and expanded with the game's map having a smoother learning curve for new players. If you have played Theme Hospital you'll understand most of the game very easily but also find it [i]almost[/i] too easy until the later maps as mechanics are introduced more slowly compared to Theme Hospital.

There are a few negatives to the game I found that include the inability to change UI colors with background and foreground colors being too close for comfort on some monitors, a clunky UI that feels counterintuitive and often requires more action to accomplish something than in Theme Hospital. There are also items that probably should be nerfed and certain mechanics, like not really requiring seating for patients, that should probably also be fixed.

All-in-all if you enjoyed the original Theme Hospital or any of the Theme games from that era or just want a light-hearted simulator game with a lot of humor you'll probably enjoy this game.

The game is Theme Hospital.  You get to build your own hospital, treat patients with weird illnesses and listen to a rather chipper lady announce obscure things over the tannoy system.  The game is amazing, funny and you have a blast.

Now, the year is 2021. You see the title, 'Two Point Hospital'.  The graphics bear a striking resemblance to something you've seen before... Suddenly a wave of nostalgia hits you and you're reliving the terrifying days of running into debt trying to cure someone with 'the squits'.  You watch the trailer for the video and that haunting voice comes back to you: 'We're sorry for the litter that YOU dropped on our floor'.  She's back.  The game is back.  You have to relive building hospitals and managing your money like you actually know what you're doing whilst trying to cure patients with weird diseases.
But this time, there's a twist.  You have an amazing radio to go with the game. Now you can listen to the dulcet tones of Harrison Wolff lulling you to sleep whilst you try your best not to let anyone die.

TLDR; This game is amazing and if you have played and loved Theme Hospital previously, this is an absolute must for you.

Coming from Cities Skylines, the simulation in this game is mediocre at best. The patient size and types of illnesses at your hospital will always remain the same throughout the gameplay regardless of how much reputation your hospital has. This is pretty unrealistic and entirely unchallenging. To acquire new rooms and new illnesses, the game forces you to create a 2nd hospital or purchase their DLCs. Still, the patient size will never increase, which means the gameplay gets stagnant very quickly.

However, the biggest let down for this game is the variety of rooms they give you. You expand new room options with new hospitals and DLCs.

But there are some things which are not implemented good enough. The game contains several abuse mechanics which are easily found and exploited, making some of the features useless. And after some missions, the game tends to be repetitive when you already know the algorithm and just repeat it until you reach all level goals.
But the biggest issue for me is coop/mp mechanics. It'd rather had none of that than having an existing one. You literally play by yourself and just check the progress of the global mission to see if your friend is still playing or not. Feels like a joke from devs.
To summarize - goods stylistic, catchy gameplay and amusing jokes, but not enough diversity and challenges to enjoy it for a while. Yet, IMO, it is enough to be worth every penny.

I can give it a positive rating for the fact that I like simulations, there are not many hospital simulations, it has an entertaining cartoon style and the gameplay feels a lot like the old ""theme park"" games.

That being said, the gameplay becomes very repetitive quickly and you completely lack the statistics to really keep things under control. Often you just have to try and fail or repeat the same patterns again and again that have worked in the past. That's NOT good game design at all.

I have no idea who buys extensions for this game with even more of the same..!

Two Point Hospital is a funny take on a Hospital Tycoon game with its origins very clearly set back in the Theme Park days of the 90's. Build up a hospital, make some money, expand and repeat. Try not to kill patients. Two Point Hospital does this, much like it's predecessor, with a slightly dark sense of humor. There are almost no real illnesses (the only exception I can think of is broken bones) and some of the made-up ones are genuinely funny. 

The game has a campaign that gently introduces players to new concepts, as well as new conditions and their treatments. There are always up to three stars that can be achieved in a campaign mission, with varying objectives for each. Getting three stars at the beginning is virtually impossible, as certain objects still need to be unlocked in later mission. You then go back to the ealier missions. Personally I like this. I also like that there are unlockable cosmetic items in the campaign map that you can use on all the mission. These feel like they might be paid-for unlockables in a mobile game but they are all unlockable with in-game currency. 

The game looks, for the genre, quite good. The only other modern Hospital Tycoon game I can think of is Project Hospital and Two Point Hospital looks much better. But then, even though it's the same sub-genre, they are totally different games, so I think a comparision is almost a little unfair. The one thing I will say in Two Point Hospitals favour in regards to display is the UI. This is one aspect of the game I was super impresed with. Everything is easy to find, easy to use and looks great.

I really have only one issue with the game. The trouble is, it's a rather big one. As mentioned earlier, the gameplay consists of build up a hospital, make some money, expand and repeat. Apart from staff training and different building layouts on the maps, that's it. In other words, while the UI and the graphics have had a big ol' overhaul, the gameplay is EXACTLY the same as the 1997 game it was so obviouly based on and man, that gameplay has aged.

As much as I loved Theme Hospital and as much as I love many aspects of this game, I just cannot recommend it. I've racked-up some hours on this game but that's only because I've returned to this game repeatedly, telling myself that it must be good, given I loved the original so much. But then I play a maximum for 20-30 mins and realise it was probably just nostalgia.",1616878747,1616878747,False,51,5,0.637960135936737061,0,True,False,False

Perhaps I was a bit harsh with my original review. People have poured their time into a game that harnesses both nostalgia and nuance into a next-gen experience and my original review was largely based on nostalgia. Once you get the hang of it, my original concerns are manageable. Kudos goes a long way and I encourage you to do the same as I have and give this great game a chance!

Their formula is different, as it likely needed to be. I find myself running the soundtrack through my head at night and am excited to continue in the morning. If you loved Theme Hospital, you'll love this title. Don't worry too much about the missing sliders, though it would make things radically different than managing clogged toilets and burning machines (with threshold limits). 

Of all the charming sims out there, this one takes the petri dish!

Everything is a quality addition to the the nostalgia of TH and can stand on its own as an independent title. Simply beautiful execution... electric... oh, forget it. I'll leave the comedy to Ricky. From isolating staff to rooms all the way down to selecting their clothes (god forbid you rename folks GP01, DNA01 and so on... but you could!), they've nailed organization in an engaging, subtle way. Absolutely love it.

Mind you, nostalgia salt is needed for the rest of this...

--Take two tabs of salt and call us after the review--

Original review: Great time sink if you want the nostalgia of Theme Hospital. This title does a wonderful job of capturing the essence of TH, but something they did not bring to this title is very important and with out it leaves me feeling like I am playing a glorified FB game; threshold settings. 

You can limit the individuals to certain tasks, but unlike TH you cannot (as far as I can tell) set when these tasks should be completed. 60%? 90%? I am talking about being tired of constantly having to pause the game to individually select every plant that I would like to have watered. The need to select each machine before it catches fire. 

If development continues, please please !please! add slider function that, like the ""when should I take a break found in policy settings"" feature, is applied to, ""when should I water the plants? When should I stock the machines? When should I do what I am supposed to do?""

Unless this lack-of-feature was meant to highlight the current (2019) real-world workforce (manager IRL) where we have to tell them everything they are supposed to do all the time, even after training and instruction, this is simply unplayable and frustrating because it becomes a major process of gameplay. Not why I bought it and as much as I would love for this to be a positive review for all of the things they do well (radio, DJ commentary, many customization options, hits the Bullfrog feel, the overall ""fun"" feature of the franchise)... I just can't with such a simple tuning ability not being included.

Well, like others have said and I will also say: It's Theme Hospital but better. If you like hospital management sims, Two Point is the best mix of building, upgrading, teaching and micromanagement to keep you engaged while still staying true to it's silly roots. It's a bunch of former Bullfrog devs making this game, so it's an updated but good clone which makes me very happy.

Long Summary:
It's a perfectly serviceable game, which is weird to write because you'd think you want an exciting title to really keep your attention and distract you. However, like most management games, the best written review I think  I can give this game is that if you lose more than a few hours playing each time, it's (hopefully) a good management game. 

Overall it's bug free, solid experience which reminds me of a 90's Toyota Corolla and all the truisms that came with owning a vehicle like that at the time: Dependable, Bland and full of Features you would and would not expect. 

I'd like more outfits and more decorative items and while I already looked at the Workshop, I hope they'll add more in the future. The selection in the Workshop is pretty great for carpets and some room items, but I can't seem to find what I want, but that's NOT the fault of the devs or the Workshop content creators. 

Everything functions just it should game play wise and other that the Three Star achievement hellscapes that Duckworth Upon Bilge and Rotting Hill are, it will keep you engaged for some time.

Current DLCs Review:
I own the all the current DLCs ( as of 3/19/2021 ) and while I have not beaten any the new levels, I do like the stuff I got in the DLCs. They're NOT necessary to enjoy the base game however.

What sounds like the opening line of a joke, is in Two Point Hospital a clear sign that your current strategy to run this hospital is failing. Maybe you did not hire the doctors with the necessary qualifications or train the nurses or installed the necessary equipment but somewhere the diagnostic process went wrong, so your patients will keep dying like flies.  What makes this game so great is that it works on both the macro strategy level and the individual level - it is fun to watch interacting the gazillion characters with each other and the medical devices. Well balanced, the game difficulty is rather low at the beginning and increases within each new hospital and throughout the game. And although it has plenty of ironic comments on modern health factories, it feels also impressively correct in its depiction of how these buildings are conceptualized and work in reality. While playing, I heard (in my mind) colleagues saying things this like ""My new office is now in front of a toilet, urgh, and then there is this vending machine where people gather and chat the entire day. I cannot concentrate at all."", ""The cardio diagnostic? I don't know. Last week, it was next door, but they keep moving this around constantly."", or ""The teaching room?

It's not a thumbs down because it is somewhat fun but extremely repetitive. Not a full thumbs up because its probably one of the most repetitive tycoon games I've ever played. 

I waffle between thumbs up and down but will give this a very WEAK thumbs up. 

Pros: 

At first it's quite fun since you're learning the game and the systems are new. 
Good graphics. Fun animations. 


Cons: 

After the first few hospitals - same thing over and over. Yes, there's a new disease but everything else is the same. 
Build a GP office, build reception, build general diagnostics, etc then when you finally build enough of the stuff you've built in the past 10 hospitals you get to treat the new disease. Gets old quick. 

If you get is on sale as I did, probably worth it but full price - NO. 

I considered the DLC early on but rethought things once I began to experience the repetitive gameplay - never did buy them. 

Gave up trying to get three stars in all the hospitals because it was so boring - waiting for things to happen. Once I finished the last hospital, will not likely play again.

Then there is a bug or a mechanic (I really don't know exactly) where nurses and doctors just stand in their room waving at patients instead of curing them. 

Room levels are also more frustrating than interesting. I ended up with small rooms filled with dozens of small pictures so the room has its max level 5. I don't see the point behind this mechanic since the level gets calculated only by the total value of the room. Size doesn't matter anymore like it did in Theme Hospital.

The gameplay is the typical ""I'll just this one more thing and I'm turning the game off"". There's always something for you to do, something to upgrade, hire, or improve. It has the potential to suck you in for hours, assuming you're into management games.  I think that map variety could be slightly better, but that's not really an issue when the core gameplay is just so good. 

Two point hospital gives off vibes similar to Monty Python. I absolutely love the slightly dark, tongue in cheek, absurd humour (""Clean up required. Dead patient in the corridor."" ""Patients are asked not to sleep in hospital beds. We are busy, recover at home.""). At first I had slight reservations due to the cartoonish-style graphics, but it turns out they work out quite well, making running a hospital not as grim as you'd expect it to be and underlining the slight absurdity of everything.

And then there's the music. It's slightly goofy, but not annoyingly so, and it contributes to the overall relaxing experience. I actually remember several tunes in my head, which is quite rare for soundtrack for new releases. It's distinct, it fits, and Big Foot's Commute is the best track in the game (challenge me if you will on that, but I am not changing my mind, NO SIR!). And there are radio stations (just like in, say, Cities Skylines), with DJs that actually have distinct, satirical personalities.

You can scrap a hospital and start over, and that's cool.  The Public Hospital is a definite challenge.  Loved that.  Still haven't got 3 stars.

But waiting half an hour, at least, for it to load and then getting to play for five minutes before it crashes, makes it not worth the trip.  Sorry, no.


I am hardly an expert.  I just started my third hospital and I never played Theme Hospital, but I can definitely recommend this game.  I understand from some of the other reviews that eventually some people found it repetitive, and I get that.  But there's a lot going on here, and it will take me a while to figure out all the little details that make a hospital better.

[h1]When:[/h1]
Modern Day.

[h1]Where:[/h1]

[h1]Why:[/h1]
Simulate hospital staff and patients, treat wacky illnesses, and keep everyone paid, fed, and happy.

Attempt to manage many people, cure them with ever expensive treatments, and accepting that many will likely die (but only after they've walked back into the hallway).

Huge post-release development effort based on community feedback, hundreds of hours of dynamic and unique gameplay, and a dedication to the predecessor.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
Somewhat tedious room decoration, for marginal effect. Logical design flaws, such as patients returning to GP for re-evaluation after each diagnosis. A disconnect between each individual hospital, the research being game-wide, and milestones - could be better if there were more regional connects, such as a shared budget, talent pool, or milestones being more important. Too many DLC.

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
A faithful recreation of an old classic. Two Point Hospital serves as a strong example of how to take a concept, improve the graphics, and use modern techniques to produce valuable art and entertainment. I'm really not a fan of all the DLC.

This game is sick with massive amount of data that makes it hard to diagnose what you really need to do to win each level in the campaign - which is absolutely nothing.
It's a weird game.
It is fun and yet boring.
It is nostalgic yet fails like all those new age crap games.
The issue is that most of the mechanisms in the game don't matter if you just want to win the campaign. This game is properly meant to spend your time in sandbox on meaningless micromanagement and decorating - and it does an awesome job at that. It is a good hospital management game.  But if your goal is to win some goals, you can do it in any hospital within the first 15 minutes after which you'll jest stare at the screen, accepting all inbox messages without even reading them, train here a bit, upgrade there a smooch and wait for 3 star. 

People die. Doesn't matter.
Staff unhappy. Doesn't matter.
Everyone is hungry, bored, need to pee, thirsty, sick, throwing up, running from ghosts, complaining on long queues, eating off the vomit ridden floors... Does. Not. Matter.

At least now I know why the global health system looks the way it is. They are busy with monobeasts instead of treating people... well, I don't blame them. Shooting the bastards is so much fun.

If you are a tidy person, efficiency is your middle name and you are driven by an urge to optimize everything you can or can't get your hands on, then you will most likely breeze through this game, following the natural order of micromanagement leading to automation.

I do as such, but still enjoy the game tremendously, even though I have to remind myself once in a while that it is still a game and I do wish sometimes that I took a bit more time to appreciate all the funny little jokes and interactions, many of which you will certainly miss if your camera is zoomed out for the sake of efficiency.

Do I recommend TPH?
Absolutely! This game is a gem, nearly a 10/10 for me, with only a few inconsistencies, such as the infamous Benches, which the game so often reminds you to make use of, but you actually should not, I speak from experience.

I am really looking forward to seeing more from Two Point Studios, perhaps even a Two Point Hotel?
That would be fantastic and much needed in the community.

It is great at the beginning as you learn the different levels, interactions, and strategies.

Where the player is tasked as the Dean of Medicine and tasked with helping diagnosis and treat nonsensical diseases and ailments for a nice profit.

Twin Point does this over the span of a campion where, over time more diseases and complicated issue will challenge a player to treat their patients and to achieve the objectives set out for them by the local government. I will first give credit for taking a complex subject such as medicine and making it engaging and fun, to the point that this game can be considered a spiritual successor to Theme Hospital which defined the genre in the 1990’s. Second, the curve for Two Point is the perfect valence of challenging but fair with the backdrop of whacky antics to keep the player entertained. In my experience this resulted in several close calls for optional objectives and streamlining of my hospital to achieve efficiency. The biggest complaint I can give the game is the backlog you may experience, where in several missions I would have patients die because they would take forever to be diagnosed. To the point where 8-10 fully trained doctors that could rival Dr House for their skills could not break the backlog.

Overall, Twin Point Hospital is a whacky medicinal simulator, that if your looking for a causal builder simulator within the medical field, this is the game for you.",1613122420,1613122420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have a janitor on the other side of the hospital who takes his sweet time moseying on over to water a plant you're in for a bad time. 

I couldn't play past the second stage because by the time I had built that one up to occupy about 75% of the map I was spending all my time flagging things to be attended to by janitors. So hire more I might hear you say. He just doesn't know how to play the game you might quip.  But I did hire more. And you know what they do with a hospital full of janitorial tasks to be done?  They all stand around and do nothing and I get constantly told by the advisor that I have too many janitors and that they have nothing to do. Yet if I look at the heatmap for janitor tasks, there are red items everywhere. It was becoming a practice in frustration so I quit and am about to uninstall. I really really really wanted to like this game. But I want to build a hospital that becomes self sufficient. Not micromanage janitors that can't see a dying plant beside them.

I would not recommend this game.
Pros
1. The game is interesting having each machine cure the bugs. its very creative how each cure does and its funny.
2. The game has great music.
Cons
1. the game get boring at the end u wont even look at each machine.
2. u be trying to clear the queues.
3. Training is such a hassle u can't sort highest training speed trainer.
4. Vaccine is a pain for jogger.
5. If u have a big big hospital like last map. U can't find the super spreader.
it should implement something like anno where u click it zoom to the area so u can find. instead leave it wide open where u have 10000 AI char running around finding 4 infected.
6.Little very to replay the game as it just repeating getting Cure patient and making ur hospital  very valuable.
7. prestige is such a pain to add. by adding lots of painting u can get prestige level 5 but u can't do it auto its a big hassle.
8. should have a more obvious icon showing last upgrade of machine. there should some image update on the machine so it looks more cool.

Since then over the years I have redownloaded Theme Hospital a few times and it's still a great game but very dated. I found out about Two Point Hospital but knew I didn't have the time to play games. Since second lockdown I have had more free time so downloaded it and this is all I'm doing in my free time and I love it! If you played Theme Hospital you will LOVE this. The graphics are really cute, the humour is on point (especially for the Brits) and the challenges make it so fun. I also think the soundtrack is brilliant. I find myself singing Nice Smelling Face and Fish Whispers quite a lot. I really like the radio idea and that there is a host. It is to Theme Hospital what LOTR Two Towers is to the Fellowship: a sequel that improves on something that was already great.

I will say that it can get a bit tricky in the higher levels as your reputation increases relatively quickly and then you get way more patients than you can handle quite early on. You need money to build diagnostics but the real money comes from the strange treatment rooms which can be quite expensive with a low influx of those patients. The queues for GPs build up pretty quickly with people on deaths door, even when you select ""Send straight to treatment at threshold"" option. I still haven't managed to build a perfectly run and efficient hospital yet that can keep up with the ever growing number of patients, while training staff and having them appropriately assigned to keep up the cure rate. Also low cure rate and high prices does not seem to lower overall reputation, it just pisses people off and they rage quit but the reputation is find and you still get more patients. It would be nice to increase reputation slowly which would be more realistic. On that note, there are too many VIP visitors to the hospital and you don't have the opportunity to reject them. 
I also think there should be more repercussion for patients dying too, they die and then nothing bad really happens. I once had a cure rate of 60% and I still won hospital of the year.

Old school gamers will probably remember Bullfrog (RIP) who made Theme Hospital as a spinoff of their succesful Theme Park. It was a whimsical hospital tycoon game before the term 'tycoon' became a genre term with a heavy focus on humour.

You do not treat real illnesses: instead you get farcical diseases such as Lightheadedness, where someone's head becomes a lightbulb, and the treatment is to send them to a device which unscrews the lightbulb and attaches a new head. Or someone is rendered in greyscale, and the treatment is to spray paint on them.
As the game goes on the diseases become increasingly more absurd and it can be real fun to just watch the sick people stumble around with all the weird effects that happen to them.

Two Point Hospital is almost a Theme Hospital clone - and that is a good thing. You run a series of hospitals where you start with an empty building and have to create offices for doctors to diagnose, treat, and cure patients. As the game progresses you unlock more and more different diseases and treatments for them and soon it becomes a real challenge to build everything you need while keeping up with the never ending influx of patients.
Each hospital has its own three star goals, with one star needed to unlock other hospitals so the additional goals are only there to provide an extra challenge.

With over 40 hours in I still haven't unlocked everything but I'm at the point where I can say without question that this game is worth your money and time. In addition to the hefty base game content there are expansion packs which add new items, hospitals, diseases and treatments, and the game also features workshop support for even more content.

The music is also a high point. The base game has fitting music tracks but on the workshop you can find a lot more to add and there is an option to enable or disable individual tracks.",1609756476,1609756476,True,16,0,0.689179897308349609,0,True,False,False

Once I figured out how that aspect of the game worked I got super excited (especially with the larger initiatives that many players can participate in) because it's fun to work towards a collective goal with other players in my own hospitals, but I was frustrated by some of the personal research projects since I don't have any friends who play this game and some of the research nodes require 2 or more players to participate in order to complete them.

From the masterful deployment of mechanics and new rooms in the level design, to the quirky bad humor, and the overall pacing, it's just great. I will elaborate a little further on everything I have mentioned here and try not to gush too much with irrelevant side-notes.

Audio/Visual Experience (9/10) - The game has a simple art style that works very well for it and it adheres to that nicely throughout. The animations are quirky and amusing, and everything is pulled together with the game's blunt and dry sense of humor. As an example ""Lightheadedness"" is one of the first diseases you will encounter, where the cure is to use a machine to unscrew the bulb from someone's neck and replace it with a head. From the sound side of things, I can't really say enough. The game does an excellent job with audio queues that aren't too annoying, the music is good, and the occasional interjection from the radio personalities is a fun way to break things up.

Game-play (9/10) - Two Point Hospital has everything you require from most sim/tycoon style games to make the experience enjoyable. There are proper metrics, stats, and tool-tips to help you along, the room system is intuitive, and there is plenty to keep you busy. I am breaking flow out into a separate category this time because I believe that is where this game truly shines. But as for the general game-play, I found myself wanting for no feature or content in my 25 hrs so far. It's a really rare thing when you don't imagine half a dozen things you would like to be added to a game in that amount of time.

Flow (10/10) - This is where Two Point Hospital makes the transition from a good game to a great game. The rate at which they introduce new mechanics and content to you, as well as the pacing of events during general game-play here is outstanding. It is one of those scenarios where the game keeps you so engaged that you can easily let yourself be taken in and suddenly hours have passed. I was surprised after the first couple of maps when I was still unlocking new mechanics in the game. By the time I was on to map three and four, I was excited to keep moving through them to see what was next. The intentional design of the constant additional content and mechanics could not have been delivered any better in my opinion and is the greatest strength of the game.

Narrative (9/10) - It's a sim/tycoon style game, so we don't expect an epic on par with the Odyssey here or anything. With that state of mind going in though, Two Point does a lot of world building and storytelling through the radio like I had mentioned earlier. You will find yourself looking around the map later in the game and recognizing places based on things you have heard on the radio or visitors you have had at your hospitals. I think this is a great narrative design for this kind of game and it honestly surprised me a little.

Overall (9.5/10) - Like I said in the beginning, it's just great, one of the best installments in the genre I have played in a long time. Two Point Hospital is a charming game and will leave your brain in a dopamine addled state that will have you drooling for more every time they ring the bell!

The game is relatively easy and unchallenging.
Patients die? Underqualified staff? Poor hospital design? No issue at all as I still managed to reap a profit from all these failures. Thus I did not feel motivated to improve the hospital as I already was successful from having no experience with this game what so ever. 

Limited design
Each room looks practically the same. Since the hospital is relatively small and you are given a fixed foundation each time, it is imperative that you build your rooms small. Making rooms big only hinders your hospital performance as regardless of the room size, only one patient is allowed per room (The same rule applies to bathrooms- even with multiple cubicles in a bathroom, only 1 patient allowed in which does not make much sense but then what does in this game?)
You can't get very creative with this game as everything is limited.
Each hospital only has one floor too.


I guess you could say the game is relaxing. The humorous conditions of the patients is a nice touch but after a while the game gets very repetitive with no real challenge as you get money very easily.

Once starting the game, you begin with a small hospital on a new map and a set of goals to reach. If you reach those goals, the hospital gets the first star and you can move to the next, bigger hospital which introduces new mechanics. But, first, you have to build the new hospital from scratch, and that is boring.

However, apart from moving directly to the next hospital, you can opt for reaching the second and third star for the hospital, and getting those turns out to be really difficult.

You are free to switch between all your hospitals and share knowledge (e.g. research) between them (but not money :)). So, yes, it's true that you will build many hospitals from scratch, and this can get quite boring.

However, I play two or three hospitals to three stars and then I pause the game for several months. WIth this playstyle, I find the game perfect and challenging.

The difficulty curve is pretty shallow, it really only gets hard if you want to push for high scores. You only need 1 star per hospital to progress all the way through the game and are  never required to compete against other players, it's optional. It does get a little difficult if you want to get 3 stars on every hospital, or challenge yourself by out doing your friends on leader boards for hospital value or cure rates, etc.

This reminds me a lot of old school relaxing management sims from decades ago, what you see in the trailers is a pretty accurate summary of what you can expect while playing.

My only complaints are you don't really have any control over the outside shape of the buildings, but you do have full custom control over everything inside (even to the point of being able to change it instantly on the fly with no penalty, which goes a long way towards why this game is so easy, you can revamp everything, constantly as needed without issue). And secondly the speed controls should have an even faster option, even playing in fast can take a long time to treat patients and wait for an income.

So while there's a lot of fun in designing your hospital layouts and some depth to the managing of staff, it's actually kind of shallow in difficulty and once you get past the learning curve there's a lot of just waiting for income as you can't speed the game up by very much.

Overall if you like this style of game it's probably worth getting, but I don't think it's worth full price, and the DLC are cute, but also really expensive for what they contain. IMO the base game is worth at least $20 while the DLC are worth maybe $4 each. 

I paid about $30 for the entire bundle of the game plus the 3 main DLC (Pebberley, Bigfoot, Close Encounters) (not including the retro items pack which is just cosmetic) and I'm not disappointed, but I'd have been a little put off if I'd paid full price for everything.

(Full price for Game plus all DLC while I write this would be almost $70, this is not a $70 game, but it's definitely a really good $30 one)

What it really excels at is its ability to streamline the UI and have simplistic goals for the player to achieve, leaving you feeling fulfilled at every challenge. 

However, it's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness as time goes on, its simplicity in achievements soon becomes too easy for the seasoned player. The freedom that is enjoyed in a regular city builder falls short as every level is not meant for creativity since every level is a pre-designed building, allowing for players to only dwell upon the interior rather than a marriage of both interior and exterior. 

Another weakness I find in 2PH's gameplay is its pacing, namely, its ""reputation"" system that awards players with more customers. However, this ""award"" system and its incentives to keep up with the amassing customer base quickly forces the player to move away from building a unique, creative, beautiful healthcare center that cares for its patients, into a profit machine seeking maximum efficiency at all times. Which turns this game into more than just a game, but a statement on contemporary politics and late-stage capitalism, where greed only breeds unhappiness and dissatisfaction while creativity shies away from efficiency and productivity.",1608581638,1608581638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It runs well, even on my somewhat bad computer, it has easy-to-use controls, and the gradual increase in difficulty is just right, at least for me. 

However, after getting a bit further into the game, a disturbing trend started to emerge.

Jest Infection: An illness where the patient dresses and acts like a clown. Treatment? Put them in a circus-themed room, then scare all the fun out of them. Barking Mad (from the Bigfoot DLC, which I got as part of a combo deal when I first got the game): An illness where the patient believes themself to be a dog, and thus dresses up in a dog costume and starts behaving like a dog. Treatment? Put them in a dog-themed room and let them indulge in their dog-like habits, then violently shake them around to scare the dog behavior out of them.

See the pattern that these are establishing? That's right: they're horrifyingly similar to the real life practices of conversion therapy. ""Illnesses"" that are really just the ""patient"" expressing their identity without hurting anyone, being treated by violently traumatizing the ""patient"" until they start associating that part of their identity with fear and pain... all presented as just quirky and fun comedic violence, and always presented as morally correct. It's disgusting, and leaves a sour taste in the mouth of any LGBTQ+ person or observant ally playing the game. 

It's really disappointing to see this kind of stuff in a modern game. If not for these ""illnesses"" the game would be great fun, but as is, the only reason I've been able to enjoy playing it at all is ignorance, first from not having gotten far enough and later from pretending like I didn't see it (despite the nausea that rose up whenever I thought about it). That only worked for so long, though, and now I'm here. 

I'm done being willfully ignorant, and I'm officially condemning this game. Don't get it, don't play it, don't support it in any way - at least until these illnesses are removed from it entirely.

Same thing. However, once I really gave it a try I've been quite addicted and very pleased. I think you will be too.

Two Point Hospital is the spiritual successor to Theme Hospital, with Two Point Studios being founded by the very people who made Theme Hospital back in the 90s. I didn't play Theme Hospital much back so Two Point is a novel experience for me. So what it is? It's a business simulation that appears cartoony and shallow but is really funny and deep. You have to build a hospital to heal the sick. You build rooms, hire and train staff, set prices, research and upgrade your equipment in the quest for health and profit. It's not overwhelming but there's almost always something to do. 

You're given a series of scenarios, each one posing a different challenge to build your most optimal hospital in the ""shell"" of  a few buildings. The layout of the exterior of the buildings are fixed but you can build internally however you want. Part of the game is making optimal layouts for both your staff and your patients. That means minimizing walking, providing restrooms, food, entertainment and the like. The longer the patients are there, the more money you can make. 

This is a serious sim but it doesn't have serious diseases. No COVID or cancer here. Light-headedness is a patient with a light bulb for a head. It, of course, has to be unscrewed with a wacky device. Animal Magnetism of course has animals stuck to the patient. You'll have Freddie Mercury wannabes running around, patients that are made out of cubes, mimes, people with pans stuck to their heads (Pandemic, get it?) and even clowns running around. Each might take a machine coupled with a doctor or a nurse, or a psychiatric treatment or even surgery to fix.

Most of these diseases require their own treatment rooms, each with unique machines and decorative items. You might only need a drug mixer to have a Pharmacy but you'll want to decorate it up. The better the decorations, the better the prestige score of the room. This in turn gives your patients a more positive feeling and helps the reputation of the hospital. Decorations are unlocked over time, spending a currency earned in game so you can prioritize what you want. If I had any complaints here, it's that there are few objects that can really enhance your score like a particular plaque, so that plaque tends to get spammed a lot. But as you build your rooms, you personalize your hospital. This goes a long way in giving the player some pride in their creation.

As I mentioned above, this is a scenario based game. You'll build your hospital to meet objectives, which unlocks other hospitals. You can quit at one star or continue to get 3 stars for your hospital. You never have to stop playing one though, so you can continue as long as you like. Two Point does a great job of introducing mechanics the first 2/3rds of the scenarios, so you're always learning something new. But there are a few issues with this. One in particular isn't great fun - it's the only one I just did the 1 star so I could move on. The last few scenarios don't introduce much new and the objectives can take a long time. I shouldn't have to just let the game run and go take a shower to wait out an objective. Finally, because you're almost always starting from scratch you tend to have the same build order for quite a while. Thank God you can template rooms because I'd have stopped playing if I had to build another GP office. The last scenario is more of a Sandbox than anything else, so that's waiting for you at the end.

Making money isn't hard once you have the hospital going. It's just a matter of expanding as the money rolls in, training your staff and growling ever-bigger. Most of my hospitals tend to look similar at the end but that's somewhat expected. I've only had to restart once when I didn't understand the scenario. Otherwise, it hasn't been a great challenge. But I've had to think about the pace of expansion and how to best spend my $$$, so it isn't a cakewalk.
  
The graphics are perfect for this game. They look like toons and given the nature of the diseases, they're perfect. They nailed the art style here. This is in large part because the diseases are hilariously absurd. My machine is a beast so I can't comment on how it runs on older machines but I think it would be fine.

Sounds are similarly well done, with appropriate pops, clangs and other sounds you'd expect from a Loony Toons Hospital. The Two Point Radio Station plays in the background and is often funny. The music got a bit samey after a while and I finally turned it off about 30 hours into the game. That's unusual for me. It's not bad but there simply isn't enough of it to keep it fresh. 

Okay, so are there any other downsides? Not really beyond what I mentioned above. The game is really, really well done. There's a goodly amount of DLC if you want but it doesn't offer new mechanics. The DLCs offer more diseases, items and scenarios. So you aren't missing anything by just getting the base game but if you want more then you can add on to the base game for a relatively small amount of money.

As for the time you'll get in, I'm playing around in the last two hospitals. All other scenarios have been 3 starred except one that I didn't much care for. So you're looking at 60 hours or so to play through the scenarios. That's good bang for your buck even at list price, but the game is often for sale at about $10-$15. Either way, if this genre interests you then pick it up. And when you do, don't be like me - give the game a chance. You won't regret it. The only thing I regret is waiting a year to get into this one.",1607481828,1607482077,True,53,2,0.824537813663482666,0,True,False,False

For anyone who has played games like Roller Coaster Tycoon, you will feel right at home with this game. You are given a building and you must create rooms, hire staff, and decorate accordingly. The game's campaign mode does a great job at introducing the new rooms and features slowly so you can get used to it. You need different rooms to handle the different sicknesses that patients will come in for.

The game has a pleasant cartoony feel. The music is chillaxing and zany to fit the theme of the game. I love how they present the sicknesses in the game. For example: Lightheadedness is a patient who has a lightbulb for a head, and a pandemic patient has a pan for a head. They present the sicknesses in very funny ways that had me grinning at all times. You have to pay attention to your staff as well. They will need breaks, you need to promote them, and as you get higher up into the game, they will need certain skills in order to treat certain illnesses.

Decorating is very fun in the game. You start with basic items, but as you complete objectives, you not only unlock new stages, but you unlock currency to buy new items to decorate your hospital. From arcade machines, to plants, to artwork and statues, and so much more. The replay value on this is extremely high.

The game also has plenty of DLCs for more items, locations, and more if you feel you want to expand your palette. As your hospital gets better and better, things become more chaotic and it's fun trying to keep up with everything. Gotta make sure your staff is taking breaks. Make sure everyone is getting paid fairly, and make sure some of your janitors are ghostbusters. There's just so much to do and so much to enjoy with this game.

Final verdict? Check this game out, especially if you like management games. The game does a great job of easing you in, so even if you are new to management type games, you won't be immediately overwhelmed. So grab yourself a copy and start curing  patients today!

I bought the DLC's when buying the game so I'm not sure how the game is without them, but the DLC's seems to give a lot of extra content and is pretty worth.
I like how there are many things you can do at the hospital like editing rooms, teaching your staff, and building treatment rooms for different illnesses. Lots of funny and interesting illnesses to cure. Each hospital teaches you a new disease to cure.

I've spent a ton of time on it, and I like moving on to a new challenge once I've exhausted the current one.

There are a few things I'd wish were better balanced. I have to keep adding more and more GP offices as my hospital expands. I wish there were options to help with that, like making my doctors much faster so they can get through the queue in a timely manner, being able to restrict the flow of patients, assigning a patient diagnosis flow (to send them to specific offices after the GP), being able to set a diagnosis percentage that automatically sends them to treatment (if they're below 100%, they get back in the queue, and I actually caught one that was at 100% waiting to see a GP for diagnosis), or even just being able to put multiple doctors in one office with cubicles or something. My diagnostics section is huge, and my treatment section is quite small.

Another thing is that I wish stats were broken down better so I could calculate how much training my doctors and nurses actually need. The percentages shown are often confusing, and I had to look online to find out that upgraded machines mean your nurses/doctors using them don't need to have perfect stats themselves to be successful with that machine.",1606670528,1606923889,True,2,0,0.512882471084594727,0,True,False,False

Two Points is a wacky hospital simulator that will at times have you pulling your hair out. Victory conditions can be onerous at times(One map in particular comes to mind) but there are generally ways to fudge your way through.

The maps are generally built around a gimmick, the disease of the week so to speak. You must research it then implement the cure. This must occur while meeting goals, growing the hospital and satisfying public health. There are climate issues and other matters that also factor in. It poses a challenge but not so much that you won't eventually relax back into the game.

My playthroughs have been bug-free and the DLC is both enjoyable and worth the price so far. I recommend taking a look, especially when it is on sale.

*Fracture Clinic patients suck at curing and aren't worth the time or investment.
*People poo a lot.
*If you die on the street or the subways, but not on my watch, it's not my problem.
*Pay me regardless of success of treatment (and never take out loans).
*Always hire staff who are good people over skilled people.
*I'm a good person really you can believe me look at the plaques which say so.

Lot more to cover too - it's a management game in so many aspects - assign staff to particular roles, build and re-build entire sections to utilise the influx of patients, juggle a multitude of priorities, and be smart about your decisions as they will catch up. The types of illnesses are as funny as they are fantastic and any old fan of the 1997 Bullfrog classic Theme Hospital will immediately regard the pedigree here not as a spiritual successor but as a true sequel. Many quality of life changes and improvements make this one of the definitive management sims of modern times.

While I've never played Theme Hospital, I've watched some playthroughs, and I know some of its developers also worked on Two Point Hospital, so, if you enjoyed Theme Hospital, I definitely recommend you try its spiritual successor.

There are a total of 15 hospitals in the base game’s career mode, each with its own unique challenges, and they each take a couple of hours to complete (depending heavily on your skill and playstyle, of course). Each hospital has a possible three-star rating requiring unique objectives to earn them, and you’ll need to at least earn the first star to unlock further hospitals. Early on, stars also unlock items or machine upgrades, so it’s best to three-star the earlier levels. If you don’t, you can always come back later and continue where you left off.

You have complete control over your staff’s assigned jobs, and, as they gain experience, you can promote and train them, with some jobs, like surgery, requiring them to learn a specific qualification. While it’s best to have specialised staff, hireable staff tends to have terrible qualification combinations, although the game is still manageable if you really need them. Staff can also have traits, which are either good (like walking faster) or bad (like walking slowly).

Patients will need to check in to reception before they are diagnosed and cured of their made-up illnesses. They’ll start to go back and forward between the GP’s office and a myriad of diagnosis rooms, with the more expensive ones being generally better, although each illness reacts differently to each diagnosis room, so even the cheap ones can come in handy, especially early on each level. You also need to keep them happy by providing them with items and facilities to take care of their needs, or else they might refuse to pay for services, or rage quit the hospital outright.

The game is also very charming: item and room descriptions, illnesses, the radio, the tannoy, even the messages you receive - the humour is amazing.

Lastly, but certainly not least, the developers listen to their audience, and the game receives regular updates: they’ve added a sandbox mode, loads of free items, a more difficult R.E.M.I.X. mode for a couple of hospitals, and more.",1543084066,1606603584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ease of building whatever and however you like. The GINORMOUS amount of items you can choose from, both from the devs and the community. The SO many scenarios available (including DLC's). The side 'projects' and and how alive and active the community is. The humor. Etc., Etc....

BUT I think what makes this game the most special of all is: How it's Devs remain active to this day, listening to their community, and constantly adding new content!

The only things missing, really, is a real-life cure for COVID! :)

The rest is absolutely stellar! A game you can buy at any price with you eyes shut, if you are just a little bit into city/base building games. And a true ""how to"" lesson for any current and future devs out there, looking at making an awesome game AND keeping it alive!!

-Their custom radio is hilarious and I LOVE the flavour texts they give to staff when you are deciding on who to hire. 
-Maps are fun and I found right to the end I was always learning new things to make my hospital run more efficiently. Some people complain the maps are repetitive and once you save a room design you will be using it over and over again. However, each hospital map has a different building layout and I actually like my hospitals to look nice while completing the challenges. I will admit, there were one or two maps I was not fond of, but I got through it. Sometimes you need to just restart.
-You can play conservatively (the quicker you level up your hospital, the more frequently patients arrive so in the beginning I find it better to start off slow and make sure no rooms have long queues.) Or you can rampage through the game on fast setting! Once I slowed down I found the game much more enjoyable!

Additionally, when you finish all the basic missions, there is replay value in the R.E.M.I.X. versions of the levels where you have to beat continuous waves (completely different game in my opinion.)

Then you have a lot of income, and you're waiting for all your tasks to complete without a clear idea how else to expand. You can, of course, keep building the same rooms, but to what end?

+ Runs absolutely great on my PC. No issues whatsoever.
+ Full of charm. From the animations and puns to the radio, names of characters and miscellaneous items.
+ Gives you plenty to do so you're most of the time not hanging around waiting for something to crop up
+ Same magic that was present in the Theme games.

It's a good management game. Overall simple, but it can be challenging at points.

Developers have continued adding content to the game ever since release. Not just DLCs - they give out free cosmetics every now and then, which is nice. The DLCs seem good overall, but it really depends on the DLC.

But, to me it never quite hits the heights of the original, and at the same time doesn't really introduce anything that's fun beyond what Theme Hospital offered. So, I'm negging it because overall the only things I enjoyed about it was the feeling of nostalgia for TH, but at the same time it didn't really do anything better at any point.

Here are some issues off the top of my head:
- Graphics are more 'the sims' than TH, probably by design but personally I dislike it
- Animations are limited, one per action .. same animation, every time .. (yes I know TH was the same)
- Announcer is sort of mildly funny? But just doesn't really capture the spirit of the original
- Likewise, the characters for bankers, doctors, and helper-man are just ... meh, I didn't even grin in earnest once.
- In a similar vein, why change shooting the rats if you're going to just make it the same but worse?
- I found the music bland and boring, and it cuts and chops between tracks.
- Game pauses for a split second each time it autosaves, which is jarring.
- The hospital spaces are way larger now so there's ostensibly more complexity. But the gameplay loop is identical throughout and it gets tiring fast.
- The things they add to try to introduce new mechanisms feel like chores: training in particular is arduous and unfun.
- There is little to no consequence to failure for any act in the game. At one stage replaying a mission to get the platinum star I thought I'd test just having no toilets, no janitors, and all 1 star staff throughout the mission. Despite frequent deaths and all manner of excrement and body fluids throughout the hospital I raked in cash like a madman, had pretty much max reputation and won public voted hospital of the year several years running.
- Loans follow this pattern. There's no real risk-reward.
- This also goes for staff challenges. Someone turns up with a challenge? You may as well accept it because why not? If you accidentally complete the challenge, great. If not, doesn't matter in the slightest. Why even give us a choice?
- If a staffer does turn up with a challenge you really want to do for some reason, you can for example pause the game, build a Lv4 Toilet as per their wishes, gain the benefit (happy staffer for six months!) and then immediately sell all the items you just added. Still happy staffer. Great..
- The time system seems weird. I know it's to measure the progress of years but even the quickest visit -> GP -> diagnose -> treatment ends up taking (in game terms) 30 or more days .... again, why bother at that point? Stop pretending.
- Building rooms is tedious due to the 'level' system they've implemented. The size of a room and the things in it influence how prestigious it's viewed by patients and staff and presumably affects their happiness as a result. So if you want to operate efficiently you end up having to chuck the same stuff in every one. Machine, plant, chair, heater, and then as many of the same Certificate along every damn wall of the place until it gets to the desired level. They didn't even bother to code a diminishing return feature for adding multiples of the same decoration.
- They recently added a way to clone rooms which is welcome but still irritating as quite often you'll be a column or a row off the available space.
- Sorting and deploying items is tedious even when using filters. There's at once too many items, and not enough with the vast majority being posters with the same effects but different pictures.
- Can't copy/paste items from hospital floor. It'd be real nice to be able to copy groups of benches / heaters / plants / etc ...
- Many illnesses are basically vanilla, eg they have a ""funny"" (arguably..?) name and/or description but in practice the patient looks identical to everyone else, and is treated the same way with no real graphical or audio cues or anything. It's all a bit boring for most types of cases particularly those related to Pharmacy and Ward.

What I love about this game?
-custom designing for efficiency
-fun and cute illnesses
-cute animations
-challenging yet engaging game mechanics

What can be improved?
-staff zoning (specially for the janitors please)
-custom room outside wall design (we can only edit inside wall and flooring at the moment)

What I do not like?
-nothing

Usually you load into a huge map and you have hundreds of options for items to place, rooms to build, and production chains to get humming. It tends to leave me crippled with indecision. How big should that room be? Is it so big that I'm wasting my precious space? What items have to be in that room and do I need to add them now or can I wait and add them later when I have money? Usually this leads me to look up a guide to see what the established meta is, and then I end up playing each mission the same way doing each step somebody else already taught me and it's an exercise in repetition. 

This game does not do that. This game has so many quality of life features that it makes the game super easy to get into yet challenging enough to keep you playing. When you start building a room, the game shows you the minimum size a room needs to be to hold the minimum equipment. If you want to go bigger, you can. But it's nice to have the minimum requirements right in front of you. Another feature that tends to become a problem in these games is the AI. Workers will start having task assignment issues and AI will have pathing issues to the different destinations in games. This game has an EXCELLENT AI. I have built hospitals where I tried to lay out the rooms according to the usual flow (G.P. -> Diagnosis - > G.P. - > Treatment room) and I've built hospitals where I build stuff anywhere I have room. Both ways work. The tools the game gives you for staff assignment to certain rooms is good for efficiency, but if you are worried about not being able to grasp the core systems the game is possible to win without them. It's really stupendous how good the game is at allowing you to feel in control. The challenges come from trying to make your hospital better, not functional. You have to work to improve your staff through training, so they're happier and your patients are happier. You upgrade your equipment (which has the rare feature where the equipment actually visually looks different after you improve it) in order to get higher diagnosis % and treatment %, which is the goal of a game like this. You actually get to manage instead of trying to debug the AI the whole time.

And some employees overwork (won't even go to the bathroom, then get angry and quit).

One thing I want to mention up front is that the game features a mild ""gatekeeping"" system: The main 'story' mode will not let you go to the next hospital until you reach at least 1 star at the current hospital, and some later hospitals are locked behind 2 different hospitals. Fortunately, you only need 1 (out of 3 possible) stars in each of those pre-requisite hospitals, which is sensible.

You can also always return to your previous (or ""other"") hospitals and basically take advantage of their good economic shape to offload whatever it is you are struggling with at your current hospital - mainly research. So, if your current hospital gives you a tough goal such as 'Research technology X', and you can't spare the doctors on research to stay afloat, you can switch to one of your well-functioning, 3-star hospitals, and do the research there. This is apparently an expected strategy and helps tremendously in some of the tougher scenarios, where you are not in full control of your hospital's economy.

The graphics are mostly clear and the building and control interface is very practical, including the ability to simply copy-paste or copy-paste-and-then-adjust for the different rooms, or the option to set a specific room as a template that can be used in other hospitals (this is basically copy-paste across hospitals, but with multiple templates possible).

The game has an abundance of humor and in 30 hours, the more complicated jokes have repeated only few times.

The diseases you are curing are 'fantasy diseases' and the treatments are hilariously animated; my younger son loves watching me cure people who think they are dogs by putting them into dog houses and then bouncing those houses on big load springs.

Could have a slightly better management mechanic, specially for the bigger hospitals. 
Wing-management for once would be great: having all Employees of the entire hospital mixed into one pot can be disorienting, specially when starting with training or have multiple stations with the same type of rooms.
better item management would be nice too.

It's a very cute, mostly bug-free (for me), very crazy and lovable hospital sim, with slightly lacking management options, but still enough to get lost in them. Learning curve is manageable ^^

The fact that a designed room can now be saved as a template really did help with this positive review: it started to feel a bit useless to reconstruct every room time and time again: that's not what makes the game fun.

The delicate balance between curing, diagnosing, and designing an efficient lay-out makes every level a challenge (at least to get all 3 stars) and the levels are diverse enough to do something different every time. The learning curve is very nice to work with, and everything also just works :-)

One problem i ran into and you will as well - Too many patients, not enough GP Offices. I tried to combat the problem by training and adding more offices, didn't make a difference when you only have so much space to build. Also the vaccination missions are annoying when you have huge hospital. You can't be expected to vaccinate when there are over 100 people in the building, too many to animations to spot one specific symptom. 
Other than that, a spectacular medical management game. The announcer is so funny and the radio hosts made me crack up. The menagerie of treatments and their buildings are wacky and entertaining to watch in action. 
The best thing you can do early is to train GP Doctors, they'll give higher diagnosis. Which'll result in less deaths, and more money.
Purchase Two Point if you want a silly management game with plenty to explore.

1. Don't rush to expand, or build every treatment room when a patient needs it
2. Only build (or loan money to do so) when you are sure to get a return on investment
3. Upgrade machines and invest in training as priorities
4. Don't be afraid to send patients home

Essentially, it's cash flow management. Once your finances are stable, you can go about meeting those ever pesky exist-just-to-annoy-you objectives. Not the most balanced of games:

1. Managing for reputation doesn't do much i.e. there isn't that big of penalty and therefore incentive to manage it. Once you've got our finances sorted out it'll manage itself
2. It's so much easier to simply pay the penalty and resolve the pandemic immediately. There's little incentive to really think about 'hygiene' or straining your eyes looking for the infected
3. You can make life easier for yourself by foregoing most of the diagnostic rooms. They're money sinks and takes a lot of effort to shuttle staff around. Ward + Psychiatry + General Diagnosis + DNA is really all the diagnosis you need. With these alone, you no longer encounter the scenario where a patient has exhausted all diagnosis options.
4. Managing patients comfort and happiness? Not super essential. The priority is to run things efficiently anyways. And by doing so you mostly get patients through the hospital before they get excessively pissed off. Sudden influx of surgeries however, are a bit tougher. They take very long to perform and require two staff so there's more in-built inefficiencies.

If you're new to the genre, give it a try when it's on sale. For veterans, bit of nostalgia is there. You'll have no problems with beating the stages (though some are really annoying and time consuming). Except for one (I got caught off guard with a new game mechanic), I've cleared all the stages on the first try.

Tons of rooms, decorations, new shops, multiplayer objectives (which are all optional but can nab you some nice extras), and maybe most importantly, mod support.

It's finally done... 

I do recommend the game . 
In small doses  it is a fun and funny management game  .  
To get the first star is pretty easy , to get 3 stars  is  difficult  . It takes a long time , and  make adjustments on the fly. adjustments of  prices work force , staff training while try to keep your income positive . 

The game has sudden difficulty spikes that makes you wonder how did you get from 6 figure income to minus 6 figure income. In spite of that it is a  good challenge to turn from failing hospital to successful one .

As i mentioned it is good in small doses ,  it gets repetitive after a while if you play more than couple of hours in a row. 
I passed most of the game before introduction of templates , so i had to rebuild every room over and over again , this was really annoying. Templates fixed  that issue.

The objectives are a bit repetitive in the main game , but it  was  fixed in the DLC the  gave  different and interesting objectives and gameplay

The game is fun, funny and so much more detailed than it's predecessor. There´s a lot of different diagnostic and treatment rooms, and i like the fact that nurses can also work many other rooms too besides pharmacy and ward. There are many different training possibilities to all staff members from doctors to assistants. I also love the room decoration options, which were very minimum in Theme Hospital. 

The game is definitely more challenging than it's predecessor, but still quite easy to manage. You have to pass different challenges and objectives to get stars for your hotel, and after getting 1 star hotel you can move on your map to next episode. There are few hospitals that are very difficult to get to even  1 star. The one i struggled the most with was the public hospital, where you get no income from treatments - only donations from public healthcare organization, when you get different objectives done.

The music in this game is awesome and has such a positive and funny vibe to it. There is also a radio commentator, but i found that a bit annoying, so it can be turned off if you like and just listen to radio music list. Of course you can turn that off too, but i couldn't imagine playing this game without these musics.

The one negative thing about this game is the timeline where you have cure certain amount of patients coming as a group for treatment. It's usually 90 days, and the clock starts ticking when you accept a challenge to treat these people. However, depending on where you have that certain treatment room, it can take up to 30 days before the patients arrive from helicopter spot to treatment room's door. There's usually 6-12 people group to treat, and if 30 days from total 90 is spent as they walk from helicopter to appointment room, there's no way you have the time to treat them all. If you don't succeed in the challenge, you get minus points to your reputation.

Overall i think Two Point Hospital is an excellent building game with different tasks and challenges to do. It has versatile contents, but after you get all the possible diagnostic and treatment rooms to built, it might feel repetitive.

CONS
One of its major issues is the simplistic and incomprehensible manner of its simulation. I can't imagine TPH appealing to serious sim fans because not only is the simulation shallow it also doesn't make itself clear. 70+ hours in and I still don't know exactly how the diagnosis process works. Success and failure of treatments seems to be left up to RNG based on the skill of the physician and how well diagnosis went, making it somewhat of a crap shoot. Features like room prestige and hospital attractiveness, reputation and level don't appear to be any more nuanced than how they're vaguely defined.

While in the process of developing the hospital things will be going smoothly until suddenly there are double digit room ques for no apparent reason. Or you suddenly have a spike in death rates. (s'far as I can tell, that seems to happen if you suddenly hire a bunch of unskilled doctors and nurses). Or you were making six digit profits and now all of a sudden you have a five figure deficit. Then as suddenly as it happened, despite having seemingly done nothing at all, it's fine again. Even though the assistant complains about how prices affect reputation and there's even a meter to display how much patients approve of your prices, I never noticed any discernable effect on overall reputation. Sometimes patients will just outright refuse to pay higher prices, but afaict that's entirely random.

TPH has no tools that explain why these things happen. What rudimentary graphs and charts that track stats do exist are practically useless and I only remember referring to them once. This gives the feeling of an off the rails simulation you've got little control over. Besides, these simple graphs only tell you what is happening, not why it's happening.

You'll be laying out the same rooms with the same templates, hiring the same randomly generated staff, training them, upgrading machines, researching technology over and over and over and over again. Fortunately the simulation requires no micromanaging. Staff always seem to know how to delegate tasks to stay optimal, so as long as you hire enough of them they'll cover all the bases themselves. There are controls to delegate staff and room behavior, but I never felt like I had to resort to using them. 

But this means that every mission is the same. Every game plays out the same way with no variation. TPH doesn't even offer up much in the way of visual customization for rooms, deco, or the appearance of staff, so every hospital is pretty much going to look exactly alike. You'll place the same rooms, with the same walls, and the same floors, and the same components, and the same decor over and over and over again.

Fortunately a recent update finally added room templates so at least you don't have to construct every room from the ground up anymore. Some fussing with door and item placement will still be required to make things fit sometimes.

Another odd design choice. While you can place any size or room shape, you can only do so within the boundaries of each hospital building's pre-existing shape. And sometimes these templates just make getting every room to fit efficiently within them a deliberate fuss. The strange logic behind this method sees someone who isn't the player laying out the building's outer walls and then letting you fit rooms inside of them. Wonky. But you'll never make many rooms of varying size and shape anyway since each room only allows for so many mandatory components so you'll never need to construct a room any bigger than its minimum size. It would be nice to be able to have one huge pan lab with multiple machines, for instance, but the game only permits one per room. Heck, even being able to add multiple doors to rooms would be nice.

For how shallow a sim TPH is, the game's user interface is needlessly fussy. Sliders for adjusting staff salaries are a pita for getting their pay rate exactly where you'd like it to be. The only factor that seems to matter are the pay thresholds at which your staff's disposition to their pay improves, which affects their happiness. But there is no visual indication on the slider as to where that threshold is. You just gotta fiddle with it until the smiley face changes. Even then, if you want the salary set to just above what makes them happier, you gotta fuss around even more. Sure, there's a button to toggle any ""unresolved"" pay raises. But all that does is set all under paid staff to the middle of the road salary. Oh, and you can increase all staff salaries by 1%, but that results in overpaying everyone! Why can't there just be a button to set each individual salary to just past the next happiness threshold?

There are three menus you'll be cycling through the most. To open one you have to collapse the others, you can't just have them all expanded at once. But the icon to expand the menu then shifts a ways to the right. So to close it, you have to chase it! In fact, at no point can any window be open simultaneously with any other. There is no resizing or repositioning of menus. Little issues like this may seem trivial, but they quickly become a constant repeat annoyance.

PROS
Since the gameplay is awfully thin, most of the game's entertainment factor comes from the visuals. I absolutely adore TPH's Wallace and Gromit style graphics. The visual gags are fun but you see em once and they're already old. I got the most amusement out of the three disk jockies who cycle through doing voice overs through the game's soundtrack. They are genuinely funny and they always have something new to say so a lot of writing was done for them. They're about the only continuously fresh content this game provides because everything else is repeated incessantly. I also got the occasional chuckle out of some of the random staff descriptions too.

Speaking of the soundtrack, I haven't heard a video game soundtrack this catchy in a long time. It seriously took me back to the days of simple infectious jingles like I remember from - say, Ocarina of Time. And I found myself humming along to the familiar tunes again and again. There are only a scant few, but most of them are pretty enjoyable and at least for me I never got tired of hearing em.

Performance wise I had few hiccups. TPH isn't exactly pushing the limits of modern computing power so it'll basically run. I experienced a few oddities. After one long play session my hardware cursor started drifting. I had one nurse resign because she just froze up after exiting a room and I couldn't even pick her up. And the game can start to chug under large busy hospitals. 

CONCLUSION
All in all, TPH is a very casual experience that'll be fun to mess with for a bit but will undoubtedly get boring pretty quick. The total lack of longevity is TPH's biggest flaw. There should be more and varied content to keep the game fresh and really allow players to play around and experiment. But as it stands, every play session is awfully shallow, repetitive, and by-the-books formulaic.",1597553711,1598854861,False,330,15,0.83894503116607666,10,True,False,False

---{Opinion}---
My opinion of this game has changed in the last few years. The major bugs that hampered the hame at launch were fixed and I quite enjoy playing the game now. It is on par, if not better, than Theme Hospital. It is a hospital game where you have to cure illnesses while keeping your hospital in budget. The graphics are great and the gameplay works well. I hope in the future that there will be a Two Point Hospital 2.

30 August, 2018 - Did not recommend.

Loved Theme Hospital and was excited to play this game. However, this game has clearly not been tested on a range of compatible (but differently spec-ed) Macs. My Mac has an i7 4GHz processor and a Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card, so can easily run games with much better graphics.

Unfortunately, the game freezes up on launch and sends the graphics card haywire freezing the system. It takes a while for even the control-alt-delete equivalent for Mac to launch to force quit the loading screen.

If you have a Mac, even if you meet the spec's, it may not work so be wary. I will try again after Two Point is next updated, or I will have to get a refund.",1535627020,1598772900,True,0,0,0.267425984144210815,0,True,False,False

Why can't the system allow for more patients per room, because my hospital has too many pharmacies and I need more room for prestige items!) but I never feel like I'm without something to do.

The bigger problem is that it very quickly becomes apparent that there isn't actually all that much to do. About half of the rooms function in pretty much the same way. Build it, put 'weird science machine 3000' into it, then assign someone to it. Surprise, the next room works the same way. About halfway to three quarters into unlocking all the hospitals (not entirely sure) I just got bored.

A game most of us enjoyed as a child, being developed by a company so dedicated to listen and satisfy the fan base. This game is well developed: the game has a lot of new features when compared with Theme Hospital. Good features that turn the game better. Nice graphics and good jokes. Like this isn't enough, the development team has been releasing patches to fix all kinds of bugs so fast as I've never seen before.


EDIT: I am editing this review to explain how this game and developers have decayed in my opinion. The developers do not hear the fan base anymore as they did in the beginning. A lot of cool features to implement, but no! Let's just put new cosmetics into the game. The game is repetitive a lot. You will do almost the same thing in every scenario, even after some DLCs. I don't recommend this game anymore. Unless you are a blind fan as I was in the past.

Edit 2: After a while, the development team heard the fans again. It took time, looks like TWP is not a major project (decisions...), and some features implementation might be slower than many of us would like. In summary, I am satisfied. It is a great game, and I recommend it.

Pros:
+Regular new features implementation, and free stuff
+Nostalgia to Theme Hospital players
+Fun game

*Communication with the fan base is regular

Fun and relaxing. Can be funny at times and I have not experienced any crashes or bugs that I can think of.

The big problem is that it gets rather grindy and you basically must redo the same exact thing over and over when you start each new level. Build reception desk, build GP office, build general diagnosis, build pharmacy, build break room, build training room, build bathrooms, build food and drinks, build entertainment, build ward and so on. 
There are unique challenges to each level, and it is fun when you discover new diseases to treat. Some levels can be frustrating (The constantly spawning ghosts got a bit old) but having to do the initial grind work every time gets rather old. You basically get to the point where you have to put in about an hour work or so just to even get to the real meat of the level.

The other negative is there is a massive amount of items to add to make you hospital look nice, but in reality there are only a tiny handful of them you will use if you want to max out your hospital. Putting gold certificates on every possible space in every room should not be the only way to do this.

Overall thumbs up, but I wish they would do something about the repetitive grindy game play at the start of a new level.

You can also purchase a large variety of items to decorate / improve your hospital, allowing for a pretty good degree of customization.

There are some problems with how the game is played, however. The biggest issue is that in order to get a room to level 5, the game essentially forces you to make the least aesthetically pleasing design of all. The way I do it (and have seen others do it) is cover the walls in gold star posters. The way rooms must be designed sort of forces the player to do this and does not give any incentive to try anything creative in the rooms. This is unfortunate considering the multitude of items available to design your hospital. In the end, the only ones I ever used were gold star posters, fire extinguishers, and occasionally water fountains.

One could argue that a tycoon game about creating a chain of private healthcare facilities is in a bit of a bad taste. A notion Two Points Studio tackled with a peculiar sense of humour, leaving the somber reality of healthcare behind, to instead pursue cartoonish visuals and cheesy jokes. The caricature is not only the game’s most defining trait, it also contributes to a truly soothing and heart-warming title. Welcome to Two Point Hospital – a place where having kitchen utensils stuck on your head is called a pan-demic and cured with a giant magnet. 

[b] Starting small [/b]
Two Point Hospital is a game that gradually grows on you both in terms of gameplay and atmosphere. The campaign starts slow with the first few hospitals dedicated foremost to learning basic gameplay mechanics, which you will then need to use all at once further down the line. While playing these “tutorial” levels I was surprised by how flexible everything in Two Points is. At any point of the game you are free to move, replace or rotate any items and even the entire rooms. Granted you have sufficient space to do so, it is possible to move the entire wing of the hospital to another. Would you like to build a nice-looking hospital but you are afraid it won’t meet the practical objectives of the level? No problem, you are free to remodel the entire facility, once it has earned enough.

You might want to get a wider set of items first. Beside mundane money, Two Points also has Kudosh – a currency that allows the player to unlock aesthetic and practical additions to the hospital. Kudosh is scarce early on, so it is advised to prioritise hand sanitizer and treatment books over the dragon statue. The primary source of Kudosh are the hospital stars and career goals (e. g. promote 100 doctors) and later your hospital can generate them too. At first the mechanic serves as means of visible campaign progress, though the longer you play, the more Kudosh unlocks fade into the background. The currency is also related to the limited “multiplayer” capability of Two Points Hospital. You are allowed to challenge your friends for hospital performance (e. g. most money made in 180 days) or contribute to community-spanning research project where all Two Points players are required to perform specific actions, to unlock new items for all the participants. A really nice community-building touch, if nothing else.

[b] Reach for the stars [/b]
To give you a more immediate idea of progress, every hospital is rated with stars, a maximum of 3. To earn these each facility has tailored objectives. On the early stages they are mostly related to specific sicknesses or mechanics introduced at the given level. Once the 3 stars-rating prerequisite is met the level is considered maxed-out, though mostly there is plenty of room left for the player to linger. The opposite is also possible, if you find a level particularly tedious progress can be made after reaching only 1 star. Beside level objective, each part of the county has its own gimmick – some parts are cold, others are hot and yet another is plagued by a steady stream of natural disasters. Does it suffice to provide genuine diversity? In the opinion of yours truly, it’s a nice touch but an insufficient one and you would have to pick up one of the DLCs for something properly inventive. On the up side, there are quite a lot of illnesses in Two Points and not until about 70% of the campaign will it run out of new tricks.
[url] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2168318058 [/url]
In order to match the relaxing quality of the game, tutorial levels really do go easy on the player and frankly the early lack of difficulty goes to the point of being deceiving. I picked up a few bad building habits there, realising only much later that perhaps I did get my completion stars but those hospitals were quite bad. Alas, roughly at the half-point of the campaign is where the greatest challenge of Two Points appears – the transition from making a cosy hospital, to one that doesn’t go bankrupt. The game does get more challenging in time and especially some of the 3-stars ratings can be tricky to get, and require double the amount of time it took to get the first 2 stars. That said, once you get a proper grasp of the game’s economy and rather simplistic (yet very necessary) micro-management you are free to build as you please.


[b] Cheesy gobbins [/b]
The joking tone of the game simply cannot be overstated. Two Points Hospital’s brand of humour definitely isn’t for everyone. To be honest, it wasn’t my pair of shoes either. Still there is some undeniable endearing quality to it and as the time passed, it simply grew onto me. Cheesy jokes encompass every part of the game, the illnesses, wacky treatment machines, ghosts vacuumed by janitors, down to minute details such as names of the songs. There is a brilliant consequence to it all, though the definite highlight of the game is the Two Points Radio.

Being a tycoon game, Two Point Hospital takes a while to beat the campaign especially that there is hardly anything about this game that would prompt you to hurry, quite the opposite. During these long hours Two Point Radio becomes a perfect companion, not only serving suitably cheery tunes but also delivering 3 lovable radio jockeys. Be it ostensibly posh Sir Nigel Bickleworth, upbeat Ricky Hawthorn or paranoid Harrison Wolff, each character breaks the monotony with their seemingly endless radio entries. It would appear as if every map had its own set of auditions and they don’t ever seem to repeat. Two Points Radio comes complete with jingles and advertisements equally absurd as the rest of the game. While the music is somewhat limited, it is believable local radio station and possibly my favourite part of the game.

[b] Two the point [/b]
Being a newcomer to the tycoon genre I enjoyed Two Point Hospital as a refreshing change of pace. If you have a taste for slow-burn forms of passing time, this is a great way to ease the mind after a busy day at work. That said, I believe that veterans of the genre will find Two Point to be too easy and simplistic. The AI of both workers and employees is quite dull and most of the micro-management in the game goes towards preventing people from roaming too much. There is a rather odd survival-style mode where the patients try to overwhelm your hospital in waves but this is as far as challenges go. On a similar note, those among you used to playing high-paced action titles, should only approach this game if you look for a vastly different experience. All in all, Two Points Hospital was a highly pleasant time. Rather than being a satisfying car chase scene, the game is an equivalent of a warm blanket and cup of coffee on a rainy day.

If i woke up tomorrow and this game was gone from my library and i had to pay full price to get it back; i'd do it in a heartbeat.  That's how good this game is for a semi-casual builder.

There are a ton of scenarios.  Some you can kick back, put up your feet, and coast through them.  Others you need to pay attention or your hospital is going into the red and on a path to failure.  You can replay scenarios even after you beat them if you think you can do better.

But if your looking for a non-serious builder to relax and have a drink while playing this is the one.  It's a perfect blend of macro vs micro management.  If you want to really control your staff you can; but you can also just set them up for success and let the game play.

It's not very complex, so that might be a downside for some players. I think it is witty in many ways and also funny, which is a plus for me. I also find it quite relaxing because it's a fun game and it allows for a decent level of customisation of your establishment. 

I recommend it as a fun, witty and relaxing game. I have played far more complex games, but I think this game doesn't take itself to seriously and it delivers a decent and fun experience. In the past I played the original Theme Hospital, which is clearly the ancestor of Two Point Hospital and I find this game feels like a remake in many ways (not all though). Some people would probably dislike it for its style, but I think it's well worth the money especially when you buy it on sale.

Plants, beds, every tool has a value that is a mechanic to force you to make bigger rooms and plan your patient movement. Unfortunately, every time you start a new hospital you'll be making these from scratch, over and over. There is a lot of repetition. A lot of repetition. A lot of repetition. A lot of repetition.

The financial mechanics I was hoping to really enjoy are vague and one dimensional. Your hospital will overflow with new patients if you don't turn the price all the way up, which is fine because patient dissatisfaction about price has no effect on gameplay other than slowing the flood of new patients down.

A spiritual successor to Bullfrog Productions' 1997 game Theme Hospital, players are tasked with constructing and operating an empire of hospitals in the fictional Two Point County, with the goal of curing patients of fictitious, comical ailments. Because visiting real hospitals is unpopular, the emphasis on humour to lighten the mood was deemed important by the developers. The game was designed and developed by some of the creators of Theme Hospital, including Mark Webley and Gary Carr.

Within weeks of release, Two Point Hospital was the second most downloaded game in the sales charts for Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Australia. The game was received positively by critics, garnering acclaim for its style, humour and its faithfulness to Theme Hospital's aesthetics, but criticised for its repetitiveness and room design. The game received four major updates as downloadable content after its release, adding new regions and illnesses to cure.

Two Point Hospital features a similar style of gameplay to that of Theme Hospital. Players take on the role of a hospital manager charged with constructing and maintaining a hospital. Tasks include building rooms and amenities that satisfy the needs (such as hunger and thirst) of patients and staff (such as toilets, staff rooms, reception desks, cafés, seating, and vending machines), expanding the hospital into new plots, the hiring and management of doctors, nurses, janitors, and assistants to maintain the hospital; and dealing with a variety of comical illnesses.

Update the hospital announced with more dynamic stuff. More decor ( yes I know there is expansions) 

Other then that I cant think of one thing I would change. Its a wonderful, cheeky, well running game with no glitches or hiccups that I saw. It just an absolute polished jem that has been overshadowed by more popular titles.

Theme Hospital was by far one of my fav games back in the late 90s, first playing it on the PlayStation then on the PC (much easier with the mouse).  This game is the true spiritual of Theme Hospital, Two Point Hospital has everything I was hoping for and more, and its also the lay out is so familiar that its was almost scary that there were times I forgot I was playing a game that was not 23 years old.  They went by the ""if its not broken, don't fix it"" approach, moving the camera to any angle is something I forgot that you could do as I was so use to the default view and that ""awesome"" moment where I was like ""yes this is even better.""  Reasons to get this game if you ever played Theme Hospital you will feel right at home, and if you never played this game get it as the OG Theme Hospital does not really play nice on modern PC's, plus the voice actors are the same.

It's fun and gives hours of play. The amount of customisation is good and although there are some minor things including how to get a room to Level 5, or that the buildings provided can be awkward shapes that others have raised, that's all part of the challenge.
If you were allowed to create the buildings in exactly the size you want, it would be less of a challenge.
Another comment was that training takes staff out of other work completely - surely that is another part of the challenge of the game. If you have run your hospital so you can afford to replace them then great, if not, then you have to find other ways of managing.

- The training takes a very long time and it takes your workers out of commission. So if you train doctors in GP, and they're the only GP's you have, no one will be available to take patients. It's very frustrating.

-I really wish you could assign employees to one room and that room only. You can of course change what a specific employee can work in, but you can't assign them to a room. It would be much easier to keep track of doctors and nurses, and they're not running everywhere to try and fill in spots. 

-It gets a little grindy if you don't change to a new hospital every so often. In one hospital, I now have 10 GP & 5 psychiatry rooms because the queue was getting ridiculous for them, having to hire new staff and train them all in specific areas. It's kind of tiring having to remake rooms over and over again.

-You can't really just hang out and enjoy your hospital and watch things happen. I always feel like I have to be doing something. Building new rooms, hiring and delegating new employees, training employees, dealing with the pop ups.

The core mechanics are mostly good, and building your first few hospitals is fun. The art is cute and the content is pretty funny sometimes. 

A few downsides which made me not recommend this game:
[list]
    [*]After a few levels of play you begin to notice that there is very little challenge to the game, and it becomes quite grind-y. 
    [*]'leveling up' rooms requires you to place high value items in them, which usually ends up with you just plastering every wall in your hospital with golden certificates. 
    [*]the training mechanic takes an ungodly amount of time and takes your training/trainee staff completely out of action, so you have to hire replacements for them while they train.
    [*]the game does not allow you to construct buildings of your own chosen dimensions. Instead, you place rooms inside buildings of fixed size. This sounds like a minor gripe but it can be very irritating if rooms have minimum size requirements or the given building is a weird shape.

These alone warrant a positive review. While the maps are fairly repetitive, they each offer unique challenges to push you into designing your hospital a little bit different each time. You can also purchase a large variety of items to decorate / improve your hospital, allowing for a pretty good degree of customization.

There are some problems with how the game is played, however. The biggest issue is that in order to get a room to level 5, the game essentially forces you to make the least aesthetically pleasing design of all. The way I do it (and have seen others do it) is cover the walls in gold star posters. The way rooms must be designed sort of forces the player to do this and does not give any incentive to try anything creative in the rooms. This is unfortunate considering the multitude of items available to design your hospital. In the end, the only ones I ever used were gold star posters, fire extinguishers, and occasionally water fountains.

Theme hospital-like game very funny and addictive.
A ""business tycoonish game""

Cons:
The game is not linear, It is stupidly confusing to have to go back and forth between hospitals. I would rather have more hospitals to start and then be done with them once i am done with the level, also the whole ""research with help from other players"" is downright stupid.

The diseases are cute (.e.g ""Light headedness"" means your head was replaced by a light bulb).  There was thought put into the machines used to administer the cures.  I bet it was fun coming up with all the pun illnesses and cures!  

You have to hire the right staff and lay out the hospital well in order for your patients to have a good experience.  Get used to killing patients though as you must train your staff in order for them to be proficient!  There is a balance here between spending money wisely and growing too slowly that makes the game challenging.   Early on you might find yourself taking out loans to keep your head above water.  Take advantage of the feedback you can get in the game (and there's a lot) in order to become a lean, mean, patient-healing machine!

There are a couple of game mechanics I don't enjoy.  At one point you need to find aliens in your hospital.  The only way to find them is when their ""disguise"" malfunctions.  You can hear it but it can be hard to see.  It would be nice if there were a way to spot them without it.  Like having a flashlight of sorts that you can shine over patients and reveal aliens.  The same goes for the patients that get sick.  You have to be able to spot them and provide a shot to make them better.  There are two possible illnesses they can get.  One is easy to spot.  The other is extremely difficult.  It just got to the point where I didn't even try.  I just threw in the towel if it appears and took my lumps. 

The game, like all games of this genre, can wear thin.  You do the same things over and over.  Each hospital provides some challenges but the road to victory is paved the same way.  Still, it's enough fun for me to have played for many hours!  It was enjoyable and I recommended it highly for those who love simulation games!

First attempt at playing I hated it! It wasn't EXACTLY like Theme Hospital, the people looked funny and I wasn't familiar with the controls. Gave up after 20 minutes and forgot it. A few weeks later I decided to have a real go - and I'll never look back!

PROS
- Still as funny as ever! Background radio is great entertainment, as is just watching people do stupid things and interact with random items in your hospital.
- Manageable learning curve. Whilst I was already familiar with some game mechanics, there were a lot of new things to learn and the pace is well-balanced. 
- Controls - Camera panning is great (for PC players at least), and designing is easy with copy and pasting of rooms.
- Potential for growth. The world map can get bigger easily, and already has with multiple DLC from active and vocal developers. More achievements can be added, new illnesses, new items, the REMIX mode letting you play a new style of game.. Not just your standard 10 level game anymore!

CONS
- If I HAD to think of something negative, it would be that random negative events can be frustrating. The worst for me is when certain rivals visit your hospital they cause problems such as brainwashing patients and staff to be miserable or sabotaging your machinery. Not fun replacing my pharmacy mixer because a VIP I wasn't watching trashed it.. 
- Even the con can be a positive, makes the game a bit more challenging ;)

For any old-school Theme Hospital player, 10/10 would recommend. For your average simulation lover, would also 10/10 recommend. Enjoy the humour and the challenge, and just get sucked back in like I did!",1591691420,1591691420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wish Steam would allow you to do a so-so recommendation as a yes or no answer doesn't always suffice...

Pros-  
Builds upon the fun of Theme Hospital and gives you more to laugh at as your patients are litterally shaken to pieces getting their treatment.  There are more diseases that the patients can catch and the cure is often worse then the disease....  Literally.
More stuff to put in the rooms and hallways
Staff appears in the hiring window faster so you can build up your tortur... errr... medical staff quicker
Several new moneymaking gadgets for patients to play around with or buy from are added while waiting for the docs to see them.
The rat shooting is back, though with hyperactive worms now (must be a trademark problem.)

Training, you don't have to wait to hire a consultant in the field that you want to train others in, just bring in a contractor to train them.

Cons- some are know to older players of the game....  I know I'm one of the old fogey's...

The ques are a pain in the butt...  It pretty much replicates the original, down to all the problems it had.  

This version doesn't seem to have copied the ""experience"" factor.  Patients have to go through all the diagnostics before the doc figures it out.  Used to have a gotcha factor in the old game where if a doc is exposed to a condition enough that they would figure it out and skip further diagnostics.  That used to cut down on the number of GP's needed, but now you need a ton of them just to keep your hallways walkable now.

Don't patients know how to sit anymore?  You'll have 1 or 2 patients in the que sitting down on the benches and chairs provided and the rest will be piled up in the middle of the hall.

The whine factor is much worse.  And I think it is a bug.  Built my janitors up to 3 per piece of hardware, and if you count plants it's pretty much 1:1.  But the same janitors will be called out over and over causing them to tire out then threaten to quit.  Just go to staffing, click on everyone that is tired and then send them to take a break.  If you notice, the ones that are the most tired/worn out will be the janitors and the assistants.  Both of them seem to be bugged no matter if you have far more then needed.

On the same note, the slide bars don't seem to want to send people on break properly.  The docs and nurses seem to work better, but they'll go en mass to the breakrooms no matter how rested or tired they are.

On shooting the worms, it is even worse then shooting the rats on the original.  Not the speed, but the aiming.  And god forbid that the hallway is crowded.  The game seems to decide if it will allow you to actually shoot no matter how you aim your mouse.  And the standards are always changing.  If the hallway is crowded, or you click near an item (and you don't even have to actually be close to it) the screen centers on that person or item.  If it is a person, it will then drag your screen around.  It used to do that in the original, but the tolerances were tighter even for an DOS based program.  No real excuse for updated programming.

And heat is back, with all the irritations that come with it.  Haven't the programmers heard of central heat and air?  Ducts would be a better modern fit as well as being easier to incorporate.  At least I haven't lost my touch with it...

The Clown emergency is bugged.  Every so often, it will give you the emergency and no one will show up even if you're built to the gills on clinics.  It is the only ""emergency"" bug I've noticed so far.

Training is back and it is faster.  The only thing is that once you train someone, you'll keep getting pop ups wanting to promote them.  You hire someone with the skills, they go for about a year before wanting to be promoted.  You train someone- they'll want promotions every couple months.  The other thing is, it doesn't always let you know when someone can be trained to a higher level.  You can train  6 people on psychology, then when you choose to have a class on psychology 2, only 4 (as an example as it varies) will show up as being trainable even though all 6 have training slots open and are still on staff.

Reputation is bugged or completely wonky.  Had a flowing hospital where lots of patients were being seen quickly and treated to the tune of 200k profit a month with 0% markup on prices.  Lots of seats, no real temp variances, room quality was 4 or above, plenty of things to do in the hall, and pretty quick service (ques of 4 or less.)  Employess were pretty happy, pay satisfaction was low but roughly 50%.  Yet, my rep plummeted over the course of a year till it hit 8 rep.  Patients kept coming, though slower (dropped me to about 50k profit.)  Then the rep went up as mysteriously as it dropped without doing anything.  All I was doing was going for the final star....

Build lots of toilets....  At least 1 room with 3 in every building.  I'd go with more but that would be a recommended minimum.  Docs and patients don't seem to like traveling between buildings to drop a load even if it is 4 steps between buildings.  This also seems to go for breakrooms for your staff.

Building limitations.  If the radiators came back, you know they just had to bring back the odd shape buildings.  Newer version not able to add onto buildings or construct them to the playes specs?

Death....  A fact of life.  Haven't reached the highest stages yet, but the variations of treatments for disease seems to have been left out of this version.  A cure for one is a death sentence for another.  It seems to have been replaced by upgrading machines, but that doesn't seem to have done anything from death striking randomly.  The ghosts are pretty funny when they're dustbustered up if you have a janitor trained in ghostbusting.

The awards ceremony.  An annoyance especially if you're in the middle of building a room.  Even clicking on it to close it brings up the ""cancel the room"" tab.  It's pretty easy to keep track of when it is going to strike, but still an annoyance.  On the same point, you can't look at messages or hire people when you're in the middle of a build.  It will do the same....

Research- more limited then it was before.  You can't disect people like before (as fas as I know of as I haven't finished yet,) you can't research subsets of a disease, and you're limited to researching the equipment and waste a lot of time getting a pitiful grant or tokens to buy ""special items.""  Another bug that I've been running into, and it is random so far, is that researchers (even though assigned to research as their only job) will disappear with the research incomplete and just walk the halls after taking a break.  This is with plenty of doctors to do everything else.  Haven't noticed anything wrong with assigning people to only working one room except for research.  Also, co-op research either isn't allowed or not allowed to work for me.  So it's basically one researcher per task.

Conclusion:

Worthy successor of Theme Hospital?  Yes....  It still has the same bad puns of the original, just more of them.  Worth $30?  Not unless you're a fanatic for the original.  It just seems they updated the programming to match the newer OS, added a few more actions, and gave you more stuff to play around with.    But there is still quite a bit of problems left from the original.  If I had been told it was just a mod for the original, I wouldn't discount it.  But it is still fun to play after all these years (and I still play Theme Hospital on a VM from the original disk I bought years ago in the bargin basket.)

Edit:  Should have said staff box instead of sliding bar.  My head was still stuck up the Theme hospital hole.  Unfortunately, you can't set priorities; just rooms for staff and clicking on individual items to repair in this game.  And pathing sucks the higher up you get in a map.",1535966356,1590926319,True,27,0,0.751132726669311523,2,True,False,False

This game reminds me of Cities: Skylines in that it has the potential to be great but it's majorly let down by a few things (the traffic system to name one in that case) which add too much friction to the gameplay.

While playing, I made a list of things I'd like to see changed or added to make the gameplay less repetitive and boring:
1. Add the ability to template rooms for re-use BETWEEN HOSPITALS. I know you can copy-and-paste rooms within the same hospital but having to recreate the same layout for every single room type every single time you move on to a new hospital is so tedious.
2. Add the ability to favourite items or duplicate existing items. I only ever use a handful of items normally (Bench, Yucca plant, Large Radiator, Fire Extinguisher, etc) but I have to scroll through a list of hundreds of items every time I want to deploy them.
3. Add a policy for bumping low-health patients to the top of all queues. It's so tedious clicking on each one and doing so manually.
4. Make the item stats more in-depth. For a while, I wasted a load of money buying the most expensive benches, plants, etc assuming that they provided more comfort, decoration, etc but, according to everyone online, this is simply not the case and it's just an aesthetic change.
5. Change the pricing system so that a percentage is used for NEW treatments too.
6. Add the option to disable certain notifications. I got so sick of being told that reducing prices would improve the hospital's reputation, for example, because I knew exactly what I was doing.
7. Add the option to market for GP doctors. I swear they're like gold dust in the hiring screen.
8. Add the option to increase salaries to certain happiness levels. This is easy in the beginning because you can just use the +1% button but, after new hires and training, that button causes the higher-paid staff to get overpaid.
9. Add the ability to assign janitors to areas, like in Rollercoaster Tycoon.
10. Allow time to pass on the training menu. Too often I was waiting for money to come in so that I could start the training course just in time then realised that time had paused but this doesn't happen on any other menu screens (hiring, etc).",1590572406,1590572406,False,66,0,0.751127183437347412,5,True,False,False

I loved Theme Hospital, but it was a game from 1997. This game is a copied and paste with better graphics.
They should take things from game like Planet Coast/Zoo, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Sim City. 

- I hate when the staff walks around in a different building. Why can't we just select which build/room the staff is supposed to work.
- To increase the rooms levels you just need to put a lot of wall frame.
- Why do have we missions to buy new buildings with I don't have enough new rooms to add?
- Janitors are still missing the ghosts, flowers and dirty
- I can't control when the staff goes to the staff room (I would like to be able to control who would stay in doctors place)
- Like the original, we have room just for one machine and the design stays always the same, unless you update. (Would be nice to change at least the color)
- Please more kind of flower
- Be able to choose what to sell on vending machine
- Change the tiles/chair/bin color
- Reception still the same boring thing. Why do we just have one entrance and just one reception?
- I would like to have a way to create some advertising
- Interaction with the city around
- Add decoration around the hospital
- Be able to create restaurants, parking lot (example: instead of buy a new building, expand the parking lot)
- Create more possibilities when the game ask you to decide about the person conditions (gives graphs, doctors idea)
- When we some accident and the game ask you to decide if you will take the people, would be nice to have a video",1590180093,1590180093,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

There's little in the way of interesting decision-making or creative problem solving.  I am a dozen hours into this game and already bored of it.  Maybe it gets better after a few more and the game opens up, but frankly this game isn't complex to warrant this long of an introductory stage.  

You have your basic diagnostic rooms that every hospital needs.  You add those until you are able to service the demand of patients then you build treatment rooms as new diseases are discovered, all while hiring staff to service the rooms as you expand.  There are multiple hospitals, basically levels, to play but every one pretty much plays out similarly while maybe having a disease that is unique to the area.  They could have easily made a single tutorial hospital that briefly showcased every disease and room available.  Then succeeding hospitals could have had interesting scenarios that upped the challenge.  However, it really seems like they are trying to pad out the content by making every room a grind to unlock, basically requiring you to restart a new hospital to unlock each one.

The game also suffers from a difficulty problem.  At no point was I ever in danger of running out of money.  I just hired staff as necessary, promoted them whenever it came up and built rooms as I needed.  I was rolling in dough, so in that sense it suffers from a Cities: Skylines-like lack of difficulty that makes strategic decisions feel rather arbitrary.  Unlike Cities: Skylines however, this game has none of the creative process of designing your own little city.  Designing your hospital is much more boring and you pretty much have a selection of rooms to choose from that you will ultimately end up building the same way every time... Draw out your rectangular room, usually by just matching the minimum tile requirements, add the necessary machines for the room, add some decorations to build up the ""prestige level"" of the room and boom, you're done.   Hospital layout seems to be completely irrelevant as well because patients will just wander the hospital willy-nilly while waiting for appointments.  

Finally, there's the meta level concept of your healthcare corporation, which owns all your hospitals.  This is probably the most compelling part of the game, building up each of your hospitals to bolster your share price, collect stars, and such, but ultimately, as I said, each hospital plays out the same so it again feels tedious.  Keep in mind I only played this game 12 hours.

The humor in this game is a miss for me as well.  A little too cornball with the diseases and treatments.  The radio announcer guy was just weird enough to pique my interest though.  

Overall, I'd grade this game a D, remedial time-waster at best.",1590170734,1590174328,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Old review :

Excellent Game, but a lot of bugs : I can't train my staff properly. They stuck into the training class, waiting for a teacher which never came. During 3 hours I try to cancel, re-train, re-cancel, re-re-train, quit game, play with speed game, but nothing work. I'm very disapointed of this game because of that ...

As a few other reviewers have noted, the loop can get a bit repetitive as you rebuild the same rooms and train employees in the same skills over and over with each new hospital. You are a large company with many hospitals but you cannot transfer trained personnel to another AFAIK, and this gets pretty tedious by your fourth or fifth location. Still, I played a good 20+ hours and I'm maybe halfway through the campaign (I goofed off a little in sandbox, but not much yet). Even if I lay off a bit I've no doubt I'll come back to it later and have a great time again for a bit, rinse and repeat.

I took a fast look at the wonder of ""Scrubs"" game play and what I feel they need to do better as they grow.

What I initially enjoyed
Presentation: It's simplicity is really done well and thought out from layouts, spacing, colors, sound, controls , smart isometric use and clean voice overs that pull you right into the madness of managing this loony set of hospitals. Nice start.  
Humor: No its not over the top adult humor like the legendary show ""Scrubs"" did, but its cute innocent creative illnesses and cures are well done. From ghost vacuuming to head replacements. This is executed well without having to do bad tasteful things that offend those who may not enjoy glamorizing suffering, but will tickle your funny bone, once.  Plus
Micro Managing: It was the first thing I got into the true creating your own hospital world, hiring staffs, handling budgets and upgrading. You really feel the creative urge to do it your way and not a developer's must way. A fun plus
All Ages: I mean fun for all ages, my little one laughed and had a lot of fun, my middle one really took her time plotting every little creative decorative instinct in her and my oldest son enjoyed the business side of Two Point here. Its really fun for all ages. Your playing Hospital Sims. Great plus.
Support: This felt like a true full content game with tons of fun ideas and a lot of content. They are constantly adding, and inventing and that is always great from a developer who has learned from their mistakes. You can do your own music, compete with those on your friend's list without realizing it and excellent camera usage. Smart
Pause: Is your friend and trust me you will need it at times with quick action to avoid catastrophe. 
Blood: Though crude in its use. Those may take the brutal twisted nature of the cure machines to be over the top, but I did not find it grotesque or harsh for the squeamish. 

What I feel they need to improve
Colors: It's pastel blandness can make it hard for the eye impaired and there are so many functions that the hand impaired and handicap may find Two Point too much to handle. The game needs good contrasting tones and auto building options for those who cannot handle all the detail of placement in the room. An auto AI room with content maker as a secondary option would be wise to add.
Sim City: My little one, soon found herself vastly overwhelmed and players can easily lose control of all the micro managing that needs to be done in controlling not just multiple hospitals, but massive layouts with tons of content. Though you have tools in game to manage things in groups like most simulators do. The youth may find this game too much to handle. Many may love the tons of content, but some may find it too much.
Spacing: You sometimes feel, you just don't have enough space and can make bad placement decisions with too much that can clog personnel and cause buggy responses. 
Space Cadets: What I call the ""Scrubs"" space cadet moments when tasks are not executed because of AI conflict. A Janitor decides to take a break at full energy instead of getting that ghost, or your Psychologist at full training decides to leave a session for no reason at all. A patient suddenly dies even though your staff is at peak performance with no way to prolong that death sign. Small space cadet moments can turn off serious gamers. A caution from me. 
DLC: Watch the pricing on these mixed dlcs, a practice many developers need to stop. I can only caution on that.

My First Take: Two Point gives you a lot of bang for the buck. The time will fly with all you have to do and the old school simulator SIMS game gets the job done. The passion is clearly in the work and you will get a thrill in all the creative managing of a hospital. Two Point Studios did a masterful job with Two Point Hospital, perhaps too good as some of your monster hospital creations can get away from you in the end. You almost feel, well, I accomplish that, than winning at anything. It is a silly fun filled game that in time will build into a cult classic. If you love SIMS, simulation building games are your thing, then two point can be a lot of fun for the price of admission. I reserve the final thoughts once its all complete, for now see the video play above discussion to figure if the game play is for you before buying.

This is an average game that will guarantee a couple of hours of enjoyment.  I certainly wouldn't pay full price. The game becomes repetitive after about 5 hours, and the levels don't really offer much aside from more space to build.  That being said, i think it would be a great value at a lower price point.  The 5-10 hours of novel gameplay are quite fun and worth spending $10-$15 on.  I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price because it simply doesn't have the content to support a price that high.  You can pay for DLC to add bit more content, but I do not consider the DLC content into the value of the original product.

They do the little things right when it comes to game design and story progression. Typically I end up burning through these kind of games because I get bored with the repetitiveness. This game does a good job making you fully explore every aspect of the game, incentivizing exploring different play styles and building unique hospitals in order to progress other hospitals to their full potential. The models and animation looks a little quirkey (childish?) at first but you will quickly get over the style once you realize how in depth every aspect of the game is.

Unfortunately however, the game becomes extremely repetitive after creating your third of fourth hospital.

If you're going to give us this much larger area to build on, give us something new and interesting to actually build, not just - you remember that room that you built in your last hospital? Well guess what, you might need two or three of them in this hospital.

Don't get me wrong, if you can get it on a deal, as i did, you may get a good few hours of fun and entertainment out of it - the characters are quite creative and well animated and the hospital announcement system can provide a laugh or two. There are definitely some people who have written positive reviews with hundreds of hours in this game so maybe you're one of those people who can suspend the boredom enough to play it forever.

Very smooth and the ability to copy and paste rooms is a revelation. I'm playing alongside with my partner (she has a copy too) and there's added challenges we can do together which is an added bonus.

I mean, yeah... there are probably better games for £25 on steam but on sale is an absolute no brainer. Time ceases to exist when you're neck deep in a level to an almost frightening degree.

Hope this helps anyone on the fence.",1589920312,1589920312,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are only minor changes to game play from as the game progresses from Hospital to Hospital. By about Hospital 10, even though you haven't unlocked all the mechanics yet, its already tiring. Building the same rooms over and over again in each new hospital, with maybe one new room per hour of game play and a new skill to keep track of in staff training. Hospitals cannot scale into more complex mechanics; you just build them for about a hour and then they enter a grind state of robotically duplicating rooms to keep up with demand.",1589898550,1589898550,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
