Jokes aside it is a very robust manager game and only for such a low price is crazy. Its only been 2 days but I'm already at 20 hours of playtime I just get lost in that ""one more race"" factor. Amazing game for F1 fans who like the nitty-gritty of Motorsport and for anyone who loves a good manager game. Played MM3 on my phone for the past two years and it took my phone dying of old age to whip out my old ass laptop and purchase this game.

P.S. I read about the DLCs being a step-up to the base game especially the GT Series DLC, but personally if u don't want to spend the extra buck just move away from it like me (I'm broke) and purchase it when you think u exhausted the base game but if you're willing and have the resources go for it :D

You can find reports of many bugs in all the relevant communities. For example, you can get a driver to love or hate their car by just taking off and putting back the same part in their car -- maybe, you take off two and put them back in a different order. Another popular bug is ""Drive X is angry because Driver X's car is better than his."" If you think about what the code looks like for such bugs to occur, you quickly realise that the developers for this game are genuinely clueless.

Even without these bugs, this game is incredibly shallow and has no depth at all. You can reliably win races with dumb strategies that require no skill or deeper understanding of the game's mechanics. The cars don't really race in any interesting ways. Under the hood, the game is a bunch of simplistic hard-coded rules like ""Soft tires give +0.5 seconds per lap for the first 9 laps"". You might think getting +30 on some part will make your car faster, but it doesn't. The game arbitrarily splits all cars into three groups and gives flat bonuses depending on which group you end up in. This has all the tension and fun of getting a B in a college course because the professor believes that a class of 30 students should always have 10 A students, 10 B students, and 10 C students.

In-race, you available actions are engine mode, driving style and pit stop commands for each of your drivers. They'll look after the driving but do need to be prompted to make 'good' decisions. For instance, most tracks have bad corners for attempting an overtake, and your drivers won't know the difference. They'll quite merrily put the car off the racing line and keep it there, attempting to overtake through corner after corner if you ask them too.
You have to be active with these modes as the opposition will do stuff like push a little from behind to attempt an overtake of their own, and you'll need to respond to them by increasing speed or cornering a little in order to keep them behind.
I wound up using two sets of keyboard shortcuts for changing modes, and would periodically switch view between the two cars to see if they needed to push or defend. Don't get me wrong, this isn't mechanically intensive like an RTS might be with >100 APM; MM is more like 10-20 APM. Your attention will be divided between the two racers and you'll want to be switching between them regularly.

Back at headquarters, the game is very much like X-COM. Your ultimate goal is to not get fired and you do this through your chairman's morale stat. If you overspend, perform worse than agreed upon in races, or represent the team poorly in the press, his or her morale will drop and you'll get the boot.
You can, but don't have: replace you drivers; promote/demote your drivers; replace your chief mechanics; replace your chief designer; build parts for your cars; improve your cars' performance or reliability; scout drivers; agree sponsors (some with caveats for payout); build facilities; vote for next season's rules.
Voting for rules was the biggest boon. Over successive seasons I managed to turn the league into a nearly fully spec-parts only league, meaning everything on the car was equal for all teams aside from suspension. To facilitate this process, I banked votes by abstaining (which roll over seasons), and paid the corrupt head of the governing body for proposed rule changes to be put to the vote that would either bring about the spec-parts only future I'd dreamt up or were Machiavellian enough that the other teams would waste their banked votes trying to defeat it! Mwa-ha-ha-hh-ahem...
On the facilities side of things, you can upgrade various buildings to make your team better. The most immediate improvement is a weather centre, which will give you forecasting in races. The default info is around 1/4 race distance, and each improvement to the building grants you another 1/4 weather information in-race. Similarly, the scouting facility is quite immediate, and will show you previously hidden and slightly better quality drivers that have slipped under the radar of the other teams. Every pre-season, on the first day, a group of new drivers will emerge in the scout's books. Teams will snap them up as reserves quickly, often sight-unseen. However if you have the scouting centre upgrade you get a few (~4) additional drivers to pick from.
Other, more straightforward, facilities offer additional tiers of improvement to your car's parts. You can build a ""Good"" engine with no additional HQ investment, or you can unlock ""Great"" engines if you upgrade the factory and build a test track. There are 6 facilities for parts, and each need one of the 2 core installations that will limit all else, the factory and the design centre. Upgrading these facilities is a multiple seasons-long endeavour (hence why I was so keen on spec-parts only rules while I built up my HQ!)

The rate at which you can build up really depends on how much money you can make with what you have right now. You'll eventually get prize money for the constructors championship, and you'll periodically get money from sponsors, but aside from those exceptions, your main source of capital is decided at the start of the year and comes from the chairman. You can employ Pay Drivers (drivers with sponsors that will pay you to put their man/woman in races or practice sessions) and this will alleviate one of your biggest expenses. You can shop around for bargain staff by finding good people who say they aren't bothered by salary or signing bonus. You can arrange your drivers as No.1 and No.2, which will save you a few bob on producing equal quality parts. No.1 drivers get angry if their cars aren't better than their teammate's, which leads to low morale. Low morale leads to poor on-track performance, which leads to missed sponsor payouts and lower points yield in the championship, which leads to less money for reinvestment, an upset chairman, and ultimately getting fired.

The game isn't without it's flaws. It's not supported any longer so anything about the game that is undesirable is stuck this way. There is a modding scene of sorts. A few dedicated souls put out mods that tinker with game balance and visual stuff and release yearly roster updates for F1 but I couldn't find any that addressed AI behaviour and scripting specifically. The biggest problem by far is related to pit lane exits and overtaking. Cars will kind of lock-onto a rival and then apply their behaviour to them so if you are overtaking a car that is also overtaking another, your car will get stuck the 2nd while the car you were attacking overtakes it. They aren't intelligent enough to slingshot both cars or following the target until both are passed the 2nd car. Similarly, the cars will get stuck on much slower cars returning to the track or leaving the pit lane. This is a huge bummer as it often completely wrecks races. Rather than simply driving around slow cars, your drivers will either slow right down or simply slam into the back of them. Unfortunately, I've not found a mod that edits this behaviour, which leaves only a few options with how to deal with it. Putting your drivers into overtake mode helps occasionally - I've seen my cars react in time to move a little and then partially clip through the other cars as they go passed. You can always ensure to pit your drivers in reverse so there is one less potential collision to worry about. You can always pick to drive long stints, so that the other drivers are always behind you on track, and pick hard compound tyre for the same reason, but being forced into a decision like this kinda takes the whole strategy element thing out of the race. Don't get me wrong, it's the same for all the AI drivers - the big difference is I'm not upset when it happens to them, and given that it does happen to them too, I suppose the problem is the immersion the game does such a fine job of creating in all other aspects. When your little AI guy or gal is having a storming race, it's hard not to get invested. When their probable podium is prematurely precluded by a stupid design bug, it makes someone want to write a plausibly positive review more than experience the disappointment one more time.

In conclusion.
Motorsport Manager is a decent little time-sink. The dual gameplay modes of racing and management that worked so well for X-COM, works well here. You can get entirely invested in big picture, long term strategising one minute, and fast paced tactical decision making in races the next.

when trying to hire some people i had one designer who made only 50k, i offered her 100k, 450k sign bonus, 75k incentives and so on.. she was offended by the offer.. offended by half a million for a seasons contract...then she waddled away waddle waddle
had a 2 star driver demand half a million.. bruh wasnt worth a toaster into a tub..
again im going to avoid talking about the pits... the pits man.. it makes you want to have a sensual moment with a toaster..and a tub
refueling makes no sense at all, 1 gallon can cost 1 second or 10 seconds the game doesnt know so F-u the pits are here and only here to f you over. 
i have noticed they got rid of the "" EVERYTHING ON THE CAR BREAKS BY THE 5TH LAP OF EVERY RACE"" 
that is actually the best thing ever cause i sh*t you not a year ago you couldnt do a race without the whole car falling apart half way through every race while having a 90 reliability rating on everything...but dont worry nothing bad has or ever will happen to a AI driver/team in this game, not joking i have yet to see one bad thing happen to the AI meanwhile my car is on fire or just something random f me out the race, oh and it only happens when youre doing good, the game does not kick you when youre down its not a jackwagon like that it waits till youre on the final lap in second and BAM* your tirewear just shot up by like 50% and now your car is on fire and the drivers wife is attempting to serve him divorce papers while he and his car are on fire driving on rims while a commercial jet falls out the sky and lands on your driver.. no he doesnt finish the race.. nor get to see the kids anymore. 
im just saying.. life throws curveballs at you this game throws sh*tastrophes at you then has everyone get mad at you cause the pit crew lit a car on fire while it was down pour raining",1678199080,1705112567,False,2,3,0.421008944511413574,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

When things are going well, it is rather fun and addicting (albeit incredibly tedious), but there are just too many elements specifically designed to screw the player and waste their valuable time. Using one of the existing teams might make things easier, but I usually go for creating my own team (which is honestly the whole point of the game). Basically, you're starting from scratch with an incredibly limited budget and you have a few seasons to turn it into a championship team before you get completely left in the dust by the competition and it becomes nearly impossible to earn enough money to overcome the challenges and develop a competitive car / racing team. This is a very unforgiving game and one wrong decision can reset hundreds of hours of play time. After several attempts, you'll gradually learn that there is a bit of a trick to developing the parts needed to make your team competitive. Meanwhile, the other teams rapidly advance in capability from one season to the next. This can be very depressing as the first few seasons can fill you with false confidence as your cars / drivers do well, finishing safely in the middle of every race and sometimes winning only to finish dead last every time the following season despite all the investments you made to improve your team. This can be especially frustrating if the league votes so only the top 5 (out of 20) drivers get any points, but you need a couple of points to avoid getting fired.",1702741528,1702751276,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

They played the game on stream and I was in, though I am a fan boy I dont do everything they do but this one did peak my interest.
I often play games about things I dont like if it has management in the title because the aspects of making anything are usually interesting.
Even if I am not into cars I can get into hiring crew, upgrading stats, keeping people happy, and micro managing fuel and heat since I dont actually have to brake and turn left.

If you like a zero to hero story, a carrier game you can sink many many hours into, and micro managing multiple systems you will probably like this game. As I said before even if you don't like cars give some lets plays a watch and see if it sinks in.

I love motors, motorsport, cars and again motors. Spent a childhood playing Football managers too, then seen this and had to try it. It is a great idea, it could have so much potential, but I was untold bored when in races. The gameplay and action really isnt there for me to enjoy it.

Don't get me wrong here, this is the best and only motorsport manager game I know of worth looking at. But my opinion of being so bored playing it was because I wanted more during races, more decisions and maybe even a bit more action. Some more drama on track to feel like something is happening.

This all being said, this is probably spot on because just like a real manager, you do absolutely sod all except sit on your pc chair watching cars go round a track while others do 90% of the work!

Update: 250+ hours of gameplay later:
So I have put in some serious over time playing this game now, and unfortunately I would still advise it is not enjoyable for the most part, (""why play it for 250+ hours then you ask""), well to me my career/season play has been one massive save file over a long period of time, and the game is just background gaming while I watch TV, Netflix, Podcasts etc at home. So it feels more like an idle clicker and second distraction because the mechanics of the game are so basic with little attention required to what I am actually doing.

However I will add now, that if the complexity of the game increased with more decisions, more management, more reactive play etc, I would love to see a 2nd version of this game come out.
(Do not talk to me about the mobile versions, I mean a full management game spec'd up on Steam).

As mentioned in my first message, this is still hands down the best (may be only) proper motorsport manager game available.

They are slightly more complex than the APP sister-game and the optional mods make this the better version imo.
The main focus of the day-to-day game is balancing several factors: Income, regular expenses ,special expenses [part upgrades, HQ upgrades], tyre wear, driver psyche/morale, chair-person happiness [that´s your BOSS] ,mechanics ,designers and league politics [ rules are voted on from spec parts to fuel tanks and track layouts/selection]. Intel on other teams/drivers and staff is crucial so using the existing teams for a few first rounds is highly recommended before entering with your own custom team.
My latest custom team approach included 10 seasons in F3 with rookie drivers (sub 50k wages) to fill my bank account and expand the HQ. Voting in as many spec parts as possible allowed me to outshine the established teams with smart gameplay decisions (fuel, tyres, parts condition). These are usually incremental changes that increase over time and your best parts will be part of next seasons car. The NPC teams will do the same, albeit with a little less future planning.
For the most part I enjoy combining simulation-games and RL media content and this is the perfect game for binging Drive-to-survive or racing weekend F1 broadcasts. Mods are kept up to date and include RL drivers, teams and so forth so u can dive in deep if you want to with relative ease (extensive how-to guides are available).",1697547355,1697547355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the sake of any confusion, I've added a little explainer on the acronyms used in this review:

WMC - World Motorsport Championship
APC - Asia Pacific Cup
ERS - European Racing Series

Let me summarise what I really appreciate about this game. Firstly, I've only played the normal track racing car seasons, so this review won't include any DLC content. I purposefully haven't purchased the Endurance series DLC or the GT series DLC because I'm not particularly interested in either of them. (If this IS your jam, fair enough, but it's not for me)

As a racing sim/strat game, you are required to run your team well and manage your finances. If you don't do this, you'll very quickly find yourself in the sh*t with your boss and likely out of a job, so the financial management aspect of the game is important. Granted, it's not very deep, but you can't just splooge all of your cash on upgrading everything at your HQ. The idea is that you work your way through several seasons to be able to do this as a gradual process, which is something I like. It's organic and the progression feels natural. After doing two or three seasons, you'll have a decent HQ and a pretty decent car.

Here's my advice for starting out: start in the European Racing Series (the lowest one). If you dive straight into WMC, you'll likely get your ass handed to you, unless you know what you're doing already. The thing I'd recommend doing is create your own team or pick a team from the ERS and take a couple of seasons to get the hang of everything. Once you've successfully completed a few seasons and you're ready to move on, either move to a team in the Asia Pacific Cup or win the ERS and promote your team up to the APC. I would recommend at [b]THIS POINT[/b] look into getting better drivers. The reason is simple, it'll make your life easier. Needless to say, keep updating your mechanics and designer every few years, if you've budgeted wisely for it. Make sure you also set a budget for the next season's car before you start a season.

Before moving your team into the WMC, I would recommend completing around 7 or 8 seasons in the APC. The reason being is that you'll need to properly upgrade your HQ before moving into the WMC, otherwise you'll get obliterated and demoted after your first season. Take your time with running a team in the APC. In my personal opinion, this is one of the most fun elements of the game. The APC has some pretty interesting tracks which each present unique challenges to overcome. 

Finally, once you're ready, move into the WMC. The WMC is fiercely competitive as you would imagine. Marketing is hugely important in the WMC as it affects and essentially dictates what kind of sponsors you can get, which are one of your main sources of cashflow. I would advise aiming low when you first enter the WMC. The prize money for finishing 6th or 7th in the constructors leaderboard is pretty much on par with doing well in the APC. It'll take time to build a winning team and to perfect your strategy and that would be my advice to anyone playing this game for the first time. Take your time with it. Unless you started as Scuderia Rossi or some other top level WMC team, you ain't gonna be winning a lot when you start out. The real good feeling you get is when you perfect your set up and your driver goes out and nails qualifying. That is what feels great about this game. 

All in all, if you're a racing fan, this will definitely appeal to you, unless you don't like strategy or simulation games. I think a mode to be able to change your view to a cockpit view or directly on the car or something would be a welcome change. The top down view isn't for everyone. Overall though, I really enjoyed this game. It's definitely not my usual kind of game, but glad I picked it up.",1690030134,1690030134,True,17,0,0.707691013813018799,0,True,False,False

As a fan of sim-management games, ""Motorsport Manager"" has provided me with an immersive and exhilarating experience as I take on the role of a team manager in the high-stakes world of racing. Developed by Playsport Games, this simulation game offers a deep and strategic gameplay that captures the essence of motorsport management.

Pros:[list]
[*]The game's depth and attention to detail in simulating various aspects of motorsport management, from car design and development to race strategy and team management, offer a satisfyingly realistic experience.

[*]The ability to customize and fine-tune every aspect of the team, including driver contracts, sponsorships, and research and development, provides a sense of ownership and control over the team's success.

[*]The race simulations and AI mechanics are well-executed, with realistic racing dynamics, challenging opponents, and a sense of excitement and tension during races.

[*]The game's intuitive and user-friendly interface allows for easy navigation and understanding of complex mechanics, making it accessible to both newcomers and experienced players.
[/list]
Cons:[list]
[*]Some players may find the progression curve to be steep, requiring careful management and strategic decision-making to achieve success, which can be overwhelming for newcomers to the genre.

[*]Get use to losing even if your car\team\set-up\strategy is better than the rest of the field.

[*]Setting the car up for the rack conditions can be frustrating, thankfully others have done the work, look it up on the interwebs.
[/list]


In conclusion, ""Motorsport Manager"" provides an engaging and immersive experience for fans of motorsport and strategy games. With its realistic mechanics, deep customization options, and challenging race simulations, it captures the thrill and strategy of managing a motorsport team. While the learning curve and absence of real-time multiplayer may be a drawback for some, the game's attention to detail and strategic depth make it a must-play for motorsport enthusiasts and strategy game lovers alike.

None of the DLCs are necessary, but you may want to try GT Series for a different experience later on. I've still only been playing through one career with ZRT Autosport and have managed to climb from 9th to potentially 5th with a lot of careful money management and attempts to bring in new staff.

Nearly every decision you make in this game impacts the outcome of something. Whether it's a race, the car, your season, and ultimately your career. It's rare to find a game that presents actually unique situations that make you weigh the options carefully. Other games give you two choices and you follow the same loop of better choice every time, but even after nearly 30 hours this game is still presenting me with new scenarios where careful consideration (especially during the car design phase) can drastically alter a season.

Just a few recommendations and mods below. The rest is up to you. If you like F1 games or just want to try a management sim, you will not be disappointed if you give it a shot and stick with it.

[list]
    [*]Long tutorial with admittedly terrible dialogue but make sure you actually go through it all
    [*]A gradually steep learning curve that lends itself to rewarding experience and understanding of the game mechanics
    [*]An extremely fun gameplay loop that continues to be refreshing after ~30+ hours
    [*]Also mods for importing F1 drivers/teams/vehicles that you can check out in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/415200/workshop/]workshop[/url].

- the strategy of your team in terms of research, mechanics, infrastructure (short,medium and long term),
- scouting and forging talents (racers),
- managing talents (engineers, etc),
- the racing strategy in real time and before the races (car-specific, pilot-specific) with datas collected,
- tough decisions :D

After several episode watches of Drive to Survive, who hasn't wanted to don the headset and play strategic puppetmaster of a F1 team racing the most advanced road going machinery in the world?  When you discover the existence of this game, the temptation is impossible to resist.

If you choose to take over an existing team, the game does a great job at taking you through the exhaustive process of understanding how to run a race and manage your team throughout a season.  Maybe it's just me, but it's very easy for your eyes to start glazing over after reading the 40th or so pop up explaining what something does, but after a couple of sessions, you'll get the vague gist of how to run your team. 

But this is where the frustrations begin.  As much information that is given to you concerning the mechanics of the game, there are still aspects of the game that are hard to grasp because they're not quite explained to you in ways that help you tie your strategy together.  It's like learning how to fly an airplane with a manual that tells you what most of the buttons mean.  You will have to smack into the side of the mountain MANY times before understanding what you need to do and what you need to keep track of.  You'll soon realize that the 90th email you get of the designer shitting on your mechanics, your mechanics shitting on your driver, your driver shitting on your designer, and all of them shitting on your facilities that they're simply flavor text and not part of the tutorial teaching you how to properly and responsibly improve your car, manage your staff and pit crew, and accrue sponsorship money to stay in the black.   Knowing the difference between the tutorial and the useless emails you get every day is tantamount to not ruining your playing experience.

I feel like I could name a number of specific examples of ticky tacky nit picky quirks of the game that end up completely screwing over your race, your season, hell, even the following season if you're not careful.   For example, there almost seems to be no point in answering interview questions on the PC version, as your choices are a) piss off your driver b)piss off your chairman c) tank your marketability giving you less sponsorship offers/money, or the totally awesome d) getting a marginal benefit for yourself while pissing off a and/or b.  The game is RELENTLESS in peppering you all season long with decisions that barely offer you any benefit and are a matter of 'which choice sucks the less?'  Do you want to get bludgeoned in the face with a club, or do you want get bludgeoned in both knees with the same club?  Or if you find yourself tapped out of reading every email carefully and don't understand the question, you could always accidentally choose both!  Such is the life of a motorsport manager. 

I could go on, but after logging a couple dozen hours, you soon realize it's Motorsport Manager's world and you just live in it.  You'll come across a handful of nonsensical nitpicks like needing a high downforce setup at Monza (lovingly referred to as Milan in the game to avoid copyright i'm guessing), the amount of times you will get busted with an illegal part, simply because it becomes impossible to improve your parts without making them illegal.  When you're exasperated and frustrated with how things are going, you go onto a forum or subreddit so another MM player can tell you that you can just make a bunch of illegal parts you never race with because the slate will be wiped clean as to what is or isn't illegal by the following season.  And that's what's most frustrating about this game: Motorsport Manager loses much of its luster once you figure out a few cheap ways to game the system and you suddenly realize most of the noise you see and hear throughout the season in the game is ultimately of little to no importance.  There seems to be five or so things you should keep close track of, ignore the rest, find out all the little shortcuts and cheap ways to improve your car or maximize results in a race and the game will start to get old very very fast.

I recommend this game because it is relatively cheap, especially during steam sales, but finding out how to maximize your results and quickly turn your fledgling team into a powerhouse has been one of the most unsatisfying experiences I've had in a game that seems and feels super fun on the surface.  

That's not to say it isn't fun at all, quite the contrary.  But imagine being someone who loves riddles, having someone tell you what sounds like a brilliant riddle that you can't quite figure out because it seems so elaborate......only to realize that they told it wrong.

I'd still recommend this game to any racing/real time strategy fan, I just wish the recipe for success was a little meatier, little more substantial than it ended up being.  To my own surprise, I'd actually recommend the latest iteration of the mobile game over this one, it's missing some of the frustrating tedium of the full PC game and is generally a little less frustrating and labor intensive to learn and play.",1676344560,1676386924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even though it's based on a mobile game the PC version was considerably better than what was done on mobile phones. In addition the follow up titles on mobile phones are worse than this game is on PC. 

The principle is simple. You pick a team you want to manage in a league of your chosing (Levels are comparable to F1, F2 and F3). If you start in the lowest league you can rise to the higher ones by winning the title. Obviously the final goal is always the championship in the highest league. The question for you is at which point of the road do you start your journey. Depending on the team you pick you will be closer to or further away from the goal.

You can recruit various team members and have to manage your team finances by balancing income and spending. Each year you get new young drivers, mechanics, designers and so on where everyone has different skill sets and either more or less potential. You can do long term investments sticking with low skilled team members who will evolve over time or invest into the best right from the start which however will also mean you have to spend a lot of money which might be missing when developing cars. In the end it's a fine balance.

During the races you have to manage when to make stops and how to deal with changing weather and other situations. The game usually keeps you on your toes. There are stretegies though that will work 100% of the time. Figuring them out however will be the challenge.",1676049121,1676049121,True,0,0,0.453172177076339722,0,True,False,False

Keep your team owner happy so you don't get fired. Design a new car. Take control of your team and enjoy countless hours of fun and excitement.

I like that the rules for championships are fluid, layouts from tracks can change and building up your team costs time and tons of cash. Fortunately I have a good business where I make enough money *cough* *laundry* *cough* *chicken* *cough* to be able to afford it all.

I was expecting to find this managing game dry and boring, where you had to cross-reference spreadsheets and graphs to optimise your car. Fortunately for me, it never goes into that much detail and complexity, which admittedly might turn off the players more knowledgable about racing.

What I did not expect to find so compelling, was watching your rookie driver slowly building up their skill, starting to beat their more experienced teamate, to finally reach the podium! The mechanics have a way of building a narrative as you play, and I caught myself doing some strange decisions ingame, just so I don't have to trade one of my drivers, which I saw as my protégé!

It's a game all about sacrifices and compromises. Do you build a better engine for the incoming high speed races, or do you save to build a new facility which will make your car unbeatable in the (very) long term? Do you make a pitstop now to come out with tyres more suited for rain, and catch the other drivers by surprise at the cost of a few slower laps?

Here's a couple of thoughts divided in pros and cons.

PROS
- The race weekend gameplay is sooo intense and addictive, eventually you will develop a bit of a flowchart on how to go about the setup process, the qualifying and the race but since track conditions, weather conditions and race development can change drastically every time the game will almost always keep you on your toes if you want to get the best results.

-  [b]Mod support is awesome[/b]. Here I thought I would play with unlicensed teams and competitions and instead thanks to the great modding community in the workshop with a couple of clicks you can play basically all the recent F1 season with real names and sponsor and track order. Just so cool. You can actually build your team manager in the career rising through the ranks from F3 up until the point where you can try to land a job at Ferrari and create your little fantasy copium world where the Scuderia actually know what the F they're doing.

- Graphics are good enough to not be boring to look but light enough to be run a mediocre laptop. You can even mod the graphics to look better but I didn't really try it yet.

- The fact that you can use political power to change the regulations of a racing league it's just an amazing touch. Maybe not realistic, but it really spices things up and leagues really morph and change through the years like in real life. Simply a great idea by the developers. (Bring back refueling to F1!)

CONS

-Holy crap, the user interface in this game really could use some work... in a game like this you will spend HOURS clicking and sifting through menus and I can't shake the feeling that I'm always working against the interface. Information is present but buried in weird places. It took me like 20 hours or so to discover that there is window that shows you critical information like what tyres everybody is on, what strategy everybody is on and current lap times. You will get used to it in the end but for sure it could be better.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
All in all I'm having a blast with just the career mode, there are also dlcs that add Endurance and GT racing competitions which to be honest I don't think I will bother with, but hey, if you are looking for content there is ridiculous amount to be had. I'm already more than satisfied with Motosport Manager, it's just amazing value for the price and I still have to try the challenge mode where the game puts in pre-set situations with different goals which seems a pretty fun mode.

I would definitely recommend this game if you have slight interest in managment games and racing in general.",1671039838,1671039952,True,32,0,0.775327801704406738,0,True,False,False

I have not played the new, official F1 Manager, but from the reviews I have read, it appears to have a lot of similarities.  With that in mind, these are the things that STILL make Motorsport Manager (MM) stick out as the best racing management sim:

- Different categories of racing.  MM allows you to pick where you want to start your management journey.  This can be in F1 or all the way down in their pseudo F3 league.  With the DLC (which I highly recommend getting), you can even play in GT or Endurance racing.  Each series has their own set of rules (and gameplay mechanics, to a certain extent) that require you to vary your gameplay.  You can either progress by winning the league and being promoted to the next series or take a job with another team.

- Personnel are constantly aging - old drivers and staff will decline and eventually retire while new people will come and take their place.  Part the enjoyment of the game is finding those rising stars and diamonds in the rough.

- MODS - there are TONs of MODS for the game and most add real teams and drivers to the game (if that is a big hangup).  I have been playing the excellent FIRE MOD almost exclusively for the past three years.  It is really interesting to learn about (and sign) some of the drivers in the less popular categories.

Highly recommend if you are the kind of person that likes management games and want to scratch that itch while waiting for the kinks to be worked out of the official game.",1519395337,1669230478,True,6,0,0.60000002384185791,0,True,False,False

Is it rough around the edges? Certainly. Can this game cause frustration through obtuse UI and misbehaving pit stops? Why yes...

Special mention to whoever created the soundtrack, you can tell that it was a labour of love.

This game is fun with the F1 2022 mod. The great parts pushed me to 50 hours within a couple weeks. However, there are some core big misses with this game and that specific mod that ultimately kill enthusiasm and desire at a point.

First off... the vanilla game is boring and unimaginative with it's cartoonish universe. If you're a racing fan who saw F1 Manager reviews that said to check this out instead, you may be very bored and uninterested in playing with anything other than one of the F1 Mods.

I played F1 2022 mod and something like 4-5 seasons in... Verstappen just left Red Bull and became a free agent while I was in F2. It just absolutely broke the immersion for me. That was not the ONLY thing, it was just the tiny last straw. This mod also seems to not have anything built to sustain a talent pool for seasons and seasons of playing. You'll be 4-5 seasons and then realize... ""oh, okay. There's no new drivers or mechanics coming into the talent pool. Okay... Guess I better hurry up...""

All of that is completely excusable if you're down to just play the vanilla game or don't mind those things I mentioned. But I warn you, the vanilla game is cartoonish to a degree that, in my opinion, breaks immersion and makes me have no investment in my people. The game itself is beautiful and so cool when playing a race. But the cartoonish characters just throw me out of taking it seriously. Like... it's cartoonish but not to a degree that makes it fun, you know? 

You also very loosely guide a driver's development by creating new building or upgrading buildings to increase development for a certain skill (among other things). A game like XCOM made me invested in my troops and I was blown when key soldiers I had for awhile died in botched missions that I messed up. Why do I care if some Charlie Brown looking character whose development wasn't intimately guided by me leaves for another team? Boo hoo, plug in another one of the Peanuts with similar or better stats. Yawn.

My biggest issue is that the in-real-time micro management of a race is just silly and you don't realize until you're hours in. For me, it was like 30-35 hours in that I noticed it, and then another 10-15 hours before I was just done with it. There are Race Strategy settings that you change often throughout the race. Burn more fuel to gain some speed or burn less to save up to burn more in a push later. You can also take a risk on increasing tire degradation that will make your pilot drive more aggressively, making them harder to overtake. Or conserve tires but risk being overtaken. Basic stuff, understandable. Aggressive fuel or not? Aggressive driving or not? You get it.

But the AI cars change these settings in real-time for every little portion of the track. For each corner and straight or chicane, the AI will adjust in real time to optimize fuel use and tire wear. While you're completely able to beat AI with no issues, it's just a HUGE miss on this dev team that they did not include a feature to set up race strategies ahead of the race to switch between based on the situations in the race. Imagine if you could have a bird's eye view of the map and create a custom setting named ""Aggressive"" where you can make sure your driver is hitting fuel hard in the straights to get speed, while holding back on fuel in the corners. Similarly, make it so tire deg is aggressive in corners since you could be overtaken, while conserving in straights since you are using fuel instead to gain advantage. Through that, you could create several different race strategies to switch between depending on how aggressive, non-aggressive, or neural you wish to drive.

Instead, you either have to manage every single little straight or corner, manage a lot of them in key moments of the race, or just be like ""okay I'll save fuel on this Medium tire stint and then burn fuel aggressively for a speed boost in my final 2-3 laps on my last stint with Softs."" That sounds like I'm just complaining because heck, managing a bunch of corners and straight in key moments of the race sounds fine and that's what this game is all about. But I assure you... it gets pretty old past a certain point. Because a ""key moment of the race"" is often like 70% of the race or more.

This understandable and probably common way of mostly managing races by just pushing when AI comes near, and conserving when you have space, also lead SO VERY often to my drivers placing well or very well in comparison to what was expected, only to have crappy ""driver scores"" at the end of the race. These driver scores end up affecting how much that driver develops (or levels up, essentially) during that race. Great. I got a great set-up for a driver in practice sessions, manage the race very well for that driver, and was able to make a great call with choosing my tire selections and pit times but because I didn't micro manage EVERY SINGLE STRAIGHT AND CORNER, I don't get much XP. Huh, cool mechanic.

It's a shame because the racing is a core element of the game play and was, for hours, the most fun part of the game for me. Until I realized how shallow it was and how lazily it was designed.

Development of things like the car or the factory grounds eventually just becomes a slog of a waiting game. This game was, at first, a fun ""omg how did 5 hours go by?"" game. The tediousness of things in terms of development ultimately led to me getting from F3 to F2 after 4-5 seasons and then just having it hit me like a ton of bricks one night when I just blurted out to myself... ""wtf am I doing?"" The game just becomes A-B-C-D but oooh wait, this season's A-B-C-D is in Arial instead of Times New Roman. Fun, right? It sucks because I think that these elements are like... 80% of the way towards being amazing and having amazing replay value. Instead, I just got to a point of realizing how shallow car and factory development was, ultimately. That would maybe be fine... if I could maybe sim some races. But I didn't find a way to sim races. Which some would think goes against this game but sorry, sometimes you just want to jump forward to a later point in a season and play out the juiciest bits of it. I don't think that's a ridiculous thing to desire, especially considering how tedious things are. I was the kid that in the early 2000s would rent the newest Madden at Blockbuster and take a crap team like the Browns and bring them to a Super Bowl win after years of development. I wouldn't have done this if I couldn't sim games. Sometimes I just want to play that way.

Pit crew stuff is also just stupid and a net negative in terms of what it adds to the game. It just gives it another tedious mechanic that, at first, makes the game feel more deep (when it really, really isn't).

I love SO much about this game. But some core downfalls are why I ultimately would not suggest it to a single person. You'll love it for hours and then just hit a wall where you're like ""what am I doing with my life?"" At least with Civ games, I would just get to a point where I would be like ""crap... I just want to start over."" Not this game.

There may be mods to fix all of these things but I bought Motorsport Manager, not Mod Manager.

The game is beautiful. So much of it is really well done. If they make a new Motorsport Manager that focuses on gameplay improvements and making it a bit less cartoonish... it would slay and dominate my Steam library.

As it stands, it's a really fun $20 game that you'll absolutely get your money's worth with. But it does the ONE thing that I hate most about sim/management games - appears, at first, to have depth but over many hours, reveals just how shallow it is and makes you go ""I just need to step away from this genre of video game for a bit.""",1665801314,1665801314,False,5,0,0.52734375,0,True,False,False

If you're a fan of racing sports - I'm a fan of F1 - it's great to manage your own team. While F1 Manager has some better qualities - much higher quality visuals (this is a much older game with a much smaller budget) and some more quality-of-life improvements - the variety in this game is top-notch. I highly suggest buying the GT DLC to have something different.

The small downsides of this game are mainly odd performance issues - sometimes there are frame drops during a race, most likely when it's processing more AI routines or something along those lines - and a couple bugs, mainly in UI. There are little oddities, like the fuel rounding up when refueling (the game doesn't tell you that or I must have missed that), which are odd.

Overall, fun game. Sometimes it's rough to come back from a stretch of bad luck and sometimes it feels impossible to catch up once you're behind. I guess that's what a new career is for!",1665504308,1665504308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-------------------

After 50+ gaming hours, i have to change my review to not recommended. this game is totally random.


previews (recommended review)
Before: thought for days before buying it, didnt play this type of racing management games, dont like formula 1 in real life.
After: Bought it, deserve more than 11USD price (sale), in love with it, 10 continues hours of playing after installing it. great game, i'll buy the next version for sure.

thing to develop to make it even better: some cinematics, driver voices when communicated during races, some personal life event, better graphics.

Update: After playing few hours more and couple of season more I found few cons \ Bugs
1- It will get boring after 3-4 seasons, nothing new.
2- no logic at all, example: I have one car which all good parts are fitted into it and one stock car and two similar drivers, whatever I change i get mixed results, giving the better car to a driver and he will get 16th and the one with the bad car will get 7th or stn, both run on the same setup and same time pit stops, when you again change cars same thing will happen.
3- Pit stop will make you lose atleast 6 postion which somtimes its impossible to regain.
4- AI is very very diffecult to beat even in tier 3!!!!
5- its normal while racing to maintain pos 3 in the last 4-5 laps and in the final lap you will drop to pos 9, even if you and other AI dont change dirivng methods (engine and tyre wear) which is completly senseless.
6- other fuew bugs, like AI driver changing tyers without pit stops!!!
7- I finish 4 on the table but somehow I finished  2nd as exptected as per the chairman feedback!!! which is not correct.
8- few inaccurate speaches \ talks in the emails...etc

Update 2:
1- its get boring after few seasons, and extremly hard specially when you are promoted.
2- please make that screming man ow whistling man to shut up, its so annoying.
3- make some cenimatecs and speches.
4- using HQ bulidng would be great, making press conforences, team talk, using the test track to really test the cars. and parts, develop drivers by running tracks...etc


why the hell you rest reliability of parts, all season efforts and gone in the next season and need to start again?? cant find a suitable reason for this?

in few more gaming hours ill remove my recomendation of the game.

this can has the potienal to be great, but still needs lots of work.",1498516890,1663007915,True,0,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

It is basically a turn base RPG the over all goal is to improve your team and win championships.  There are several leagues to choose from as well as home brew add-on's in the workshop.   After several hours invested and a few ""start overs"" I've concluded that this is not for me.  With the amount of work that goes into preparing for each race, only to finish 15-20th every single race there isn't enough reward for the work, however, if you are into trudging through all of the statistical parameters and running one or two races at a time understanding that it will take seasons to improve your team then this may be for you.  Remember to save the game even with auto save I was doing two per race using: Pre R1 - Post R1, Pre R2 - Post R2 etc...Because of the amount of time invested in all the micro managing, if your pc hiccups you will lose a lot of time.   I recommend this to those who like RPG""s and racing games.

 Twenty Eight hours Later and I am hooked.  I think about this game when I am not playing it!

I've only been managing in the single seater series so far but I feel like I could play my current save for 30+ more hours. I haven't even touched the GT and Endurance series. 

You can manage your team's sponsors + scout and recruit;  lead designers, drivers and their race mechanics. Designers are in charge of designing new parts to help improve your cars performance. Some parts can have unreal levels of performance but take longer to develop or even have a risk of rule breach. So the idea here is to develop these parts with the aim to use the knowledge gained in following seasons. This is because these parts will have their risk reduced as your team develop their understanding of the parts in pre-season.

Race mechanics focus on improving the parts that have been designed throughout the season and also build rapport with the driver they are assigned to.
You also hire and manage the pit crew, which the race mechanics can also impact.

You also have a headquarters where you can build and upgrade buildings such as; design centre, test track, wind tunnel, telemetry centre, simulator etc. All these buildings impact different aspects of your team such as; the level of parts your designers can develop, how far ahead of time your weather forecasts can provide you valuable information and how quickly the stats of your drivers and staff improve,  etc. 

During the season you and other team principals will vote on different rules in the series you are competing in. These could be; changing which parts are spec parts and which parts can be developed, how points are awarded in races, changing track layouts, and loads more. This adds a good variation to gameplay, but when you have a rule set you are happy with, having any of them change can also negatively impact your experience. 
I recommend the save file editor, available from the RaceDepartment site. This can allow you to alter the rule set, for the following season, to match what you enjoy.

Overall, great game and fully recommend for motorsport and management game fans. There is also a great steam workshop community that have created great mods such as the Formula 1 2022 season mod.",1661777343,1661777343,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u]Should come with a health warning, its that addictive[/u]

I have been waiting for a good Motorsport managing game since the release of Microprose Grand Prix Manager 2 in 1996. But this type of management game has been in serious decline. However now in 2016 it looks like the management games are coming back. With the release of titles like Transport Fever, Planet Coaster and Motorsport Manager in one year and all of them doing great in the reviews, the age of the manager game may be back.

I followed this game since I heard of it as I was not confident it would be done right as there have been some ""other"" manager sims in the void since 96 but they have all sucked. After watching lets plays and seeing the reviews I decided to go for it. The lets plays did not do it justice, its better in every way.

If you love your management games and racing this game is for you. It makes you want to play more and progress your team. The whole ""One more turn"" effect applies to this game, so much so that I set a record for my [b]longest session ever, at around 12 hours[/b] and [b]over 36 hours played in the first 3 days of owning it.[/b] I don't remember the last time I was so addicted to a title.

I have played 5 seasons now in career and have stayed in the bottom league so far despite having opportunities to move up. You can take a team and build it to make it better and when you want to move up you do not have to leave your team. If your team does well enough the whole team and all its staff can be promoted to the next league. Even though I have stayed put for 5 seasons with 2 teams the years rules change, drivers, staff and teams move up or down, every year has been different with new challenges.

The development is fantastic. Develop your headquarters to train your staff and designers and make better factories to make better and more reliable components. Push the limits on the rules by making risky parts and hoping you don't get caught by the governing body if you want.

The drivers have permanent and temporary traits which change throughout the season. They can develop rivals, get injured, have affairs, get in to fights, find god and even get addicted to video games to name a few.

Manage cash flow with sponsors and wages ensuring you can afford to make a competitive car for the next year and that you can develop your insanely expensive HQ.

At this time I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game, apart from the scary amount of time I have spent on it in such a short time.

Kudos Sega & Playsport, take a bow.

Pros:
+ You can download user made and play seasons with real F1 driver databases, real faces, logos and similar liveries. I have downloaded 2022 season and currently managing Williams F1 team for 3 seasons.
+ Tyre heating, fuel saving, tyre saving are so realistic. You have to be very catious about these.
+ Sponsors are also real (i dont know whether is in the original game or coming from the patch)
+ Component development is not very easy but not as hard as old Grand Prix Manager games. it is really realistic.
+ Driver traits are really very good
+ Inclusion of pay-drivers 
Cons:
- if you download 2022 patch, the user made it for 2022 season thus Verstappen is 17-18 years old. So basically if you download this patch, you will see a 18 years old kid with almost every attribute is full and has the trait of ""reigning champion""
- systems change so much. FIA rule changes are unrealistic. in my 3rd season, points system changed to ""every driver gets point. 1st gets 20, 2nd 19... 20th...
- F1 teams get relegated, F2 teams get promoted. Haas got relegated to F2 and Prema promoted to F1. is it football league??
- probably worst part is AI driver changes. i am in my 3rd season and no team changed their drivers. only whenever i sign their drivers, they sign the driver that i released. After my 1st season i released Latifi and signed Riccardio. McLaren immediately signed Latifi as their 2nd driver :D after 4th race Riccardio suffered 1 year injury and i released him to sign Stroll (i needed another pay-driver to balance the finance). after signing Stroll, Aston Martin immediately signed Riccardio who will not race for 1 year :D 

OVERALL: this game is currently extremelly cheap and if you are a hardcore F1 fan like me, you would enjoy it There are some extreme unrealistic things in game but if i didnt enjoy i wouldnt be in my 3rd season right now.",1657201054,1657201054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, kudos to the developers for making arguably the best racing management sim available. The amount of polish, from the UI to the graphics certainly adds to its appeal.

Here comes the part where I don't recommend this game:
1. Car setup does not make a lot of sense. The ideal setups are almost randomly generated regardless of the track layout (e.g lots of straights def. should have top speed as priority)
2. Events are HIGHLY stochastic. It doesn't make sense that most races will have varying weather and car conditions.
3. Even on tracks where it should have been hard to overtake, opposing cars pass through yours like a ghost.
4. Maybe a bit unforgiving for most people. As opposed to the three mobile versions, I can say that this port is more stressful than addicting.
5. Applying workshop items take a bit of work (copy-pasting some files etc) as opposed to other games' implementation.

It manages to strike a great balance between being broadly realistic while also simplified and accessible A lot of people will be bored by the game's generic nature of off-brand teams and made-up drivers but I strongly prefer it to playing with real teams and names as it allows me to have my own sandbox world away from the stresses of reality; however if you want the ""real F1/LMP/etc."" experience there are many readily available mods in the workshop from the great community. It's also not a very difficult game to mod yourself; I spent some time working on a mod that put teams on a more equal footing and turned off relegation and promotion and that was, in and of itself, an edutaining period in my gaming career, getting under the hood of a game.

Of course it's not perfect, I have several nitpicks but in the big picture none of them stop me enjoying the game. When your driver gets suddenly ground to a halt by a driver exiting the pits in a totally unrealistic fashion for the 10th time you finally learn to stop getting mad at it and just accept it's part of the game. There is a savegame bug (the ""L Stoltz"" bug) where the wrong drivers load and then the game crashes but I stopped experiencing that once I gave the game to the count of 10 after saving a game before exiting, I think that bug just happens when you don't give the save file enough time to write, as the saves for this game are rather large. I've also recently found one driver (Munoz) that ""doesn't show up"" in practice sessions but the game still runs just with the first driver duplicated, kinda a weird bug but not game-breaking. But only with that one driver. The game has a couple little quirks like that. Overall though it really succeeds in engrossing me, I keep coming back to it to play for a few weeks, then put down, then pick up and continue my save file so I've taken a couple back-of-ERS teams to the WCC title. The GT and Endurance side of the game gives a good change if you're bored of single seaters but want to keep playing, but overall I prefer the single seater side, it does seem a bit more what the game was initially made to do. Overall great game, IMO it hits very close to the sweet spot of management games that most of them miss by a pretty wide margin.",1654991805,1654991805,True,6,0,0.584931313991546631,0,True,False,False

My biggest complaint: if you work hard, get the best car and team - at some point the league will 'reset' everyone's cars to similar stats again. I get why it happened but something like that should have been a vote (maybe happens every year with every team voting for it) instead of sprung up on you suddenly without warning.

• if you start with the worst or one of the worst teams, you probably get 10th in constructors and get demoted to F2, which makes no sense…
•You can downgrade from F1 into F2?!?!
•You can have the best drivers, and the Overall best car, but the AI F2 Bot drivers still will be quicker…
•My Drivers (Vettel, Gasly)  both over 4/5 stars, always mess up the start and lose 6-12 Positions.
•lets say your drivers start from P1 and P2, to 85% theyre gonna mess up at the start and land in P9 or lower after 2 laps.
•just too much that is unrealistic 
Otherwise, its a good game, has many detailed things, but yeah its just not fun to play, especially when you can get demoted to F2, and that what happens to many people in Theyre first season.
All in all i regret buying that game, already un-installed it.

Bought on sale, complete bundle for US $6, one of the only good financial decisions I've made in my life.  I've spent more to watch an overly-hyped 2hr movie in a covid zombie infected theater, and already have 50x the entertainment time-value back on it, and still barely scratched the surface.

This is not a Racing Game, you are not the driver. It's a Management game, you are the manager/Principal. Between races, you manage and develop your car, design, parts, drivers, staff, sponsors, finances, etc. During Practice/Qualifications/Races, you micro-manage tactics during the race (tires, pitting, fuel/e-boost management, driver tactics, tweaking car setups, etc.).  Plenty to do at all times, but easily managed and engaging. Long-session gaming, requires patience and planning. Team progression requires multiple Seasons, not just races.

Vanilla game does not contain any licensed teams/drivers/sponsors/etc. But you can have plenty of fun developing an existing team or build a custom one and bring it up through the ranks.  F1, GT, and Enduro leagues, each with multiple tiers to progress through. Or just take over an existing team at the top and see how you do.

Lots of excellent Mod support, including RL F1 drivers/teams/etc.",1649530348,1649530348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, apparently you start with a refueling ban, because its some sort of rule with F1 racing (which I knew nothing about) and can only remove it later in the game through voting.  Frankly I could care less about F1 rules, I'm not any sort of racing sports buff - I just want to race fast cars and have fun managing a race.  I cannot find an option to allow refueling early on and there does not seem to be a mod for it or change the rules.  I played for a race, ran out of fuel (they don't even mention anything about refueling and expect me to know all about it) and lost badly in the tutorial.  And I learned that watching 17 laps of cars run around a track is just boring.   Ya sure, I can swap tires, repair parts, set pit stop crew risk, big deal - I just want to refuel, damn it!  So refunding it before I get stuck with another crappy Sega game like Two Point Hospital.

At the beginning of the game you are given a choice to take over a team or make a new one. Most games this choice does not matter. But in this one it does. If you take over a team, they have an already decently equipped car with decent HQ setup and decent drivers. Enough to place top 10 or so. But if you pick your own team you start with nothing. A loan, some OK staff and no idea how to play the game. 

I chose to make a new team and after I realized i wasnt winning due to my car being hot garbage I determined what exactly I needed to do. I used Cheat Engine to set my money to a large sum and then went about spending every single dime on everything until I finished season 1. In season 1 I didnt place anything above 20th. This is normal! You should expect the same. 

Here is my suggestion for starting playing this game.
- Make a new team, Set your money to 150 Million with Cheat Engine. (This should be enough for the first season. But you might need more)
- Don't hire anyone but pit crew as needed, don't care what you do but keep the drivers happy. This will only help you later. 
- Get through Season 1 as fast as possible and while your doing that have your HQ upgrading at all times. 
- The entire time your doing this learn how to setup the cars for the drivers in practice. You can also save settings for tracks and they should be close to the same next time. 

How I would personally start races
- Balls to the wall for the first 2-3 laps. See how tires are doing and don't pit until the tires are 5% or less. 
- Do the math on pit stops based on this",1649145854,1649145854,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So many things could be improved and added, and unfortunately it seems the modding community can only do so much for this game. That being said, there are some AWESOME mods on the Workshop for this game. As far as the game itself, it's very solid. Definitely worth your $20 (or equivalent currency of course). If you are already into racing, this game won't be as hard for you as it is for others. For that person this game will be very easy to pick up, but still hard to master, giving you plenty of gameplay to be had. Can't speak to the DLC as of yet besides the free stuff, but I will be buying them as I feel the base game merits enough to spend more on the game, and will update my review when I buy them :) The create your own team free DLC is awesome. The livery pack on the other hand? Not many of them are great looking in my opinion, but you might love them. They're free so one can't complain too much. At the end of the day, if you enjoy racing and the ins and outs of it, you will love this game!

Edit for DLC:
The DLC content is well worth it as well in my opinion having enjoyed the game so much I decided I had to have them to add the depth they bring to my seasons :p That being said, I picked them up 3rd party and got keys for both of them for under the price of one of them at $7, and I would recommend doing the same. Still great fun and adds plenty of content to be worth the money they charge, but with the game being so old, and very little support these days, it's not like you're supporting future development so....",1644348257,1645344128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The AI doesn't 'cheat' per se, but has certain advantages: They have perfect 'driver mode' and 'engine mode' management, and maximise these algorithmically. This in an of itself isn't terrible, but when it combines with a buffed driver/team, you will never, ever, beat them. Confusingly, the game has some internal metrics that tell you very clearly where you stand compared to the opposition, but they're confusing, because your results don't really reflect the graphs. 

So, you just need to keep grinding. The game rewards graft, is challengin and provides enough worthwhile moments to keep coming back to, even if occasionally I want to throw my computer out of the window when an AI car pulls six seconds on me through two corners. It is one of those games where it's fairly easy to do well in, but to beat is another matter.",1641259429,1642889205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even with optimal car upgrades and settings, supposedly high quality drivers, and sensible race strategies, not one single race ended without one or both of my drivers crashing. Zero feedback regarding the cause of crashes, which made them feel entirely random or even scripted. None of these crashes involved other cars, just my drivers randomly flying off the track.

Other quibbles include practice and qualifying sessions. My drivers would ALWAYS register the fastest laps in practice by some considerable margin, yet when it came to qualifying, they were ALWAYS way down behind the leaders for pole position. Something obviously just doesn't add up there in the slightest.

Essentially, the whole game felt utterly random and a complete waste of time.

I'm not very good at the game (only won a few races) but the strategy and tie to real world motorsports is what keeps me playing. I also enjoy how I can have the game running and do other things while it's in the background since you can choose the session lengths/speed time up, so it gives a lot of flexibility to play the game if you don't want to stare at your screen for a full F1 race but still get the full race experience.

There is enough on both sides of the loop to stay fairly entertaining.

The game lacks in a few things: Control of team is wide in terms of different tasks but never too deep in terms of options/complexity (which eases use for newer player but lacks the depth of other managers like Futebol Manager, etc) and the lack of licences (FIA, F1, WEC,Sponsors, ETC) which gives it a off the shelf bargain brand feel that makes it hard to keep pushing in a long playthrough. 

This does not mean it can´t be enjoyable, on the contrary, the first playthough where you get your F3 team all the way to F1 is quite the blast but after that´s done you start to get to the problems. GT/Endurance lack appeal for most people and don´t offer sufficient changes to entice a whole new playthrough and while challenges can be fun they´re for the most part more of the same except with a specific goal/limits.

Thankfully there are mods which elevate the game A TON, and particular the FIRE MODS (1 per year). These add licences for most relevant GT/F1/WEC/IndyCar along with the FIA, Real teams/drivers, more customization options, tracks etc. With these babys on it´s a new game which frankly makes the vannila version obsolete and elevate the game for any motorsport fan.

It needs to be reminded that the ""skeleton"" even with mods is the same and as such even with a lot of changes the gameplay loop and the management itself is the same. Same car just a different paintjob, which means just because you painted your Williams red it sure as hell isn´t a Ferrari, it still very much sucks.

Probably mainly due to the fact that the game has surprisingly lots of content that makes you trying to do more and more when starting from the lower championships. Another plus in my opinion is that the developers care about the game, and are continuously improving the game by releasing new content. One would assume that they where going the paradox route and release a fuckton of  paid dlc that improves the game, but that is not the case. WIth every dlc release the devs also improve the game for free with free updates which is kinda cool since it maintains you with the desire to continue playing the game even if you are not interested in the the dlc they released, but at least you can take advantage of some new mechanics they introduce in each dlc. For me that is a plus and they have won my trust to buy their next game.

Better than watching actual F1.

I'm usually dislike the ""manager"" type games but this one strikes a great balance between the different aspects of management and motor sports, making the player decisions feel both diverse and significant.

The game captures the tension of a race very well. A lot comes down to watching and routing for the Sim-Drivers race on the track, but them executing our strategy makes is just this more exciting.
At the same time, there are quite a few things, the player can manage in terms of strategy, that do feel impactfull and can be decisive. 

And then there is the whole actual management game, juggling the teams budget, dealing with the personal and deciding what direction the development should go.

Picked the game at on eof the frequent discounts but honestly, would not have been upset, if i paid the full price for it. Both of the free DLC (custom team and extra liveries) are also very nice, although small, additions.

Note however, that this only applies to the base game. 
The paid DLC are absolutely NOT worth the asking price. 
The Challenges DLC is a borderline scam and adds absolutely nothing worthwhile.
The GT and Endurance are not as terrible, but unfortunately not good either; They fail to capture the look and feel of the represented racing series, so people knowledgeable and specifically interested in GT and Endurance will be disappointed, while players who are just looking for ""generic motorsports"" are already getting it with great base game content.",1635896515,1635905824,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really, really want to like this game (and I have probably tried way too hard) but as a fan of motor racing and management sims I can't recommend it to others like me. There are too many overly simplistic and poorly realised mechanics that pull me out of the game.

The messages from drivers during practice, qualifying and the race are absurd and impart no useful information. Drivers asking to push during safety car periods in the race, and next to useless feedback during practice sessions is a waste of time. The politics are a merely a caricature of the real thing with nil impact on the game and represent another pointless distraction.

There is no nuance to the choices you are asked to make. The differences between key personnel and car characteristics are exaggerated to point of silliness.

Motorsport Manager is a fun racing team management game that tries to balance the team management aspect with real time racing 'driver management', which has you selecting the tyre/fuel use for your driver as they race. Team management has quite a lot of options and can be interesting, but there are some nasty power curves that you need to keep up with (car upgrades for example) or you will fall behind and never be able to catch up. The game is also very, very drawn out and feels like it takes way too long to do some basic things. 


[b]GamePlay - 6/10[/b]

The team management part of the game is nothing special in terms of things you can do (upgrade cars, sponsors, staff etc etc), but works well for the most part. The races themselves can also be fun, though it can feel like one minute your drivers/cars are the worst ever and no matter what you do they suck, then next season they are suddenly the best cars/drivers ever but doesn't let you know why?? Feels a bit long winded and drags in places, but a solid management game overall.

[b]Graphics - 8/10[/b]

Nice graphics for the tracks and cars overall, the UI is reasonably clean and well placed, but there is a small 'cartoonish' quality to the graphics that I don't like much. But ignoring that, the graphics are pretty good otherwise.

[b]Audio - 6/10[/b]

Car sounds are fine, music is fine, the background pit sounds can get annoying after a while and the music gets old really quickly, but there is nothing bad about the sounds in general.

[b]Replayability - 8/10[/b]

This is one of those games that you don't play for 10 minutes at a time, you put hours upon hours into it as you try to manage your team and improve your standings. I would expect a season to take you a good 3-4 hours if you fly thought it, though for all the tweaking and upgrading of the car/drivers you can look to add another 3-4 hours of tinkering if you like to get the most out of a game.",1634977510,1634978210,True,2,0,0.545165419578552246,0,True,False,False

THE GOOD
Decent graphics
Mod support
HUGE amount of things to do
So many racing disciplines (from F1 to MotoGP).
3D and 2D modes

THE BAD
Game can be very hard
Wrong specs for disciplines; e.g F1 using V10 engines.
It has been abandoned for 3 years 
Some tracks make no sense, such as Doha with that pit lane
You can run the same tire compound in a race without fear of disqualification
Unrealistic weather (5 degrees in Sydney in late October doesn't EVER happen)

Verdict: A very good motorsport management game. If you are after management-style games, go for it. Buy on sale as it isn't worth the $38.69 (nice) price.

Long races in GT and Single Seater equate to around a short Endurance race. I wouldn't recommend medium or long for endurance as it can literally take an hour or two with only racing just to finish a single race with very little in regards to significant changes in the race. Paired with qualifying you have a several hour long gaming session just to complete one race. However, if you are interested in the perfect strategy, Endurance is probably a go too as it takes a very strong and thought out strategy to excel at the long races. I only recommend buying the Endurance and GT DLC after you have experienced quite a bit of the game first, getting used to all of the repetition of qualifying, building parts, expanding your HQ, hiring drivers and your race strategy. It will be a lot at the start but the quite wide range in AI difficulty is very good for starting out. I don't recommend buying the challenge pack, it adds very little to the overall game, with only adding one votable rule, 2 new additions to investment backgrounds with only one completely changing your driver recruitment playstyle, cosmetics and new liveries that really don't effect the playing style and a single new manager background.

Motorsport Manager provides a perspective on racing that I feel no other racing game I've seen has given. This, being the management side of motorsports. Sometimes in motorsports, we think of the driver as the star of the show, but this is far from the truth, as without a team behind them, the managers, engineers, mechanics, all of them, they would be nothing. My first race in this game gave me that wake up call. Sure, I understood that there's a whole team behind every car and driver in motorsports, and I have even dabbled in management thanks to the F1 2020 career mode, but having to make decisions on a dime during the race was difficult, but a learning experience and eye-opener to the work that real racing teams do every weekend. One of my favorite aspects of the management is pit stops. Specifically, one can manage every aspect of them, from what tires to switch to, to which parts to repair if any, and even the speed of the stop. The fact that the possibility of error increases with the speed is fascinating and realistic, and it makes the race more intense, as you watch your car take the stop and the progress bars fill, hoping and praying that the rear left tire changer doesn't mess it up, as you'll be kissing that podium goodbye. In the brief time I've played thus far, I've leaned towards the endurance racing. Endurance racing in real life has always peaked my interest, and I've been fascinated to see how the teams tackle the grueling task of 6 hour+ races. Managing endurance races in Motorsport Manager has been really cool to catch a glimpse into, albeit a fictional/simplified version of said endurance racing. At the time of writing, I have yet to try a GT race, but I'm sure it'll be the same thing- I'll get a new view on another division of motorsports that I'm interested in. All in all, Motorsport Manager shows you what you may not get to see all of on TV. Behind every driver is a team and a manager, and with this game you get to be that manager. Each race, you'll use your ingenuity and drive (no pun intended) to win to work with your team and bring the best out of them. Here, you're not just cheering on your team, you're helping them (and hopefully succeeding, eventually) to victory!

I highly recommend Motorsport Manager to all fans of racing games. Before I played this game, I've only had minimal experience with management games, though I believe it was my passion for racing and motorsport that has and will continue to provide a fantastic, educational, and entertaining experience. To go from driving on the track listening to updates from the engineer, to being the engineer talking to the drivers on the track is a strange transition, but the fun, challenge, and perspective that comes from it is entirely worth getting this game.",1628580594,1629057734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's no choice of different cars. You have to manage a two car team like F1. Limited livery choices and customisation. Every new career starts with an inevitable losing streak for the several first seasons regardless of difficulty unless you get very lucky before running out of money, until you can eventually upgrade your car and facilities enough to have a chance against a much better equipped grid (see grid average for components vs your car).

Qualifying is always just one flying lap at a time and allows for little quali strategy other than maybe getting lucky with the limited forecast by staying in for a bit longer and then sending out. Having to micromanage tyre heating gets very tiring. The AI is pretty braindead, at least at lower skill levels overtaking is a pain and the driver complaints - for example about changing to inters when already on wets and the weather forecast gets worse - get annoying. It might also overrule your tyre choices in qualifying on its own if you're not careful, denying you perks related to the setup you trained for in practice. Series rules are randomised and can only be changed slowly step by step by voting during the season.

In terms of graphics the tilt shift effect looks neat but it's kinda ruined by the insane amount of aliasing everywhere - not that you're really looking closely at anything other than the UI during races. The racing lines for some tracks look really off in places, so sometimes cars take slow turns very fast and take weird slow lines through fast looking sections. Sounds are okay, I suppose appropriate for Formula. The UI looks modern but the animations and wait times get annoying.

Maybe get in a sale if you like F1 I guess; pass otherwise.",1628727822,1628729050,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If there's a negative, it's that fundamentally, auto racing is not that exciting as a spectator sport. If you LIKE watching F1 and so forth, it's quite likely you'll enjoy Motorsport Manager. Otherwise, the entertainment is all about the strategy and the development of your team. 
There's plenty of that. On the track, the different tasks of practice, qualifying and racing make for a more varied experience than ""oh another soccer match"". Off track there are familiar elements around recruiting and developing your drivers and crew, sponsors + business concerns, media relations, etc. Plus you are constantly researching, upgrading, and tuning your cars.
The game does an admirable job capturing the culture of the sport, and it looks pretty good graphically.

Having it for not THAT long im already a few hundred hours into the game and i do not regret a single second.
Bought it when it was around  5€ in steam store. Now that i know how this game is, i'd gladly pay 30 Bucks for it. After a while it gets easy but thats no problem since you got a lot of settings for changing difficulty. GT-Series is so much fun. Workshop stuff (F1 2021) is great, the game does have a few weaknesses, which didnt keep me from playing it for 300h+.
After a while i got the GT-DLC and im going to get that challenge pack today.


Good

+ Hundreds of hours gametime for small money
+ With DLCs a lot of different ""leagues"" for some variety
+ Fun, challenging races/trainings/qualifyings
+ Several different racing classes with different car settings/challenges
+ Big variety in the settings, so you can make the game exactly as difficult as u want it to be
+ Good Workshop stuff (f1 2021 e.g.)
+ Fun DLCs (havent tried the challenge pack yet)
+ Rule Changes possible (there is barely a season just like the one before)
+ Interviews
+ Stuff you do actually has an impact. I could never tell when i played other managers (Football, EA, Sega for example)

Bad
- Too easy to get the best drivers by just smearing honey up their butts in interviews
- Dilemmas (some are just annoying)
- ""Fast forward"" keeps stopping for new months and events that im not even taking part  in
- Interviews (Should not be visible what exactly changes, when you give a specific answer. Also some answers should do you good, some should do you bad in every interview. There are a lot of Interviews in which you can only get pooped on)
- Estimated tire life is TOO FAR OFF the actual tire life. Example: in the GT-Series on soft tires it always says something like ""your tires will be usable for 14-16 laps"" but i can easily drive 27 laps on normal mode (tire usage) and they're still on 30%+
- Chassis Suppliers: RANDOM. Nothing you can do to affect which suppliers you can choose from. BY FAR my biggest - can be really annoying
- Drivers priority in endurance series: RANDOM. i dont want to have to change the order my drivers are in before every single race. The one thats in the middle on the ""drivers""- Screen should be in the middle of that ""drivers priority"" window. Everything else is just random sh.....rapnel
(- No Multiplayer.... cant they just bring one? I have no clue about programming but id really like the possibility to start a career with a friend in which every player manages his own team)

If it wasnt for the few (minor) bugs/ poor game mechanics i'd give it 10/10 Points, now its 8/10 and a definite recommendation from me. Buy it! The fun i had with it already far outweighs the minor bugs, even tho it seems differently in my list. Thats only because i explained the bad stuff in detail.
Cant think of anything else right now. Im sure, ill slightly change this review when i encounter new annoying or exceptionally great stuff.

I'm not going to say too much about the advantages of the game since most player have done it.

Here's something I hope can be improved:
1.Track accidents are a bit rare.Each race of F1 contains lots of accidents from a slight corner cutting,running wide to some 
   horrible collisions.But in the game these things happen too rare.
2.And there are never a REAL collsion between 2 or more cars.Of course you'll see somtimes 2 cars ""having a collison"" and 
   maybe one of them will be given a punishment,but actually it doesnt influence the car AT ALL.I mean,parts of the car 
   dont be damaged even in a COLLISION(at least in the single seater series).When it comes to a big collsion containing 
   several cars,just forget it.The game doesnt containit at all.Perhapes the AI driver have a mysterious power to avoid it...
3.First,what I want to say next has nothing to do with politics.         I really want an option enabling players to make all 
   drivers,designers,mechanics,etc,to be MALE or FEMALE.       I mean,I just want to have a more realistic experience.
4.AI drivers' racing strategy is awful.It seems like their decisions whether to ATTACK or CONSERVE mostly depend on their 
   tyre degrees.Sometimes a driver stubbornly preserves his/her 50% tyres when its just 2 laps remaining.And this leads to a 
   weird phenomenon that a driver with much newer tyres cant pass another just because of the degrees...
5.The race start is sometimes a disaster...You'll probably see a driver on POLE drop to 10th after one lap or a driver get 10or 
   even more positions in the first lap with the HARDEST tyre...
6.Last but not least,the retiring ages of most drivers is unidle,which are often 32,33,34...come on,what will RAI and ALO

The game mechanics are shallow and unrewarding. AI is horrible, I've played a lot of strategy games, so I'm used to bad AI, but this game is right near the top. UI and UX are unfinished and unpolished, sometimes downright absurd how bad some design choices are. 

[h3] Strategy and depth of game mechanics [/h3]

If you are expecting an immersive, in-depth gameplay like Football Manager, you're bound to be disappointed by the shallowness of mechanics in this game. Telemetry screen during races is very basic and useless. Strategy is done on the fly, you don't need to look into timetables or anything to make the right decision. During practice sessions you need to min-max your car setup and ""knowledge"", so you don't have to try out the compounds and see tire wear and performance. The knowledge mechanic is also a shallow mechanic that just forces you to do the same [b]exact[/b] thing before every race to min-max it. 

It feels like whatever you do you're going to start winning at one point as AI is unable to do anything right, including developing it's car. Keep in mind that car development just requires you to mindlessly develop parts during the season, no way to mess it up, really, just design new parts whenever you can. All of the game mechanics outside of race weekend feel like you're given a multiple choice test where you just need to select the biggest number. This includes sponsorships, car development, pre-season car development, pit crew management, staff management, driver management. 

[h3] UI and UX [/h3]

You know it's a big problem when UI and UX have to be mentioned in a review. The game is obviously made for mobile devices as scroll doesn't work in most menus correctly.

You get some screens where you can search for staff and drivers, but you can't even filter by attributes/bonuses, instead you have to click through every driver to see their stats.

Data centre during the race is absolutely unusable and useless (you are going to win anyway, so why bother).

What made me stop playing the game is when I lost my pit crew after 3 seasons of carefully picking them because I forgot to renew contracts. That shouldn't even have been a part of the game, yet they made crew contracts a real PITA by not giving you an option to auto-renew contracts, and no reminders that contracts are expiring. Ideally it should've been done so that you select your pit crew for the season and at the end of the season you get an option to replace a crew member or extend their contract. It's really a cherry on top of how bad the UI and UX are, and how unfinished this game is. 

[h3] Licencing [/h3]

They haven't paid for licencing of any real-world racing series, which I don't mind, but at least don't make your teams similar to real world teams, as it makes the game feel like parody or a joke, it looks very unprofessional.",1626706794,1626706954,False,1,0,0.495568394660949707,0,True,False,False

-It belongs in that perfect spot between ""not too hard for the casuals"" and ""not too easy for the hardcore""
-Race management is such a fun thing to do. if you hit that perfect strategy you will feel very satisfied. But if you messed it up, WELL IT IS THE FERRARI MASTERBLAN.
-Rule changes make things fun. You see if you get bored, you can just propose some rule changes that make the sport a little bit more chaotic.
-Pretty realistic F1 management because Sponsors ARE EVERYTHING. It is your lifeline. Just like in Formula 1
-You aren't in control of the cars unlike playing F1 games by Codemasters, so there's a lot of drama and your drivers can make mistakes. SINGAPORE 2017 MISTAKES.
-You and the AI races not just in the circuit, but also in car development. Your car can dominate the first half of the season but the AI teams can improve too and that's just fun.
-Community support with great mods.

the Bad:
Doesn't really impact the game that much but i think these are what they needed.
-Really needed a sequel smh
-Lacked the intra-team drama and politics or maybe the scandals in F1. Driver rivalries are meh. No shady sponsors like Rich Energy.
-The sponsors, especially the higher paying ones, should've lot more control such as your car's colors like what BWT did with Racing Point. They should've wanted much more such as a Belgian company wants a Belgian driver for the team.
-The vanilla database are kinda unrealistic. That's why i recommend mods.

+ Graphics are ok but you can find Enchanced Graphics mod in Nexus website (make sure you add the camera)
+ Gameplay is really solid. There's all the basics if you ever played a F1 Sim; from finding the correct setup before the race and a cool system of Overtake/Push/Normal/Conserve/SOS in both fuel/tyres.
+ Interface for Strategy is very intuitive. Look's scary in screenshots but takes you 2-3 hours so you can get competitive.
+ Steam Workshop Available (DOWNLOAD F1 MANAGER 2021 MOD - you still can get the achievements)
+ You can play at your pace
+ Crafting new parts and Reability works just fine

- Audio isn't really great
- You can't control how you start, sometimes you have the perfect everything in P1 and you're just sent to 3rd for no reason D: or i'm just unlucky

The game offers enough depth to be entertaining and challenging for hours on end. Developing your team slowly, on both a macro level (budgeting, research and development, sponsorships, scouting, etc) and more detailled levels (race strategy, even engine modes (ERS)). 

However, the detail of the car setup could be improved upon, as only three factors define the performance of the car. You will have to find the sweet spot for these three factor settings to get the fastest times, but if this was more detailled, the difficulty and challenge of the game would be better. 

Long story short: I can reccomend this game. There are however some improvements to be made. The soundtrack will become boring after a while, and I would like some more options to tweak the User Interface. Maybe I'ts me getting old, but the Typefont is just a bit too small sometimes and I can't change it in the Preferences of the game (maybe in some .txt file but haven't looked that up). For example, it would be great if you could also change the cars weight balance or changing brake balance. 

One thing that is plain wrong is the correlation between tyre pressure (PSI/BAR) and straight line speed. According to the game, when you increase tyre pressure your straight line speed decreases, while your accelaration increases. It is reversed ofcourse when lowering tyre pressure, which results in higher straight line speed. I belief this correlation is on general wrong and should be updated. But I think it has been designed like this in order to give the car setup a 'trade of system' (like rock paper sciccors) in order to make the game more challenging instead of being completely realistic.

Anyway, if this one is for sale I can definetly recommend it if you like autosport games.",1615855026,1624010902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The in-race action is really fun, as are the driver personality traits etc. But it the career mode really feels like a progression system from a mobile game. Each year you will improve a little, until you're winning the championship every season without fail.

I think the way you develop cars etc. needs to be re-thought. Maybe with hidden staff ratings and dynamic ratings for providers.

An older game as of my review, there are lots of mods to keep the game fresh and most of the bugs are worked out or known.

The game is really deep, but I understand there are some issues with replayability because of how drivers are the same every play-through. Mods fix this. I'm so new though, I haven't installed any mods. It's very hard. I recommend following the annoyingly long tutorial (do NOT create your own team first time! you'll likely run out of money the first season) to figure out the basics, then start over fresh once you have things figured out. There's some great posts in the Guides and Discussion sections on steam that help you understand the best strategies for success (like, not picking ROOT for the 3 star chassis your first season, which leads to you still placing 9th in the championship at best, and running out of money quickly).",1615414324,1615414324,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No, there are fairly random moments where the game crashes, load times can be a chore, and perhaps it lacks a little bit of depth, but overall it's a good fun game and there are some very good mods that add to it too.

i cannot recommend this game now, as this does not start for me, my pc is more than capable to manage this game but some how wont even go past the loading screen. crashes each time. have varified game on many occasions and also done other restarts, deletions,reinstall etc...game is broken and done. its a pitty, i really enjoyed it, but cant like a game that doesnt even make it to the main menu

EDIT:01/01/2016
Still a very positive game, but lately my computer has been crashing alot.. the last week ive played over 22hrs or so and the game has started crashing and more frequently. Never has in the past so im assuming they have done a patch that i havnt noticed and its crashing. 
I have also noticed that they fixed the blue flag problem with the backmarkers so now i can go into qualiflying without being holding me up. GREAT advantage, however, not the real deal! why apply a fix that allows cars to driver through one another? why not spend more time fixing the engine on the backmarkers getting out of the way?
If the game had a racing line, then you would be able to easily fix the issue..simply when doing a hot lap, your on the racing line. when cooling down or heading to the pits, your off the racing line!?!?! SIMPLES!!

over 100 hours now just like i said previously, and i still find the game rewarding and full of fun!
however, i dont like seeing 3 laps to go with the safety car out and all drivers have pitted with the correct amount of fuel and new tyres, but being in first place and getting totally blown away by Stein motorsport by more then 20 secs is NOT REALISTIC!!
thats the biggest con of this game, the game is far from being realistic!
Another thing id like them to apply, is spending REAL money on the game to benefit your gaming experience! Just like you could in the phone app version!

They have got alot to fix, but this doesnt change my view of the game. I still love it and even talk to my self every now and then as if im being interviewed on the game! lol...little personal fun but hey, its great!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though i have only clocked up 4 hours so far on this game, Motorsport Manager definately lived up to its expectations! 
Ive played the Mobile version of this and have clocked up atleast 100hrs of none stop fun on it but this design in racing is literally all ive ever wanted to play!

Motorsport Manager is a PURE management game! Can be played as a casual game but also take it seriously.
On the good points, the game is totally decision based on how you like your racers to race! YOU ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL! and on a plus side, the races arnt a 5min race like what the Mobile version is like!
The graphics for a game like this is amazing, considering its all been transferred and redesgined from a mobile game app! 
Its definately worth buying, but i highly and strongly recommand you download the Mobile version of it first ( i think its free) before you play as for some people, it could get boring and get boring really fast!

This game is not the for racing type gamers, its 100% management! to put it all in a nutshell, imagine you are Toto Wolff or Christian Horner. This game is literally like being one of them! and for those who dont know the names of the people i just said, then you might not wana buy this game.. Even though it does say MOTORSPORT, its really not, its F1, GP2 and GP3 but its not an official game from F1 ( FIA). Due to copyrights, i assume they decided to create their own style of brands etc as im sure it makes the game cheaper..so no, you wont see no Lewis Hamiton, Nico Rosbery or Daniel Riccairdo! But honestly, does this really matter?

Being a true F1 supporter and fanatic, i loved this game even before it came out! i can see myself clocking easily over 100hours gametime even 1000 if i really wanted too!

A true gamer with no history of playing the mobile game would rate this a 6 for graphics, 8 for gameplay and 7 for everything else. BUT!!! due to me knowing how much effort they have done to this game, how little the brand is and how they turned a Mobile game into a PC game, id rate all aspects of this game a 10/10!!
You most definately need to be keen on management type games as this one is by far the most balanced management type game out there!!",1478753565,1613468670,False,0,0,0.594095885753631592,0,True,False,False

On it's way to being 5 years old there aren't huge amounts to update for a sequel and if you didnt know it was a 2016 game, you wouldn't guess. Things i'd like to see in a sequel;

A bit from the regulations, what's there is good but things like forced tyre compound usage during races would be good.
A bit more clarity on the rain, and just when the wet's are needed, as opposed to the inters.
More real benefit from HQ upgrades, directly effecting car quality at start of season
More regulations that define era's, so there is a noticeable reset to car development
A bit more effort in contract ending and the reasons you might fire people
A refined bit crew navigation system
A more realistic approach to reliability
More social media content

What isn't great is the quality of how some of these are implemented and the raft of bugs that comes with it. 

Here are the deal breakers for me:

Game crashes, a lot. Typically when you try sim a session or skip forwards in time. In these cases often the last save is at the end of the previous race weekend which is frustrating. Saving takes longer than it should as well for some reason.

Graphical bugs, including but not limited to:
 - Number 2 car showing the same parts as number 1 car or vice versa, no clue if the selected parts are actually used due 
    to this 
 - One driver shown as driving both cars (in which case only one car gives feedback for both drivers and you cant work out 
    which is which), is the car duplicated, are the parts duplicated, or is it just visual? Who knows  
- If you actually use your reserve driver, it is no longer possible to properly allocate drivers to cars causing a repeat of the 
   bug above
- Game is abandoned

The career mode itself is kind of broken. I'm midway through my second season as Manager, and my car isn't even competitive.

The two constraints on that being time... and money, like in real life (except I don't have millions in the bank).

What's super irritating is that the time in sessions is not real time. I don't know why they thought this was a good idea, especially if they give you a way to speed up time. It's especially frustrating in practice when you're trying to max out your tire and setup bonuses. Second, the seasons, are relatively short and improving anything in the game takes a long time. This makes the game seem much more grindy than it should frankly.

Money. Well, it's important in this game. And frankly I understand that things SHOULD cost money, but things cost more than they probably should. $200k just to recuit a pit crew? $2M for an engine??? Normally this would be okay, but money is hard difficult to come by, unless you're already competing for podiums.

The worst part is that my top two complaints I could see past, but RNG/backend calculations which you are not privy to are invasive in the game.

Last lap and you're meeting the goal for the race? Bummer, your driver ran wide.

2% chance of a mistake? Nah, looks like your pitstop now took an extra 10 seconds because magic.

I want to reiterate that I like the game, a lot actually. It's something I can come back to. But damn, this game could be incredible, if they actually took the time to read some of these reviews. Maybe release a new version of the game...

It's currently the only game that is of this type that has many options and is quality.
There are some bugs in the game and some things that are not well done but for the most part you can glance over them. I hope in the future they make a better version of this with more options and customisation and less randomness!! The race pace of the drivers is so random sometimes it's really weird. Also the undercut is a lot too strong. It's so strong I do it always when I play seriously. If there is refuelling it's almost a joke that they are programmed so simply. I know that AI is hard to make as I am doing it right now, but atleast you could make let's 3 presets how they would go and it would make it more interesting, like this it's just like no refuelling, they just take in to plan the tires.

1. You can promote backup driver, but not main drivers? So first I need to promote some noob to main driver and then another driver to main driver position in order to be able to switch positions between 2 main drivers. Then they both get a bunch negative satisfaction points. Because they don't see it as a promotion but as a demotion.

2. You can design new parts for the car and build them. But you won't be able to get rid of them later on. Even though you are FORCED to start by making some low level parts in order to get to the higher level ones. So eventually you end up with a huge list of items, useless items. They even wrote about that fact in their tutorial. As if that is something to brag about???! What?!

3. You can scout new drivers. But you won't know which one will be interested in hearing your offer for joining right away. First you need to click on a driver and then click another button in order to see if they are interested. Now since there are more than 200 of the drivers and all of them change their minds from time to time. Imagine making 500 clicks! Just to see who is willing to hear your offer! Then you'll need to make an offer and hope it's appealing to them. And since the ESC button does literally NOTHING. That means you're forced to use your hand and wrist to scout the drivers. Say a prayer for your hand and wrist before playing this game!

4. And say goodbye to a bunch of wasted time on well... trying to even come close to figuring out what makes this game tick. Should you be investing in the car or in the driver or both? Should you scout new drivers or not? Should you be making buildings and upgrading buildings or not? And will you have enough money to do all of it? The game doesn't tell you what percentage of benefits you'll get for anything really. I had to go online in order to find out by how much fuel consumption is increased or decreased during the race. Which also can be a huge key factor in figuring out how to win this game! I then figured out that I could make only 2 fuel stops rather than 3 in 13 laps with about 6 laps fuel tank. Save time and get ahead of the competition!

5. Does tweaking your car during practice even do anything? Nobody tells you that in the game. You'll probably never know! And to make it worse. Even if you didn't make upgrades to your car. Before the next race you need to readjust everything once again! So.. it's like a guessing game where you never know what is happening and why. Just hope for the best! 

Maybe you'll get lucky and someone crashes. Then a pickup truck will go on the track. Everyone get stuck behind that truck and by that resetting their positions. You now have a good chance of winning 1st spot! After you've spent 50h trying to figure out how to even get into top 10 during the race with at least 1 car.

What can i say Honestly it's a good idea for a game if you have ever wanted to run your own Formula 1 team or lower class as well as look into stuff like the le mans series or GT racing this is the game for you but there are some pros and cons id like to layout before deciding to buy this game 

Pros 

Management style game that allows you to take a look into the eyes of a team manager 
Create a team Always a good idea for a game like this as you can look into the trouble managing your own team year to year can be 
Mod Support/Steam Workshop this was a great idea i like that the game went with mod support but sadly most of the workshop items are built for Formula 1 rather than exploring other options or new drivers to add into your roster 
Great intro Climatic 

Cons 
Every game has it's cons and this game does fall short on that

Time control i feel that in every management game if you have a speed up clock it messes up the formula of what is being Calculated  anything beyond 2 times speed just makes the game unplayable and you can't make decisions or see changes in how the race is going 

Upgrades any of the upgrades for your Car or HQ feels really good but it doesn't show any actual change in how the car is rather it's going faster or slower and upgrading the car doesn't have a impact til the new years car 

Car Stats Car stats seem to have a issue for instance you could put the better parts on your favorite driver aka driver 2 and it feels like driver 1 gets those upgrades and eventually makes driver 2 unhappy this also seems to affect the way Driver 2 reacts during a race as they drive worst even though you gave them the better parts 

Profit ok this might seem like a minor issue but there almost seems to be no way of gaining profit unless your a top tier team which also leads to expenses i understand that races can be expensive and at the end of the day it's hard to come out with a profit but if your for instance in create a team and you are a new team you can't end the year with a profit unless you choose to be spare with your spending 

Progression this is a weird Topic and i feel that progression is strange as the way the game works it makes it to where if you finished X year at 10th place the next year your car could be still a 20th or lower placed car yet the principal expects you to have a 10th place car to roll with and that can be difficult if you used all your money to make last years car the way it was this makes it to where eventually or that next year your bound to fail

Scenes their are almost no scenes to speak of it would of been nice to have some kinda of Celebration on the podium or even just a scene of stuff happening in the pit it would of also been nice to have interactions with your drivers and mechanics and stuff this game came out in Nov 9th 2016 but it would of been nice to see something that made it feel like your really a manager of a team and their were choices you needed to make or discuss with your team before they happened 

Finally lets talk about a sequel there is none that is on PC yes mobile got a few new versions of the game most recently Motorsport Manger Online which is on mobile only but there is no Sequel to the PC version it would of been nice to seen a new version in the works with updates as well as new ways to race for instance having the Sequel include Formula E i feel that after Motorsport manager went out and didn't sell well Playsports just never looked into a new Game or making a Sequel on PC which would of been nice 

Otherwise i recommend this game because it's fun a great time passer and well worth the money if you buy it on sale or during a Steam Sale otherwise it's still worth it just realize there are alot of issues in the game",1609111533,1609111533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One could say that MM is just a series of races, and I can admit it can become a grind sometimes, but MM is above all a series of testing, gettting feedback, hiring/firing/scouting, improving, building, keeping an eye on and interacting with many aspects at the same time, learning all the races' elements and  keep trying to find better ways of dealing with them, with even some adreline on initial/final laps.

Definitely a benchmark and unique experience (that I thought I'd never even wanted) to manage a racing team
GAMEPLAY

PROS
- Very challenging, especially if you start your own team, takes some time to build everything up
- Quite deep systems, a lot of different aspects to manage
- Plenty of variety(tracks, drivers, teams, etc) even in the base game, a lot more with DLCs and mods
- Due to its challenging (downright frustating sometimes) nature success feels very gratifying

CONS
- Gets quite tedious, especially after around the third or so season
- Some systems don't make much sense/don't seem relevant (e.g. driver form, stat growth, chassis 'stars')
- Too much race micromanagement

GRAPHICS, SOUND, ETC

Absolutely gorgeous game
License free tracks and drivers which make them very unique
Cars sound great, although ambient noise is rather annoying

If you want a complex game like Football Manager but for the world of Motorsport I'm sorry to say but this is far from complex anything. And here is why.

Car development is basically go for the best stats at any risk, it just drags on and on.
The HQ while a good idea it's literally a reskin for the car development menu that unlocks some items in development and improves your drivers quicker.
Dilmeas are boxes with one real choice, the one where you have to pay for it. You don't sacrifice anything otehr than money in this game. 
When you develop the car in between seasons is the same exact shit as above. You will get dillemas and you pay to get a better car, that's it. 
Drivers endlessly just improve until they don't and randomly they either get a buff or a nerf, it's all up to RNG, you will eventually find a great driver and you will pay a premium for him and you will get more and better results, of course.

Now to the actual gameplay.
Practice is driving your car in and out of the garage fine tuning your car, and if that might not sound that bad at first just realize that there are 3 sliders that change the setup. Tires, conditions, the track make no difference. 
Qualifying is just straight up luck. It doesn't have any strategy in itself, something that qualifiers do have in the real sport.
And the race :)

The race is as simple as it gets, but here I actually enjoy it. 
You can have a strategy in your mind and it usually plays just like it should, but you have to be careful.
The tire degradation mechanic is kinda cool actually.
And the strategy of other cars will make you think more than you should

this game needs a rehash

A masterpiece of 2010 decade sport management videogames still counting on a delta of surplus on respect majority of competitors.
Please, pay attention before buying it: you’ll have to set car and choose strategies during the races. If you’re looking for just management game you should really choose something else – far from being impossible or really hard actually it is not that easy and you’ll have to show out some knowledge of both mechanics attitude and car race tactics together timing sensitiveness to effectively start winning with scrappy teams/drivers in this races simulation.

Negative: 
It lack something to ensure a commeasurable longevity related to its absolute engaging gameplay structure.
For example the software house provided names that seems like fake of real world – especially regarding drivers name, somehow a few chooses seems to range between parody and plagiarism. Tributes to legends are ok, from Farina to Loeb and Hamilton passing through Block or Schumacher there really are too much. My suggestion to the software house is just randomizing normal reasonable name and keep their virtual world separated from real one!
Also, I do think mechanics settings really are a bit out core activities in this kind of management simulation: if it’s not possible to demand it at engineer skills at least allow standard cut&paste options (beside it is absolutely truth drivers may need personal adjust to fit their own driving attitude).",1606579763,1606581249,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

THAT said, the premise of the game is about as surreal and daft as the one behind Plants Vs Zombies Garden Warfare. Not that it prevented that one from being a fun game too, mind you.

Have you even looked at a racing game and thought ""nah, actually driving the car is BORING""?

Have you ever thought that what, say, Takumi of Initial D fame really needed was a stereotypical mother-in-law telling him how to drive from the back seat? Like, ""Step on it, junior, I see a snail overtaking us. And shouting we should stay off the road""? Followed some two minutes later by, ""slow down, Beavis, you'll blow the engine""? Did you wish you could play as HER?

Did you ever look at a Dilbert comic strip and thought, ""man, I wish I were as smart as that pointy-haired boss, always telling engineers exactly how to do their job?""

Did you ever think that when you have a multiple gold-medallist driver and a race mechanic with 30 years work experience, it should be a 24 year old, fresh from management school, telling the latter what the exact camber angle should be? Based on just vaguely remembering that the driver said something like, ""can we loosen the handling a bit?"", but not having actually even bothered writing it down?

Did you ever think that when you have an engine designed by a 5-star veteran race car engineer, it should be some manager who decides how many kilos of structural weight to strip down from the engine block to make the car faster? Followed by deciding how many kilos of ballast to put in the back instead so the car doesn't now terminally oversteer?

Did you ever secretly believe that said multiple gold-medallist driver has a Kelly Bundy memory model, so if he remembers how the car performed in practice with racing slicks and racing trim, he'll forget a third thing, like that the mechanic installed a new engine boost button? Do you think he needs a manager to tell him to remember how the car drove in practice?

If you answered ""yes"" to any of the above... well, you probably should stop mistaking Dilbert for a documentary on GOOD management practices.

If you answered ""hell no, but I'll still play a fun game even if it's based on a totally absurd premise"", then this may well be worth a try.",1606396319,1606396319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just want to play vanilla, with real courses, maaaybe real driver names, and if there are sponsors and logos and liveries, I'll take it.... but pleeeaase no changes to gameplay or vanilla etc..


Update 40h later:

I made the crucial mistake to set my goals a bit higher for the second season since i expected to be able to make better parts with my new mechanics. Out of a job after 3 races, all that counts is the facilities, mechs and drivers are negligible. Last place 3rd league chairman fired me, nothing achieved. Immediately got hired by 1st league team.. what? Now i have alll the facilities and no idea what to do. Kinda killed my mood :(

Close to changing to not recommended. The basics are fine, but I was thinking... when come the next steps in the tutorial? Like.. is this it?? Sounds weird with 30h playtime+ but its mostly watching the race and changing attack mode or back to saving fuel etc. 


EDIT: MOD FIRE FANTASY 20 is perfect. Use it. It also has a real nice manual with summary and and and, really professional (although a bit hidden).

EDIT: Unfortunately its not. Many descriptions are not correct anymore, e.g. HQ Test Track helps driver develop his cornering. Its actually gives +% to learning to almost every driverskill. Really annoying that you dont know what u get before u make big xx million costly decisions. I'm back to pleeease somebody make a mod with names etc. only and no gameplay changes.

This game does not do that very well at all. Eg. changes to the power delivery of the car cause your car to burn more fuel and aggressiveness causes your tires to wear out sooner, but neither appear to make any change to your lap times or ability to overtake. I am sure there is a reason for this, but the game does not explain why, so it appears the main control you have over the game (tire/fuel management) is quite pointless.

The most game-breaking example of this is in driver recruitment. I have had all 3 of my games fall apart suddenly when all racers just start flat out refusing to sign a contract with me after a relatively good season with no other obvious issues. My current racers will force their contracts to expire and any/all, even the unemployed and most junior of racers currently on $50,000/race contracts, will flat out refuse $500,000/race contracts. I will go through 20+ sets of contract negotiations during the off-season getting to the point where I will offer so much money that it would completely bankrupt my team and all will still be rejected. You get nothing but a statement that the specifics of the per race price are ""insulting"" whilst finding all other parts of the contract ""delighted"". Once again, I am sure there is a reason why they find a ludicrously high contract insultingly low, but it does not communicate this to you.

There are other instances of this problem such as your driver coming 3rd in qualifying, but then be 18th by the end of the second lap with no reason as to why. CPU racers will somehow go 12 laps on super/ultra-soft tires they already used for 2 qualifying laps, but you will need to pit after 4 because you already used them for 1 qualifying lap. Seemingly impossible to improve pit teams. etc. etc. The list goes on and on of instances where you can see a problem, but the game doesn't help you in any way to figure out how to fix the issue.",1602932514,1602932514,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was able to log ~250 hours into the game before it got too repetitive and I got bored. I'm playing it for a second time, so I decided to write a review as well. There are a few annoying bugs (i.e., weird driver bugs/can't pick the right driver during practice), but I think they're fairly minor. I own all the DLCs, but I've only played the main portion of the game (the single-seat/F1 series).

Since I've only played the single-seat series (which is the equivalent to Formula racing), I'll only talk about that. There are 3 series to choose from (ERS, APS, and WMC). ERS is the lowest tier, and WMC is the highest tier. For new players and people who are creating their own team, I'd recommend starting in the lowest tier (and with the worst team if you're not making your own) because there'll be less pressure to perform, and you can take your time to learn how the game works. In general, you should focus most on improving the engine's performance followed by the other parts, but the engine is the most important by far.  There are 'risk levels' that you can add to your parts that can greatly boost its stats, but if you're caught using them you'll be penalised. My suggestion is build the most powerful engine you can near the end of the season because the game will take your best part into the next season. Of course, I recommend watching some beginner's video to get a better understanding of the game.

I got this game on sale (including the DLCs) which was around $15 CAD. I'd recommend waiting for the sale to buy the game because, while it's enjoyable, I think it's a little too pricey ($38.69 right now). I think anything under $25 is a fair price, but it goes on sale for like 75% off from time to time, so I'd just wait for that.

TL;DR, Great game, especially if you're a Formula fan. Wait for a sale—goes on sale somewhat often. If you're bored with the main game, you can also try the DLC, but I've never tried them, so I can't tell you for sure to get them.",1602543451,1602543511,True,5,0,0.564220190048217773,0,True,False,False

However, this is not a game new players to this type of game can get into. The simulation options are far too numerous and complex and when you start, for the first few races you are walked through a pretty heavy and detailed tutorial.

The problem is there are so many things you can click on, just wondering what they are, and by doing so you trigger a 10-20 click-by-click tutorial where you're forced to read the boxes and click on all the things it is trying to explain to you. Theres no way out of them but to keep clicking, and if you've already reached saturation point of information (which you will by an hour or two in) then you'll be screwed.

One of the early tutorials was to build a new part for a car, and this again is ""click this tutorial window to move onto the next one"" all the way through, but the problem is, it ends with the tutorial telling you to fast forward time as the part will take 5 days to make. This wouldn't be a problem except you've built ONE of that part, and can put it only in ONE of your two cars, and when i did this, the other driver's mood went from OK/contented to ANGRY and him considering leaving for another team because his teammates car had ONE part in, that was 10% better than his.

The in-race simulation seems almost fine except tyres wear out at like 5-25% per real life minute, and for some bizarre reason there is no option to refuel mid race, which due to having inferior cars, means there is absolutely no chance of getting a top 5 finish in any race in your first 5-6 races, because you'd have to set the drivers to overdrive and run out of fuel. 

Maybe it's possible later on after you've invested and more upgraded the cars, and sure, you shouldn't expect to win every race from the start, but it feels like the exhausting and overextensive tutorials focus too much on the wrong things at the very beginning and it might have been better to lock off many of the sections until a couple of races have gone by.

I cannot recommend because it's too complex, which during the ""tutorial"" phase, is a real problem.",1602349601,1602349601,False,1,0,0.396088242530822754,0,True,False,False

I always played Gran Turismo 4 on B-Spec mode and loved it at the time but doing an endurance race with only 6 cars is a bit dated at this point. Motorsport Manger has a great scope of what motorsport is about, with elements of all areas included; from Racing and HQ building to the Media and Championship Rules. As someone with a very weak machine its great to have a 2D mode that can run well on a potato, though I wish to be able to play this in full 3D some day.

One thing I will say is that as some one who has had this game for a while now, it is getting a little dated due to so much happening in real-world motorsports since its release and could perhaps do with a new version on PC. The release of lots of mobile versions are nice but they do not compare to the full version. Its a similar issue to FIFA in that, you can start the new season as many times as you like but to begin with, its always the same. A randomizer would be a nice edition but there are enough of there examples where I think an evolution of this game would be the better call, especially as its the only one of its kind in the market.

There's quite a bit of a learning curve here, not everything works the way you'd think/hope or is relatively equally important, and because it's a simulation there's still a bunch of randomness, as well as a smattering of little bugs and nuisances, so I can see why the metacritic score isn't higher, but if you have a bit of patience and the subject matter works for you then there's nearly endless fun and shenanigans.",1565148904,1598668886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I put in a fair amount of hours working at this the hard way by starting with a custom team and working my way to the top.   There's a lot of things you as a team principal have to balance in MSM including the budget, contracts, race strategies, what to research, sponsor contracts, etc.  

Pros:
- graphics are decent
- decent amount of depth
- can use varied strategies against the computer in the race, somethings stealing a podium when your cars had no business being there
- plenty of mods available

Cons:
- once you figure out the winning strategy, the game can get way too easy.  An example is marketability is so overpowered.  You can hire two junk drivers, but if they have 90-100% marketability, you can quickly bring in 5 star sponsors even with a last place team.  Money is king
- an occasional crash to desktop here and there, but nothing major
- there's no manual to the game, so it's unclear what certain things mean (such as if your pit crew member becomes burnt out and the implications)

Conclusion:
Even though the game got too easy for me in the end, I still enjoyed the journey of figuring out the strategy that works for me.  I put in a rather large number of hours (more than 200 if the stat is to be believed) and definitely got my money's worth on the game.  Granted I purchased this on a discount

What would make this game more interesting, in my opinion, is more gameplay relating to the the media / marketing, and more personal relationships with the drivers themselves.  As of now, the drivers are just containers for stats that occasionally have events to change those stats - you can't get to know them as people, because there's no 'people' to get to know.

Motorsport Manager is not a great step forwards in overall game quality when compared to GPM2, but it is not bad either. It modernizes and streamlines some of the systems that really needed it. A lot of mechanics are somewhat similar to GPM2 (some better, some worse). Graphics and user interfaces have come a long way since '96 though. 
Mod support is pretty good so if you want to play a licensed series (F1) there's plenty of options as well as mods to change all sorts of other stuff.

There's a couple of annoyances. First is the way new hires are handled as you cannot schedule a contract to follow an existing one leaving you with only a very small window at the end of the seasons to get new drivers or mechanics without having to pay for breaking contracts. 
Second the game appears to have some bugs. I wouldn't call them huge, but other reviewers appear to have a lot of issues with them.
Lastly I think the game would have greatly benefitted from the ability to do multiplay and let you play against your friends' teams.

I bought this game a few days ago and am working a full time job but still managed to put almost 20 hours into it at the time of this review. It's in-depth and has a lot of elements and strategy to keep you busy and on your toes. There's not too much micromanagement to the point it gets tedious, but there is enough to keep you busy and make use of your time. Managing driving and pit strategies and giving your drivers have the best setup they're comfortable during the race is absolutely crucial. Oh, and keep an eye on the weather! You don't know how many times I bonked myself on the head because I had just sent my driver out on softs when it began to rain....nothing better to help your drivers position-wise than an extra pit-stop for tyres eh.

Plus there are little ""dilemmas"" that pop up throughout the season that definitely make the game more interesting! Though they do get somewhat redundant the more you play.

If you are a racing guru or gear-head, this game is essential to you. I wish they would make another one that isn't for mobile, This game is great the way it is and holds up don't get me wrong, but some updated visuals, perhaps some layout changes and more scenarios would make it another title worth buying!

This game is like when you get 3 questions from your teacher, but there are 5 different subsections for each question. The things that repeat in this game are like the main questions. The 'subsections' are what's different every single time. This is what simulators/management games should be all about: You repeat several main objectives while still having so much variety in the process.

I've played over 1000 hours, by far the most of any game I've owned, and have completed somewhere around 30 seasons just in the formula series. I have the GT and Endurance DLCs and haven't even touched them (yet).  Honestly, any criticism I'd have is just nitpicking. There's hardly anything I can think of that I can't do. The interface is great. The circuits are genius in how they utilize most of the characteristics of real circuits for a familiar feel, but they don't infringe on any trademarks. I look forward to the strategizing between races as much as the races themselves. My team is totally dominant but I still find the racing rewarding and I'm certainly not a lock to win every race. It's especially rewarding to develop new drivers and make room for them in the team. 

The developers did their homework for this game. They understand racing in and out and have produced a slick running and looking, intuitive game that's challenging, especially early on as you learn the ropes through the first few seasons. As you progress into ""F2"" and ""F1"" you'll have even more difficult seasons; I had to slog through about 7 full ""F1"" seasons before I could win a race, after dominating the lower series. That's a tough pill to swallow, but it was worth it once I started winning championships. Each season, scraping 10-15 points seemed like such an achievement until the dam broke and I became Merc dominant. Even then, you feel like you earned that dominance after what it takes to build to get to that level, including getting fired a few times from other teams after getting so close. And still there's room to improve the team after all this time. 

If you like road racing and feel you can manage a team's operations and real time race strategies better than Toto Wolff and  Bono, give it a shot. But be prepared to put in the time. And to get very addicted.",1596780181,1596780523,True,93,4,0.888631999492645264,0,True,False,False

Althought this game is a manager, it doesn't focus entirely on management. In fact, management part is not very complicated - all the rules can be learned quite easily, the only further work is to understand where to put focus in. We manage drivers, choose workers, we decide which parts to build or how to improve our team base. I have a feeling that this part could be richer - after few seasons, I started to feel it's too repetitive. I also think that tempo of improvement is kind of slow - it takes ages to build everything. It also takes vast amount of money, althought I played only as a custom team in the lowest league - maybe it's easier in higher divisions.

But most of the results is determined in races. It wouldn't be far from true to say that we rather manage drivers in races than a whole motorsport team. Althought we don't drive ourselves, we must do multiple decisions every time - starting from training, where we want to find optimal settings, ending in the race, where we tell driver when to drive passively/aggresively, how to manage tyres and fuel or how to react to changing weather. Race part is not automated at all - there is no option to predefine driver's behaviour in certain conditions, we have to manage everything manually. It's like being a race engineer.

Unfortunately, game interface is not perfect - some crucial information about the race is sometimes not available (during training) or well-hidden. During the race, the game informs me that fuel is ending (which wouldn't be bad if I didn't already schedule a pit stop), but it doesn't warn me that rain is coming (which is easy to miss at 12x speed). In addition, it has various minor, but notable bugs - like wrong laps left counting (it takes laps of the leader, not our driver) or incorrect counting of race costs.

I was also very anoyed when I discovered I can't contract the driver for the next seaon, even if his contract ends - drivers have to join the team immediately when we sign a contract.

Summarizing: I did enjoy the game, especially the race part, but I can imagine something better. In lack of other good motorsport managers of the market, this game is worth trying.",1596406189,1596406189,True,13,0,0.666751682758331299,0,True,False,False

The reason I can no longer recommend it is because I am really tired of the arcade-like features that sega put in. Things like...
- The qualifying mini-game, getting stat boosts or penalties because of your tire and break heat.
- The fact that the actual technical set-up of your car doesn't matter, so long as the stat sliders end up in the right place. (For example, it doesn't matter if you put higher or lower angle in the front wing for low speed corners or rear wing for high speed corners, just as long as the high/low down force slider is in the right spot.
- Mechanic special bonuses being crazy OP. Being able to refuell in half the time completely negates the need for high stat pit-crew or a top of the line car.
- The fact that when you build a BRAND NEW part, it has VERY LOW reliability. It is mind boggling that a new part starts off broken, and then can get more reliable at any age so long as have your mechanics max it out at some point. (It should be the other way around, where it starts with max reliability and every race decreases the max).
- The fact that you have to build 6 engines (or any other part) in a season just to get one good one. Or the fact that a max stat designer can create a bad part if the stat choices are bad, but a low stat designer can create a great part if you get good choices. (Choices as in each tier gives you 3 choices of stat bonuses or penalties).
- The fact that AI drivers don't suffer the same penalties for driving with worn tires or racing slicks in the rain as you do. AI penalty for say a 10% tire tread is the same as a player with like 25% tread. AI can drive on slicks with not penalty in like 25% track wetness, but if you try to use slicks in even 10% wetness and you fall way behind.

Keep in mind. Despite all of these flaws, I still love and play this game. However, to someone new to the game, you really need to know these things ahead of time. I will say that, if you can get past these issues, it is such a great game. However, these issues are why I cannot recommend it.",1478850820,1596392352,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that being said the actual application of this game is kind of frustrating because the things that are supposed to make it real are either missing, vague, or don't work. 

Examples:
_missing_ 
Watching the innovation and development of a growing team. you can start a new driver and continually improve their car, however you never really get a feel for how they are developing as a driver. (the do have quirky aspects that they have assigned to them from time to time.) But what is presented to you never changes. 
Salary- you can go from job to job, but there is no feeling of a salary (the team is much more equipped or not, however the aspect of your compensation) is missing.

_vague-
scouting sponsors, developing a team is all about looking for money. (while you do get to select between sponsors who have already made an offer, you do not get the experience of scouting and proposing/negotiating with them, (you are able to scout and negotiate with new mechanics, drivers, and designers for example) so as far as the principle or theme which your car stands for, its just sorta lost. 
-doesn't work_
physics, while running on low gas, and calculating the best time to pit (gas/weight/depleting laps/pit time) my driver was chased down by the AI which was setting better times (in the wet and on slicks) than was set in the dry for pole position, while on tires with 25% life left. (so as far as realistic expectations for your team over a career..makes it a waste of time) 
__PROS/really cool__
You literally can implement stages of growth building structures like wind tunnels, tourist centers, and/or test tracks for your team (you don't get to see the wind tunnel work, or watch your drivers on the test track, etc) 

politics- you can vote on different rule proposals for the upcoming seasons which can benefit your team, or a direction which you are more specialized, or likewise veto those changes to benefit your team. (its a vote you can win, or lose) 

several championships- you can manage many different styles of team, single seat/indy/formula one or touring cars, you can apply for these positions can get them (likewise on the other hand you can also be rejected from the position, or fired from your current post) 

non-important world interactions, you get emails from fans and are able to watch them banter back and forth about their favorite team, and results. 

As you can probably tell, I really like this game, however without those few key aspects of realism during the race, (which your career is based on) its difficult to to watch the result of something you've invested your time into caring to see the results only to have your efforts squandered a non-realistic game engine.",1596088836,1596088836,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] English review [/h1] 


Soo you are thinking of buying this game but can´t really know if is worth the money, well the short answer is yes but when it is in promotion, it tends to get it pretty often. The longer answer is also yes but with the disclaimers I'm going to give. 


Let me elaborate this game is a ""complete"" package, all it's mechanics are really intuitive, even if you aren't an aficionado in the world of motorsports like me, and its graphics hold pretty well if you are into that type off stuff (it can be pretty entertaining see the cars up close battling in the track). 

  
I say ""complete"" because this game if you still didn't saw is almost 4 years old ,by the time of this review (27/07/2020), and the sad thing is that the devs aren't supporting this game anymore, the last update was in 2017 and the game has some gamebreking bugs, fortunately I didn't experience any one of those but nonetheless some bugs. 
  

My recommendation is that if you get any gamebreking bugs and you cannot find a fix on the bugs report tab of the community hub, uninstall the game and ask for a refund as quickly as possible, don't waste your time on trying to fix the game. 

Here is the url to the bug report tab if you are too lazy or my directions are too **** for you.

Putting those problems aside what keeps the game going is the community, the workshop is littered with mods being the most popular:

And as an honourable mention: 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121868749

 

In summary I would say this game is a hidden gem in the world of management games and recently the youtuber quill did a series of this game, so if you want to know how the game really play come to that channel and see his videos.  

Here is the link for the same reasons I list before 😊 :

There are also some newer youtubers that do videos about this game that I think you should give them small peek.

[h1] Русский обзор [/h1] 

 

Итак, вы думаете о покупке этой игры, но не можете знать, стоит ли она денег, ну, в общем, короткий ответ - да, но когда она продвигается, она имеет тенденцию получать ее довольно часто. Более длинный ответ тоже да, но с оговорками, которые я собираюсь дать. 

 

Позвольте мне прояснить, что эта игра является “полным” пакетом, все ее механики действительно интуитивны, даже если вы не являетесь поклонником в мире автоспорта, как я, и ее графика держится очень хорошо, если вы любите подобные вещи ( это может быть довольно интересно видеть машины, близко сражающиеся на трассе). 

 

Я говорю «завершено», потому что к моменту обзора (27/07/20) этой игре, которую вы еще не видели, уже почти 4 года, и печально то, что разработчики больше не поддерживают эту игру Последнее обновление было в 2017 году, и в игре есть некоторые игровые ошибки, к счастью, я не столкнулся ни с одной из них, но, тем не менее, с некоторыми ошибками. 

 

Я рекомендую, чтобы, если вы получили какие-либо игровые ошибки и не смогли найти исправление на вкладке отчета об ошибках в хабе сообщества, удалите игру и попросите возмещение как можно быстрее, не тратьте свое время на исправление ошибки. Игра. 

Вот ссылка на вкладку отчета об ошибках, если вы слишком ленивы или мои указания слишком ****** для вас. 

https://steamcommunity.com/app/415200/discussions/2/ 

 

Если оставить в стороне эти проблемы, то, что движет игрой - это сообщество, семинар изобилует модами, которые являются самыми популярными

И в качестве почетного упоминания: 

  

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121868749

 

Подводя итог, я бы сказал, что эта игра - скрытая жемчужина в мире управленческих игр, и недавно youtuber quill сделал серию этой игры, так что если вы хотите узнать, как игра действительно играет, зайдите на этот канал и посмотрите его видео. 

Вот ссылка по тем же причинам, которые я перечислил ранее 😊: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33EGHWkrnsk&list=PLs3acGYgI1-ub40BCFoNEbqDIVHL5DULz 

 

Есть также несколько новых youubers, которые делают видео об этой игре, которые я думаю, вы должны дать им небольшой взгляд.

Hire/Fire staff (Designers, Race Mechanics, Pit Crew & Drivers)
Design Your car
Design new parts
Scouting
Race Management
Political voting to amend race rules
While it can get a bit repetitive doing the same thing over and over again most seasons have different race rules or tracks which alleviate the repetition.
I really have enjoyed this game going from the very bottom with a new team to the very top or getting so close to tasting the trophy and then you get fired for a few bad races where your drivers crash.

Plenty of replayability

Deep and engrossing. Thought provoking and intriguing. You will find yourself combing over the details of your team before the race, during the race and after the race. You will meet defeat many times before you find the success you seek. Often times the defeat is just a slight mismanagement. Others its because the car burst into flames while being refueled. Motorsport Manager does something other management games fail to do with me and thats keeping me coming back for me.

I did five seasons in the European Racing Series before being promoted to the Asian Pacific Series. In Five seasons I went from back of the grid to winning two Drivers Champs for my 5 Star Rookie back up driver and also winning one team champs. Now I have to start over in the APS and try to find success again. New challenges like qualifying and only top positions get points. This makes things a bit more difficult and also a lot more rewarding. 

As someone who loves to play racing sims and has a Thrustmaster TMX and T3PA Pro Pedals, this game takes sim racing to a different place. I get out of the car and get into a management role. You feel the pressure and you want to see your guys win. I give this game 8.5 out of 10 because its a solid time waster and its definitely for those who enjoy motorsports or the football manager series.

I am changing my review because in season 3 I find the game is broken, and it has been known since 2018.
There is a bug when you hire a new driver and even though their contract is to be the number 2 driver, and my previous #2 driver was signed to an extension to be #1 driver, it puts them in the wrong spots and the actual #1 driver is upset that the other driver is getting a better car and takes morale hits, and you cannot assign cars properly as the new driver will now be driving both cars etc. 
It is a mess, and though it seems like it would be a simple fix they chose not to fix it.

Improve your HQ buildings over time. Get better drivers. Get better Race Mechanics. Get a better Designer.
THEN move up to a higher tier racing series.  I started in the World, got relegated to Asia Pacific. Stayed there for 7 seasons. Now I dominate it. My cars are so fast nobody can beat me. I basically game the game now to pick which driver I want to win the race. 
Still though, I know that my buildings in HQ aren't at the peak level yet, so I'm going to continue to dominate the middle (lower) tier race league/series until all of my HQ buildings are upgraded to their max level. THEN I'll move up to the World (F1) level.
I save a lot now, where I didn't before, I regret not saving more often before I figured out I should do that.  I was just trying to play through and have a perfect game the first time.  I did not have a good time.
Now that I understand the grind, I'll never start another new team again. I'm sticking with this team until my dude is forced to retire, my team owner dies, or I win the World Championship. 
Then, I'm going to uninstall.  

Once you figure out HOW to win, it's simply grinding through each race (waiting for cars to make  trips around the tracks.) for your result.
The game has some bugs, but not terrible or life ending.
There are some errors and inconsistencies within the mechanics compared to IRL, of course they did the best they could with a game vs. Real Life. Some things in balancing the cars don't make sense and are counter intuitive to RL. So, if you're an F1 or open wheel racing fan, you're brain is going to struggle a little with how they do the mechanics of the game to figure out your car's optimal set up. Once you get used to the game's mechanics, you're good.
The game uses sliders and clicks to adjust speed, handling, and downforce. Also tire Pressure and Camber. (These don't work the way you think they do like in RL.) EVERYTHING affects your overall speed and handling of the car, also based on the Driver's stats. 
The first thing you should do when you start the game is shitcan your starting Designer, go shopping for a nobody who's not on  any team that's got more Stars rating than the one you start with. Use that person for a LONG time. They'll be fine, even when the game asks you to upgrade that person. Just stick with them for a long time. (unless you have money to burn, which you won't when you start.)
SCOUT, SCOUT, SCOUT new drivers from Day One. I can't stress this enough.
You want to scoop up the 5 Star Potential drivers who aren't on teams. Get them young, pay them nothing until they start winning. 
Pro Tip: Your Car's ability to haul A s s is superior to your Driver's ability to drive it. However, your driver will make the most out of the aspects of the car.  
Right now, and for many seasons, my cars have been better than my drivers. That's the winning factor for me and has been consistent. 
Never Auto anything. The AI/CPU will screw up your set up every time.  (my experience so far, regardless of how good your car ""should"" be. Take the Practices, and Take the Qualifying. Nail it. Win on Sunday.

Also, starting with a horrible team and just getting a big bag of money didn't do it for me. There's so much trial and error in getting the right people on board, and then you don't actually feel the difference, even though you spent like 1 hour before the race.

There's more entertainment value here than accuracy, not least of which because they don't have the licences for the various series and racetracks they're trying to emulate. That doesn't detract from the fun of the game, though. The races are usually fast and furious, rarely becoming dull unless your car is vastly superior (and even if it is, there's no guarantee it will stay that way for more than a year or two).

You can play in up to three types of racing series (open-seaters, GT cars and endurance racers) which all have promotion and relegation incorporated. On top of participating in all of the races, you can also vote for future regulation changes. Such regulation changes can fundamentally alter your race strategy (refuelling allowed or banned, very limited sets of tyres or tyre compounds, amongst others) when they take effect. For me, this adds variety where a series may have otherwise got stale.

The driver ratings are what you'd roughly expect, but the driver preferences can make someone really stand out. For instance, a driver might be a good race day driver, or love chasing other cars, adding modifiers to their ratings in a given situation. Some preferences are purely on-track while others are off-track. Some are temporary, others are permanent. It really gives drivers a unique personality instead of just some driver with a list of ratings.

Most of the racing looks good and plays well, but I don't think the AI race strategy is as good as it could be. There are certainly some oddities in some of their pit stop decisions, as you will no doubt find when you play the game. It would also have been better if they could add collisions between multiple cars instead of just one car going off the track at a time for any given incident.

My cars were the worst in the grid. Saturday qualifying, I get 19th and 20th. It's over I tell myself.

Sunday race, I see that it will start raining in the first lap, half the cars in the grid are with dry tyres. I put up intermediates. In the first lap, my drivers speed through many with dry tyres, including three that realized their mistakes and pitted. I push my tyres to the limit and this helps me get past even other drivers with wet tyres.

Near the end of the race, 1st driver is in 5th and 2nd is in 10th.

The second driver has 2 of smoothness and will not be able to finish the race with only 1 pit as almost everyone else. I realize the track becomes dry in the last couple laps. I time my pit stop perfectly to put up softs and again, push my tires to the max. The 2nd driver goes from 10th to 16th and back to 10th against the drivers with wet tyres, I consider this a huge win.

Meanwhile, the 1st driver is saving everything he can from the tyres and still manages to get past the 4th when pushing the engine with leftover fuel. Somehow, the 3rd place has mechanical problems and has to pit.

The tires will always last the same amount per lap no matter what track it is. (The softest set you're given, 5% per lap deg, the next softest, 4%, The hardest, 3%, Inters and wets 5%) - Know this and you'll know instinctively when to pit and how to do the perfect strategy every time. This game often feels more of a maths game than a sports one, there's none of the uncertainty and chance like you get with real motor-racing.

The driver feedback becomes a tad mundane too. During practice sessions, you will have to constantly guess what the driver wants to change to the car when he says you have ""the wrong aero set up"" or ""The speed is wrong"". The drivers will demand to pit on the last lap of a race because the tyres are worn, or question why they don't have enough fuel to get the end when racing in a series with a restricted fuel tank size and refuelling at every pit stop. This sound like minor gripes but you'll encounter them at every race, time and time again. 

There is good here too though. The modding community is great and can greatly benefit the experience and I also loved the politics system where the rules of a racing series can change by popular consensus.

There are some good points and if effort was made in a few very important quality-of-life tweaks it could be a much better experience after a few hours. I completed 4 full seasons and will probably only play again if there's a big update or a sequel.

Which makes zero sense. You cant repair cars during the race, refuel cars. Parts don't wear out the way that they do or have such a terrible life span. Because parts wear out at a seriously insane rate, every race you have to pit to fix your stuff. Basically dooming you to finish last. I understand that there's supposed to be a challenge and all, but the game makes it seriously impossible. One of the reviews the game got was that they are clearly lovers of racing.

Pros:

Great Gameplay
Good for Management Simulation Fans
Awesome Visuals both 2D and 3D Mode

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game for the motorsport enthusiast in general, in the base game you only have the option to play the single-seater categories (F3, F2 and finally F1), since SEGA doesn't have the rights to use the FIA branding, what I did it's to use a workshop creation that includes the FIA calendar and F1 teams, and I recommend all players utilize it, you will get the F1 teams (Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, etc..) and real drivers for all categories. 
Now let´s talk about the gameplay in general, the main premise of the game is to be a Team Principal of a Motorsport Team, you will have objectives laid out for you by the chairman and that's your starting point. As a team principal, you have the power to fire/hire drivers, build new parts for you car throughout the season, manage your pit crew, manage your staff (designer and race mechanics) witch each one has stats that can grow, also you can upgrade the HQ that allows you to build parts quicker, generate more income, improve your drivers' stats, but keep in mind these upgrades costs a lot of your season budget, at the beginning of each season the chairman will give you an objective (finish 6,4 or 3) in the championship standings selecting one of them gives you more cash but also gives you more pressure to reach said objectives. Now let's get to the racing, well you don't you only have an overview camera of the race, you can manage throughout the race your fuel and tires, manage pit stops and race strategies, and there is your replayability, every race is different and every track has it's peculiarities, some will favor cars that have a more developed gearbox, others will favor cars that are keener on aerodynamics and braking, but in my experience during the race the only thing that matters it's the part degradation, as some tracks require more of you gearbox, and other require more of your front wing (that part will wear down more quickly) the performance will factor less IMO. 
You have two options when beginning your career mode, you can create your own team and start from the bottom all the way up, managing your finances, drivers, and staff from F3 to F1 (I think this is the way to play) or start with an already established team and manage to reach the goals set for you and try to win a Championship.

When starting a new career mode, you can select your background, being an ex-driver or ex-engineer, in a nutshell, this game has very deep gameplay in managing your resources, and strategies, for the racing enthusiast it's a great game, I can't talk much about the DLCs for this game, which brings endurance racing and GT series, but I deeply recommend this game.

Emails, pop ups, mandatory things, all help you stay in the mix. this has been my biggest relief, as there are so many systems i was afraid id forget to assign a researcher or something and not realize it for 2 weeks - the game doesnt try to ""trick"" you into making a frigging clerical error. if you forget to set a research project the guy will email you asking what you want him to work on. 

The game is massive and complex, but FUN and ultimately, the designers are *on your side* trying to help you get the most out of this game. F1 is hard enough - the devs are trying to do their best to help you manage all the many many pieces of your team bc they clearly want you to fall in love with F1 and the game.

The UI is frustration incarnate.  Critical information is provided with simplistic graphs and bars when hard numbers are needed.  Often handing off the busy-work decisions to the game (pit crew management, pre-race car setup) is not just sub-optimal, it is quite literally the worst decision you can make.  The pre-race car tuning is stymied by the fact that you cannot see all of your smiley faces data points at once.  Yes, smiley faces are used to communicate car tuning specs.

That might be the first time I can find the words to explain a video game. First off this adds the depth and interactive capabilities of a Soccer / Football manager. Honestly, if you are a fan of any sort of motorsport whether it be GT or Formula 1 I would highly recommend this game.

I would suggest if you're just starting this game start with the lowest tier and additionally a lower tier team to add additional challenge. Practices are encouraged as they set your drivers up for the best success but just a forewarning *YOU PLAY NO PART IN THE RACE* Other than determining their fuel consumption, how aggressive they drive, and when / how they pit. You are the manager so you are in charge of the finances, which HQ upgrades you should perform, and which parts should be made.

Overall this game has great potential, you can scout drivers, enlist a great pit crew, and if you listened to my advice have a tough journey ahead of you moving up to Formula 1. If I were you, I would look on this game for sale if you get the chance but if you're truly passionate about the sport I think this is a fair price to pay for such a complete game.",1588921631,1588921631,True,6,0,0.588631212711334229,0,True,False,False

Balance issues on the AI side though, seems like even in lower ranking series AI teams can pick up drivers and staff that they shouldn't have access to.

If you're starting from the bottom it is very difficult to progress but the game does allow you to use politics to tip things in your favor early on that can make you an unstoppable force. I have yet to leave the ERS and already have a road car factory and all the buildings except for theme part to at least level 1, a few at level 2 and design center and factory at level 3.

Tips: Always look for drivers with marketability at 90% or above early on. Those matter more than stats and their ability to win races. While at bottom series, if a vote is coming up to make certain components spec, save votes for it. It will save you millions a year in part production. Also, first few seasons the game will give you crap pit crew, it will be difficult to find any good designers/mechanics/drivers.

The game is actually beautifully thought out with a long and arduous road ahead if you want to build a team from scratch and fight your way to the top. Having to not only manage the teams finances but also decide whether you want to risk upsetting your 'star' driver who might only have a couple of years left before retiring by not giving him the upgrades vs giving the young gun who might be with your team for years to come is a lot more difficult than it should be. Since you can only build 1 engine or gearbox or one of any upgrade at a time this is definitely a tough decision. 

The overall feel is actually a lot more complete than I was expecting. The ability to look at data, to see (post-race) exactly when teams pitted ahead of you, how long their stint was, allowing you to think about the future chassis to get the most out of the tyres while also having to balance long tyre life against not simply being slow. All in all they've managed to reflect what it would be like to start out with a brand new team in motorsport to an annoyingly high level. It's only annoying because I hate not winning all the time. But where's the fun in jumping into a winning team? There's no real success there.

Basically, I would say get this game. It's absolutely worth it. The mods are also worth looking at, some incredible work on those, too. Having the F1 mod playing on one save and a base game on another is quite a bit of fun and offers two very different challenges.

And Sega, if you're reading this (which you're not, obviously), F1 needs money right now. Go get a license and I'm sure people would flock to this game in even higher numbers!",1587021247,1587021247,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Not in the basic strategy or mechanics of the game (those are pretty straight forward), but the subtle nuances that you MUST master in order to be successful. Strategies for tire wear, fuel consumption and pit choices are not obvious. You'll fail many times (entire seasons even) until you understand the ""not so obvious"" cues needed make each crucial decision to win (or even be competitive) in each race. I can't count how many times i lost a race simply because I ran out of gas or my tires wore out on the LAST lap. The same goes for managing the race team - if you don't place, you don't earn much money, and if you don't make money you can't improve your car or facilities...and the snowball effect begins towards getting fired. It's not to say the game is bad, it's just HARD. So, if you're into into the strategy behind racing (and sports management games in general), this may be for you. If you really want a challenge from the start, you can do like I did by building a team from scratch right away - whew, the grind is REAL!.

I like the graphics and the detail in the graphs and charts available to help make decisions.  There is no question that the creators spent time thinking about how to show all the data available.

However, once you get past the surface you have a game that is a bit obscure to the player.  Nothing felt intuitive.  I found that the computer controlled cars could get away with things that seemed impossible.  Often in a race I'd watch computer control cars get 4-5 laps more out of their tires.  I'll admit that my cars were horrible so I was pushing the tires more, but that many laps felt unrealistic.  Pit stops were often far too chancy as mistakes are both costly and random.

But it is fun, and as you have time to improve your car, your racing gets more interesting.  Its just the steep learning curve and the way that a new or poorly outfitted team is just not competitive that makes the game a bit frustrating at time.",1585050011,1585050011,True,5,1,0.539459168910980225,0,True,False,False

As an F1 fan of many years I bought the game when it was first published, on the strength of early reviews. I was skeptical but, despite some early flaws, it turned out to be a truly thrilling ride. Patches and DLCs added to the fun (though I stuck to open seat, F3, F2 and F1 championships).
I played it to death, then played it again with Flaming Red's excellent Rebirth mod, which added all manner of tweaks and extras, turning the game into something more challenging with many more options to choose. Eventually, as with all things, I stopped playing, though always in the hope that Playsport would add new updates or, preferably, release MM2 for PC.

No sign of that happening atm, but recently something made me take another look. I reinstalled it, added the Fire18 mod for variation, and boy, am I blown away! This game really offers so much to anyone interested in motorsports. There's so much to think about, from managing your staff and drivers, hiring new people, managing money, developing your cars, drivers, mechanics, designer and HQ, to dealing with thrills of the races, plus practice and qualifying. And lots more!
It is just so much fun!

A few little anomalies still, like one F3 driver still regularly winning races at age 63(!) and lately my sponsors have tended to offer me few upfront cash deals, but these are not gamebreaking by any means and actually force me to think and plan more carefully about my decisions.

There's a persistent storyline that I also love. I started with my own team in F3, had two reasonably good seasons but then my drivers and development suffered and I was sacked in season 3. But that's not the end. When you lose your job, new offers come in. I accepted an offer to manage a better team, with more money and resources - but possible higher demands from the company CEO. I made sweeping changes, sacked two mechanics and both current drivers and hired more. Two more seasons saw my team promoted to F2. Hooray!
Now the real challenges arrive. Far more demanding, but with a well-developed HQ, two excellent young drivers still improving, and sponsors showing more interest, I'm nearing the end of my first season with high hopes of finishing second or third, and possibly even the championship.

I'd love to see a Motorsport Manager 2 but in the meantime this game continues to challenge and entertain  and then some! I'm 60. Always been a gamer, and always loved F1, with no great interest in other sports. 792 hours played means this game stands as one of my all time faves.

Anyway, let's start with the many negatives:

1) the game doesn't factor-in all the variables it claims should really matter, like a driver's rating for example, which doesn't matter in the slightest, since it all comes down to the RNG and how you manage the drivers during a race

2) another major issue I immediately noticed was that the AI don't seem to have any signifiant reliability issues, at least nothing they had to fix during a race, whilst I constantly had these kind of issues. Also, the AI could easily keep the same pace on a fully wet track with worn slick tyres as I could with Intermediates or Wet tyres. It just doesn't really affect them.

3) there's a large number of minor issues; the AI drivers not slowing down when blue-flagged, sudden and dramatic drops in realiability, pointless HQ buildings that have no significant effect on the gameplay, artifical rubberbanding that completely negates the player's efforts, a fuel system that poorly and unrealistically matches tyre wear, etc. 

I think the developers took a whole bunch of short-cuts, the game just doesn't really do what it claims: you are lead to think that you are a manager, but instead it's the combination of heavy RNG (in some areas) and pre-programmed paths (in other areas) that largely decide the outcome, not your actions as a gamer.


The positives then;
#1. The game is very unique, personally I haven't seen any other game with this exact type of content and gameplay

#2. The overall quality is very good; the micro-macro management level is neither too complex nor too simplistic, the graphics are excellent, I had no technical issues running the game, the presentation is very good, the user interface felt intuitive, it's super-easy to add user mods, etc.

#3. Despite its many flaws, the game still felt very addicting to play. Lowering the AI difficulty level made the game feel more fair as well, since it evened ut some of the issues I experienced

On a side-note or ""tip"", starting out with a low-ranked team is actually much harder than starting out with a mid-or top ranked team.

The management aspects of the game are middle of the field - not too basic, and not too micromanaged. Some options can be set to minimize some of the more tedious aspects you may not like, and mods exist that customize the game in a way you might prefer.

On race day, you direct your pilots to attack or back off - balancing between tire temps, component wear & tear, and fuel usage. You also choose when to pit, and with two cars on the track per team, you need to manage it so they don't come in at the same time. Multiple tire compounds, in-season component development, staff recruiting (mechanics, designers, pit crew, drivers), politics (rules changes and voting), and fixed budgets/sponsorships all need to be managed to win.

It's the same fundamental idea as other sports management games, the aim is to win - or at least get results and make enough money to build towards a championship winning team. You're tasked with hiring drivers, engineers, mechanics, selecting sponsors, and developing a winning strategy on race day. 

_________________________
TL;DR

- In-depth game mechanics give you complete control over a race team. Manage drivers, staff, sponsorships, and strategy.

- Procedurally generated drivers and staff, plus ever evolving rules and regulations offer seemingly endless campaigns.

- Strong mod support with countless realistic editions, and various gameplay tweaks. 

- Excellent race-day simulation, where managing your tyres and fuel can make or break your race.

_________________________
LONG VERSION:

If you choose to take the reigns of an existing front runner, you must achieve results or risk losing your job. For a more in-depth challenge, create a team from scratch and fight your way to the front of the grid by developing your cars and employees into race winners. Don't disappoint your boss, or run the bank dry in the process, and you can keep playing forever. As drivers and staff get old and retire, the game procedurally generates new drivers and staff to scout and hire. With 3 main types of racing (Formula, GT, & Prototype) consisting of different rules and regulations, there's plenty of variety to be had. 

Leading up to race day it's up to you to find the setup sweet spot, which varies from race to race and track to track, by adjusting the sliders for aero, suspension, tyre pressures etc. Use practice and qualifying to your advantage or simulate the sessions to let the AI take control. The setup can be the difference between fighting for a podium, or scrapping for the last points scoring position, so having a good setup is key. Keep an eye on your tyre bank too, if you use all of your softer compound rubber it could hurt your race day strategy.

Before each race you have a chance to tweak the setup, and plot out your ultimate strategy based on grid position. Starting at the front is your best chance at scoring a win, but if you play your cards right, a surprise podium from the back isn't out of the question. You have complete control over the fuel and tyre strategy, and how much to push or conserve as you manage tyre wear and fuel loads. If your cars' reliability isn't great, or they receive damage during the race, you also need to manage repairs - is it quicker to pit early and make up lost ground, or stretch it to the next pit stop and hope it doesn't get worse? Don't forget about weather or Safety Cars, both can ruin your strategy, but if you react quickly enough they can give you an advantage over the competition.

Overall a very in-depth and impressive game, that has very little to complain about. Outside of minor bugs and glitches that usually don't impact playability, the game runs smoothly. Great mod support, with various realistic editions, or tweaks to the gameplay mechanics, there's endless fun to be had. Ideal for anyone that thinks they can do it better than Ferrari.",1574851061,1574851061,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Simply put it's the best racing management game in store. Started this game 'cause I suck at racing games. Spent 80+ hours in one of the worst team and it took me 4 seasons to get a genius driver and win the championship. Great fun until I was promoted to a better series which made the team trash again, so I just quit. 

The Good: The races are actually exciting. I have seen my driver retired due to mechanical issue in the second to last lap. I have seen my driver overtook at the final corner in the final lap with 12% tire and won the GP. This game just begs for a playback or recording function. 

The bad: It's a 2016 game so most likely they won't add new things to the game. New content can deplete fast like every other simulation game. And finally, it's really hard to win any race with no money in your pocket, just like real life.",1574571546,1574571546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have so many different aspects that you have to manage both on and off the track. On the track, you have to manage tire temperatures, tire wear, and fuel consumption. Your tire temps can be managed by pushing harder or being more conservative. Lay back and your tires cool down and wear slower. Push harder, and your tire temps raise and your tires wear quicker. Even weather impacts how your tires heat up and cool down. At the same time, pushing hard also causes your tires to wear quicker, while driving more conservatively causes them to wear out at a slower rate. The same goes with managing your engine. You can push harder to go faster and use more fuel. You can tune the engine back to extend your fuel range. How hard you push your engine and drive the car also impacts how the car wears throughout the race. If you are constantly in push mode, your brakes will wear our quicker. On the contrary, if you constantly have the engine in overtake or high mode, your engine will wear out quicker.

And that's just the things you manage on the track. Not to mention things you have to manage off the track, which also impact your on the track performance.

I guess what I'm trying to say here is if you have a good understanding of how motorsports and racing work and have ever wanted to manage a team, then this is the game... er, simulator for you. I'm an ex-sim racer myself, so it's refreshing to take off the helmet and manage a team as a manager and watch my drivers perform.",1574434407,1574434407,True,1,0,0.525316417217254639,0,True,False,False

That is that you have played like 80 hours the game just becomes kinda dull and boring because you know it very well and you can easily manage any team.

I'm nearing the end of my fifth season of a create your own team play through and just snagged my second ever win in the European Championship. I wanted to share the story. This game has me completely hooked.

Guildford. Race 7 out of 11. Prior to the race I had signed a new driver as Bjorn Bjelland was completely failing me. While my primary driver Aguado had a few podiums and even a win in the season opener, Bjorn was way off the pace, and his stats were declining rapidly. I brought in 17 year old Belgian Delcour, despite him not being a pay driver and having 90% marketability instead of 100%.

Sunday comes and its pouring. Everyone is going with inters and i figure I probably should too. The AI decision making is on realistic so when I go on a different script to them I tend to get punished. I figure - at least play it safe with Delcour. He's starting on pole thanks to reverse grids and he's in the third best car in the championship. Anyway I start Delcour on inters. Meanwhile Aguado is sent out with wets and starts from 19th. The game actually warned me that I was starting on the wrong tyre but I risk all!

The race starts and Delcour gets away well and leads from the dreadful Predators. Aguado meanwhile can't cling onto the back of the field and is losing several seconds every lap. He asks for inters. The rain though, is belting down.

End of lap 3 or 4 and its time to bring in Delcour for wets (he's leading by a few seconds). The stop goes well and he gets back out in front of everyone. Everyone that is, except Aguado who hammers by on the bit straight a full 5 seconds clear of the now 2nd placed Delcour. I almost jumped out of my seat! My gamble, for now at least, had paid off.

The race continues and my undeveloped forecasting system is really proving a problem. When exactly will the rain subside and the track dry up? Just how much will it dry? I'm not sure if I should save tyres and fuel with Aguado and try for a 2 stopper, or push hard and end up on a 3 stopper like I predict the rest of the field will. Delcour is 5 seconds back. 3rd place another 5 or so behind him. I wait until the last possible lap to pit Aguado and opt for inters. The track is starting to dry but wont be ideal good for inters for about 2-3 laps. It's time for him to drive the wrong tyre again! The pit crew execute and he's pushing super hard on the wrong tyres waiting for the sun to dry the track. Delcour pits a number of laps later and takes on inters as well. Just like before, Aguado manages to return to first and the gap is yet again about five seconds.

From here we drive for a while. The drivers start to push hard as we see the track will fully dry before the tyres are worn out. The track drys FAST and I suddenly realise that my drivers are way too close together to pit on the same lap. I can't afford to stack them. I agonise over what to do and ultimately pit the 2nd placed Delcour. I give him softs and the full 13 laps of fuel to complete the remaining 14. Aguado on the other hand has to do his thing for the third time this race and drive the wrong tyre for the conditions. Inters on a track with just a fraction of water. At some point there is no spray behind his car. His pace still looks okay. He comes in for super softs.

Out he goes again. Once again he hits the lead with a good few seconds buffer in front of his team mate. The pit crew are 6/6. Five of the stops were fast.

From there I conserve fuel and tyres for the next 13 laps. 3rd place is gaining but I maintain a decent gap which never falls below 4 seconds. With three laps to go 3rd starts to drop off. Then, as I'm crossing the line for my first ever 1-2 finish, almost the entire field runs out of fuel.

Cherry on top is that it was a home race for my English team, Midlands Motorsport. And on top of that, a 3x home sponsor bonus for a cool $1,800,000.

This race was incredible and I'm so thankful to this game and it's developers for organically providing entirely unscripted excitement like this. What a masterpiece of design. The race itself, combined with the narrative elements of a new untested driver at the team's home race was magical for me.

While writing this out the strategy seemed to work perfectly like a master crafted watch. But in reality is was nail-biting, frenzied and chaotic from when the lights went out to when the chequered flag fell.

415200,55663588,76561198007746796,0,34,15806,0,7136,1598725273,"OK so while I recommend this game, there are a few things that the developer really needs to work on in an update or 2nd version. Having said that, this is the best racing sim/manager game yet, and as there are no competitors, I do recommend it if you like F1, racing, or sim/management games. I am into my 5th season having started in F3 and being fired in my 2nd season, taking over a F2 team, got promoted to F1 and survived my first F1 season and now having some success. So onto the things that spoil this game. I say spoil and not ruin, because you can live with them...I list them from most annoying to least annoying:
 Pit crew management, completely unrealistic to the real thing. I cannot imagine that any F1,2 or 3 team are constantly switching out their crew, who are suffering ""fatigue"" from race to race. Seriously it's as if a 5 year old came up with this idea. Rather replace with a training option that affects morale of your team.
Injuries: I have not had a season yet where one of my drivers have had an 8 week ""neck inury"". Seriously wth, drivers very rarely get injured, if they do it's due to a crash, and it happens perhaps one out of 5 seasons. Look back at the current drivers and see how many races they have missed due to minor injuries.
Race mechanics: My driver gets off to a great start only to drive straight into the back of another car, only for cars behind to stream past, going from 10th to 18th in one section. Or come out of the pits and have the car behind simply hit you and stop. 
Practice: I get that the developer tried to make it hard to perfect your race/qualy setup, but there could be a much better way of doing it and having the full Practice sessions like in real racing, if the players want it. Really hurts the realism to have one 12 minute practice. 
Weather: Heavy downpours followed by bright sun, by the time you pit it's changed back again, not realistic at all and extremely annoying.
Pointless press interviews with no imagination or genuine consequences that you worry about.
Rule changes: I save up my votes to avoid serious changes that can affect your game badly, like switching to Top 6 only scoring points etc. When you're a small team that really struggles to get into the top 10, when you have the race of your life then don't get a point for finishing 7th, it can ruin the whole game (I got fired for not reaching my target when points for 7th would have taken me into 8th in the championship, my target was 9th)

Other than these annoying problems, which could mostly be fixed rather easily I would think (the race mechanics I realise must be hard to get right) the game is very good and worth it on sale for 40% off at the least.

The principal mechanic is setting-up the cars before each race and controlling driver speed and pit strategies during it.  Getting those right *should* result in good results, which attract sponsors with more money, which means you can improve your team and car more.  Repeat. 
 Unfortunately, both vehicle setup and race strategy are so laughably basic and the game cheats to such an extent that you might as well not bother but pray to RNGesus.  Does everything it can to destroy any sense that you're in control of anything.

It also appears as if the race graphics and the vehicle modelling are on completely different timers so it's not uncommon for a car to, say, suddenly accelerate from several hundred metres back and overtake you in five or six seconds, only to then sit just in front of you because the 'model' has just updated and decided that that car should be winning.  At the same time you will probably overtake a car or two every race without ever seeing it.  No, you didn't pass it in the pit lane or while it had run wide, it simply wasn't drawn.  Now the cheat-engine has decided it should be behind you, not in front, so it has teleported it there.

Off-track, tired pit crew recover energy if you rotate them so they can miss a race or two.  Fine, but how come they don't recover at all if there's a month between races?  Whereas contract negotiations and some other things are, more sensibly, calculated by the day there are several examples of half-arsed programming shortcuts/omissions like this everywhere.  It's just very sloppy.

Lack of research or even interest, lazy programming and RNG instead of calculation are apparent throughout the system.  It's such a pity because the idea is great, the presentation is nice and even with the cheating and RNG the races can be exciting.  Presumably they knew they wouldn't sell more copies by making it good, so they didn't bother.

Ont the other hand, the tracks are fairly good-looking, for a management sim, and I have played for 130+ hours, so it's not a complete waste of money.

Edit:  No, I played another 30-odd hours and once the bugs cut in - can't use reserve driver in first car and can't swap drivers between cars, can't fit new components to cars, etc.  the game just becomes completely unplayable.

Sadly, the mobile games get new iterations and the new features for the PC version seem to have stopped, even as DLC. Compared to MM3, the most recent mobile version, I'm just really missing some features, especially the Youth Driver's Programme. The desktop version just generates some new drivers every year without any input from the player. Still, I'd recommend this, if you're into manager games. Be sure to save your setups for every track, saves you some time after a few seasons.

EDIT: It had been a while since I last played the game. Mostly played the base game. I like the DLCs, but in terms of bugs, the game has become worse than I remember. I have a driver who I can't pick for practice for some reason. Meanwhile, my first driver is complaining that her car is worse than the second driver's, despite having the vastly superior one. The workaround: Promote the Reserve Driver to 1st, then promote the new Reserve Driver (formerly 1st) to 2nd, then promote new new Reserve Driver (formerly 2nd) to 1st. You end up with the same line-up, only number 1 and 2 are switched. The real beauty: since you have to demote every driver once, you'll take a 40% morale hit. This really shouldn't be an issue for a production this big.

I know and have empathy for the fact that the devs aren't made of money (they said a while ago that MM2 isn't a thing yet because they don't have the funds for it).

Good
- Based on real-life racing series and tracks
- UI is clear and easy to navigate
- No bugs / performance issues

Bad
- Game play is repetitive after the first few hours
- Optimal strategy is easy to discover, and it gets boring
- Insufficient sound effects. Too much text reading

The content (series, cars, tracks) in Motorsport Manager are fictional yet easily recognizable to a racing fan. For example most tracks would have a [i]very[/i] similar layout, although a few corners are different. Dominant teams are represented as fictional teams with similar color scheme. I guess this is an easy way to get them in without the legal cost.

The game is mostly what it says, you negotiate contracts with drivers, designers and mechanics. You're also the race strategist, and you can manage the drivers by telling them when to push and when to save fuel & tires.

As a 100% strategy game, however, it fails to create replay value. For example the optimal way to find car setups is exactly the same regardless of car, track, weather or tires. It quickly becomes a routine for every new race, and it gets boring very quickly. Not to mention, the effect on car setups is completely arcade and does not even remotely match what it'll do in real life.

Most other aspects of the game follows the same routine: hire better people ==> develop HQ ==> get a better car ==> get better results ==> get better sponsors ==> repeat.

Good:
- The graphics and sound are decent
- Easy to understand, even if you do not watch motorsports or understand cars... It's a management game, not a simulator.
- Good game if you need to pause and walk away, or if you can only play for 30 minutes. 
- Addictive... You make your numbers bigger then start to do well, then repeat until you win everything.

Bad:
- Necessary info is not found on certain screens with no way to go back.  I find myself needing to write down critical info which the game should provide with glorious spreadsheets.  (When choosing tires to take, you can't see how long they will last.  When loading a car setup, you can't see what track you are on.  Ect.)
- The car setup loading screen is terrible.  You can't sort and have to manually delete old setups.  It's a minor annoyance which you will encounter every single race.
- The A.I./simulation is terrible.  Cars won't pass each other at the start, when coming out of the pits, or when rejoining, they just rear-end each other without a crash.
- Can not watch videos on another monitor while running this game without encountering stuttering in game.  This doesn't happen with any other games I own to my knowledge.

First, I must say that this is one of the few games nowadays where I have the clear impression that the developers actually sat down and thought through how to create a great game that gives its players a very positive experience rather than sitting down wondering how to make quick buck with little effort. The biggest + of the game is that it offers a pretty realistic management simulation of your own racing team and challenges you in the same way F1 (or whatever series you choose to operate in) managers are challenged in reality. There is a variety of stuff you can do that influence your success such as building your chassis, designing new parts for your cars, expanding your headquarters (to design better parts, improve your scouting of other drivers or help your own workers improve), hiring drivers, mechanics, engineers and your boxing crew. There are also frequent possible rule changes that you can vote for or against which can dramatically alter your series. The level of realism is pretty well chosen, the game is fairly indepth and further realism would probably reduce the overall game quality due to overcomplexity. 

Let's start with cars, they consist of a chassis and 6 different parts, each devoted to a certain aspect of a track: Engine (top speed), suspension (medium speed corners), front wing (low speed corners), rear wing (high speed corners), gearbox (acceleration), and brakes (guess what). All of these parts have 2 values, one for how good it is, and one for how reliable it is. The chassis of the car holds 4 values, which determine the heating of your tyres, the efficiency of fuel usage, the improvability of the car and the tyre consumption.

Each race track is different (obviously), although all? of them seem to be similar to real life tracks, for example Yokohama is oddly similar to Suzuka, although most likely different enough to evade licensing problems. Different tracks challenge different parts of the car in different manner, meaning being good at these will give you an edge, and having low reliability could result in an additional stop because the part is at risk of breaking. Furthermore, the tracks also show you tyre and fuel consumption, predicted weather, and during sessions, the traction of the track as well as the projected weather.

Knowing about cars and tracks, we shall head to the actual sessions, starting with training. This is actually my biggest criticism of this game because it gets boring really quickly and once you've figured out what to do is basically just a grind. You can choose between two different stints (either a qualifying stint of 1, 2 or 3 laps, or a race stint of 4, 8 or 12 laps). While doing these, your drivers give you feedback about the setup of the car, which you can then improve the next time they pit. Also, you can perks for each stint you do as well as the tyre you do it on, and the goal is basically to get to level 3 on all of them during the session, as before the qualifying and the race, you have to choose 2 perks that your drivers will use during the race, and the level 3 perks give you 15% improvement of the car either overall depending on stint or depending on the tyre. To be honest I do not really like this system because it is grindy and actually forces you do to stuff that makes no sense. If it rains during the training, you will still go out on soft/medium if you know you will use them during the race, because the intermediate/heavy wet perk holds no benefit then. It will take longer to get to level 3 if you are for example on a soft tyre and it rains, but it is still the better solution. You can save your setups to use them again next year, although they will not be exactly as good unless your car remains unchanged, which it hopefully will not.

My suggestions for training would be to grant you all perks you unlock without having to choose them (same for the perk your mechanics give you, they should also be available all the time without choosing), and training should actually be a bit closer to reality rather than grinding out the level 3 perks. What I mean by that? It should be about checking how long the tyres last as well as the difference in tyres in terms of lap times. Since this could potentially end up a bit boring (perhaps the reason the devs chose not to do it?), I suggest having this simulated without graphics, just as if you're simulating the pre-seasons tests or the training itself. This way, it would consume fewer real life time and you could easily have 3 FP sessions rather than only one, since it wouldn't be actually played and drawn out. So basically, you decide your stints, game simulates results, you get results, adjust for next session, and so on. Should be pretty quick and could end up less repetitive than the actual way it works right now.

Qualifying sessions here we come! As mentioned, I use Fire Fantasy 19, where just like in reality, there are 3 qualifying sessions. Qualifying is well done and fairly realistic, one has to watch out for quick weather changes and whether the track gains traction, potentially leading to your own drivers having to go out for another lap. The only thing I don't get here is that the drivers do an outlap (which is fine, getting tyres and brakes into a good temperature), then go for their qualifying lap, but then, they always do an inlap and pit. They do not do that in real life and I haven't found out yet why this is the case. Usually, they stay out, use another lap to get into the temperature window again and then try again. I think you should have the option to either do the outlap as they do it now (obviously they can't just turn around and pit the wrong way), but also to keep them outside to save time and go for another quick lap. One other thing that bothers me a bit is that you cannot see a track's pit stop delta, for some reason. This would be super important though because it'll make it easier for you to choose whether to use a single or double pit strategy. It goes hand in hand with my suggested changes for training, because you cannot really find out the differences of the tyres either, because you're too busy getting your perks ready. There should also be a projected tyre wear from Pirelli, and training should improve the accuracy of this estimate. The reason why I repeat this in the qualifying section is because just last week we've seen the top teams (except Ferrari :() start Q2 with medium tyres because it would pay off at the race due to their higher wear. In this game it's hard to take this decision because you lack information to do so. Nevertheless, this is a really small issue and barely touches the fun of the game, and it's GREAT FUN!

Last but not least, the race. Here, you can decide how your drivers should drive in terms of power/fuel consumption as well as tyre wear. You decide when they box, which tyres they start on (unless you're locked due to reaching Q1 as in real life), you decide how much fuel to start the race with, and you can also decide that one driver should let the other one pass. The only thing you cannot do is order driver 2 to let driver 1 one pass to win the race in Russia and then complain that Valtt.., I mean driver 2, hasn't won a race in so long. You can view the race either from a sort of helicopter 3D angle or 2D top-down, I chose 3D because it's beautiful and pretty cool to watch. There is a great variety of potential decisions you have to take that make the game fairly realistic and also fun. Tyre wear, safety car, weather changes or the general race circumstances may require constant thinking and adaptation.

Jump right into the game running the most successful team in F1, or create your own team from scratch. Design your car at the beginning of the season using parts from sponsors, who are based on your success from the previous year. Sign deals with sponsors to get money either just for showing up to the race or bigger payouts for placing higher than the sponsor expects. Sign staff, drivers, and pit crew to give you the edge in designing and on race day. Decide the outcome of dilemmas as situations arise during the season. For example, my driver asked me if he should marry his girl. I told him to do it. Soon after he was divorced and suffered a focus penalty. I was only trying to help!

Race day is really something. You can practice and set your car's performance by adjusting things like gear ration and downforce.  Your drivers will also become more in-touch with the car setup which will give them an advantage on raceday. Watch the race from above or get down in the action with 3d mode. Decide when to pit the car and what to do during the stops. Should I add fuel or just change my tires? Should I put on soft tires that last longer or super soft to get a performance boost?

I'm addicted to this game just running F1, and now i can run GT and Endurance as well.

I liked the idea of starting from the bottom.  So I chose to create a new team from absolutely nothing.  I suck, the race mechanics suck, the drivers suck, the lead designer sucks, and the pit crew may has well been a flock of emus.  All things considered there was a race about mid-season where somehow everything went right during practice.  We were able to get the cars set up perfectly.  The mechanics and the drivers both loved the setup we'd all developed together.  My top driver had a 2nd place lap time compared to the other teams that were practicing.  I thought the struggling and learning I'd done had finally started to pay off.

Next day, race day.  I knew all along it was going to rain.  The race forecast said so.  The bad weather wasn't going to roll in until around lap six.  So I decided to fit super soft tires in an attempt to get in some really fast laps in before the rain came, then switch to wet tires.  All the other teams appeared to do the same except a few running regular soft.  Everything went beautifully, my drivers were at position 1 and 3 and holding those places down nicely.

Lap six comes, here comes the expected rain.  When I pit to change tires, everyone else comes too, nice.  The rain was going to be light and the track wasn't even damp yet so I fitted intermediate tires so I could keep cooking up good lap times until the track gets really wet.  Looking at the forecast I thought maybe I could even switch back to super softs when the rain tapers off.  Everyone else, full wet tires.  Whoops, maybe they see something I don't.

A few more laps in, it's absolutely pouring.  I did not expect the track to accumulate and hold this much water this fast.  My drivers are both complaining to me they want wet tires and they want them now.  They're falling behind in lap times quick.  I panic.  After all I've got sponsors to please, a chairman to impress, and drivers that are longing to be read about in the papers for something other than placing 19th and 20th out of 20.

So in a frantic manner I call them into the pits for wet tires.....on the same lap.....at the same time.  One driver sits and watches the other car getting pit service while the other cars on the track go blazing by.  What the hell was I thinking.  But I figured, who could ever know?  It's a game.  Just 1's and 0's.  Oh it knows.  The top driver with the blazing fast practice time was sure to inform me after the race that he didn't appreciate sitting in the pit with our other car during a race.

I felt myself blush in real life.  I was sitting in my chair in front of my PC seriously embarrassed after what I'd done.  It was our big chance and I blew it.  I'm still shook up about it.  To be honest I'm not even all that comfortable telling you folks about it.  I might start seeing a therapist.  I dunno.  We'll see how next season goes.  It's not looking good though.  My number one driver has already indicated he won't be with us again next year.  And for some reason none of the replacement drivers I've approached want to drive for me.

However it's not perfect and after two seasons begins to be really repetitive. There are tons of options, some things are done extremely well, including small details (for example the ""twitts"" that are like taken from reality), most aspects known from racing are there. But on the other hand after you find out how the game works it's doing the same stuff all over again. I just came to a point where I'm playing just to win the ""F1"" (well it's not actually F1, but quite similar) season and be able to uninstall the game. Nevertheless if you want to have a great time for ~50 hours the game is pretty sleek. It's also nice that there are some things that can be done automatically (for example managing the racing mechanicians), but on the other hand some really handy features are missing (or I couldn't find them). For example in training you cannot compare directly the setups of your drivers - you need to remember (or save) the settings and go to the second driver to redo all the stuff. Sadly you cannot rely on automatic trainings as the results will be mediocre and you won't be able to take full advantage of your car's capabilities. What I also didn't like was the fact that trainings have nothing to do with qualifications and races - you can end up on the first spot in training and be the last one when qualifying. Sure, in reality practices sessions don't represent the shape during races, but still give you some kind of perspective and if during practice in F1 you see HAM at the, let's say, third place you expect him to get nice results in Q3 and in the race. Here it's far from reality. And just one more thing - during races the only strategy that works is to limit the number of pitstops. It really doesn't make sense to change tyres for soft for the last couple of laps, because you will lose too much time and won't get a huge advantage in race. So the best (and only) strategy that works is to have 1 pitstop in races that consist of several laps, up to 2 pitstops in longer races. And here I need to focus on one more issue. The tyres last the same number of laps - doesn't matter how long the lap is. Soft tyres will last for ~9-10 laps in races consisting of 26 laps and in races consisting of 42 laps. Doesn't make any sense. I also don't get why I can build a lunapark in my HQ, but I cannot build a motorhome at the racing track not setup my garage, which is something more important and affecting the team than a lunapark ;)). Either way it's the best motorsport manager on the market so I recommend it and would rate it 7.5/10.",1562173065,1562173065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lot of the actual simulation is very rough, some of it are bearable such as AI seems to be immune to tire temperature problems and setups being just a minigame with no realism. The major flaw in the game though is that in rather than turning performance numbers of the car parts and chassis directly into the respective performance, it uses the performance numbers to rank the cars in the championship then creates performance based off that. So you can be only 1 performance point behind a group of other teams but you'll be way slower cause you fall into the lower bracket. This usually means when you're trying to climb to the bottom of a league to the top you'll be doing tons of car development with no effect, then when you catch up with everyone else your car suddenly leaps ahead in performance. 
It's not game breaking but it would have been nice to have a more linear climb rather than nothing then everything.

That being said, I've still had a lot of fun with the game, the graphics are fantastic, planning race strats is interesting.

It was not a case of simply picking a side and a tactic and watching the game play. There were lots of elements to play with but you felt that each played a role in the outcome of your matches, season and career. 
Then it got bogged down in all sorts of issues and many people, myself included, felt we had no idea if ANYTHING was making a difference. 

So why am I saying this in the Motorsport Manager review? 
Because this is sitting in the same field as that FM2006 era. Man this game is fun. If you like management games that are meaty but not stupidly convoluted, this is your game. If you like motorsport and are willing to control tactics but not the actual drive through intuitive systems and mechanics, this is your game.

I can only comment on one  type of racing (open wheel etc) as I have a career going in one only, but I am riding the emotions like I did with the ol' FM. And after 5 or 6 seasons, there does not seem to be a simple system to winning races or championships 
The replayability is awesome as political sessions that you can be involved in change the rules of the season - tyre types, practice session lengths, car specs (general ones for those who are like me and know little about the actual cars themselves) are all up for change each year.

I've played alot of racing and car games over the years. Both arcade and simulation.
They all capture their own racing genre in their own way, and they all have their pros and cons.
But I've never really played a strategic racing game. So this one caught my interest.

Game type; Simulation or Arcade:
This is by far a simulation game in any way.  Its no pick-up-and-go kinda game. The tutorial is long and informative, but crucial to the gameplay.

Difficulty:
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say this is a 5 or 6.  The game isn't hard, but not easy. It doesnt hold your hand through the campaign, and it punishes you for bad choises.

Graphics:
Since this is a strategic type game, I'll cut it some slack. The graphics on scenery and background is good, and renders good and fast. The UI is pleasing to use and look at. It's what you'd expect from a game at this age and overall good quality graphics. Some minor tweaks should have been done before release though. One example is that the wheels on the cars aren't actually turning when driving. But something you only see if you zoom in MAX.

Replayability:
Very high.  Since this is a racing game with career mode and new seasons happening every time you finish a championship, you won't really finish this game. Or, maybe when you destroy all your opponents on the hardest difficulty, have 100 billion dollars income after every race and nothing really is a challange anymore.  But I think that takes time.

Overall:
I highly recommend this game to any fans of the racing genre, and especially if you like simulation games.
With micro managing, managing economy and staff and developing a racing team from the ground up.
This game would have been a fantastic game if you could combine it with Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, and have the ability to drive the cars yourself.

Overall   8/10

If you like management games and know absolutely NOTHING about motorsport, this game should be a fun time sink for a season or three till the management side of things gets repetitive.

If you're a motorsport enthusiast...  within the first season you're going to realise that most of those numbers mean a lot less than they should, and the racing simulation side of things is going to leave you grinding your teeth VERY quickly.  As an example - car setup is broken down to three indicators, and it doesn't seem to matter HOW you get those indicators to the sweet spot.  Drop the gear rations, harden the suspension, put the wheels on a ridiculous camber and over inflate them...  and the stats say the car is exactly the same as it was beforehand.

Driver orders for tyre and fuel usage seem to work the same whether the driver is behind the safety car or not, which can catch you out if you don't realise they're somehow still using a lap and a half of fuel per lap because they're in full aggression mode.  On the upside, despite the fact they had to have been running it redline with the clutch in, the gearbox and engine weren't wearing any faster.",1561915095,1561915095,False,54,10,0.693167924880981445,0,True,False,False

I did wait for the price to be thump down via sale and got a good amount of money worth out of it. I was interested to play it but just felt the price was a bit high. However, excluding the prices, it's a fairly enjoyable game. Keeping track of your money, trying to save up cash to be more competitive down the line, while trying to keep your job, it's somewhat tense but if you learn the rope fairly quickly, you'll have no trouble.

When I first created my team, it was a struggle at first but I managed to get it into a good spot. For the pros, I think there are 3 good ones. One, It's a simulation with a hint of RPG. An interesting mix but it works fairly well. The simulation is fairly realistic but not too realistic. Throw in a bit of RPG to level up your driver, and you have a game that is fairly impressive. Second, the graphics look good. Is it breathtaking? no. Is it fairly good? yes, if you have a powerful enough computer. even then, you could do 2D and watch the race. Lastly, the racing strategy is fairly hard but fair. When you are racing, you should constantly think ""should I try to go for it and push my car or save fuel and make a run later on?"" both have their cons, the earlier run would mean you run out of fuel and need to pit earlier and the fuel saving could leave you far back behind the field and might get lap down. That's racing for you.

Now, for some negatives, and I have 3 to mention, one, some the submenu is kinda clunky to get around. The pit crew for example doesn't show how many races are left on their contract and it really catches you off guard if you don't check in a while. Second, the interviews post race is fairly bad. I mean, it's not god awful but it feels a bit redundant to do that when you could easily keep your trap shut and just keep your head down and work hard on the car. Plus a few people who gave a review said they were sketchy and I kinda agree to that. Lastly, once again, graphics. Now, yes, they aren't bad, they are fairly good but in order to view it in full detail, you would need either powerful laptop or a good desktop. Mine is an Intel i7 Core with the default HD Graphic card and it can't do medium well. If you have a laptop like me and want the best graphics, you are out of luck.


Even with those nitpicks...I still like this game. Is it for everyone? Definitely not, but I would still recommend the game to a good amount of people, sports fans, racing fans, manager fans, sim fans. If you fall into one of these categories (me, I'm all 4), I recommend this game. However, if you don't feel like it deserves $35 to get it, wait for a sale, whatever it the steam sale (as of writing on 6-26-19, it's on sale) or a random sale, go for it when you feel like it's low enough. I got mine at 8.74, which is the current sale amount. So, if you the absolute lowest price, $10 or less would get you the most bang for your buck. If you can't wait for a sale, then maybe try to squeeze more out of it. While yes there's a sequel, it's on mobile. If we look at Motorsport Manager as a whole, $15-$20 bucks would a be a fairly good deal. Sega strikes again on the Manager series and they get a thumbs up from me. Maybe Sega should take the NBA licence away from 2K and make NBA Manager 2025 or something.

I'm not a big fan of racing managers so i can't compare this game to anything similar.
It took me 100 hours to beat the game, starting from absolute bottom to the Top.And that was a *blast* to be honest.
But then i decide to check some achievements and dlc and after 250 hours of play time i can say that this game has a lot of flaws  that directly impact gameplay.
To put it simple: more you learn about game less fun it become.Maybe it's just for me.
I know it's review of the game and not the dlc but since some people like to buy *whole package* I can say that all dlcs is almost identical to the base game, couple of additional things and new models can't really change gameplay, so if you ""burn out"" on base game, dlc probably won't help you.
In my opinion dlc worth it only if you want to start your first playthrough in endurance or gt series.

Game mechanics are great until it comes to saved car setups at the same track same car same driver same day. Here's what I mean. I went to Vancover, ran practice laps and secured excellent setup. Went into qualifying with setup. Since I am new to qualifying and did not qualify that well I decided to reload the game and try again. So I loaded the saved car setup with what should have been excellent 99% (the setup I just obtained and saved before I reloaded) and low and behold its no where near excellent settings. Whats the point in saving car setups??? Seems to me its all just random to begin with and stays that way. I first noticed this B.S. in earlier seasons with other drivers and thought well these are lower level drivers and hey maybe their just not capable of maintaining the knowledge of car setups 15 minutes apart.  No matter what you do to setup the same car with the same driver every time you go to a save on the same track same day same race its just random developer B.S. There is no reason to save car setups period. Serious lack of development in that regard. I know in OTHER GAMES that game mechanic certainly works like it should. Also on another note I dont care for the qualifying slider bar you have to deal with especially when you have to do it for 2 drivers at the same time in such a short time frame. Another bone I would like to pick is when I created my team in the bottom league I was in that league for 3 seasons and not once get to vote qualifying in. In fact it was never on the docket to be voted on either. In my opinion this is rubbish! Not realistic and therefore more developer lack thereof. This game could have been a classic.

After five seasons of play I experienced:

1) Fast forward part of a race because I wanted to go to bed.
I did this three times and ended up having four race ending crashes out of six having NEVER crashed before when watching races at normal speed.

2) Having finally won two races in a row for the first time the driver who won now has ""a dodgy neck"" and will have half their fitness stat for eight in game weeks despite being a 24 year old driver with perfect stats, this also has NEVER happened before

3) Finally after saving money during the seasons and then spending on facilities through large sponsorship and gaining success on track, finishing championship in 6th then 5th then 3rd, ALL large sponsorship disappears meaning I nearly got fired because money dried up even though I was spending LESS buy hiring cheaper drivers (who were also high stats, see above)

Why negativ, because the game is now 2 and a half years and it still has lap count and ranking bugs.


For exemple my second driver is on position 19 behind my first driver on position 18. But when he passes the goal on the race track for his last round the game says that he has completed his last track while my driver on position 18 ist sitll on its last round. I observed this now already twice..

Another exemple. In the box planning you can fill fuel for max 10 laps but then the fuel indicator shows fuel for 11 laps.



Such stuff is very annoying.

This game unfortunately doesn't have an official F1 license so the team and driver names are not the real ones( but some are quite close). I know there are mods out there that try to fix this but it is not the same thing.

The only issue I have with the game is that it seems to have been rushed out. Sometimes I wonder if developers play their own games. Many times during the game they will refer to a male driver as her instead of he. News articles and supporters comments always seem to be the same and just randomised which become boring the longer you play. When you have your own team, it is so hard to get any drivers, or staff, to contract with you. Hundreds of driver choices but none of them want to drive for you and it does not matter how well your team is doing. You don't even get a chance to make an offer. Even with these minor faults, this is a fantastic game to play. Highly recommend 4 to 5 stars.

When setting up your car a good guide is https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=817349754 You will find in the introduction the Excellent Smiley Setup Guide, click on that. Remember, it is only a guide to follow as every driver, part upgrades, etc will effect the final setup of your car.

Good Luck and Happy Motoring.

There are only 3 drivers, which you usually don't switch or train. Car progression is pretty straight forward. There is some tactics during the race but they are quite easy to figure out (for example if you have a perk for faster pit stop, you might consider making more of them). Some general pre-season decision (like how much money to put into a car or whether to use one expencive or two excpencive drivers) affect the whole season and there is really not much you can do about it later. After 1-2 seaons it becomes quite boring and repetetive, luckly you can get hired by other company racing different league (especially if you have add-ons there are more leagues to chose from). Other leagues may have different rules which causes that you need to learn different strategies. So in general I think that I played something like 8 seaons in 4 different leagues before I got bored.

I think there is quite a few things in the game that needed developing to make this into a really cool game, and lots of people on the steam message boards also share these views as the community really wanted the devs to continue to develop this game but unfortunately it has been shelved for some apparent reason. 

The biggest pro that keeps this game fresh after you have played a couple of years and start to get into the swing of things, of what you should upgrade first at the start of the season, is the modding community. There are some absolutely outstanding mods in the workshop that are super fun and seem to be more balanced then the standard game. 
It also seems quite friendly for PC users if they want to create their own content but cannot comment on this as I am a Mac user and it seems super difficult lol.

Overall this game is definitely worth a purchase if you are into these sort of building developing simulators, with managing a group of people and developing a car on a budget is very fun at times and with the workshop, can keep you entertained for multiple seasons into one save.",1550441616,1550441616,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed and got into it for ~30hrs then I suddenly stopped playing.
This is because I had really enjoyed learning about some of the parameters that are important to a team during a race, on a race weekend and on the business side. However, once these parameters are well understood I found it begin to feel a bit like just passing the time.

I think having 'real' circuits would add quite a bit of appeal to this game. I also found the game a little limiting in the information you are provided during the race. In real life, stratagists are fed or can request informaiton from teams of people. In this game, if you want some information you have to pause and go and hunt it down yourself.

This game does give you a good insight into some of the simple parameters being considered during a season/race, an even deeper appreciation for those involved (knowing there is so much more complexity that isn't included) and a good buzz if you pull of a great stratagy.

The game can be a little obtuse at times, and the tutorial drags on forever. However, once you come to grips with some basic concepts, the rest follows fairly intuitively. 
There are essentially two games here- one is the team and car management part and the other is the racing and pit strategy. Between races you negotiate contracts, improve staff, improve the car, choose sponsor deals, build new facilities, and more. On it's own it would be lacking but combined with the racing portion, it feels pretty complete. Mods add more depth to this process, but vanilla is alright if you aren't into running mods. 
As a team manager, you can choose to join an existing team, or create your own (official DLC). Choosing a team is basically choosing a 'scenario' in most games. One team might have one great driver but he is a pain in the ass spoiled guy. Another might have good facilities and cars but terrible drivers. You must adapt to each situation and plan accordingly. 
Planning for the future is a must. You must think ahead with this game or you might find immediate success only lasts for a season before you are broke, your drivers unhappy, and your staff unpaid. Starting a custom team is more fun initially but once your team is made, it plays out the same. Things like HQ upgrades are insanely expensive, so again one must plan well and think to the future when spending money. Early on it's easy to overspend and find yourself deeply in debt halfway thru the season. 
The racing portion is like playing a different game. Depending on race length, pit strategy makes or breaks you more than the car or driver. Poor pit strategy or mistakes made by pit crew because you had them on max speed for a quick pit stop can totally ruin a winning run. Early on equipment wear will be a critical factor as running hard breaks parts. I've had more than one car retire just seconds from getting to the pits for repair. Taking the chance to stay out just one more lap carries real weight for your team. This is a game where you should expect to do poorly for a couple seasons until you can really build not only the car and driver combo, but also have the infrastructure in place to support it. Immediate gratification is tough to achieve, this is a slower build to feel the satisfaction of achieving something. 
Things like interviews by media could be fleshed out more. They barely matter unless you pick an obviously inflammatory statement. Contract negotiations could be fleshed out better, at least the interaction between the team and the potential hire. Just adding in more day to day decisions would be nice for the team management portion. Many people prefer that to the actual racing part of the game. The racing portion is alright. You can't zoom in very close so the whole thing looks more cartoonish than I'd like. More like toy slot cars than real race cars. But I find the racing part quite fun and juggling two cars and drivers keeps you busy. Improving the car and designing parts could be better, or maybe just presented a little better. It is cool to upgrade the cars, and some drivers will demand all the best parts for themselves, but the process is sort of basic. I'd also like to see a bit more flair added to the sponsorship thing- maybe just a tv commercial or billboard. 
Overall I really enjoy this game. More than I expected. You don't have to be a racing fan to enjoy this game. If you aren't into cars or racing then the racing portion might drag a bit (remember fast forward) but there is a ton to manage during the race. 
DLC suggestion- WRC Rally racing. I think it'd be a matter of just making the tracks and cars look different. 

Wishlist- this same game but set at the 'grass roots' local racing level. Racing teams could be different based on the business; junkyard, tow truck, machine shop....the kinds of businesses that sponsor small time racing. Work up to maybe the Super Mod class, but starting in junkers at the rookie level. Work up thru Late Model, Super Stock, etc.",1546796080,1546796080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

pitstops are messed up ai is messed up 
it isnt realistic as feul and tires wont last it takes ages to pit parts wear off to fast 
practice times are to short no testing in between races 
you cant set up any stints for a race so drivers wil just do as they please even when you set the fuel and tire consumption 

the game could and should be improved on in many ways and i wonder if the makers have ever driven a vehicle or watched a race cause this just a mess 
and id like to hear what race has about 500 pitstops 

few improvements could be 
setting up a time for practice because ai like to say car feels perfect then whine in the last few 100 meters its rols to much, its to stiff, 
let players set up a stint for a race and have ai adopt to that and let players change it during a race in case of damage or happenings and have feul and tires last longer so you wont need 500 pitstops

I've found that playing through the races, though entertaining are somewhat tedious early game for if you play a low ranked team and know you cant get better than 10th, then you constantly have to play through races that you really dont care about the result of for season after season until you are good enough to manage your team to a win. Also ive found that the AI cant get a cars performance in the pre race above 70%-80% while if you do it yourself you can manage a 90%-95% every time much more easily. Other than the annoyance of early game and poor AI for car set up it is a great game that creates a brilliant atmosphere that you can role play through or just sit down and play an hour here or there while still enjoying your experience",1543138155,1543138155,True,4,0,0.565380990505218506,0,True,False,False

Things I have modded: 

1: Tirewear, I think the tires wear too slowly so I maxed it out. (basically it is possible to wear tires at 2x the rate)
I made it so that practice and qualifying had very high tire wear rate because I wanted to simulate a ""fresh track"" that needed to be run in, that causes a lot of lock ups, but I could not find a way to mod that without it happening during Quali and Race too.

and very high during Qual to indicate they are pushing the cars and tires 110%.

But normal during the race.


2: Practice length, 30-40-50min. Not because I need it, but I like to see the tires you have for the weekend to actually be used.

3:Economy, all teams start with 10million more than original, I know the economy of the game is there
to limit your progress, but it also is very unrealistic, sports teams may have tight budgets, but they do also have a bit of money at the start of a season, they are not flat out broke.
this however also works against the player as all the AI teams have more money from start and you will see they upgrade HQ earlier.

4:Driver, mechanic and engineer skilldevelopment speed is increased by 8%, instead of 1-2% per week it is 8-10%, this makes development of young drivers actually work.
to give some math. 
1skill point at 1%/week = 100 weeks for 1 skill, that is 2 years!! that means a driver who can gain 10 points will have to spend 20 years, 
if he is 20 when he starts he will retire before maxxing out at an age of 36-40.

So to be more realistic and practical, it is now 10-13 weeks for one skill point which allows a new talent to max out in 3-4 years. which is evident from the age of the F1 drivers who age 18+ with some of the very top drivers being some of the youngest aswell.

4.5: I did however also make it so they slowly start loosing stats a bit earlier but at a slower rate initially.

Things I would modify if I could/knew how.:

1: Change how the AI changes lanes, make them react faster to slower cars or passing opportunities.

2: Change how the AI chooses tires during practice, on long practices they needlessly spend tires about 20% and then pit, switch to new tires, go to 80% remaining, pit etc. 
I would make them use single sets entirely or to around 30-40% before changing tires in practice.
That would be more realistic and make their strategy work better when only given 9 tires.

3: Change the general economy to give all teams bigger sponser deals so they have more money, but that will add to the challenge and I am not sure how well it would go in the longer run.

4: Add the option to modify team colors more freely and change the initial colors aswell.

5: Change how the AI behaves during practice so they run normal levels if they go race stint and a higher level when going quali stint.

6: Change how frequently lock ups happen during practice and add a chance of it happening during quali for very low quality drivers and none for someone with 19-20 smoothness, 19-20 braking, 19-20 cornering. 

7: also I would make it so a severe lock up could cause a tire to go down 
alot more than it does, I don't know if there is just a simple min-max value or if it is just a specific percentage then made more or less severe, by driver skill.

8: mod the track grip, a race track develops over the weekend in the real world, in Motorsports Manager, apparantly it rains every night and from practice to quali or quali to race, the grip is gone. That is not realistic, the track becomes better over a dry weekend and you start qual with more grip than you did practice, and again the race with a good bit of grip from practice and quali, so I would make the initial grip for qual be medium and for the race about the same level.

But I can only recommend the game because of the mods, and with the hope that I someday learn how to mod the points I made.

After learning to mod this game I love it.!!",1479543767,1543137202,True,0,0,0.498560696840286255,7,True,False,False

It would be good in future to have some better personlisation choices of the driver, team colours etc!

Just a few things that really frustrated me though... a saftey car came out and I was in 2nd place, it came out between myself and the guy in 1st...somehow everyone overtook us both then joined at the back afterwards...meaning I suddenly became 20th and had been lapped...twice by the guy in 1st too, in this case. I've been smashed into the back of *so not my fault* and then had to do a drive through penalty. Some times it's a bit glitchy with stuff like that, but it's things like that which ruin a race completely after all that hard work put in over the weekend and in the race itself. So I stopped playing after a while because I was so annoyed with things like that happening.

Overall a great game which steals away hours of your time, but I'm glad I got the 50% off coupon as there are much bigger more personalised games out there for the same price.

*Update* Since this review, they've added a lot of personalisation which was one of my minor complaints. However now, it doesn't matter how careful I am with petrol and tyres, for some reason, all the other teams seem to be able to drive round the track with no trouble if their tyres are at 20% and yet my car slows down to almost a stop, letting everyone pass with tires at 35% - if it's a realistic effect, it should happen to every vehicle.

GOOD:
Accurate representation of how difficult it is to maintain a profitable racing team
Variety of driver quirks that add depth to the drivers
Race strategy and the ability to properly calculate changes to it are very rewarding when you get it right
Building up a terrible team into a championship winning team is also very rewarding
There was a mobile game with the same title but this game is a completely different experience and feels nothing like it in a very, very good way.

NOT SO GOOD:
Visuals - It's not really very pretty and feels like it should run better than it does relative to said graphics
Sometimes cars will all fall into a long conga line to go through a corner and it looks really weird (think safety car bunching while green flagged)

Some reviews talk about crashes.  I have experienced only one in a hundred hours of playing.  I emailed the developer about it and got an actual human response that they were working on a fix.  There was a patch within a week and I have not crashed since.  Maybe I was just lucky, but I've been following the development of this game for over a year and they do seem to genuinely care about their customers and their product.

Some reviews talk about the game being boring.  It's a racing management game.  You run the team and make strategic decisions about developing your headquarters and car as well as tactical decisions during the race.  Some races are really exciting nail biters, some are just fast forwarding until you need to make a pit stop.  That's the nature of racing.  When building up a last place team, though, the ability to simulate a race without running it would be nice, especially since you know you're going to come in last place anyway.

Some reviews complain about lack of multiplayer.  I totally agree.  For as much as I like this game, I'd have twice the hours played if it could be played with others.  I'd have at least two friends who would have bought it by now if it had that feature.  Perhaps this will be in a future DLC or a sequel...

IN SHORT:
I really like what this game offers.  If you enjoy race strategy, this game will keep you entertained for many hours.  Yes, it's the only real option in the genre, and it isn't perfect, but it's good.  I also paid full price and think it was well worth the money.

NOTE:
I haven't played the GT Series stuff at all even though I own it.  I can't tell you how good it is, but some of the options it adds to the game are really nice.  Also, I haven't even looked at the workshop for this game.  I'll do that after I get bored with what the developers have to offer in the game (probably at least a hundred hours of play from now).

FURTHER EDIT:
This game has been out for nearly a year and I'm still putting more time into it.  The challenge of getting to the top and staying there is still as thrilling as when the game was released.

EVEN FURTHER EDIT:
I've gone back to playing this as the F1 season has drawn to a close.  Features I still wish the game had were multiplayer (so my friends and I can each run a team and compete against one another), a track editor (so I can make my own and maybe share them on the Steam Workshop), and better overtaking/defending AI.  Other than that, it's still good.",1491561611,1542932386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not a bad or good thing, this is just a thing. Older games included much more depth and more choices that also means more complexity, harder in a way. 

I completely understand how extremely difficult is to balance out such a game now'days. A game that puts the emphasis on the core and depth like gpro ( http://www.gpro.net/hu/gpro.asp ) may be too much for most players. A game with a wider audience in the mind needs to have some trade-offs to reduce the possibility of the player being lost too much in details.

Considering all of that and the gameplay, I think Motorsport Manager is the best balanced race manager game out there. It has a pretty well-thought game concept with many layers, well balanced game mechanics and enough yet not too much depth to satisfy most players.

Does it beat GP Manager 2? As for fluency and clear interface, it does by miles. Still, under the 1996 low resolution surface, in the very deep core, GP Manager 2 built a better balanced, more hardcore race car.

Does that matter? Not at all.

A 300BHP 2017 WRC rally car is not necessarily a worse race car than a 500BHP group B rally car - just different. They were created in different era, with different goals in mind and different technology, different attitude. WRC is just more for today. 

By that mean, Motorsport Manager is an awesome new design to be raced. I absolutely enjoyed it. The game improves update by update, a lot of balancing / finetuning is continuously on the way.

Perhaps the best thing with this game is the amount and quality of updates this game gets. It is constanlly improving and becoming fuller. It is a good representation of the sport.

Great work Playsport / Sega (y)

I had been searching on and off for years and there was nothing I could find, until one night I was aimlessly scrolling through the app store and found the mobile version of this game! This game followed not long after and after seeing it advertised through the mobile version I pre-ordered it. I was not dissapointed upon the release and soon I was spending every moment I could on the game, whether it was 5 minutes to go through the part development then saving before heading out or a few hours on a saturday evening, I was just enjoying playing! Then a few months after release the first DLC became available, and like every DLC release since that one, it just made the game that much more FUN. 

It is a brilliant game, you can start in any series and keep a top team fighting for championships or try and develop a minor team. You will find yourself sitting there going over the best tactics during a race, trying to anticipate your rivals next move, how loong the fuel/tyres will last and will the rain come quicker than you expected?

All those flashy cars with stylish appearances remained to be stuck on my head, and the moment I came back to the Philippines I yearned to see more of those. So I got into a local toy store and bought a buckload of minicars, played with them till when I was 12 I lost them from a typhoon, boy how that got depressing real quick.

Then I set my eyes on some motorsports, specifically NASCAR and F1 races at their peak when I got my hands on my own smartphone and decided to look up on cars. I watched a few races on and on, and as an RTS and simulator enthusiast myself I decided to take upon about my own incomplete, worthless review of this game.

I haven't completely squeezed out most of this game yet, so you'll have to look elsewhere for a better, comprehensive review. But for someone who spends few hours on something, you'd probably say that this isn't a bad game. It nailed at least most details of how to run a professional motorsports team, winning titles and dominating the series by creating dynasties with expendable and irreplacable assets including racers.

As you move on, it becomes demanding for your assets to see an upgrade and these are necessary to keep pace with the other big leagues. Who knows, you might end up with a really humble racer who doesn't care about winning, but rather pushes on to set him/herself in reaching achievements one hoped they wanted since they were kids. Of course from every unorthodox or sometimes unfair moves, there are consequences that are more than enough to remind you that overstaying with something that doesn't comply with standards is one ticket to boot you out of the game.

There are several types of tournaments out there, one being with the F1 series I gladly enjoyed, and the other being the Lambo ones that I also enjoyed. Analyzing other teams of their strengths, and their weaknesses are something to keep track on, but also needs your micromanagement skills to the brink as you also need to tend care with your personnel, and the vehicles they use as the race goes on. Live monitoring and barking orders each races entirely changes the outcome of the race, and whether or not you lag behind on contending for a starting spot on an actual race that doesn't matter if the choices you make are too good or flawlessly terrible that also costs your job too. The AI isn't smart but isn't taking the dumb route, as they'll find a way to outpace you should you chose to be a person of luxury and do nothing. So a near absolute focus of management is required.

This does not mean it's bad, its what the game is designed for. It's really tedious but not at the point where you actually need to work for a motorsport team to get the best of it, if you do work for one before then that's fantastic, but most don't including myself and I do understand the pressure of keeping things in check. A few criticisms the game gets is sometimes there's not much freedom to do other than what role you are intended to execute. 

While I do say this game is great for anyone who wants to try their seats on for something, this isn't exactly the easiest of all sims. Now you got your own journey to fill up to, but you might be hesitant due to it's price tag and the extra content with it's own price tag. I'd say get this on sale, but the content and the execution of this game alone doubts my assumptions that you should, as right now it isn't that bad of a game, it's really good.",1536141947,1536141947,True,14,0,0.657165288925170898,2,True,False,False

Without DLC, this game is like Total War: Formula 1.  You manage your strategy between races - upgrading your HQ, getting better staff, managing finance and marketability and sponsors, and so on.  I'd compare the staffing to something like the characters in Crusader Kings II, albeit slightly watered down - each person you can hire has skills, and traits that can affect those skills.  Sometimes you have to scout them to see what those are.  The HQ management is pretty straightforward, as are the sponsors (marketability is really down to how many races you win, and what your drivers are like).

And that brings us to the racing - which is absolutely fantastic.  The races can last (with DLC) up to 6 hours (most are 20-30 minutes, by default).  In each race, you manage two cars + drivers (or two cars and up to six drivers, with the Endurance DLC).  With or without mods, the flexibility for strategy is quite deep (and the consequences of mistakes are grievous).  If you've created your own team, you won't be winning much in the first season or two, but you may be able to sneak a podium or two if you're clever enough.

I recommend both the base-game and the DLC.  Don't be afraid to install mods (I recommend looking at FIRE or ICE in the steam workshop).

Recommended for anyone who likes strategy and racing. 

For any F1, Indy, or endorse fan the base game is okish. Pretty dull, but once you get the right mods the game opens up and becomes more addicting and fun. Sometimes the game crashes on launch, and the game can get a little stale due to the repetitiveness of interviews, circuits, and Part building. However, I have a few suggestions that could help with these problems.  

Suggestions: 
- More circuits:  They don't need to be based on real circuits, they can be totally fake. I just don't want to race a Doha 3 times in a season. I want to have 20 or 22 different circuits for one season. Then vote to implement 2 or 3 or even 1 new circuit next season. Instead of just picking from layout A, B or C. I can vote to replace China with London (Not a real circuit) or add or take away a race weekend from the schedule. 
- More interview questions: The one question per interview is pretty dull to start with, but then I get asked the same question 12 or 15 times a season. I would love to get a question that asks me about how my drivers did and how our strategy worked out. Maybe even ask a question about my previous answer and build on my past interviews.  More questions and more detailed questions would go a long way 
- More Communication: More communication for everyone. From chatting with my drivers to see if they are interested in signing a new contract before I offer one to them. Convincing new drivers that our team is up and coming. Asking why Drivers morales our low, even holding a  meeting with my whole team and drivers to talk about the upcome season and what parts of the car they think needs improvements. I would also love to talk with my driver during the race. Maybe saying ""Us the slipstream,"" "" We think Vettel has one more stop. Do not wast gas passing him since we have no stops left."" or ""Kimi is 1.54 seconds behind you and Ocon is .030 Second in front."" This may help you drive to stay focused.  Just a little more management aspect to the game. 
-Training: I would love to pick which aspects of training my drivers focus on. Ocon sucks at giving feedback. Well, let's put him on a program outside of the race weekend to work with him on giving feedback and upgrading his skills. Something to this extent would be awesome for reserve drivers, so they're not just sitting there not improving.

I didn't put anywhere near as much hours into a game lately as I put into this... For me it is very entertaining, it is really nice to make your own team and start out from scratch. Currently in season 2038!

You will probably lose a lot when you start or when you decide to be promoted to a higher championship, but it is very rewarding once you see your investments influence the outcome of a race for the better... you will earn more money, invest it into something and be like ""heck yeh, nice!""

I bought this game on sale for 10 or 15 bucks, I don't remember anymore. I can totally recommend it for the full price tho, I've sunk 180 hours into this little gem of a game.

It takes a while to get started, it can be a little frustrating when you first start but give it a go, it is totally worth it once you know what's what and how to do shit properly.

One thing I dislike is the ""Saved Setup Management"" for tracks... maybe a dev has an eye on this, it is probably not very hard to implement ;)

Put that 2nd grade part on the vehicle for your 2nd driver. 3. Put the first grade part towards your first driver. Both drivers now think they have better parts than the other.

- My driver was sad because she had worse vehicle parts. Funny thing is: She had the best parts. But well, this is wat she (Laura) said: ""Are you really giving me worse parts than Laura?"" Yup. She was sad because she got worse parts than herself.

- Maybe this bug has something to do with the one above. During ""practice-time"", selecting the right drivers is somethimes weird. The game is saying I have not selected enough drivers, but I have selected two. Luckily I'm still able to proceed to the practice! But once you get there, you suddenly got two of the same drivers. Exactly the same. Funny side-effect: Whenever one of them tries to say something on the radio, it gets shown as a text for the left driver.",1532383929,1532383998,False,9,1,0.523703515529632568,0,True,False,False

Its an awsome game, gives back a fealing close to being a high end team manager.....

HOWEVER... ( and if the fallowing wont happen soon i will not recommend this game becouse:

                       1. the best case scenario for the hundreds of unexplained factors is that you cant 
                           make clear tactical decisions and thats bad enough as that is the whole point..
                           BUT atleast thay really matter

                           would only make sence if the core mechanics are just smoke and mirrors.... )
                           

without a real official manual describeing how the hundreds of stats from the car ,the team ,the HQ ,the driver etc.interract its really hard to make decisions like a pro and feal that the results werent not always down to luck.....
add this to events like being overtaken by someone on the lowest tyre setting when your all pedal to the metal and its hard not to think that the core mechanics of this game are just smoke and mirrors...

and the only think that can clarify this is an official manual so players can confirm the main mechanics of the game are legit....

It's a good game, simple but effective car development and tuning models, decent team management and, with the DLC and workshop content, multiple series with a plethora of options for your playthrough.  All in all, I think it's a good game.  With lack of real competition for the moto-management genera, I'd have to say that it is the best on Steam right now. It takes time and measured patience, perhapse a little too easy at times, but I think it's worth the price if you enjoy motorsport and management games.

For those that would like a little more detail, I offer you this:
- The game takes a very long time to ""complete."" This is not a drawback by any means, but if you're looking for a casual ""10 minutes here-and-there"" type of game this may not be for you. Depending on your settings, races can last from 15-20 minutes in low settings/series to several hours at the higher end.  There are fast forward options to speed up the race simulation, but it still takes some time.

- Car development is linear. Your top two parts in a catagory (based on performance value) are carried over into the next season, throw some money at them and they can be improved. Sometimes you are given an option that ""pushes the envelope"" of what may be legal in a series, but normaly there is at least one decent option to choose from that is not risky (three options per tier, five tiers available at max rank). Nothing carries over if you jump up to the next series, no special discoveries that give you an edge over the competition, just a simple system with some user input. 

- As other reviews have stated, staff and drivers are somewhat limited in number. Chances are that a good individual is already signed, and you have to make an outrageous offer to get them off their current contract (if you are still a budding team). There are some gems to look out for, so keep an eye on who you want and when their contract ends. They may become available, or new talent could come onto the scene. 

- What I see as the largest flaw in the game is the late game drop off of competition. In simple terms, if you stay in a series long enough and invest minimally into your car, you can still climb out of the series and through the highest tier if enough seasons pass. I believe this to be related to funds for the AI teams.  Why would they be out of money? The AI do not seem to be aware of driver marketability. This is a huge factor that plays in to what sponsors want to sign with you.  The AI focus solely on driver skill, which may leave them with an unmarketable driver.  This means that their funds are stretched late game, barely scraping by paying thier team upkeep and staff contracts.  Unable to invest in their car, you eventually overtake them by defult.

It's really damn cool - for about 50 seconds before you realized that all this game is... a mobile game with better graphics. you can chose from 5 different engine strats and 5 different tire wear strats - and then when to pit......... where you can chose tires which have a number of laps they can last written on them..... This is so simplyfied that it ruins the game - AND - it doesn't fit the rest of the game! You have a mismatch of a strategy level where you amongst other things hire people like talent scouts and pit crew on a number of stats and upgrade parts in a pretty complex system - and then you get this ..... this..... well freaking slider bar race...

PRO
- Lots of stuff to make decisions over. Get involved in politics (vote for or against rules), research parts, build buildings to improve your team's capabilities, hire crew and managers, keep a close eye on your financials, set your goals and enjoy the thrill of a good strategy during the race.
- Nice graphics. Overall, the graphics pull you into the race atmosphere. Sometimes things look a bit too smooth though. At those moments it reminds me of the fact that this game also has a mobile version.
- Highly moddable. There are some high quality mods in the workshop.
- Satisfying. Winning a race or achieving your goals is very satisfying. Especially when you can think of the decisions that turned the tide. After an endurance race (6 real hours (!) although you can speed up time) ending 3rd in your class with a mediocre car feels like a win.

CONS
- Driver pool. I know, it's probably a license thing, and there are mods that introduce existing drivers into the game. The women/men ratio is ridiculous.
- Tracks. The tracks are nice, but most of the them are so obviously similar to real tracks that you just want the real tracks. Again a license thing I guess, but this time there is no mod to help out.
- Highly moddable. Yes, I also list this as a con, because when you scroll through the list of mods you sometimes wonder why the devs didn't include certain features in the game.

Overall, the game is worth playing if you like in-depth managing of a racing team. The devs really did a good job trying to capture the thrill of success. To be at the top, you need a good car and good drivers. To get a good car and good drivers, you need a good team.

I like this game, the general idea of being a manager of a motorsport is great, I can't complain in that department. But I play games for ""ENTERTAINMENT"" and honestly this game was not made to entertain anyone but to make your life frustrating. I admit, i'm not a pro at management, that is why i'm nowhere near that in real life. So I have a question to the DEVs. Why the hell are all of you implementing real life issues into entertainment? We have enough problems with life it self, can we at least enjoy games, which are supposed to ENTER f***ng TAIN you? With that said, the biggest problem in this particular game, is that stupid Chairman, he totaly ruins the whole game. This ""thing"" makes you work really hard to keep a job within the game, just like it is in real life and if you mess up, you loose all the progress, including your ""imaginary"" job. And no, I don't want to go work for someone else, I spent days working on the team I built. So I sit there frustrated, praying i will meet the chairman's requirements. If you succeed, it will make it even harder the next season, thus increasing frustration from season to season and I have this thing tuned to the easiest setting (I suck at it ok?). Second, when you create your team, you get a car with 0 horsepower, litterally. Enjoy investing like 200 hours before it becomes anywhere near fun. Basically it forces you to join a team, instead of building one, not sure why this option even exists in the first place and good luck making the chairman happy with 0 horsepower car. Some small issues that I noticed is, during refueling (ONLY refueling), they jack the car up. Is the gas tank hole underneath the car or something? I just lost about 3 seconds waiting for them to jack it up and down. Pathfinding is also kinda weird, the cars don't seem to try and go around eachother when one obviously goes faster than the other, instead they just bump into one another without causing accidents, especially during pit exits. Characters are all the same, come on guys, you could of made atleast 10 different faces, this is lazyness. Anyway, these are games, their purpose is to entertain and in some cases alter reality. I already have a job and a frustrating life, now I want to pretend i'm a billionare, and that I own a race team, and i'm the chairman, and I make decisions.

Its a great game at its core - but the decision making of the AI is purely random. Even if everything is absolutely golden you just lose your best driver or mechanic for no reason whatsoever - and there is NOTHING you can do about that - this is just not how this stuff would work in reality. 

And sometimes thats just the end of it all - you whole game is over, there is nothing you can do about that cause usually at this point it all comes apart - as you have to find a replacement and if this happens at a crucial point (like moving up to the next higher championship) you usually are financially done for.

This makes this whole game, a game of russian roulette - and that sort of randomness is not what I personally am looking for in a simulation/management game. Dont get me wrong ""randomness"" is interesting and necessary - but the way its implemented in this game, and the fact that you actually cannot react to any of it (only option you have is to accept it) is what makes it a bad experience. Those events come out of nowhere and there is nothing you can do to prevent them or to dampen the blow (or prevent it by having options before it all comes apart) - also often time they dont make much sense at all (for example: I lost my most recent run because my best driver decided to get into another team RIGHT the moment I decided to move to the next higher class - after we won 2 team titles and 1 personal championship - her reasoning was that she wanted to race in a higher class - the class I moved to - now she was racing against me and i had to find a replacement - which, in combination with the investment to build a new car for the higher class, broke my back financially and ended my whole game after 5 seasons.)

TLDR: Its a great game and you will have a lot of fun but be prepared to lose it all to randomness.

I origionally got the Motorsport Manager app on my phone when it was on a giveaway and I enjoyed it a lot, but it does run out quickly, but I heard it was coming over to PC and I was pleased for this game because it has a lot of potential. Let me just say that it really has lived up to it's potential.

I was starting to get bored and wanted a single player game I could play in the background, so I decided to go ahead and get this game, I knew that it was modable but I didn't know that there was a great community dedicated to creating mods for it in the Steam Workshop which is easily accesible in game. That on it own makes it a fantastic game.

This game is also so intuitive to use so for anyone who's debating whether you need to be a dedicated motorsport fan boy to understand it, you don't need to be, you can also up the difficulty if you a challenge but otherwise it's simple to get into how it works. It's also got a bit of character, your driver can pick up some ""interesting"" traits. The DLC's available are worth it too. I got so into this game, I decided to try Football Manager, and well, to show how good this game is, I uninstalled Football Manager within 30 minutes because it has nothing on this.

So basically, overall this game is simple, intuitive and fun BUT it can be challenging, and you do need to grind it out and work towards making sure you put the right components together on and off the track. With the Steam Workshop being available, it does make it super emmersive to be able to hire your favourite drivers but it would be nice to add a few more bits of content and race series to add to it to fill it out more, maybe I'll write a blog about that just to expand on what I mean.",1529702402,1529702761,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So much of watching and experiencing motorsports are the relationships you form with teams and drivers. This game puts you in the ""drivers seat"" of a Formula One equivlent series and it's easy to get emotional when you hit your first milestones in this game. First points, first podium, first win, first 1-2 finish, and first championship. The young driver program in the game also gives a great experience to the game, there is no better feeling than scouting a 18 year old, 5 Star potential driver, signing them and winning multiple world championships with them in the years later, It's like re-living McLaren in 08 and Redbull between 2010 and 2013 except you're the one in control. like in real life you begin to form relationships with the drivers and teams and get a little disapointed when one guy you've been racing for years finnaly retires.

The game is also complimented by strategic decision making at the factory and on the racetrack. Should I risk running the illegal part for more preformance? or use the legal part which might have reliability over preformance. The race track also presents really great game play, the decisions of which tires to run, the car setups, and the overall race strategy. Some say that during races the game gets boring, but I disagree, the races are where the game is untouchable. There are so many things to take account for and miscalculating could mean the loss of a race win.

Overall this game is perfect for motorsports fans yet is still approachable to regular gamers. I hope the devs continue to explore the genre further with more DLC or in the form of a second game. the game builds a wonderfull experience to get lost in and always has me looking forward to the next race.",1529179172,1529179172,True,4,0,0.53858649730682373,0,True,False,False

I had played through one season with Predator Racing Team - the worst team available - and tried to see where I could get. Many variables where not well exposed and quite often it did not feel like I had really control over what happens. Also some races got boring back then as I pretty much always played the same tactic - every race, and was super successful with it, so had no reason to chance. Back then I recommended it, because it mad motorsport such a fun game, that I could enjoy races, without ever having watched a single real race or played any racing game before. It was so simple to get it, but also a bit repetetive and underwhelming in terms of content.

Motorsport Manager now is an amazing game. Point. I barely recognize some areas of the game, and every chance I see is extremly awsome. Now I am able to watch a full length race over 43 turns in x12 speed mode, and it does not feel as I am skipping the important part of the game: Playing it. Why? Simply because one simple feature: automatic slo-motion during important events. The camera jumps to the race event you might want to see in detail (lost a place, gained a place) and allows you react. Also it looks pretty nice. The already gorgous little toy car likes (two words: tilt shift) look really cool in slo motion when you overturn someone. There is so much more information to digest - which is good, because back then it felt sometimes like I had no chance to really find out why something went good or bad. Now I really have the feeling all those new values and charts allow me to be engaged with those game mechanisms. They feel like providing the missing reward back then: I chance something and later find out it did INDEED turn out well? Seems like i am a GENIUS in motorsport games. Beeing at the very end of the leaderboard in the current campaign - obviously I am not, but beeing at the very end and having the feeling I can actively work on the problems of my team gives me the reason to long for just another race to verify the next little change.

Do you keep the money to invest in a new, crucial part for the upcoming race or use it to get a new upgrade for the design centre? Your car isn't doing all that well but that upgrade could allow for better parts, in the long term. Do you improve the performance or do you improve the reliabilty? Those high performance parts aren't worth jack if you have to keep pulling your drivers back in for costly repairs every two to three laps or, worse, retire from the race. Do you keep your number one driver who's the top of their class but their selfish nature makes them hated by everyone, including your boss whom you need to stay on their good side. That's just the team managment. 

On the track it's more, or just as, challenging. Push the car or conserve? Is shaving off those seconds worth draining the fuel tank? Dry, Intermediate or Wet tires? It might be forcasted a slight drizzle, but will it soak the track? Or will it dry up by the time you request your driver to change tires? Pit stop now or later? Lets face it, the car's almost falling apart but are you willing to repair that damage and watch as your driver falls to the back of the pack or wing it?

Can you manage a racing team both on and off the track to victory? This game is the perfect simulation for that. Picking the lower end teams may look easier, trust me. It's harder than it looks.

One team may have the best cars in the championship but their drivers limit the car's true potential.",1527166380,1527166380,True,5,0,0.571642577648162842,0,True,False,False

I like to watch racing games from God's point of view, and enter the pit stop during racing. But in the management interface, I would rather have more random events than mandatory, rather than multiple choices, which is not true enough.

我很喜歡在上帝的角度觀看賽車比賽，而且在賽車比賽中進入維修站。但在管理介面中，我寧願有更多強制的隨機事件，而不是多種選擇，這樣不夠真實。",1522041590,1524770490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Based on the above, I can confidently say that this game completely hits the mark.  It's the perfect balance of entertainment versus complexity.  F1 is an incredibly complex sport (dominated by engineers), but the game doesn't get so caught up in the details that some of the entertainment value is lost.  It abstracts enough concepts that there is plenty to manage and your decisions have a huge impact on the outcome of your success.  Also, the graphics are fantastic compared to some of the other motorsports management games in the past.

In the single seater series, the game does a great job of modeling tire wear, which for better or worse is a huge part of present day F1 and Indy Car.  I can't tell you how many times my races have come down to the wire, and where I've had to shift to tire conservation mode, while praying that my tires will make it to the end.

If this game had an F1 license, which I would think would be easy to get now that Bernie is gone and F1 has been taken over by an american company, it would be icing on the cake.  There are some really good mods out there, but personally I stay away from the ones that change the game mechanics.  Therefore, I'm back to playing the vanilla game after finding one of the most ""popular mods"" way too easy.  There was just too much sponsor money being handed out and I found I could push my tires almost the entire race without any penalty.  However, there are some visual only mods out there that I'm looking forward to trying.

In sum, a great management game and a must have for F1 fans.  I hope the developers continue coming out with new titles in the future.",1524265385,1524265385,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want to win pick the best team in the league, otherwise, just like in real life, chassis and engines/gearboxes make a very very very big difference. A team with money + infrastructure, will outcompete hard the smaller teams.

That said, I find playing a newly created team very rewarding, as I get up through the ranks (rank 10, rank 9, rank 6, now rank 4). So this progression of smart investments and decisions + a good race strategy is really really fun to observe.

Again. Highly recommended, if you like manager games. It's a bit more simplistic than others, but for me personally, I find this to be the best thing of all.

Manager sims are a tried and tested genre, mostly thanks to football manager sims. So it was only natural that the idea spread to other sports and, indeed, other areas in our way of life. Games like [i] Theme Park, Theme Hospital [/i] to the more recent [i] Farm Simulator [/i] spring to mind.

But [i] Motorsport Manager [/i] had a bigger hole to fill, so to speak. While motorsport fans are plentiful (myself included) the need to race rather than manage a racing team always came first. There have been previous attempts at manager sims for motorsport, but none that really grab you attention... until now that is!

[i] Motorsport Manager [/i] covers all the bases and areas required to run your own racing team. Hiring and firing team drivers and staff, managing your pit-crew, aquiring sponsorships, developing the team HQ, improving your cars and developing new parts - you have your hands on everything. You even get to vote on rule changes! With nice, sleek looking graphics (when run at full spec, of course) with easy to follow screens when trying to find that perfect race setup, it's all here for the motorsport fan to get their teeth into. With the addition of the Endurance and GT Racing DLC, as well as countless mods available (like this seasons F1 teams) you cannot go wrong with this game. 

Developer Playsport Games have really nailed this attempt and looking forward, if done correctly, the next game in the franchise (if there is one) will only make this genre even better!

Sim city i could never figure out how to play as a child, and when I got my ps2 from a friend I got a bunch of games along with it which included football manager 2004. I played that for about 20 minutes and never touched again. But because this game is about a series I've enjoyed since I was 5, aka racing cars, this has risen to become one of my favourite games of all time!

While you don't directly control the cars during races in other racing games, you can still adjust the cars' behaviour through tactical styles. One could be disappointed that you don't get the adrenaline that one get normally, but for me the fact that I can through tactics alone squeeze out a victory with the skin of my teeth despite having an underperforming car is more than enough to give me massive amounts of satisfaction. For instance, the other week I managed to win a 1-2 with Chariot midway during season 1! What made it even better was that I hadn't boosted the performance on any of my parts or even built any new ones that season!

What I haven't liked however, is that pre-pitstop crew patch, the save files could get REALLY big as you play through a lot of seasons, and not only that, the game has over the 657h of gameplay as of writing this crashed a total of about a dozen different times, and those were NOT from mods! The game also has a rather steep learning curve, this is NOT a pickup and play game! You can get a simple tutorial on how things work at the start of a new game, but all other details, including how much you should adjust your car's settings during practise and even in which direction to move it, as well as how to read the drivers' desires and adjust their new contract to their bare minimum liking (as to not waste too much money, it does matter especially long run) takes trial and error without a guide. It might've been a stroke of luck that I decided very early on to do the Underdog challenge and use the slow build tactic. It gave me enough time to on my own figure out how to adjust the car and from a glance at the track determine where to start. This was before saved presets were added. Even now I have a feeling I could learn a thing or two through the community's in-depth guides!

Still, if you enjoy motorsport in general, this is something I highly recommend, even with the steep learning curve.",1521676722,1521676722,True,28,1,0.734810113906860352,1,True,False,False

The career mode is very in depth but also easy to understand. I enjoy the fact that this game gives you great stories about your drivers/team. The fact that there are some really good mods help those who want to play with real drivers and teams. 

Pros:
Fun career mode that provides a challenge
Races are enjoyable
The ability for rule changes to take place to allow for different tires, points systems, spec parts and a lot more
System of upgrading your car during the year
Mods 
Variety- if you purchase the dlc you can become a GT or endurance manager and have to deal with the different styles of racing.
Addictive

Cons
No stat tracking in regards to drivers and teams and is lacking a hall of fame
Drivers changing team are a bit simplistic and miss the excitement of having rumors and gossip as per real life. Also sometimes the logic of these swaps is somewhat lacking.

If you liked the Grand Prix Manager games there should be something for you to enjoy here.

Pros

+ Encourages modding, and there are some really talented modders on this one. Check out Fire or Ice, which are basically overhauls that include real drivers, sponsors, etc. Really adds a great layer to the game, especially if you are a fan of certain teams or drivers.

+ Management elements are in-depth enough to make you think strategically, but not to the point of being intimidating. They perfectly balanced the feeling of being a team manager without compromising any of the fun of gaming in the process. 

+ Every race is a nail-biter, even if you’re winning by a considerable margin. It’s probably the closest you can ever get to the feeling of commanding a team to victory in real life.

+ Plenty of replayability, and room for you to master your craft or play around with new techniques and strategies.

+ Tracks are nicely designed renditions of their real-life versions.

Cons

- I occasionally get random frame rate hiccups that interrupt an otherwise solid 60. Not sure how many people have this issue. It’s annoying but not game-breaking.

- Sometimes your drivers are total prima donnas. 200k for a birthday spa trip on the company, or our relationship will be forever on the rocks? Eat sh*t.

- Some more spoken dialogue from the drivers would be nice as an option, rather than having to read their input. Currently their updates come across kinda like The Sims, with garbled jibberish and text. This causes the immersion to break a bit.

All in all, but the pros far outweigh the cons. Definitely recommend this one if you’re into management sims or Motorsport, and especially if you like both!",1520639374,1520639374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game tries to throw a monkey wrench in your plans at times by manufacturing some really ridiculous scenarios. I've twice had the same mechanic caught trying to steal plans.

Motorsport Manager is a management game; in the vein of the once popular Football Manager (FM) series. (in which I was a dedicated follower of before it turned to shit) The concept is simple. Take an F1 or GT Team and turn them into world beaters, hiring the best staff and drivers, building your car and just attempt to dominate the race tracks.

The graphics are pretty alright, but Miles (Jacobson) better than the 3D Match Engine that FM has been trying to perfect since 2009.
For a management game though, graphics are not important whatsoever and the lesser the graphical fidelity the more compatible it is with older machines, which can be the computer of choice for a bunch of Management sim players.
If your computer can't do 3D either, there is a 2D engine that does the job as well.

The management options really look like a mobile game at this point. The HQ building really looks like it came from the idea of using a touch device and it is a bit clunky in that regard. Parts building also seem pretty simplistic, with several ranks of parts, each rank unlocked by a different HQ building.

Drivers are also important, right? So hire and fire as you need. Each driver has a ability between 1 and five stars, each obviously based (at least in Not-F1) on a real life F1 driver. Though some of their ficticious conterparts are female, so if you want to see genderbent Nico Rosberg or Daniel Riccardo this is for you (?). Contracts are not as complex as FM, thankfully. Just select bonuses, wages, contract length, driver status. Though stats and the driver's willingness to sign a contract comes with the traits system. They can either be personality traits or temporary events. All of them affecting things like stats, willingness to renew contracts (damn you rivalry) and morale, all positively or negatively.

Of course, where is the money gonna come from? You need money for next season's car, you need to pay your staff and for your HQ's upkeep, oh, and you also need to repair your car after each race right? You CAN always race and hope for a top 2 finish all the time, or you could sign sponsors. Sponsors are simple. There are 2 kinds, and you can have 3 of each. Almost all of them will pay upfront. The first category will have you pick a target finishing position for qualifying and the race. Meet one and you will get half the bonus. Meet the other and you has all the monies. The other one pays after every race, and of course each sponsor has a set length of races before it expires.

Now on to the races. The three stages are practice, qualifying, and the race itself. Practice allows you to tune your car settings (if you have no idea where to begin, there is a Steam guide with good starting settings that you will need to tune as each car and driver have different optimal settings.) and there is a set time limit to get said combination. Secondly is the qualifying stage. Use that setting you found to attempt to get the podium! And then the race. You now have to manage fuel, tyre durability and type, pit stops and car conditions. It is about playing your cards right and hoping that it is enough, as your drivers or car might not be able to secure the target.

Overall, Motorsport Manager is a great game, despite it's simplicity. And if you are annoyed by the non-licensed drivers, the Steam Workshop has ya covered. I really fell in love from the start and I really want to play more.

I find this game disappointing and frustrating in that, despite there being so much information on screen (actually too much) it's mostly meaningless, very little can be changed or influenced, and nothing I do seems to have any impact on what happens in the race.  The management and race weekend options really aren't granular enough to make it worth investing time to understand what I might be doing wrong, because there are very few things to actually change, and next to nothing to tweak in any detail. 

In the series I've been running, race weekened consists of a practice session (3-4 runs to get your setup tweaked), qualifying (3 runs) and then race.  Once you've got your setup sorted in practice through changing suspension, wing angles, wheel camber, tyre pressure and gear ratio sliders (and getting very good / excellent setup isn't difficult), then all you're changing are tyres or fuel.  You supposidly gain knowledge on your tyre choices and  quali / race trim, but those seem to be meaningless in terms of the impact on the race.  Quali consists of sending the car out on the softest tyres, and trying to balance tyre and brake temps on the out lap (or setting that to auto) but otherwise there isn't much you can influence.  For the race, again it's managing the aggressiveness of the drivers tyre and engine use, but doing anything risky seems to be punished.  The driver might tell you he wants to do his own thing (and then without telling you, change his mind), and if anything starts to fail on your car, your race is ruined if you fix it, and ruined if you don't.  Tyres seem to just fall apart very quickly and become completely unusable at the end, so you have to be conservative on tyre strategy.  Obviously this doesn't seem to be a problem at all for the AI...     

Outside of the race weekend, you build parts, scout / recruit staff, select sponsors and build your factory.  but there is just no granularity in any of it.  And again, with parts, building risky parts - even seemingly low risk ones - will just get you punished come race scrutineering, so your choices are limited and again appear to have no significant impact.   

The screen simulation  frustrates, especially at the end of a race where, despite being miles (safely) ahead of other drivers, they suddenly race past on the last lap and you can do nothing to influence it.     

Oh, and the tutorial is rubbish - runs through things too quickly in an unstructured way without really explaining what you're changing or why.  All very hap hazard.

I love manager games and also love Formule1. Back in the day, i used to play Grand Prix World days on end.
For years i've been looking for a decent succesor. And i've found it in this game.
Not that this might be the best manager game around. Probably not, cause it's pretty straight forward.
The choices aren't that hard and it's more of a grind game.

I started building my own F1 team. It's way cooler to have you're own team, then to race with some-one elses.
The team names aren't real (the license probably was way to expensive), but the teamnames resemble the real once. Mercedes is Steinman, Ferrari is Rossini etc. You'll figure it out.
Starting you're own team is the hardest choise you can make. The Formule 1 (called WCGP, or something) is the hardest branche and the competition is fierce. You're lucky to survive you're first year and stay in this league and not get demoted to the lower league.
The second season you might score a point, if you're lucky.
I got demoted to a lower league (finishing last in a season might get you demoted) after 2 seasons. I fought my way back after 2 years and started my climb on the ladder. After 3 seasons is won my first race, with a huge amount of luck.
After another 3 seasons i became a strong championship contender. The year after i won my first championship.

I think if i keep on grinding i'll keep winning and get further away from the other teams. I don't think the game will catch up on me, it's not that good of a game.

The actions are quite repetative, so after a while it just becomes grinding up the ladder. But i enjoy that.
My first points were welcomed with a loud cheer. So did my first podium, win and championship. 
It keeps on being fun to win and improve on you're team. 
I didn't mind the first seasons we're awefull with being last every qualification and race, cause is saw the challenge in getting better each year.

Some pics of pit crew will pop up from time to time and you just hire them. You keep hitting the research button for different car parts to go from average, to good, to great. The main gist of the game is in the racing which is actually quite exciting. It is very easy to mess it all up by not choosing the right tyres as you didn't see the clouds coming, or by stacking up your cars in the pit lane which I tend to do quite a lot. Team tactics, type choices, new parts, and the type of drivers that you have all make a difference.

At the beginning it is very frustrating because you don't improve very quickly. Your car parts seem to blow up fairly regularly and it is easy to overuse tyres. Two stops can quickly become three stops because of a botched pit stop or unraveling racing plan.

There are some moments of sheer joy, though, when you do finally get it together. My Chairman gave me the ultimatum to finish 6th or be sacked in the very next race. I had only finished 11th before. I went hunting for a good second driver and shelled out 800,000 per race to some South American female driver. She looked to have some potential. She only went and won the race with my other driver finishing third.

The game idea is OK. The basic concept is solid, the structure of the game is OK. I enjoy practises, and races can be exciting. 
Some mechanics feel arbitrary and unnecessary, like the pit crew, the stacked risks of being caught with illegal parts as oppose to seperate risks per cars, the driving styles with tyres (you either have all or no heat, and switching does barely anything), however, management games can get away with this.
However.
It appears that this game was never play-tested on anything except the most high-quality computer. 
I've watched a couple people play this, and they didn't edit out any loading screens and everything loaded quickly. 
I jump on, pay £40 to get everything for this game, then spend most of my play time in loading or saving screens. Then when the 3D track stuff loads, it's automatically PS1 graphics. 
OK, thinks I, let's try 2D mode. 
No joke, waiting to get to the Milan GP took me half an hour. Then you're in 3D mode, which is an amazing replica of a Google Maps image cut from the map when not all the detail's loaded in yet, not at all like the picturesque rippling waters of the teaser image. 
At HQ is no better. Switching from looking at the car to looking at your scouting drivers takes 5 to 10 minutes. Every loading screen crashes the game temporarily. I was staring at my desktop background for half the first GMA vote. 
Most of your game is spent in menus, not unlike watching a robot try to set up a DnD game. Then when you get to the fun parts, the game takes ages to load a race astronomically stacked against you.

(Jan 3, 2018)
Okay, so things have changed since I first reviewed this right after the full release.  They have added GT & Enduro class series in DLC packs (as well as a challenge pack), and have opened the game up for mods on the Steam Workshop (which is supported by a relatively robust community).

The base price for the game plus DLC's is rather steep for a management game, so I would recommend waiting for a sale to get the game + DLC packs.

Other than that, this is a pretty good game that I would recommend to anyone into motosports, sim racing, and/or management games.",1478926178,1514999395,True,0,0,0.517331600189208984,0,True,False,False

Almost 90 hours now and only purchased the game like 2 weeks ago... Let me start by saying, I don't know the first thing about F1 Racing, nor have ever really have had an interest in it (did like the 2 movies I've seen on them though, the Ron Howard directed one and the other that was a bit more campy called Drive I think that Sly Stallone in it..), but I was looking for something to play on the simulation side of things, and came across this and notice the amount of positive reviews for it. 

On a whim, decided to pick it up, (probably helped there was a similiar review like this that said the same thing about not really ever being into F1 racing, but somehow totally addicted to this, heh..).. and boy, I don't regret it at all. Ya, i'm shooting myself in the foot a bit, since now the game is on sale for just 8 bucks, and man I thought the game was worth it at 35 bucks, but it's a total steal at just 8 bucks if you happen to pick it up during the current winter sale going on. 

While I did spend some time in the vanilla experience, that sort of totally faded out, as when it comes to simulation games like this I'm always drawn to RL mods, even if I have no clue what the sport is in RL.. (last F1 driver I think I ever remembered was , hmm Mario Andretti? I guess...), I tend to gravitate towards it to get the full immersion experience when it comes to actual RL car suppliers, sponsers, and hell started to learn a little about the more popular racers now since I decided to go with a RL mod instead. (shout out to the Fire 2017 mod, as that one is rather excellent and what I'm currenty playing..), and that's what this game can do so well as it really does make you feel like you're running a racing team through season after season. 

However, if you are slowly going for the vanilla experience a lot went into the teams they did, and also the drivers that are introduced and stuff. There's a good management aspect in terms of trying to find the best mechanics (with their 2 special unlock abilities that you could use in a race if you so choose) with the right driver.. And once you've found that happy balance the glee of seeing your team perform is quite satistifying like any other simulator that's usually out there. 

You also got your chairman (note you get one even if you decided to pick up the free DLC and create your own team) or boss to meet happy demands with, while it's not as extensive as say Football Manager or Out of the Park Baseball in terms of the goals they want each season (here it's simply just a team place finish during the season), there's still a pressure aspect applied to your team, especially if you join a highly well oiled machine that expects to win the team championships year in and year out. 

The race day events are pretty fun, and the actual race itself, while you can speed up the races, are pretty fun the watch if you go with the 3D setting, the Tracks while fictional are beautiful to see and never seem to get boring as there's also different variations of each track that could be voted in for next season for use instead of the current one that's being used in the current season by the team owners of the championship series you are participating in (yes you take part in those votes and perhaps could influence to a certain degree as well..) Now , I did hear complaints if you're a true F1 fan you may not like some of the moves and such they do during the race day (as some call it very unrealistic..).. but since I don't really know a thing about F1 in RL, that doesn't bother me in the slightest. 

As fun as I've had with this game, the one thing I really wish there was more of was a better stat history aspect added to the game.. While the game keeps track of your drivers performance that current year and how they place on each track for that season and any wins they may have had in the mutilple seasons you'll play, that's pretty much as far is it goes.. 

Meaning, if I like to compare how certain drivers have performed on certain tracks , year over year, you can't do that, unless of course you're willing to keep track of this yourself outside of the game on an excel spreadsheet, but ehh who has the time to remember or really do that sometimes, lol... Being that I'm coming from the Football Manager series, and the Out of the Park series from way back when (haven't gotten the newer versions although I hear they just as good now too..), to see that lack in stat tracking is very disappointing for a simulation game. 

But hey, that's why there's perhaps always Motorsports 2 down the line one day that could hopefully remedy that.. 

So yea, I could go on and on about perhaps give more nitty gritty details of the other aspect of the game, but I just feel that other good reviews on here have really done that and all. This review is kind of just to give a perspective if you're someone like me who perhaps never had an interest in F1 racing before, but if you have played simulation type games like Football Manager, out of the park baseball, etc... Than this one is certainly worth checking out. 

If you're able to snag it while it's still on sale, totally worth it too as mentioned earlier!.

Max. Playing time : As long as you live. Price : ~4$ on sale, pretty cheap.
 
+Fun & easy to learn, even for someone who don't know shit about racing. 
+It has good-looking drivers ;). 
+You can play it both in-depth and casually (simulating). 
+Involves a lot of strategizing and is mentally stimulating. 
+The car is visually pleasing. And everything else is visually on point.
+Doesn't get repetitive quickly.
+Definitely not a short game.

-You can't play it on background.
-I don't feel the level of importance on scouting people. I know it's important but I can't feel that it's important, like it's taken for granted. 
-Does not include the GT and Endurance series. But if they need money for them, then I would gladly pay for them. I just hoped they included it in the main game so others who are not willing to pay for it can also play it, then just think of other DLCs, like exclusive cars or drivers, challenges (they already have one), more track layouts, etc. 
-50% of the time, I get fcked up for not knowing it's gonna rain the next lap. The interface is good, but it's not perfect. I wish they could've shown it beside the tyres in the leaderboards.
-Can't zoom in close enough to see my cool livery while racing.

Risk Level: None 
Build-Time: About 3 hours, it's' only 6 gigabytes or so, so it doesn't take up much space. (That's a huge + for someone who wants to conserve memory for other stuff)

Suprisingly extremely addictive, only recently found out about this gem of a game, picked it up to fill the bordom gap and get my racing fix without having to set up my racing wheel. Ended up getting far more addicted than I expected

Nice and simple to pick up, very easy to learn.

Really addictive and rewards careful management of your team.

Creating your own team is a very fun challenge if you can get the free DLC to install.

After a while I had this Tamagochi effect and I relly feel like the manager of my own team (with DLC: Create your own team) with one downside: There's a chairman, who evaluates your results and you have to keep him happy or get fired. Not hard to do, but doesn't feel right to me.

I do reccomend this game if you like to manage, tweak etc. There's a lot to do and to find out which keeps you happy for a long time.

Unfortunately there is quite a lot I don't like and if I wouldn't like the core features I would've thrown away the game already. As mentioned the tutorial is very long and although most of the features are explained well, it is kind of annoying. The long tutorial is needed to even barely understand what is going on. Here's a list of things that are just wrong:

- the email system. You get every news as an email which is annoying. You have to filter the stuff you are interested in yourself.
- Extra waiting time when other series are calculated. Incredibly unnecessary with no benefit whatrsoever for me as a player.
- So many different menus, which are position information strangely and you have to navigate so much with the mouse and eyes that it becomes tireing.
- All menues fly in an out. Fancy when you start, but incredibly annoying over time.
- It all feels like it was invented for a tablet and for this ""apple-faciness"" which has no place for real PC players.
- overflow of unnecessary information

user interface --> terrible

The outcome is one single part, so if you want another one for your second car then you have to do the whole design process a second time. 

The better part is the actual race weekend. Very polished in the looks department and interactions that make the race exciting to watch.  You can do most rl strategies and it feels like it really makes a difference.

Even though it might be in a completely different sport, the feel of the game reminds me of old football manager games. And I don't mean the game Football Manager, because the ones I've played have in my opinion not been good enough - but I am talking about the old Championship Manager games.

In this game, you try to stay ahead of the other teams - in the races as well as talking car/part development. It is all about prioritizing where to put your money. Spending more money on the car (in pre-season), developing new car parts during the season, the HQ (building and upgrading) and/or the drivers. Upgrading the HQ will make your drivers stay fit easier, will enable you to develope and build better parts for the cars, have better/more information about weather (so that you can have an edge when it comes to choosing the right tyres) etc etc.

Finding that balance is what this game is about - that and when to pit and how.

The content is great and the game is very stable - even on low spec PC's. Can't recommend this enough for someone looking for a really good manager sim. You don't have to have a lot of information of, or a huge interest in, motorsports to understand this game.

Either way, as a management game it is bloody brilliant. Though that said it IS a management game, and therefore not for those gamers who prefer things a bit more fast paced and action filled. But those who dont mind putting in a bit of time and enjoy playing the long game, this is great. It also helps if you're into F1 and the like.

What it really does nail is that feeling all the actual team principals no doubt get. You do everything in your power to make a brilliant car, build the team, and win. Then you go out and everything is really in your drivers hands. There's a bit of powerlessness to it, and personally I love it!

To say this was originally a mobile game shows as because of it providing a fairly simple interface with helpful tooltips whenever hovering over any of the names/icons whilst retaining key/important information.

The gameplay side is split into two sections, pre/post-race team management and actual raceday management with you in control of both, although you can refer some decisions to the computer/staff such as, the 'new' pit crew update. The only issues I have with pre/post-race team management is why certain people don't want to join your team without a real reason other than, ""I'm not interested"", yet they are unemployed at a young-ish age.

Race-day management is simple, yet allows for strategy, for example, if it going to rain through the race, you can plan around it, however the forcasting is unreliable sometimes (as it should be.) However, you really only have limited control over your drivers, except for telling them to push their tyres or the engine as well as setting pit-stops, the rest is up to the stats of the car and the drivers which, early game (especially when creating your own team) is going to be very low so getting decent place finishes can be a struggle.

Another criticism of the game is the randomness of events that can happen with no real explanation, such as drivers getting caught by the media doing something illegal or suddenly deciding to go for a career in modeling, or even when there is no positive/neutral answer during an interview, which end up turning into the same questions. ""Why did you go for a fast pitstop"" ""Why are your parts so rubbish and holding 'Driver' back?"" etc.

Even with the problems it has, the dev team have pushed out some nice updates and QoL fixes, such as saving practice setups and tweaks to the AI so they respond to changes in the weather better, it continues to be a fun game in small bursts. Plus it got me interested even though i'm not interested in actual Formula 1 racing.

Originally when I found that game, I was looking for a motorsport game that's chilled back and relaxed. I saw the game and was like ""Yeah, that's the perfect game I am looking for!"". Welp I have not been more wrong in my entire life... This game is all but chilled back and relaxed, especially during races. You have to make split second decision, which can not only determine the outcome of the race, but the outcome of the whole season. Insane right? And it's right here at the click of your fingers!

Overall it's decently optimised, since there's a 2D mode, for slower PCs, and a 3D, over the top, mode with fancy environmental graphics, of the track and all the stuff around it, as well as cool car models.

Everything in the game is not licensed so track names, team names and driver names will be different but they represent their real life version clearly. That's not a problem though, since Motorsport Manager also has a great community! Since the implementation of the Steam Workshop, a tone of people have started making mods, which even change the cars used and update the info of teams etc. so that it is like the real life one.

However, a big disclaimer is that the game requires you to have some understanding of Motorsports and particualrly open-wheel racing, since the base game is focused around the formula series, and the main thing in the game is strategy and car development. Of course the people at Playsport introduced a DLC, which you can buy for 7.99€, that adds the GT side of things to the Motorsport world.

Playsport Games haven't stayed in the shadow and not done anything, they've added 2 more DLCs: a car livery pack, which allows you to change the looks of your car in-game, and a ""Build your own team"" DLC, which to be honest who doesn't like to imagine that they've created a brand and run it themselves and see their brand succeed. And that's not even the good part, those 2 DLCs are entirely free and you can get them when you buy the game!

All in all the game is great, you should 100% get it if you are motorsports fan, if you are not, you might have trouble at the start but with the instructions and experince you should be able to pick up the game easily since the machanics aren't    unnecessarily overcomplicated.",1494311173,1511388450,True,12,0,0.654743731021881104,0,True,False,False

The only downside for me is that despite the pc version being more complex than the mobile original, it still has some arcade feeling, some things could be better. This will probably turn into an yearly release version like the CM games. For the second one I expect more, but to start this is very good.

Pros:
- graphics and style. For a manager game are very nice.
- you hire drivers, staff
- develop parts
- control strategy
- develop HQ
- sponsors
- rules change during seasons. You have the best engine on the grid and for the next they decide to give equal engines to everyone. 
Cons:
- things feel a little arcade. doing laps in practice you get % bonus for the race, or tyre type that you try. It should be more about finding about tyre degradation, fuel consumption, diference between tyre compounds. 
- everything works a bit with the % bonus or penalty. that gives it a little arcade feeling.
- during races a driver does one lap, the next he is 3 seconds faster, than 2 seconds slower. They seem a bit random. My example is exagerated but it does feel like that a bit
- If your driver is cought with blue flags, even if he is faster, he will let the leader go, than pass him, than get a blue fllag and let him pass and than pass him, and so on. Hope they fix this.

A good game, but very arcade like. Hours will pass as you make a couple of races. But I hope that if a second game is made it will be more of a simulator.",1483183768,1511386410,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

This is a great game mechanically (no pun intended), but lacks a well balanced and engaging campaign.  It's a real shame as well, because the layout of the game, the UI, and the cycle of improvement and hiring/firing/training are all done really well.  The problem is, you spend a lot of your time hopelessly behind, a short window where you are competitive, and then quickly graduate to winning every race by 20 seconds.  Repeat that cycle for hundreds of hours to graduate various tiers.  To progress from one league to the next, you really need to spend multiple seasons winning every race and building your HQ up, it's just overly long and becomes tedious very quickly, as once you figure out how to dial your car in, there isn't enough RNG to really keep things interesting.

I will say what they have is close, there is a great game in here, and could probably be modded as far as progression goes.  They have a fantastic skeleton on this, just needs some flesh.

If this game had a well balanced and meaningful campaign, it would be a solid A, as it stands it's probably a C+.  Worth buying if you can pick it up on sale, as there is certainly some game time to be had.",1510681965,1510681965,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

The only issue I've had with it is not being able to continue your career because of a black screen directly after a loading screen. Hopefully this issue will be solved in the near future as you do get attached to a team you've been nurturing from dead last in the European Championship to winning races in the World Motorsport Championship.

He Joined my race team as soon as it was formed and for the most part, he is an ok driver. Much better than his partner named Fry. Now Fry couldn't drive a shopping cart down the dairy isle at his local grocery store without f**king it up somehow. But, he was cheap and kept the seat warm till I could hire someone that could at least walk in a strait line without crashing. 

Back to my dear driver Dan. Now, for the first 7 races of the GT season, our team sucked. We just outright should not even be associated with cars at all. Perhaps professional paper airplane racing was better suited for a team of our caliber. But we kept pressing on. 

Then one day in Germany, aparently Dan decided to himself: “you know what? I’m really sick of sucking so bad. I’m gonna give a good race today.”

And my dear friends, he did. While Fry was trying his best not to get lapped for the 2nd time of the day, Dan was up in the top 10, then the top five, then the top three… 

Do you know where my dear driver ended up at the finish line? Lol no you silly steam player. He finished third. But, it was like we won the world that day. 

Later in the day, a few hours after the race finished, we waited for dumb fry to finally cross the finish line. We loaded up the trailers and headed back home. 

I’m still in my first season. We have improved our racing capabilities. Even fry was able to finish 18th one race. We gave him a high five, much like adults giving a participation ribbon to the last place tee ball team for the young dumb snot snorting kids. We act like they did something, but all they did was drive their dads to drink that day. 

In summary, this game has occupied my weekend and has gave me much joy. The events both on the track and off the track make this a very realistic and enjoyable game to play. 

The learning curve is average. It will be a high learning curve is you’re not familiar with how racing works. However, well worth the effort and time to put in to the game.

Could this game be more detailed and complex, like FM has grown to be?  Sure, and I hope the devs continue to add things for the Manager to worry about, when not trying to control the actual race.

Since the game launched, the race AI has gotten better, to the point where it will beat you if you're not doing a good job developing your team and car.  Devs have been good about fixing bugs as well.

At this point, though, the devs should start looking at attacking the boredom that can creep in (and not simply by adding RNG impacts).  Each race weekend is pretty similar -- I think the tracks should have more of an influence based on their characteristics.  The track conditions and weather do impact the racing, but I think the tracks could do so more dramatically.  The mechanics are there to deal with high and low tire wear, or high and low downforce impacts, but the teams and cars all mostly perform the same way (relative to each other).  I think this could be tweaked so that in developing the car, some additional trade-offs would need to be made.

I started with my own team which has been a steep learning curve. Being bottom every race was not fun but by my third season I was finishing top 10.  This is where you need to start paying attention to the details, tweeking the aero or gearing on the car will mean the difference between points or no points.

Factoring in the weather to plan your pits stops, looking when to have your drivers attack and increase tire wear to try and perform the undercut and hoping that the tires dont die out before the end of the race. 

If there were a couple more things I would like to see in the game they would be, 
1) Merchandising oportunities to generate money, deciding on what you would like to sell and for how much.
2) Perhaps something with regards to the engine to tweek the max revs, power etc
3) Option to select which racing series are available. Think I have some mods on that have changed the series.
4) I find that I favor one driver over another, so perhaps an option to control just one driver instead of both, it can get quite intense during the race, especially if both drivers are in the top 10, managing two seperate race stragtegies.

All in all a fantastic game with some real potential to add so much more depth to an already great game.

I changed my mind - again. 

I bought this on release date, was very enthusiastic and then - read below. But after one year I grabbed this game out of my ""false buy""-box and re-visited.
Well, it's actually a very good game now. There are NO bugs (I've played another 50+ hours) anymore. The career mode got better. The drivers aren't that stupid anymore. Overall, it matured to a very good SEGA game as we expected. But it took more than 6 months for the necessary updates. Another point is the price. Yes, it's a premium product. But the managment part isn't worth the €35,- and that's what a manager game is about, isn't it? If you get it on sale, for 20 bucks -> grab it! 


First review, already changed to negative:

I have to change my review. After playing 180+ hours I have to say, I'd better not bought this game. You see through this after a long time. The problem is, 1 season takes at least 8 hours in real time - if you play triple speed and know what to do. You need several seasons to get into highest class. But 1-2 simple mistakes in the beginning may ruin your career, which ruins 40+ hours of playing. 
Then all the repetitive stuff, which makes the game very boring. 

And don't forget the lot of bugs... 

This is the main reason I changed my review. ONE fu**ing bug ruined my race, my season and - my career. My #2 driver finished the race (in 3rd position) and decided to give up AFTER CROSSING THE LINE. In the end I missed the goal (getting 2nd) by 1 point, got fired and 22 years of career where gone.

Firstly - expect to be frustrated at times if you do get it. Racing is massively unpredictable at times, and so is this game. You can apparently nail your setup, have a good car with capable drivers, qualify well, then lose 10 places on lap 1 and put up with a terrible race or have a part fail two laps from victory. There are definitely a few faults with it too, but I would still recommend MM, even at full price.

Cons:

- Race starts are a bit unpredictable, possibly too much so - I've had drivers go from 6th to 2nd then back to 15th on lap 1 before without any mistakes, crashes, etc
- Contract negotiation really needs to be looked at - at the moment you can only sign drivers NOW, not at the end of the season, which is just daft
- Errors at pit stops always used to be reasonable (an extra second or two), but since a patch they've been ridiculous - a highly trained pit crew which can change a tyre in 2 seconds if all goes well will randomly take 11 or 12 seconds because they didn't quite get it right first time, and that just shouldn't happen. To be honest, pit strategy really needs fixed as a whole
- Some of the drivers' comments are redundant or just plain wrong
- Driver ability sometimes means less than it should - I've seen 3 star drivers winning World Championships ahead of much better teammates/rivals

I enjoyed most other aspects of the game, but some of my favourites include:

+ Really varied management styles - corrupt or clean, developmental or cash-splashing, they all get results if you use them right
+ Rule changes make for a dynamic environment (spec engines change everything!)
+ Immersive race weekends - some people think they take too long, but I think they create a more realistic race experience (although 1x speed is far too slow), and you can save and exit for a break whenever you want
+ Good R&D path for components and parts
+ Tongue-in-cheek ripping off of real-life teams and drivers - like the red Italian team with the German and Finnish drivers who *definitely aren't* Ferrari, or mildly corrupt governing body chief ""Ernie Hecklerock"" - keeps the game realistic while also not taking image rights too seriously
+ Interesting but balanced random events

Overall, while the game has its faults, Motorsport Manager is by far the best racing sim I've seen yet, and it is a genuinely immersive and interesting experience. If you're a racing fan, I'd recommend it at any price; if you're a fan of the genre, then this would be a good buy in a sale.",1507499807,1507499807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game was a huge surprise to me because i went into it thinking it will be some super basic game ala mobile and nothing like real manager game and it blew my mind. If you love motorsport and/or football manager you will fall in love with this game. Lot of great features than even SI should get inspiration here for their Football Manager. 
You can create your own team or start with existing one and take it to glory. There is lot of stuff to do outside of track, car development, car design, sponsors, mechanics, drivers, scouting, employees, finances, media, interviews, hard choices, promotion to higher categories, designing of new parts and lots more. And on the track, the engine is very nice and the races itself are a lot of fun. You have to control the strategy, tyre management, pit stops etc. Overall great game and i hope they will some day make Motorsport Manager 2 for PC",1507415041,1507415041,True,12,0,0.672597229480743408,0,True,False,False

Pro's

Allows you to demote an F1 team in your first season

Con's

Starting drivers are a joke
Factory improvements serve no purpose
Your drivers are sub par compared to there competition
Component improvements appear to take 3 times longer compared to the competition
Competitors have the worlds greatest tire wear (20 laps on ulti-soft tyres)
Tutorials only serve the purpose of pointing out the cons (i.e designing new components cost money and still don't boost your performance)

Its such a shame so many things appear to be in place to make you loose, there are far to many cons to right them all down, just a shame the pro's that did exist don't last very long after your first season from scrath.

415200,35544874,76561198244185880,0,2,9041,0,5980,1587050319,"If you are looking for a deep, complex and difficult managing game, this is not the game for you. Instead, Motorsport Manager is a straightforward managing simulator that does not require any prior knowledge about racing.   However, due to its simplicity, it is easy to figure out a way to play the game that will always work. As a result, replayability in this game is surprisingly low. 

Furthermore, the game tends to waste the time of the player often. For instance, at the end of a training session, the player is obliged to watch all the cars driving to their pits, even though there is nothing to do, nothing to gain, and nothing interesting happening on screen. Pointless pre-season testing where you just see some slicers that move; flashy, good looking animations that aren't important for the gameplay. Patience is a virtue, and you'll need it if you want to play this game.

Like the famous football manager, much of the satisfaction of this game comes from reading the messages that you'll receive in your inbox. After your first win, your driver may dedicate the win to you. After doing great in a season, you may be chosen as the manager of the year. You'll be able to participate in a voting system that shapes next season, and its great to see how a vote goes into your favorite direction. 
But also on these good points, the game leds down after a while. Many of the messages are repeating, and at some point, you'll skip reading them because of that. The worst of it all, is the media. You'll often be asked whether you'd like to give an interview. You're better off denying the interview, because it frequently results in a morale penalty for one of your teammates. I really do not understand how to developers have implemented this option in the game like this.

However, in the first few seasons that you play, everything will be new, and at that time the game is really entertaining. This is why I would recommend buying the game when its on discount. You'll get some fun out of the game for sure, and when the game turns into a chore-fest, you'll  just lay it down, and gotten your money's worth out of it.",1507384066,1507385964,True,14,0,0.666496038436889648,0,True,False,False

 [*]Feels authentic. I believe that I'm really running a racing team.
 [*]Not too steap of a learning curve. In your first season, you might feel like you're doing something wrong because you come last in every race. You're not - you need to play the long game. That being said, pay attention to which parts matter most (engine and gearbox for Europe) across all the races, and improve those consistently.
 [*]7 seasons in, and I'm not entirely bored. Just got promoted to Asia cup, where I'm at the  bottom of the field have to work my way up again. An expected challenge!
[*]For the most part the UI is cleanly laid out and uncluttered
[*]Being unethical is possible - bribes, parts that risk being outside of regulation, obtaining part designs from other teams are also choices you can make. And you do get caught from time to time.
[/list]
[u]Negative[/u]
[list]
 [*]Idiot drivers. You just get plain sick of their in-race chatter and dumb requests. ""Do we have enough fuel to get to the end of the race?"" after 5 laps. Of course you don't, the fuel tank isn't big enough to fuel the whole race. ""I'm not on the right tyres!"" That's because the weather is about to change. ""I need fresh tyres"". Not on the 2nd last lap you don't.
 [*]Slow transitions. Going into races, and coming out of races there are a lot of slow screen transitions. Do I really need to watch every number pop one by one on the driver stat improvement screen? I really don't know what devs think when they make these kind of choices.
 [*]Lack of key information in key places. All the info you need is available, just not on the screen you actually need it. The car parts that are most important for each track are shown when you go to the track, but not on the actual setup screen! Similarly, when choosing tyres you can't actually see your driver's smoothness rating. This gets really annoying really fast.
 [*]Useless green bars to 'guide' your setup. I don't know if these are supposed to be based on a mechanic's ability but they're pretty much garbage - several times the perfect setup is on the edge or past the edge of these, when you would expect to be somewhere in the middle.
 [*]Contract Negotiation - This is perhaps my biggest complaint, because it's the most ""unbelievable"" part of the game in my opinion. The issue is that there's no mechanic to negotiate contracts in advance for the next season. You can only negotiate and hire *now*. Which means you either need to fire the person in that current position, and pay their early terminination fee and pay to buy out the contract of the person you are hiring, or wait until after the last race. So you delay to save money and reputation, and then there's a big rush to get it done before season start, because the AI snaps up people really fast. You have to go through several days, sometimes weeks of negotiating with a prospect, before you hire them, but the AI apparently does not (or know the exact offer to get an acceptance first time). If you don't renew someone's contract in time, they leave and head to the unemployment line, instead of staying on a rolling contract at the same terms. Just give us a way to overlap contracts, yeah? Let contracts run out at the end of the season, and let us negotiate in advance for contracts that will start next season.
 [*]Pit stops - once you decide what changes and how much fuel etc. you can't change it, even if the car is still half a lap away. So many times I made a mistake, and wished I could go back and change it. Until the driver turns into the pit lane, we should be able to change our minds...
 [*]I'm at a bit of loss as to how the driver/mechanic relationships work. I can't seem to figure out what the pattern is with these going up or down after each race.
[*]Setup loading and saving. The screen for this sucks. You have a long list of every setup for every driver for every track. You can't even sort the list. A filter to restrict the list to just those for the current race would go a looonnng way to improve this.
[*]Tyre life - so sure, your milage will vary, but it took me some time to figure out that the expected number of laps for each tyre (in the tooltip) is if you run the tyre down to 0%. You never do that. At 25% left, lap times start to massively drop off and once you get down below 15% it's undrivable. So when calculating fuel loads and expected pit stops I have to mentally calculate the listed number multiplied by 0.75 to get actual laps that can be done on the tyre.
[*]Refueling - The number of laps of fuel remaining, ""excess"" and ""low fuel"" indicators are useless, because they are based on some mid-range fuel burn strategy and not the current engine setting. If you have enough fuel that you will be 1/2 lap from empty by race end, you will still see the excess fuel message. Estimates at pit stops seem inaccurate too, so I always go one lap over than the recommended because in my first season I ran out too many times...
[*]The rule voting is more of a distraction than of any real strategic value - most of the time you don't have nearly enough information to make an informed decision, and the changes in rules mean that getting promoted from one tier to another (or demoted) means you suddenly end up in a very different motorsport with staff that have skills that don't necessarily match what you need. The biggest of these is spec vs. developed parts. These votes seem to come up a lot and drastically change your direction - part development is the most important decision you have.
[*]Speed setting - During practice, qualifying and race there are 3 speed settings. The game always resets to 1 at the start of session. 1 is really slow. The cars don't look like they are even racing, but rather going for a Sunday drive. 3 looks faster than real time, but is still too slow. I can't count the number of times I've drifted off waiting for 10 laps to go by and then missed a pit stop. Since the driver radio chatter is mostly useless, you ignore it. A faster speed would be great. Drivers telling you about being short of fuel 2 laps before (instead of randomly) would be helpful. Remembering your last speed setting would be really, really great.
[*]Put money aside for next season - this is completely dumb, and must only be for the truly poor at math. Really, it's not hard to calculate how much money you can still spend so you end the season with 10m. Besides, you get prize money before you need to pay for your next season chassis etc. anyway. I always put this on the lowest amount and manage my own finances just fine...

It's biggest downside is how tedious and drawn out the races are. Even when using the fastest 'fast forward' speed and knowing exactly what to do when, each race will take roughly an hour with little input from you. Even if you micromanage the race (when to overtake, when to back off for tire temp and fuel consumption), even if you're constantly redoing fuel burn and tire consumption to have the fastest possible lap times, you'll spend far more time waiting for something to happen than actively playing the game.

If I wanted to watch a Formula 1 race. I'd turn on the television.

However, it focuses almost solely on race management rather than team management. Sure, you can expand your base, but the staff you hire is limited to the drivers, a chief designer and two race engineers - and no matter how good your staff is, you absolutely and categorically cannot make a big step forward from one year to another in outright pace, because your best parts get carried over from the previous season, and the chassis don't seem to matter.

As is befitting of a niche game anno 2017, it does come with a bunch of features that remind you of freemium games, such as the design process for next year's car. Instead of having the chief designer do his thing with a set budget and whatever manpower you can hand spare him, you choose suppliers of parts, which then affect the chassis performance. Going for the best engines and expect your car to have more power than the previous season? No way. Engines only affect fuel efficiency and chassis improvability - the ability to improve your car with new parts the upcoming season. The only thing missing here really is microtransactions to further increase the base stat.

With Sega publishing it, I was kind of hoping for some Sports Interactive knowhow to somehow be funneled into the process - like Football Manager and Eastside Hockey Manager - games where you can spend tens of hours fiddling with your staff and tactics, and then spend tens more going through statistics for the last 10 seasons just because it's fun. Motorsport Manager lacks all of that. It's extremely superficial, and basically only does the racing simulation part well. Even this leaves you dumbfounded at times when the opposition deploys all of its battery power, which somehow magically results in a laptime 3-4 seconds quicker than anything else out there at the time.

When it comes to team and asset management, it's severely outdone by the 1999 Microprose management game Grand Prix World - a game where an engine has ten parameters, not *one* overall stat - and you negotiate deals with fuel suppliers, said engine suppliers and tyre suppliers (because that was back in the days of good tyres in F1). Sponsorship deals were difficult to come by, they didn't come to you, like they do in Motorsport Manager. Hell, you even managed hospitality for the sponsors at each race in GPW. It's even got a modding scene releasing new season packs every now and then. And pay drivers. As if Marcus Ericsson would get paid to drive anywhere in real life (he does in Motorsport Manager.)

In conclusion - it's not a game I'd recommend, since it's lacking the depth not only of SI management games, but it can't even hold a candle to Grand Prix World which is due to celebrate its 20th anniversary in the near future. Motorsport Manager isn't bad, it's just not that great - personally I'd like the proportion of team to race management to be inverse.",1505089491,1505089491,False,21,1,0.643357515335083008,0,True,False,False

Building up your Car, Team, Buildings, Drivers etc. can be a blast. Graphics are okay, the Sounddesign is very good.
When you come from lets say a Football-Manager and are looking for a different Discipline, then you are golden with this Game. The Managementpart is superb!

But i come from the SimRacingside. If you think you can transfer your knowledge of Racing to this Game, be ready to be frustrated. Numberwise all the Things happening on Track might make Sense. But from a Drivers Point of View it feels like pure Luck or Misfortune (emphasis on ""feels""!).

The thing that kills it for me is the Driver-communication.
Example: Safetycar comes out; i needed Fuel and the Tires were worn so i Pitstopped. In the exact Moment the Driver is leaving the Pit he (or she) always -repeat- aaalwaaays tells me that the Safetycar is out (eeehm - thank you) and asks if he (or she) should take a Pitstop... while leaving the Pit with fresh Tires and a full Tank...

Another example is Weatherstrategy: again i need Fuel and Tires, go to the Pits and look at the Weatherforecast. I see that in the next Round it will start to Rain and it wont stop for at least for a couple of Rounds. So obviously (from the SimRacer-perspective) i choose Intermediates (or the Wet-Tires).
Back on Track the Driver always complains about the wrong Tires. Yes they are wrong - but only for 0,5 Laps. 
Driving these Tires for half a lap in not optimal condtions slows you down much more in most of the cases then taking an additional Pitstop.
As i said: the Numbers calculated in background might make a mathematical Sense. But this is not how its working in Real- or Sim-Life. An unecessary Pitstop would cost waaay more Time.

For 30 years I've mostly enjoyed war and turn-based strategy games. I have absolutely no interest in motorsports, just as I have no interest in football (soccer). But I like Football Manager, and I like this game even more.

Main reason is it's much more visceral during the actual race. And I can play the game with some level of competency without reading a manual, guide or watching (ugh) a drawn out youtube video. They've packed so much meaningful decisionmaking into the management and the race portions, I can't see getting bored for a long while. And then there's all those potentially enjoyable mods on tap.

It's one of the few (if any) games I've bought in a long time that is really worth full price in the long run. For example, I quickly refunded Paradox's Steel Division, but would definitely pick it up later on a 50% off sale. This purchase I don't think I'll every regret.

Of course, once I figure out what I'm doing I expect the game to be even more fun. The car set-ups are the least enjoyable thing for me, but it's probably cause I'm too lazy to read up on it. Where did that ""perfect set-up"" mod go? The only nitpick so far is the writing style for the fans' and media's comments. It's like ya man, I'm so cool. But hopefully, there will be a mod for that, if there isn't already.

No computer crashes, no bugs I've noticed, and it runs all-out on a vanilla i7 3.6 (16 ram) with a lousy GeForce GTX 745. I can't imagine how much ""real"" racing fans must be enjoying this, and would be surprised if any general strategy gamer would be disappointed with the purchase.

But still requires strategic deicision making with improving your car and team. I recommend this game to anyone who likes team management games.

Here we are. in the beginning, You all signed with me, Knowing I had no HQ to speak of, and the worst cars on the grid. Through hard work and dedication, Ups and downs, we managed to scrape ourselves off the bottom of the pack and finish our first season in European Series in 8th place overall. Not what we hoped for, but better then we expected. You all then decided to sign with me again, 2 year contracts each. With the dedicated goal of winning our first championship.

In our second season, We did far better. You bickered less, and worked better as a team unit. We were able to climb the ranks far higher then we expected based on last seasons proformance. We fought and battled our way to a third place finish overall in our second year together. It was an amazing year with a few race wins and a few more podium finishes. But it still wasn't enough.

With one year remaining on all of your contracts, We got right back to work for our third season in Europe. We could feel it in the air, This was OUR year. With contracts winding down, and no one sure where we would be this time next year. Everyone gave it their all. Trying to push for the win this year.

It was our hardest year yet. Fighting back and forth with Dragon Racing. The entire season only a few points seperating our two teams. They had more race wins then we did. Totaling 7/5. But we had better team positioning, often coming in 2nd & 3rd. Points were close the entire season, but we finally managed to pull ahead with points in the last two races.

We WON! After three long years together, we won the European Series Championship!
It was amazing to see how far we came from when we started. We have all grown so much, and put so much of ourselves into this racing team. Everyone was in shock that we actually managed to pull out the win.

But our celebrations were short lived, Everyones contract was up in a month. No one knew where they were going to be for next season, or even if they would have work. I aproched each of you seperately. Hoping you would be willing to give it another go in the Asia Pacific Championship. Everyone was on board, Except Hong Liou. You were not happy with the contract I offered and insited I pay you more given that you just won the European Series.
I reluctently agreed, and we were set for another 2 years in the new Asia Pacific Championship.

The year began very similar to our last year in Europe. The races were fast, and we were on top. Our team had become so well oiled, that even our mid feild cars couldn't hold us back. We were top 3 every single qualifying and race the entire series. We dominated in our new setting, and thrived as a team. We managed to win the Asia Pacific Championship in our first year there. No one expected that. Not even us. You all were so elated to know how good our team had gotten in just four years. Hong again won over Shen Qi. With a dominating 65 point gap.

Again I was approched about moving up to a higher challenge. I accepted it instantly in excitement. This is what I had been working for. This is what WE had been working for.

That brings us to now. The start of season 5. Our FIRST season in the Highest competition out there. The World Series.
I want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart. We have had great times together, and some not so great ones. But we were able to grow as individuals and as a team. Without you I don't think I could have made it here.

And now, Without any further Adue. I want to introduce you all, to your NEW REPLACEMENTS! In this season and all seasons to come after. I will need better drivers, desginers and mechanics if I want any chance to win.

All of your progress in developing technology is RESET whenever you step up to better competition. In the game there are several circuits in which you can compete. If you start at the bottom circuit and progress to the next tier then you lose all of the effort in designing a better car as the game resets you to a base value. This is supposed to be a management game. You have very few important decisions outside of the critical tech decisions. So the game takes all of your careful decisions that you made about which techs to focus on and throws them down the drain. There is no progression ouside of hiring drivers/mechanics/designers/buildings, as nothing else carries over. 

That's the core of this game. Developing your technology so you can be more competitive is what it's all about. Then the game resets that technology? Kills immersion and the sense of building something from the ground up. For that reason I feel that this game is poor. It's like having an RPG game without a story. Or having a strategy game without competent AI. This is a very poor 'management' game because there is little to manage. 

If they were to add some kind of persistent development for your team it would help me to enjoy it.

Over time, Playsport have turned MM from what was merely an alright game on launch day into a fantastic one, squashing the bugs and including many new features.  I highly admire the developers for this, because the post-release support shows that they were genuinely in this to create a great game, one that people would enjoy.  Many a lesser team would've taken the money and ran.

Another thing worth mentioning is this game's Steam workshop support.  The vanilla game may be great on it's own, but the workshop adds a lot more to it, ranging from simpler balance tweaks and car models, to full blown mods featuring real life drivers and championships.  Great solution for those who might see the lack of official licencing as a turn off, though I must say that the fictional world Playsport constucted in it's place can be a lot of fun too.

There's a balance and trade-off to be made with many different aspects of the car and driver.

The thing is whilst that is relatively simple to articulate, it's  completely different affair to begin to understand it. I mean, who has spare millions lying around to play around with a real motorsport team? Not many!

I got the game as the premise sounded interesting. Rather than driving the car, you would be in the pit lane directing the action. The question is, would this make an interesting experience. I'd tried Gran Turismo B-Spec mode before, and not really been enamoured with it. Would this be different, or just the same old same old in a slightly fancier outfit?

Diving into the game and just following the tutorial, it quickly became apparent that there was (a) a learning curve to go up and (b) there was more to the game than meets the eye. But it didn't really capture my attention until I started to make a few inspired ('lucky') strategic tyre decisions in a rainy race, and suddenly found myself no longer at the back of the pack but in the lead. All of a sudden it was a nail biting race to the finish as much faster drivers and cars slowly gained on my position... and fuel was getting low... would I even make it to the finish?

Most satisfying second place ever, and a realisation that if a game can draw me emotionally into watching virtual drivers go round a track, it must be doing something right.

This game is not another variation of a tried and tested formula. It's a little different. It will require you to think. It will require you to plan and strategise. It will require you to make some tough decisions.

What a gem.

PROS:

- All the glory, agony and soap-opera style drama you'd expect from professional racing. Drivers complain, develop attitudes/traits, grow and improve, grow old and retire, etc. Same with staff to a lesser degree.
- Lots of stuff to do from managing the finances (particularly if you create your own new race team) to building up the team's headquarters and facilities, scouting drivers and staff for possible hiring while firing or letting contracts run out on those you don't want to keep around if at the end of the season, designing the car in between season, designing improved parts during the season and improving the car overall in order to keep pace or attempt to surpass the competition on your path to glory. You can even customize the car's look/paintjob and also that of the team members.
- Choice to take over management of an existing team or creating a brand new team of your own. Be warned, it's a tall order to start with literally nothing but a starter car, some cash and basic staff and drivers. But then, therein lies the fun and satisfaction of the long-term play as you build a minnow team into a shark that eats up the competition. 
- Nicely done race strategy in which you can give individual drivers driving style orders, pit calls and decisions on fuel, tires, risk a fast pit stop or play it safe, gamble on if the rain is gonna last or will soon clear up and dry the track, etc. Many times races can be won and lost, or positions changes by these very important decisions taking place in realtime. Thankfully, you can pause the action (nice touch!) if you wanna think about something.
- Single player, take all the time you want. Also have a rolling auto-save feature that keeps the last 5 auto-saves just in case you really mess up bad and need to travel back in time.
- Women. They're everywhere! And bless 'em, some of them are great! Nice to see plenty of diversity in a game, as well there should be being that it is based on international motorsport competition.
- Game has been regularly updated.
- DLC is nice. GT cars not only add the GT cars but also some more tracks in addition to the ones already in the game. Also, DLC that allows you to create your own team and gives more customization options is great too. 
- There's a governoring sports association thing in the game that meets occasionally to discuss rules changes for the following season. So you get to vote on things like adding a track to the calendar to make the season longer, or adding that track in place of an existing track on the schedule, or you can decide to allow driver aids, spec engines, different types of qualifying formats and points payouts, etc., etc. This is a really nice feature of the game as well as it gives you the ability and immersion of being a part of something bigger than just your race team and which allows you to affect the direction and ever-changing nature of the sport itself.


CONS:
Not too many cons but a couple I feel need to be pointed out.

- The AI drivers and staff can be pretty static. Meaning, whenever you start a new career with a team you'll find the same starting drivers and staff on all the same teams. Which is ok I suppose, and there is a reason for that due to the games' challenges/mission.  However, the same drivers/staff with same potential and often same skills except the ones still developing and which you can steer/groom to improve differently than they may have otherwise. The only variance seems to be in the driver  traits as those seem to come along fairly randomly whether they are permanent or temporary traits. Mechanics will always have the same relationship skill with their driver pairing. Also, when drivers retire it becomes nearly predictable what rookies then show up in the free agent driver listing. And so once you play the game a couple of careers and get to know the drivers/staff over time as you scout them all to see their skills and potential then for all future seasons you then know who to hire and roughly when they'll be available if they are not in the starting allotment of drivers and personnel. That tends to take some of the fun and randomness out of the game. Still, just because you know where/when the drivers/staff are, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll always get them on your team as you still have to negotiate and beat out other teams' offers.

- Women. I already listed as a pro but many people consider it a con. So if you dislike the idea of a strong female presence in the game or female drivers winning races or even seeing an all-female podium occassionally then you'll probably want to get the ""realism mod for butthurt men"" that you can find on the internet and think it's also in the Steam Workshop for the game too. Me? I just run the game vanilla and have fun no matter the gender. It's a game.

WISHLIST:

- Would love to see a MotoGP DLC for the game as that would add more fun and depth to the game and possibly even allow the rare 2-wheel/4-wheel driver to create their own legend.

- Would love the ability to manage more than one time in a series at a time. For example, having my race team in both the Formula and GT series' respectively and being able to manage both or either/or as you like. While it's not necessary it would definitely up the immersion factor. But maybe that would be too much management?   ;-)

- To be honest, any and all racing series would be a great addition to the game over time and the game seems ready made to accept it all. A solid foundation of a game with a hopefully bright future.",1501747920,1501748196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Be prepared your team can fail from time to time, or that ego's can disturb the results and the relationships. If you love it, you will spend too much hours with this game. Patience and a lot of free time is demanded for this game.

pro: 

/5 championships, but you do only race one (and they keep you updated about the 4 other ones)
/invest a lot of money in your HQ to develop better raceparts or to train your drivers
/GMA rules could  change every year, and you have your part in it by voting in whatever way you want
/you can scout for better drivers and negiotiate a possible contract
/you can look for a better designer and mechanics 
/every designer and mechanic have options that can influence the development of the car (designer), or give the driver some extra advantage (mechanic). By the mechanic it happens by developping a relationship with its driver
/driving style has his effect on fuel and tyres. you can command your drivers' behaviour and change it immediatly during the race
/carcrashes do happen, but it is very plain and you get no clue how it happened
/morale of your drivers
/3 gamespeeds during racing
/you have to keep a big eye on your budget. Better raceresults can attrac better sponsors
/mod support



weird:

/as manager, you have to finetune the setup of the car for every race. Depending on the rules, you have the chance for practice driving for extra finetuning. Extra weird thing: they don't keep the data of your setups for future races on the same circuits
/never found an option to fine a driver who's ego could become way of limit



negative:

/don't expect shiny gfx, they are poor
/hard to see who  has the fastest lap during the race
/car behaviours are too squary and not smooth on circuits (especially in highest gamespeed modus)
/cars can drive through other cars without a crash as result
/practice and qualify parts can be simulated, and that can go very wrong
/random traits that can result in a bad behaviour of your driver for a very long time

The biggest dissapointment aspect of the game is the depth of management and details, compare to other sport management games. Driver stats and improvement seem artificial and unrealistic, very limited driver/staff contract term/rules, poor AI decisions in race tactic, for example: we have big chance to win 1-2 position for both our drivers when racing in rain because enemy team AI seem always too late when making decision to change their tyre and the result our car will be so far ahead nobody can't catch up. No in depth car setting, we only have to slide 3 bar to find correct setting for each race and our mechanics will forget the setting next year for the same track, repeated same interview question and after few race we already memorize all the good answer.

Our team will be unbeatable after 3 season in the same league or 5 season if we have a very weak team. because enemy team not improving or at least improve in very slow rate, this will force us to accept promotion for more challenge and it will repeat, in 2-3 season our team will win almost all race and we promote again only to become unbeatable team in the next 2 season.

This game is not offering good challenge for veteran of sport team management games, if i want to compare it for example with Football Manager series, this game only contain probably 10-20% of in depth/detail management option.

Despite all the flaws, the game is still good and fun to play, very good game design and have huge potential to become  legendary game in sport management genre.

Upon loading [b][i]Motorsport Manager[/i][/b] you are launched straight into a tutorial mode taking you through a race weekend and what you need to learn between races to turn your chosen team to manage into a championship winner. The tutorial is lengthy, but bear with it as it is informative. Following this, you get helpful hints accessed through a floating question mark over pretty much every area until you get up to speed.

As soon as that race finishes, you want to see how the result affects the championship, go through the debrief of the race weekend and immediately prepare for the next race. That notion of “just one more” is here, and before you know it you've been playing for four hours. You can expect to spend an hour in a full race cycle, from preparing the team for a race at the factory and doing the race weekend. Seasons will take a long time to complete so there is plenty of depth within [b][i]Motorsport Manager[/i][/b].

Playsport Games has truly captured the essence of F1 without the need of a license. The off-track politics  are wonderfully included and the foundations have certainly been laid for what could be motorsport's answer to Football Manager.

[b][i]Motorsport Manager[/i][/b] is a very fun and unique racing game that allows you to focus on so much more than steering and acceleration. A much more realistic racing game than one where you just drive, this game gives you the experience to see how good your driving decisions really are, and with great graphics and a easy to learn set of controls, this game is a fun addition to any gaming library.

Take football manager for an example, that game fully immerses you in to everything. This does not. The design of upgrades to the car is terrible the modiers on drivers and staff are terrible and the building upgrades need to be imprroved. If they bought the licence to fully implement single seater real life teams and sponses with more drivers and staff and realistic stats that can be improved it would be well worth the full asking price maybe even a bit more. Managing a racing team would be very intricate and it seems like motor sport manager has over simplified everything.

- More stuff to do between races and in the pre-season
- Maybe a more complex parts design, it gets kinda repetitive and simple with time
- Remove the relegation systems, maybe add a feature where constructors choose to pull out or enter a championship (just like F1)
- The buildings (HQs...) are too simple and once you upgrade them all there is nothing much else to do
- More accurate and complete statistics and historical data on teams, drivers, mechanics, where we can see exactly how well a pilot performed in a past season, with info regarding positions, wins, and such on each track, and titles, etc for example

For example:

Having selected the top team to play, imagine the excitement of being in 4th place a little less that 20 seconds behind 3rd, 2nd and 1st.  My pit stops are done and they still have to come in.  When the do, my drive is directed to burn everything, fuel, tires etc. to catch them in the pits.  Can he do it???  1st place is about to exit the pit when my driver comes sweeeping down the main straight and passes him just as he exits !!!  What fun.  Or another instance when my driver was trailing 1st place by less than 2 seconds, but fuel is running low and the tires are worn.  I need my scheduled pit stop, so I resign to coming in and losing contact with 1st place.  Lo and behold he comes in right in front of me.  My team give me a great pit stop.  When we pull out of our stalls, we are side by side, drag racing down pit road (at 40 MPH pit road max speed) !   Exiting the pit, I edge into first place and the rest is history.  What a thrill !

The racing is intense, but the management and car set up is straigh forward.  Mangement tasks are simplified and not time consuming.  Build new parts for the cars, improve performance or reliability.  Staff management is also easy.  You only have a lead designer and two chief mechanics, one for each driver.  Sponsors for the car, pick which suits your financial needs.  Scout new drivers as needed and also new staff.  Upgrade you HQ is costly, but is also not complex.

The e-mail system is engaging with as sorts of interesting items from interviews from the press to proposed rule changes that you will need to consider.

The race weekend arrives and during practice, you need to get the right setup for the track you are racing on.   I am not a technical geek when it come to racing and things like wing angles, tire pressures, camber, gear ratios and shock tensions are tedious to me.  They are here too, but the beauty of the interface here is that you are looking a only three things that affect performance.  Down force, Handling and Speed Balance.  Your setup is to find the best balance in those 3 catagories.  Yes you have to adjust the technical items, but they show the changes in those 3 performance categories.  Pretty cool and simple.  Take the car out on the track and bring it in to see what the drive says about the performance from very poor to excellent.  Adjust what is not good and go back out to see what the adjustments equal in performance.  Simply brilliant in get the car balanced.

There are some things that I have for a wish list.

1. Segment replay.  When something happens to the car I don't have the camera on, it would be nice to be able to pause and replay a segment on the track.  In that replay segment, it would be really cool to have different camera angles, including in car.

2. Multiplayer would be nice.  I not sure at what level, but I have a friend that plays and it would be nice to set up a season with our two teams in it and see who tops out at the end of the season.

3.  It would be great to be able to customize the paint schemes on the cars, especially the GT version.

Bottom line - if you are a race fan, then Motorsport Manager is a must  ! ! !

It would be nice if most of the improvements you make to your car during the season went on to the next season. Or an alternitive to this would give us the ability to upgrade two parts at the same time so that we can upgrade the parts for both cars.

The setup screen for the cars is way too vague and the drivers input dring testing is very vague too. Sometimes the driver says the handling is too stiff but he means the handling is too soft. Sometimes the driver tells me a setting is perfect only to tell me the setting is wrong a few laps later. 

I would like the mechanics suggestion (green area in setup screen) narrow the longer the mechanic is in the team. Maybe have the car go to the test track a few times during a season so that he can familiarise himself with the car so that we don't have to still guess so much during practice for the perfect setup. The mechanics suggestion is far too wide and you can still get a very bad setup. Even with 16 minute practices I can never get a perfect setup and a lot of the time the driver isn't happy with the car even after bringing him four or five times.

It would be nice if we had the ability to make the races go faster. Add two more steps to the speed to make it go to about 6x.

I would like to have a camera angle behind the car while racing. Following the car in while pointing the direction the car is going.

With or without DLC, with or without Workshop mods, this represents Motorsport really good.
It's fun to create a team with your name, give it logos, colors and an own livery on the car and slowly but steady lead it to the top.
I wouldn't give a 10/10, but it's a solid 8.5/10.

Pros:
- Motorsport from the managers' POV, something rare
- quite ""realistic"" growth rates when it comes to the acquisition of staff and drivers
- high difficulty, when you create a team without the ""Brooks' Bonus""-Mod
- at least some things on the to-do-list between races
- motivating to play more
- some good mods, despite the relatively small playerbase
- good price (when in sale)
- great UI, better than some triple-A games 

Cons:
- a small lack of statistics (e.g. you dont have a list of ""races won"" where you can see which driver gave you a victory)
- when having completed 6 seasons or more, the game runs out of ""new"" things to discover
- not enough liveries to be actually interested in creating new ones every season
- reaaaally slow growth in the ""create a team"" mod
- finances are dull to increase, prize money + sponsors, that's it
- even when driver aid systems are disabled by a rule vote, it doesnt feel like the driver is THAT important
- enemy teams create funds (for improving the HQ e.g.) apparently by dark magic and still improve their cars at a pretty fast pace
- races are time-intense even on 3x speed
- in-race decisions beside pit stops are more or less gimmicks

In the end, it's you that counts: Are you interested in motorsport and the formula one? Buy it.
Are you interested in manager games where you need to bring man and machine together in harmony? Buy it.
If neither of these 2 things pick your interest, don't buy it.

Dont start creating your own team from scratch it will be very hard for you especially in the first season to get everything together. I started with the Cobra team and had a certain Damon Hill as my lead driver. My team were predicted to finish 2nd to last in the constructors and for most of the forgettable first season it was like that...parts were designed all the time...parts broken in mid race all the time. This got pretty frustrating especially also when the cars kepr running out of the fun. This game is not easy to start with at all (unless you start with a bigger team). As time goes on your team will improve and become more reliable but you need to invest in a lot of time and patience in this game.

Graphics are good...I recommend getting the mods (Im playing the 1989 one at the moment to bring back memories when F1 was exciting), sound is just one annoying tune though and the odd crowd and engine noise.

So will I recommend this...well yes as its the only decent motorsport management game really around.

Pros:
-Challenging and balanced no matter how had or easy you make the game. At least in the create your own team in world cup campaign.  
-Verity of technology to research and improve your vehicle.
-States matter in this game but slightly improve with new improvement or overtime. In other words, nothing large happens instantly like the real world.
-Relationships, decisions, skills, and character straits matter.
-Money tycoon at the start of your career in create your own team.
-Major time killer
-Graphics looks good, but at times, a bit glitchy in taking turns in 3D mode

Cons:
-Addicting
-Sometimes too challenging. 
-Requires a strong soul because expect to lose some races in career mode 
-Saving! Trust me it’s really addicting to save evetime when you have to make a decision, then go back and retry if the desired outcome did not happen.
-At time races are boring and feels like a grind, particularly long 32 lap races with practice and qualifying rounds. 
-No action. Not an action game, but more like passive spectating.
-Requires a lot of time.
-Did I motion it’s addicting.

Recommending
-People who want a challenging, managing, time killer, (grinding), leveling, researching game, then this may be the game for you so please go and try it.
-If you are looking for action, actual racing game in a car, weak souled (where you always win (get a real life)) game, then I suggest you try some other game.

There are however still bugs and issues, missing text strings here and there and the AI in changing weather conditions is awful.

The other main thing I don't like is the mini game for qualifying, although you can skip this and doing so would normally result in better qualifying than trying the mini game yourself.

The spoiler for me is reading a guide which explains the way to beat the game. While unrealistic and unfair it made sense that having thre worst paid drivers, aiming for 10th team, coming last and spending all money on upgrading all buildings before moving forward would give you an advantage over the AI teams and perhaps the only way of beating the game.

Sure, the management mechanics aren't exactly the most detailed we've ever seen, and they're sure as hell not revolutionary, but the R&D system and personnel management are both very satisfying to interact with. That top driver you've eyed up isn't going to join your no-name team without making it worth is while, and that means less money to build parts to train your R&D staff so they can make parts that you would even consider putting into a car.

But your R&D staff can't make stuff from nothing. They need facilities. Bloody expensive facilities at that, and that's yet more money the Chairman isn't going to like to see the back of. Oh, and that crap press interview you gave after the last race? That probably just put off that killer sponsorship you were hoping for, so kiss goodbye to that £1,000,000 cash you were relying on coming in.

6/10 - above average

I'd really like to recommend this game, but it really isn't enough for me to do so.

Motorsport Manager is REALLY fun at first. Especially the races are fun to watch.

However, after 2-3 seasons, you've seen it all. Very little content, repeats itself pretty fast.
The whole game is pretty shallow, no realism or depth behind anything, no fine-tuning.
The learning curve stops where it should steepen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The interviews and events repeat themselves very quickly. Additionally, their quantity lacks, too.
- There is no real interaction with drivers and staff, however there should be more, since they are the backbone of you 
   team, obviously. And you should have to check up on them to ensure they're doing fine.
- Generally, not much to do between the races. 
- Very narrow selection of drivers and staff, very few unique personal traits.
- You can't do anything with the buildings, zero interaction, just generic unlocks and stat gain.
- The driving itself sometimes is pretty unrealistic and there are no collisions where there should 
  be

Yes, you COULD mod additional content (interviews etc.) into the game and i know, that MM does everything to support that. The problem being:
The game itself provides little to no base mechanics to build upon.

There is NO REALISM and ZERO DEPTH behind everything. Just take the higher numbers and done. There you go.

The biggest issue here, the most obvious one, is the car development (-progress) and the racing itself.
Instead of being able to fine-tune certain aspects of certain part in a simplyfied, but realistic approach, you just have every part's power defined as one single number (2, counting reliability), that's it.
No actual testing, no fine-tuning, nothing. 
Sure, you're the manager, not the mechanic you might think, but in the end, you'd have the final word on how and where to improve the engine and what to change, right? You'd expect you could actively test your brakes or engines on the test track and let your drivers practise there, but no. Nothing.


If you sell a game for that price, you should atleast provide a wide array of basic mechanics. You can't simply rely on the workshop to mod everything for you. Even tho this might legit be the strategy behind this title.

The tutorial (if selected) sort of hovers over you as you play the actual game, instead of being something that you have to do separately.

Online/LAN Multiplayer Career:
I´m not asking for online servers so that strangers can meet and play, or compete. No, I´m suggesting something simple to add, like the possibility to invite steam friend to join in a career mode. I suggest to benchmark the multiplayer used by Football Manager game. I know, there is a few things that need to be changed to make this mode more dynamic, like in-game PAUSE and probably unable different championship divisions, but still, it´s possible to do it and it will increase tremendously the appeal for this game.

Create/Edit Pilots:
I mean, it would be a nice add for the game if it was possible to create new pilots, with diferent skills, to be use in-game. I suggest the Character Creator from Crusaders Kings II, where you can balance the skills with positive and negative traits.

Own Engine Development:
Like Formula 1, the teams that has a car factory could develop engines from its own brands, and if other teams would like to use it, they could pay for it. I think it will give a nice touch in the game and a money boost for the ones who aims to create its own car factory.

I know there are other things that could be improved in the game, but I hope you guys consider this suggestions, because you have a nice game on your hands and it can be even nicer.

PS: I know it appears that I have a few hours in-game, but I was playing with another account before, where I already finished 6 seasons with my own created team, so I really enjoy a lot of the game already.

This is basically a light version of football manager but for f1 instead. It is a very well polished games with way prettier graphics than FM, a very nice menu system and a very good tutorial. 

However, I feel like you, the manager, can not have the same amount of impact the same way you can in football manager due to the game mechanics. In football manager you can if you're very good with smart transfers, good tactics, moral talks etc lift a very poor team quite quickly, say take a bottom team to mid table and beat expections. I do not feel that is possible to the same extent in motorsport manager (although, I admit there's a possiblity that I just suck and perhaps don't know the game well enough yet). I've only played the worst team in the lowest tier so far but I feel like it is way harder to have an impact compared to managing a low team in football manager and it is basically just waiting for the new season to come around so you can upgrade stuff and eventually catch up. The whole ""tactics"" part of the game is not there.

My biggest issue with the game though is how slow it is to get through each race. You can run the game at 3 different speeds, but even running it at highest speed possible (and you should as there is very little things to micromanage during a race and you can just pause when you need to) a race is still fucking slow and takes a a good 20-30 min to get through.

Pros:

-Well polished, good graphics, run well, good menu system, good tutorial. 
- It is fun
- easy to get into, not overly difficult

Cons:

- The management is basically toned down in every department compared to football manager, scouting, transfers, player / driver interaction, media handling, tactics are all much more simplistic.
- Your impact as a manager is reduced compared to football manager due to the game mechanics putting a stronger emphasis on money and gear than tactics, team tealks etc.
- The game speed is too slow and I feel like it takes too long to get through each race, esp considering there is not enough things to tinker with during a race.

- More free DLC includes a bonus pack of liveries to customize your cars look. It costs a hefty sum to edit your cars visually which is more appreciated realism!

You have to manage everything from the building of new parts and improving those parts all the way down to personnel conflicts and giving interviews about your team.

[b]What I like[/b]:
+ It has a decent basic varieties within the game: type of motor sport, tier system, rules, drivers availability, random event, etc. I feel the game captures all the basic requirements in terms of content.
+ The progression system is satisfying: you can grow the team that you lead from lowest tier to the highest tier and making them competitive with all the upgrades. You can also apply for that job in higher division.
+ The financial side of the game is challenging, not hard but also definitely not easy. What I like is that the game has a budget predicition per race, so that you are always aware on your situation.

[b]What I dislike[/b]:
- The quallifying session has an annoying mini game to me. If you don't like it, you can let it done automatically. In overall, I have never succeed in qualy, always underperform. I end up using skip session just to see the final results, except when I see there is a weather change within the session - you must exploit it.
- There is no way to save a car setup in based on a track. Everytime you come to the same track in the following year, although your car may be different, it is like you know nothing about it. What I did in the end is just looking at the community guide where a well-made car setup is available.

The good (some of them): it is an engaging game if you like management games and are ok to watch the race and manage it rather than drive yourself (driving is not possible since this is a management game)
It can be chalenging sometimes to take responsability for the fails of the team, instead of cursing at the driver who crashed because you told him (or her) to push instead of driving safe :D

You get to hire drivers and mechanics, decide what buildings to add to your HQ, decide which parts to improve on. Having a long term strategy is important. You get to manage the race which adds to the entertainment.

Drivers get some permanent traits as they get older as well as some temporaty ones which make everything less predictable and more engaging

What can be improved: the tooltips could be better (there are still some adjustments I can make to the car which I do not undrestand completly)
I wish I could save the emails from the scout (looks to me like the very old ones are deleted automatically)
More diverse and fun reporting of the race results would be nice (maybe also a few ways to watch the race after it is complete and just enjoy the highlights of the race in nice cinematics)

I don't watch racing

I know nothing about cars aside from being able to change my own oil (but i'm too lazy and take it to a mechanic anyway)

BUT 

I love simulations done right, management sims especially. 

If I can learn a bit more about the subject of the sim? Bonus. 

I. Freaking. Love. This Game. I started out managing a small American racing team. It took a few years, smart HQ investments to be able to design, research and use better parts. After a ton of hard work, I started winning races. Out of 10 teams in our division, We're now in third. The accomplishment feels awesome. Learning to make the smallest of tweaks in practice sessions to figure out the perfect tuning for a race, and then watching your driver get to the podium? Man. I never tire of it. 

Graphics are good for a sim game, watching the races tends to be exciting and fun. The strategy of knowing when to pit or when to push your car can have you white knuckling until the finish. 

I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys sports sim games. I'm sure if you actually know more about cars than I do it's even more fun, but that's my point: This game is great, even to someone who doesn't watch or have any interest in following racing...well...I didn't before playing this, now I think I'm going to pop in the Senna documentary.

It's awesome to finally have a management game in a sport I enjoy watching and sim-ing, and Motorsport Manager certainly held me for a long time. In fact, with mods, it still does.

The environments are beautiful, the updated car models are chunkier and more substantial, so those livery changes finally show up as more than the simple two-tone designs we had at release. Playing the staff and driver market is fun, and working your way up the field is rewarding. For the casual gamer who enjoys motorsport, this game is an absolute must have. If you don't do racing, but enjoy management sims, you'll likely enjoy this too.

A couple of big negative points though, which I feel are more a me thing than a game issue:-
As a power gamer, I found after about 50 hours or so, everything got seriously easy. The AI are, unfortunately, too dim to challenge a player who knows what they are doing, and they struggle to keep up with your pace of car development whenever you hit a stat reset. The same goes for qualifying in a session that has a wet and dry period, where the AI don't look ahead in the weather reports, and then set their quali times in the dry on Inters.

The second thing is there are too many ways for a player to abuse a system for their gain - notably the Risk system on car develpment, which makes the game even easier (I didn't even use this method and still found a lack of difficulty).

However, with the game being so easy to mod for beginners (simple editing of databases), and the ability for more advanced users to modify the actual code of the game, difficulty and overhaul mods have been made which can keep even power gamers like myself challenged and engaged. A huge boon to modding is that mods can be grabbed both with or without Workshop, and can be mixed and matched as you see fit.

Without mods - I would only recommend this to casual gamers, regardless of whether you are a motorsport fan or not. If you play an hour here or there and want your progress to not be too slow, then it's a good title for you.

With mods - There is now something for everyone, and if you like your games challenging and you want to be in it for the long haul, you can opt for that experience while still enjoying the visually beautiful game that PlaySport have brought us.",1496168110,1496168110,True,110,3,0.906474292278289795,2,True,False,False

You can decide how to run your team, lots of decision making whether it be on the track in realtime during a race or between races where you need to manage all aspects of your motorsport team.

Couple of things I would like to see:
- When in game either start the camera angle to match the angle of the HUD map or add a button to do it.
- When exiting the game after doing a save it prompts if you want to quit without saving even though you just saved, so it would be better if it didn't prompt if you don't change anything after save.",1479723358,1495475106,True,1,0,0.50304257869720459,0,True,False,False

The good: Hours of your life will melt away in this game. Though not state of the art, graphics are immersive. I really feel apart of the team in the game. Realistic racing grooves used by the AI (most of the time). Engine sounds consistant with what the car is doing. Garage/pit road sfx good. Backstage politics, such as the literal politics of voting, contract negotiations, interviews, and driver happiness all tie in well with the ultimate challenge of winning races and making money.

Needs improvement: I would like updates or further installments of this game put more reward on winning. I want to see my driver model on the podium, receiving kisses from the podium girls, receiving the trophy, spraying champagne. Even interviewing rooms could be installed to add realism. I also would like to see better camera angles. It would be cool to have angled as if you are watching it on television or on board. Keep the aerial, but just add more options.

The bad: AI battling for position needs a good look at. I am tired of seeing my 2nd place qualifying position get dropped to 10th on the start of the race and stay there until the first round of pitstops. Either this needs fixed to make it so cars pass each other easier or have another political avenue such as rivalries. Make it so that a trait is added for a specific driver to make it hard to pass them for the next few races or something in retaliation for not allowing an easy pass. Tutorials, tutorials, tutorials! Everything needs covered, not just the basics. I went to google and youtube far too often. Also, despite being out for quite awhile, there are still some bugs needing weeded out. I am concerned about this because I hope the company is not ditching this game. I'd hate for such a strong foundationed game to be put on the shelf when it has so much potential!

If you're into strategy/management sims then you'll like this game.
If you're into motor racing then you'll like this game.
If you're into both, like I am - then you'll absolutely love this game.

This game is just a pure out and out extremely detailed, multi-faceted, challenging and realistic motor racing management sim. Period.  

Struggling to think of any negatives, because, really, I can't, but the only slight snags are:

1.) Real life teams, drivers and sponsors are not licensed, but this is not a big issue as you can quickly download MODS which provide all three very easily.
2.) Long-term, the game does become repetitive and once you reach the top echelons it's very easy.
Again, this isn't really a big issue, as you can always start over again, or quit your team and join a new one.
If you're still bored, there are challenges to complete and obviously plenty of pretty challenging achievements to unlock.
3.) The AI is pretty dumb on race day/quali at adapting to different weather conditions.
I personally don't find this a big issue as if you are starting out with an uncompetitive team, you can exploit this to your advantage for some sneaky points.
Besides, if you wanted to, you could always edit the game config to change the AI difficulty.

My two drivers - let's call them Dave and Emma - are at the top of the championship, with Dave 9 points ahead.. They're enough points ahead of everyone else that the title is just between them now. They've grown to hate each other, and Dave's ontract is up for renewal at the end of the season - but won't renew while Emma is with the team.

I decide to let them race for it, as we're far enough ahead in the team championship that we should still win it unless there's a freak result. The only team that can beat us is Ferrari (well, a legally safe knockoff of Ferrari), but it's a long shot. My drivers are starting at the back, because of the reversed grid rule. 

At the start, Dave and Emma immediately begin scything through the field, with Emma slightly ahead. The Ferrari drivers are first and second, but nothing to worry about yet - until Dave crashes on lap 3. Fuck. Emma now just needs to finish in the top 8 to win the title. I check the team standings - and then remember it's a double points race. Ferrari are going to win the title. 

Welp. 

Emma gives it her best shot and gets up to 8th, enough to win the title. I tell her to keep pushing, as we've got a team championship to win. With 2 laps to go, she's running third, behind the Ferraris. At this point, we're just three points short. Just when I had accepted losing, the second Ferrari starts pouring black smoke.

I couldn't believe it. As the Ferrari slows to a crawl, Emma swoops past for second place. The broken Ferrari eventually finishes fifth, giving Emma the driver's title and my team the championship. Fantastic.

1. Driver development is virtually non-existant. At the rate my drivers improve, even with upgraded facilities, they'll be in their 30s before they reach their potential. It's means you're forced to sign expensive drivers that already have a high rating rather than young cheaper drivers with good potential.
2. Drivers and staffs wage demands are ridiculous. Offering to more than double their current wage and bonuses quite often isn't enough.
3. Constant crashes. I'm getting to the stage it's usually one per day and usually just after a race just before it saves. I find myself sitting with fingers crossed that I manage to get to the auto-save after each race.
4. AI at the start of races. Drivers saying to themselves ""I'm just going to sit in this queue for the first corner in 15th place while the drivers from 18th and 19th jump the queue up to 9th and 10th place"".
5. Practice speeds bearing no relevance to race pace. I can go out at the end of practice with the engine turned up and be 2.5s faster than everyone else. I'd then expect in the race that I'd at least be able to keep pace with the leaders using the same settings however it's common to find yourself dropping to last and then dropping back at a second a lap.",1492529435,1492529435,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

And you spend a lot of time in the races. Your in race decisions basically boil down to tire choice and when to pit. 90% of your in race performance is the car and driver. You can screw up things with poor pit choices, but after a while it's pretty clear what to do and you're just watching the game play itself out.

The meta game is interesting. Lots of choices on who to hire, managing contracts, etc. It's well done. To some extent, it's just a matter of grinding races for money and watching your team inexorably rise as you buy better, well, better everything. But it's a fun grind.

An awesome mix of different decission levels:

+ long term: how do i manage my headquarter, staff, technical and finance strategy
+ middle range: how do i play the season (money, car development, ranking ...)
+ situative decisions: training, qualifying, racing tactics

On every level and situation your plan can be damaged or enriched by your decission.

You can scale your engagement and game objectives: just win a race, play a good season or bring your team up from a lower league to one of the best racing teams of the world (needs time, strategy and patience).

Anyway: if your looking for a challenging simulation without easy, lucky winnings Motorsport Manager is good choice with outstanding game mechanics. Easy to learn, hard to handle.

I'm dimly aware of an expansion I was really looking forward to, and a Humble Monthly that has unlocked, but I don't care - Predator Racing needs me, and I need them.

Following the advice from another review, I chose to manage Predator Racing, the bottom team in the bottom league.  It's been quite a ride, and aspects of the game have only just started to make sense to me, 58 hours in.  It SEEMS innocent enough - recruit and appoint drivers, fit out cars, decide on a pit strategy and use it.

But things keep happening.  Safety cars come out and destroy the lead you worked to build - or fail to.  Rain looks like it's clearing up, but sometimes it's a pause in the downpour, not an end to it. And then there's the fact that (unlike most games with 'manager' in the title) this game is simulating a managerial career.  So decisions that might annoy the owner might also get me fired.

After 3 seasons, I've promised the chairman that we'll finish 7th this year.  (How anyone gets the achievement for a season 2 championship with Predator is beyond me at the moment.)

At times, the grind involved with building parts can be a bit frustrating and it's not without a few minor bugs here and there (even after the March patch), but it's very well presented, has a crisp-sounding genre-suitable soundtrack and has enough about it to keep you interested for quite a while.

It can be a bit daunting at first, but it soon reveals itself to be more of a simcade as opposed to a hardcore management sim, which is both a pro and a con, I suppose.

There are quite a few areas it could be improved (a review probably isn't the place to go into that, though), and so if an MM2 is on the cards, then I expect it could go on to be one of the must-have titles for fans of management sims.

Motorsport Manager, though, is a great foundation to work from and, if I didn't know it, I wouldn't have been able to tell it had originated on the mobile-gaming platform. In fact, I didn't, and I couldn't.

Since some time the biggest problem that I have is not to find games with a lot of realism, but games with a lot of fun. I have to say that MM lacks sometime of realism, but maybe is exactly for that reason that I can play it for hours and still wanting to go on for ""just another race"".

The atmosphere is great and the usage of appropriate mods helps you to feel competing in real life championships. The translations are wonderful; I am playing in italian and I feel that they didn't just translated the texts, but used slangs that are typical in my language. 

I find the mechanism to improve the car during the season challenging and clear, but also in this case not that much realistic. I don't know if this is a conscius decision to make the game more enjoyable, but I have to say that it works and that I guess I am enjoying it more than a full realistic  process.

There are still some possible improvements that should be considered also at this not realistic simulation status:
- maybe is a small thing, but during the free pratice there are no ways to know how many laps will last the race! Since during the free pratice you can gain experience with the typres type, it would make sense to have know how long will be the race, in order to plan which tyres you want to test.
- I played two season now and basically it never happened that one of my drivers did during the qualifying a better time in the second run than in the first one. That makes still less sense if you consider that normally at the end of the session the grip is higher!
- it would be great if it would be possible to copy the balance of a car to the other one and above all to copy the balance from the previous year! After finding the right setting in 2016 I don't have the will to start from scratch for the 2017... I would prefere to use the set of the previous year as basis (I am pretty sure that it is how it works in real race as well :) ). You could also consider how much time a driver raced in a specific circuit to improve his/her level of experience.
- the contract negotations are horrible! I understand that you have to pay a penalty if you take a driver/engineer from another team while the older contract is still running, but you should be able to close a contract for the future. And also I think that it would be better to have more staff than just an engineer and two mechanics: it would make more challenging having a five star team.
- I would like to have more transparency to understand how the car for the next year will be influenced by the development of the car for the current one.",1491305455,1491305455,True,2,0,0.537239015102386475,0,True,False,False

I have wanted a good racing management game ever since. Motorsport Manager is that game. It’s easy to get into, but still gives the player countless decisions to make that impact everything from finances to the race itself.

It is thoroughly addicting, building a team, setting up the cars in practice, and then trying to determine the perfect plan for the race. What advantages to use, which tires, how many laps of fuel, and how long is that rain going to last? Then in the off season, trying to decide on the best people and infrastructure, while still saving money for parts and next year’s car? It is a constant struggle. The game is choice after choice where everything seems important. It’s maddening and addicting trying to figure out why I am still struggling in my 4th season of the lowest division.

It looks great, the tilt-shifted races are beautiful, and the atmosphere sounds are also good. My complaints are that much of the interface retains the tablet born simplicity with a lack of information. Everything is easy to read and get to, but I would rather have had more information on the screen instead of the huge interface boxes. I want to see lap histories, sector info, fuel breakdowns, etc. They could include a lot more stats and put them in the data window where new players could ignore them, but veterans could dig into. The game is great because it is so easy, but it also leaves me wanting more.

Also, why can’t I save car designs or see both cars set-ups at once on the set-up screen? Little things like that make me wish for more.

My biggest complaint comes from overly predictable game events and the complete lack of a manual. The game is very predictable. How many pace cars will I get on lap 2 in a season? In one season 8 out of 11 races had a pace car on lap 2. Always lap 2. More than likely, if a car is going to crash, it will be on lap 2. I have seen a pace car on a lap other than lap 2 once (which came after a pace car on lap 2). It would also be nice if the game was a bit more realistic. A team wants to send their cars out on a soaked track on super softs? There should be spins and accidents, but usually it just means slower lap times. Car retirements, even from being stupid, are rare.

But the lack of a manual for a game like this is just horrible. I have almost 50 hours in the game and I still don’t understand everything. There are so many factors to everything it is often hard to determine what exactly is going wrong. Are my tires worthless this race because of improper management, the outside temperature, the tracks wear level, or because this new chassis is horrible on tires? A lot of the help bubbles are good, but they provide basic information which is rarely enough. Often, I have no idea what a car or driver’s stats actually do, or how the system works. There are numerous guides and forums posts to help, but I often feel like they aren’t much more than what I already know. I find myself searching for dev’s forum posts just so I can get a bit of a glimpse of the how game works.

Still, I love the game, it is a lot of fun if you like management games. I am just hoping for a Motorsport Manger 2 with an in-depth interface and a proper manual.

First of all, as a racing fan, this is hands down one of the most engaging games I've ever played. I will play it for a long time to come and I'm already thinking about the Monza (Milan) race I'm set up to play tomorrow. Nothing like some racing on a sunday! 

Have I got new ideas for the setup and strategy? I didn't have a good time out there earlier in the season, I misjudged the weather and paid badly for it. I'm in my pre-season target position in the standings, but it's close, each race is a battle to hold that position and just when I think I've got my car development right where I want it, all performance and reliability neatly full and organized between my 1st and 2nd driver, my opponents just keep developing.. it becomes another race - against time and money - to get that new engine out and reliable enough for the upcoming race.

I also took a risk in pre-season in my allocation for this years car, it didn't pay off though I'll know next time, which put me on the back foot from the jump, to say the season has been a challenge is an understatement. I went into it thinking aha, I've clocked it! I'll set my expectations high and let the money and fame flow. The game brought me back to earth with a bang. 

Going into the last 2 races, the pressure's on.

It's experiences like this that draw you into the game, that give you that 'one more race' feeling and that trick of the mind that makes you think like you're a real team principal. That's the hook for this game, and it's backed up by stunning graphics and race simulation. 

Having seen the races in all different angles at this point, I think my favourite is top down 3D, it makes the circuits feel more alive to me, and the circuits are packed with detail. Everything you'd expect really, crowds with many littering the fencing around the track, tents, coaches, ambulances, cranes, all manner of buildings, helicopters, planes and on and on.. when the cars are flying round in this view, you could almost swear all the people are moving, walking, cheering.. and not just still in place. Suffice to say.. What they have managed to achieve with the simulation, and that's before you get to the generally superb actual simulation of high level motorsport on track, is truly incredible. Water on track, racing lines developing over time, and then washed away by the rain - the effects of which are excellent - safety cars, virtual and real, all types of rules and regulations all presented and processed accurately. 

Big thanks to the developers for delivering such a great core to the game. 

There could be more depth to the wider world, I don't find all that much interest in scouting as it currently stands, it feels more like an obligation than a vast world of racing to explore, perhaps after 10+ seasons the world will take more shape but I'd definitely appreciate more detail given to drivers and staff, more history, more.. seriousness. The people and their personalities can feel a little cartoony, in ways that have made me laugh out loud once or twice (my driver getting a crush on his teammate..) but for me, takes you out of the immersion of a real serious sporting world and I feel more balance can be achieved here with some thought put into the next installment down the road, you know.. in a way SI never bothered to do with the FM series.

The HQ is a real cool feature, but I don't have that many reasons to keep going back, and all teams look the same and build the same (dependant on it's needs, but it's choices are fairly linear). With some different country or region variations, team colours and logos, and even specific buildings available for each team, you could easily see this becoming one of the shining parts of a future game. However, I wouldn't like to see it become the interface (click this building to go to scouting etc.), the interface as it stands is bright, clean, easy to understand and nice to use and look at. 

The car and car development screen is good, easy to use, some nice additions would be different background screens for the different areas, perhaps different parts of a garage/factory for backgrounds, and more individual staff to hire and interact with here would give this section more depth. 

There are a handful of random little things, like being able to save and copy setups, that I could mention as 'wants' here but I know others have covered these in more detail in reviews and posts, and I don't want to go looking for small negatives when I genuinely adore this game, it's absolutely brilliant and if you have even a passing interest in racing or sports management you NEED to check this out. If you've got this far then you're probably someone who already knows that create your own team has been added, which is a great addition along with liveries and a GT pack (should have come with more liveries surely?) so I'll just give a passing mention to those as an example of the great work devs are still putting into it. 

It's not perfect but it's damn close, and I can't wait to play it again tomorrow.

I tried it out two weeks ago when there have been a 7 day free play period...and imo thats a great thing other publishers should think of too. I wouldnt have bought this game otherwise because its not really cheap if you dont know what you get and theres a lot of crappy manager games out there.

Pro:
- really good graphics for a manager game
- good sounds, espacially at the races
- good tutorial and easy to learn game functions...very intuitive...
- you can activate/deactivate Steam Workshop mods directly inside the game with one click
- good sponsor/advertising system 
- good car creation (gear, motor etc. colors, and much more)
- you can change racing rules for the next season...really great and it can change the gameplay (and your tactics) completely ;)
- nice to have: a kind of twitter feedback from fans and other drivers and interviews via mail which can have direct affects to your drivers
- technical professional developed...no lags, no crashes, no problems, good performance
- long time motivation because of 3 leagues (start at the lowest, create your own team, work yourself up to F1...for example) or buy the 4th leage (GTA)...and modify it with lots of Workshop mods

Con:
- only one point i really miss...NO Multiplayer.
I would really like to play this game with 1-4 friends...that would be really great.

I recommend to get this game during a sale though. Using a mod with real names (either 2007 or in my case 1989 F1) makes the game a lot more enjoyable because you're a lot more connected with real teams and drivers.

Pro:
- easy access, but anyway enough ""depth"" to keep the game interesting
- setting up the car during the practice to get the best balance (can sometimes also be annoying)
- interesting races and ""cute"" graphics
- building/developping new parts and deciding which driver/car will get it is interesting
- F1 drama (your driver wins some races and suddenly has a new attribute self-important. Or your 2nd driver is unhappy because your other driver has the better car)

Contra:
- It's not possible to sign contracts in advance for next season. If you want to sign a driver, it's always immediately, causing a contract penalty
- It seems like I only get bad sponsors even though my market rate isn't that bad

Seriously addictive! Of course, much of my time with it has been modding or adjusting mods, which is normal for me. There are several mods which have some things I like and some things I don't, so I've been combining database elements (e.g. driver and mechanic list combining and removing duplicates), modifying textures, etc.

You do want to make sure you have database mods to your liking before starting a career, because you can't change them once the career is started (the database information is loaded into your save file), so if you decide you want to change something, it only will work if you start a new game. For example, many mods change the top-tier championship to Formula 1, but having teams named like ""Haas F1 Team"" while realistic is not the best thing for the game, because as years go on, teams may get demoted or promoted to different series, thus you end up with Haas F1 Team that's actually in GP2/F2 and not in F1 anymore. Likewise having, for example, Carlin fielding both a GP2 and a GP3 team. What happens when the GP3 team is promoted into GP2? Four Carlin cars on the grid -- two teams with the same name.

Anyway, as for the game itself: You can manage every aspect of your team -- scouting and hiring staff, contract negotiations, car setup, driver orders to manage tire and fuel usage, designing new parts, improving existing parts, expanding the team's facilities, etc. You can bend the rules and hope you don't get caught. You have to keep your team and drivers marketable in order to attract sponsors. Part of that is affected by how you respond to journalists' questions. The list goes on and on. The rules of the championship you're in, and the tracks they race on, can change from year to year via occasional voting by team managers (that's you, of course).

I have another sports management game, Out Of The Park Baseball 17. I never play it, though I love baseball. I fiddled with it for a few minutes (it came in a bundle with other things), but never got into the management aspect; I'd just set some teams together and watch what happened, letting the AI manage the team. With Motorsport Manager, on the other hand, I'm always wanting to try improving the team, to the point where I haven't even been logging into my real-life email account or social media accounts because I really want to see what I can get my virtual racing team to accomplish next!

I cannot really compare it to other management games since the last one i played was about 15 years ago - so sry for that.


But I think it is deep enough to give a good challenge and good feel of making decisions while it keeps other parts simple to have a good flow in the game.
The races are tense and the decisions to be made like pit stop strategy and driver aggressivenes and so forth have a big impact on the races.
Sometimes you really feel and cheer for your drivers like in a real race.
Graphics are neat and the performance is great. Sound is ok though I think engine sounds could be better.
The Game is challenging - depending on your experience dont expect to finish every race first or win the championship first season.
I enjoyed following an underdog racing team for multiple seasons and bring them to the top a lil bit more season for season.

I strongly suggest to play with the  ""ICE 17"" Mod. It completes the game at the exact right spots and makes it even more deep. (no gamebreaking bugs encountered so far)

It is a game where you play as a manager of a racing team. You scout and recruit members. Improve your car and build buildings that improve development. Then your team races and you can time when your tires need to change refuel. Of course the goal is to get as high as possible. I chose a limping team so i can be responsible for the teams success. 
A nice feature of this game is that the game experience changes over time because new rules are voted upon by you and other managers which will be active next racing season. There are a fair amount of these rules so each season is different. To get money, get sponsors.
I think a good ammount of work went in to this game. It works pretty stable and has many features.

It still has some bugs i hope they intend to solve:
- When there is thunder/lightning the game crashes, happened once.
- Finishes are not correct. Sometimes i finish a few rounds to soon because i am a few rounds behind. Also the game waits for cars that should already have finished.
- At the start of a season you can buy engine parts. But if the rule is engine is fixed you should not be able to choose one.
- Before you race you can choose what type of tyres you bring. But what i want is depending on the size of the fuel tank. This i can not see  at this moment.
- The weather report does not show your place in reference to the weather but the pole position it seems. It would be better so show the positions of the racers there.
- Scrolling trough the car parts in a car is choppy.
- Its not clear to me if the weight of the fuel has any impact on the race.
- After ending a race in fourth place the stats of my driver went down 200% and i don't know why.

I don't like the part of the game where you have to tune the car before a race or test or quallification. I hope they make an option or rule to do it automatically.

I am a fan of management games; sim-something, as long as it is engaging and not drifting from the usual. I have a long story with Football Manager, and related sport games; so when I heard that there was a new simulation made for autosports; I had to check it out, and glad to see that Steam had a promo on it, and a free weekend.

The game feels ""right""; it is not too complex to scare away people; has a nice UI and overall, you have a clue about what is going on, even if you never played other management games. It reminds me a lot of an old EA game made as F1 simulation from the perspective of the management and not of the pilots. Fundamentally the game is very similar to this one; where you get a team, race, and try to win the chanpionship.

here you don't drive, but you direct. You start giving directions to the R&D to improve one or more areas of your car; sign pilots, sign mechanic, designers and technicians, and then begin to test your car on the various tracks, while the season goes on. I had the chance to try only the ""F1"" equivalent; and I was sucked in the game mechanic, which is brutal but very clear: you need to balance things and check what your pilots and engineers suggest, if you want to have a chance.

The game:
You have mostly a static screen with various options; no fancy stuff here; you go in the various sections and decide where to allocate money. You can expand your base of operation with new and expensive equipment, or invest in research to improve the car (or both, if you are in a big  wealty team). The whole season is a rinse and repeat of the same: practice, where the pilots tell you how they feel about the setup; and you change 6 parameters that are reflecting in the ""handling"" ""speed"" and ""downforce"" categories. You start with bars where the engineers give you the min and max suggested for that track; then start to experiment, getting feedback from the pilots, and changing things accordingly.

Practice and 3 qualification stages are fundamentally the same; you run few laps, change settings based on feedback (and time on track of course), few laps and so on. Keep in mind that practice is the only time where pilots are more vocal, and you can gain XP to let them improve on that particular track. During qualification you mostly do minor tweaks, so get the setup as polished as possible during the practice.
The race is a bit different, since you have to manage fuel, wheel consumption and overall car efficiency. Push too hard and the engine blow up; too aggressive and the pilot will crash or will eat up too much fuel and wheel will degrade to the point where they will end up last.
It is a game of chess, where you observe the situation, take some risks and hope that you did the right thing. No 2 races are the same, and even the fastest car could end up loosing, if your strategy is poor.

So far the game has been harsh but any fault was because of me not doing things right; not because I had no clue of what was I doing (or not doing). If you fail, it is because you are not careful or listen enough. Although going for a stronger team makes everything easier; so it si not exactly like with football manager games, where you have a certain degree of outcomes.

Graphic is fine; nothing fancy but the game doesn't need it; the UI is clean and straightforward. The music is a bit repetitive, but you can use yours. The sound effects are nice; I just wish that they would put some audio clips, instead everything is text based. This is 2017, you would expect voiced acting at least.

I would suggest to give it a try, if you are looking for a good simulation of auto sports.",1490509587,1490509587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

English:  

I strongly recommend this game! 
It’s just amazing how the calculations are so precise and awfully exciting.
OMG, Devs… I guess I’ll have to sleep a little bit less from now on. Congrats for the professional job you’ve done in order to achieve such an astonishing and entertaining game like this one.

Of course, there’s always room for improvement, like characters faces, some profiles, graphics etc. But, the most important features, which are: racing in 3D, excitement, and mathematics… oh boy, you guys rock!  I’m a big fan of your work from now on. Thumbs up!

Portuguese: 

Só posso recomendar esse jogo para todos os amantes do automobilismo. 
O trabalho realizado pela equipe é simplesmente sensacional. Os cálculos são fantásticos e o jogo é realmente viciante. Como disse acima, sempre haverá lugar para melhoras: As fotos dos personagens envolvidos, alguns perfis, a parte gráfica do 3D etc.. No entanto, o mais importante, foi que os desenvolvedores conseguiram dar emoção real à corrida nesse game. O difícil será conseguir para de jogar
Resumo: Extremamente recomendável!

P.S. Para quem não domina o inglês, o jogo pode ser totalmente jogado em português e a tradução não decepciona em nada.

TLDR: Even though the game is full of inconsistencies virtually in every mechanic (from in-race to career), I can still recommend it. 

At first it pissed me off that some things didn't work the way they should, especially racing related. Off-track management part, even though completely unrealistic, was easier for me to accept, because even in real life this stuff varies from one extreme to another depending on a team, championship or category.

Racing-wise, however it was frustrating to me how inaccurate it was in relation to actual racing.

But if you stop treating this game as a ""simulator"" and accept it as fictitious in every respect, then it's fun. For sure, if it was more realistic it would not be fun for most people.

The matches are engaging and you definitely need to keep your wits about you, as pitting at the wrong time can ruin your position in the charts for the remainder of the race.

Pros.

Addictive gamplay - always a problem to solve, or something to make better.
Great politics system - much more in-depth that I intially thought.
Superb upgrading/design system - really makes you think about what is best for your team and drivers, instead of just maxing out everything.
Races themselves are well done - active weather, occasional crashes, team disputes.
Mod support!

Cons.

Soundtrack - all cars sound the same (and not in a good way), and a single track playing in the background between races gets annoying FAST.
Race strategies are far too easy to optimise - very little benefit of the undercut, for example.
Can be quite easy to dominate constantly.
No difficulty levels - just one.
No point of the 3D race viewing - everything still stays very far away, so there's no much point.

Overall, brilliant game, great potential, can't wait to see where it goes next! 8/10

Take this opportunity to express my feature wish list :)
1– Be able to have more teams in each level. At least 22, being the perfect scenario 26 (like old times F1). I play full game (max practice, race length, etc.) hard core F1/racing fan, so definitely just this feature itself would make me buy MM2 next November.

2 (not a priority) – Simple Editor (edit drivers, teams. Staff basic stuff like Names, etc.). I like to play with the original configuration just need to change basic stuff.

I also become a bit of a Team Principal god, with 5 WMC team championships under my belt... I was starting to get a little too used to the routine of my seasons though (not bored, just too familiar) and so I changed teams and decided to have a crack at a mid tier team in the WMC, to pull them up by the boot laces. 

This has re-ignited my passion for the game and having now completed 5 races in the new season, I have secured 2 podiums already. Loving it and considering I won 5 WMC titles in a row (with a Red Italian team), including one season where I achieved 15 out of 16 wins (30 podiums that year too), I cannot believe that I am now again just as pumped to finish a race, avoid a DNF, get some lowly points and grab two (lucky'ish) 3rd place podiums. My target is 6th overall this season, following years as the Champion... this is weirdly as exciting to me as winning week after week.

Very cool game, keeps you hooked whether winning regularly, competing in midfield or struggling to grab a point, any point. Awesome... * *  

* * * * * * * 

This is perhaps the most enjoyable game I have played since I beat my Football Manager addiction.

I bought this and whilst I don't get loads of time to play, with a young family, I somehow racked up 74 hours in a few weeks and have unlocked 50% of the achievements so far. you know a game has grabbed you when you go to bed thinking about set up and driver contract renewals! 

I love games that are not impossible but give you a real tough challenge. I love games that let my inner statto shine through and I love seeing what happens when I tinker with set up. I have scribbled notes, pages long with optimum set ups for teams, drivers, cars etc. and have enjoyed scouring this community for some great guides too.

I have geniunely had a couple of happy 'fist pump' moments with this game too. For example, I won the Euro Series constructors title by 4 points at the last race of my third season and was really chuffed with myself. I have to remember this is only a game! My drivers were 2nd and 5th but I won the trophy I wanted. Then when I moved into the Asia series, strewth, I struggled and was binned after 2 races by my chairman (this felt more like a weird bug in the game tbh). But from there I moved on to another Asia series team and spent two seasons there before winning that constructors championship (and my driver won the drivers title) giving me a real sense of satisfaction. In the Asia series I had my first (and only!) Pole Position and was so happy I was: ""yes yes yes"" whilst pumping my fists! Like I say, I'm getting into this game. Then I moved into the World series and I am currently on race 5 of a very hard season but my driver (Zoe Sharp) just scored our first points of the season, with 2 in the bag. Amazing that this game gets you so engrossed that you are as satisfied when you get a huge result of a point at the back, as well as a win, a pole, a championship.

I would love to see on the home player tab, even more career stats. I am currently on:

Euro Series - 30 races - 20 podiums - 11 wins
Asia Pacific Series - 31 races - 11 podiums - 5 wins 
WMC 4 races completed

What would be great is to see that as well as these stats, I want to see how many Poles, Fastest Laps and Points Scoring races listed too. Also I would love to see the Driver championship trophies listed (there has been one for me). After all, like Wins, I was the team principal who oversaw all of these other achievements, so it would be good to see these.

Overall, I am thoroughly enjoying this game so far.",1483202150,1490132058,True,18,0,0.686926186084747314,1,True,False,False

Pros:
Feels like a managment game
DLC (FOR FREE) where you own your own team
Extensive list of people to hire
Based of real F1 rankings (gp1 gp2 etc)
Vote on rules for potential changes
The now new and updated interviews (was one of my only problems and the fix it? kudos)

Now the few ""cons"":
If you don't own the GT DLC it all shows up the drivers the lot which is quiet annoying (although i will purchese this later it just doesn't feel right)
after a while you get's repetitive (dur)


now the ""neutral"":
No competition (good or bad but the game is great)
Nothing simallar on steam or anywhere to do with motorsport (correct me on this if im wrong please)
Mobile port (might put some off but for me done how it should be)


To the point: Great game small let downs need more managment type games of motorsport on steam like this as it has clearly captured the audience and i think that's great and the Devs are fantastic too.

Also that marketability attribute is bit annoying because it's most important stat for driver, no matter how fast he is, bad marketability and you can't take him, because you can get only 1-2 star sponsors after that.

After 11( i think ) seasons i finally managed to get into the Asia league (middle of 3 leagues) with my Predator racing team (weakest to start the game with). It was a long hard struggle but it felt great to be on top...sadly when entering the new league my motivation started lacking. The game offers quite some options for managing your team..but after a while youve ssen it all and you notice that it could use some mroe gameplay depth.

The races itself are well presented with  nice modell railroad kinda style racetracks. Lovely to look at. However first you have to get the right setup in practice..which quickly turns in a tedious hutn to get the bestr settings by testing your settings, see the resultks, try others...and check if they got better or worse. thats all. I wrote them all down...but they change everytime ytour driver improves..or you have better parts or drivers...i was just able to use them as guideleiones. Setings from alst season where every setting was excellent, was enxt season just good or great.

The qualifying is even worse with a minigame where you have to make sure your break and tire temps are at optimum temperatur,before doing your quick lap. practice and Quali can be skipped or leave it to the computer..but especially the practice is important for the setup.

The race actually is quite exciting and strategic. Ordering how your driver pushes the engine,tires and parts..or hwo mcuh fuel to burn. When to come in..and how much fuel to add..or what tires. And when there is rain..it gets even more exciting. 
Sadly the AI does act erratic when it rains on the track. it has been improved through patches, but still happens that they pit 3-4 laps in a row.

A bigger issue is the blue flag mechanic. If a driver is being lapped, in real he is not allwoed to fight the car thats lapping him and let him pass..but doesnt have to slow down or make room. In the game a car being lapped slows down and makes room. 
often it happens that a car that is being lapped is slow enough for the blueflag mechanic to apply, but fast enough to keep up and even pass the car that has just passed him. After passign it, the blue flag pops up, the car slows down and the other car goes ahead again....again....and again. It ruins your lap times and makes you fall back even more.

Even worse is the phoenix A circuit, which is a oval, where lapping will start after the 4th ior 5th lap. And if youre not one of the top 5 cars, it gets very ridicoulous.

However, my brother and i have no regret buying the game and still spend some hours during the week playing our teams. A very nice race manager game....that runs a bit out of fuel in the last few laps.

The graphics looks decent too. The 'depth of field' (zoom blur) is a bit to much for my taste and the camera zoom is almost non existant, but other than that it looks alright.

The weak part of the game are all the texts in the game (and scripted text mechanics - emails etc). After 1 race I already got an email of my 'lead designer' that I should fire my 2nd driver (that finished ahead of the 1st driver)... because my 2nd driver was to much 'on the phone'.

The developers finally stepped up to the plate and started to adress all the bugs in the game. I have no doubts that there are still many bugs left and maybe some were introduced as well. Nevertheless, the game works a whole lot better now and if the developers continue to show their commitment, I have no problems recommending this game. So many things are fundamentally right in this game but the experience was spoiled by all the bugs. The game was released too early, customers were treated as beta-testers, which is not acceptable – but it has finally been rectified. *


It's been a long time since the developers communicated with the customers. As of now, there's no indication of the developers even trying to fix the latest bugs they introduced with their last patch. There are many positive reviews of this game but the bugs may not be obvious to everyone. Believe me, they are there and they are real spoiling the whole experience. Stay away from this game until the developers have communicated their commitment to fix this game.

Amazing game until you start getting into the details. So much fine work has gone into this game, the graphics, the interface, the conceptualization of development, how you run a team and so on. Not everything is totally realistic in a racing sense but it makes you struggle with the same kind of problems a team does and it puts you in a situation where you have to make decisions in a way that FEELS realistic. But. And a big but. I urge everyone to stay away from this game until the developers have squashed the bugs. And there are plenty and a quite a few will make you feel very annoyed and frustrated. The biggest problem is the Blue Flag-problem (check the forums for in depth explanation) which can really spoil a whole race for both you and the AI. There are plenty of others maybe not so game breaking as the blue flag but still, they stack up and sooner or later breaks the player down. Unfortunately the developers doesnt seem to have a testing process in place and the latest release has done nothing but aggravate the blue flag-problem.",1481850145,1489147051,True,0,0,0.50271075963973999,0,True,False,False

For those of you that haven't seen that old version of the game, Let me just say that the current version is a half upgraded game, even if you only own the vanilla game, there are stuff from GT everywhere, in other words the company is trying to force you to buy GT.

One very fun aspect of this game was the Predator Challenge, and in version 1.21 it was amazing, specially since you could rebuild the team any way you wanted with the free drivers that were out of work, in version 1.23 a version half updated with GT stuff, you do not have free drivers anymore, so you go from having a very tough and very fun predator challenge in 1.21 to an absolute nightmare and an exercise in frustration in 1.23, in other words the company that made the game tried to make the GT DLC obligatory, not giving the option to customers to see the original game if they wanted.

For myself I find that 1.21 is 10 times a better game than the current the version, the game is still good, but sadly is not as fun, if I needed to put an score it would be 

Version 1.21  9 out of 10 (still there are issues with blue flags the game is not perfect)
Version 1.23  5 out of 10 (Having a half updated game and trying to force you to buy the GT DLC made the game a whole lot less fun than it was)

Tip: Start with a slower car. That is the best experience. Or even, start with the worst car in the lowest season. See the growth. You will be amazed with yourself.

A con would be the pitstops. The risk factor is really crazy, and the time added is like 8-10 seconds. The tires are also something that needs fixing. They write 11-13, 10-12, 9-11, but it really isn't. Decrease one/two laps from the range and that will be more realistic. The harder compunds are even worse. 20-22 lap tires will be finished by 17-18 laps.

Pros:

1.  You feel like you're in charge.  Good or bad, millions of dollars and your season could depend on when or if you build that Telemetry building.
2.  Drivers are like spoiled children.  Just like real life.
3.  Budgets, budgets, budgets.
4.  Not too gnitty gritty, but when I sweat .1 degrees of a wing angle in practice, that's enough for me.
5.  Build it and they will come.  A Test Track, that is.  Drivers love a winner.
6.  Eeerrraaaaaaammmm!

Cons:

1.  Your mechanics are idiots at setups.  Especially the new ones, in ERS, which is when you really need their help.
2.  Couple little bugs.  One driver got sick, and dropped to 0 lbs. weight for the rest of his life.  So, he's faster now?
3.  Could have used an extra zoom or a In-Car Cam graphics level.  Instead, it's decent, but not super pretty.
4.  On the graphics note, cars take slow corners with a jerky turning radius.  Could have been smoothed out a little.
5.  And cars sometimes collide or even pass through each other.  Moreso in practice than races.
6.  Tire wear can be dramatic, especially if you can't afford super nice compounds on hot tracks... which probably makes sense.
7.  Budget, budget, budget.
8.  Drivers could have more specific feedback on the radio, or have more varied responses to overtakes, etc.

This game doesn't give you much help in the beginning.   Learning that you should pit each lap in the beginning of a practice session, for example, may seem intuitive to some... but others have to learn the hard way.

Also, the game shouldn't allow you to build a part for a car once the season is over until after the new chassis is designed.  It's a tough way to learn a lesson about throwing away money.

All in all, though, it's an excellent game.  There's flaws that can be easily avoided, and it delivers a lot of atmosphere.  Well done.

Full disclosure I'm in my thirties, been a gamer from an early age to give you perspective. 

The Good

1. It's very easy to pick up, shallow learning curve.

2. Some nice car customization options for (shallow) player choice

3. Good variability for race events and track challenges.

4. The possibility of scouting and finding the right staff can really enhance gameplay.

5. Generally the game looks nice and is enjoyable.


The Bad

1. Insufficient depth for long term gaming for an adult.

2. Repetitive non-engaging ""messages""

3. Most interview questions and scenerios have no positive outcome, only negative or neutral.


The Ugly

So much untapped potential in the game. I'm sure the devs know that too.

Some ideas:

1. Choosing season rules to start with

2. Choosing fuel amounts

3. Driver injury, long term, short term, recovery times.

4. Sponsorship structure needs a rethink.

5. Interactive specific training for drivers. (ideally for everyone)

6. We have a test track? - let's use it!

7. Telemetry data? would be nice to see something telemetry looking like with some options to improve/invest/fix

8. Press events! - you know when all the drivers get to sit, pretend they like it and talk to the media...

9. Fake news. Not just email but some paper headlines or something. (Pretty cheap to create)

10. Driver seat mode! - can we get some watered down driver seat 3D view? (maybe for MM2?)

11. Multiplayer!!! - (definitely MM2 territory)

12. Track danger level (some tracks can be much more dangerous than others)

13. Repair bill! - some drivers are awesome but they have no smoothness and they destroy engines. Worse, sometimes the car crashes and is totalled. Taht costs.

14. Recoverability. Sometimes a driver runs wide or into the gravel and can still recover!

I could probably extend this to 50 so I'll stop here.

I've never followed F1 or GT motorsports but the game draws the player in kind of like Football Manager does even for someone who knows nothing about ""soccer football"" <grin>.

It is a management game, not a driving simulation.
It doesn't have any F1 etc licensing so you will not see names or images of famous racing teams, drivers, mechanics, designers, events(?) etc. It is all fictitious except maybe some of the track layouts not sure.

It is a simulation-oriented game and even though I know nothing about motorsports I'd certainly call it ""evocative"". Maybe the only thing missing from that evocation is the carnival atmosphere you hear about from real-life spectators of the sport.

I enjoy the race strategy. I do see it as a little bit mathematical (for me that is a good thing), you have to figure out the fixed fuel-per-lap burn rates in the game for different engine settings (which takes a few laps of your first race) and balance those against ""tyre"" wear rates that depend on driver, temperature, track etc.

There are a couple ways I've played this. Aggressive, once your parts have enough reliability, you use the fact that fuel weighs more than the time to add it in the pit stop (the big time consumption of a pit stop is entering and exiting the pit lane) and run high output with just enough fuel levels to cover the time it takes the softest slick to wear down. Or conservative, you use the fact that that pit lane entry and exit time is worth a second of lap time over many laps, so you load up on fuel for the long haul and conserve fuel and ""tyre"" wear as much as possible to minimise the number of pit stops. You can see there is some balancing to work out here and depending on your team and drivers and car the same strategy may work sometimes and not others.

There are some quirks I've noticed. Some probably intended, some not. I'm going to give a lot of verbage to these because I don't see a lot of discussion about them, but don't let me convey that I don't very much like the game and rate it one my best Steam purchases.

There are some annoying dialog issues that make no sense. Like one that asks you to ""bring in"" a driver that beat yours, and gets them mad when you refuse, but they happen to already be your other driver. So either answer you piss off one of your drivers. Not that unavoidable ego issues are not part of the sport (they are a big part of this management sim) but the pretext in this case is absurd. However, okay, that is not huge deal and I'm sure in some future patch it will be handled.

Also, your first set of ""tyres"" in a race will start at a lower temperature than every other set put on the car at a pit stop. I know nothing, but maybe this is due to the time sitting still on the grid in the starting lane until the lights go out?

The second and subsequent seasons all the cars start with very poor reliability parts, much worse than the first season. To the point where it doesn't seem like the intention of the design. I'd almost expect it to be the other way around. Note that the AI has the same issues here - first races of the season are fraught with mechanical issues for them too.

The part design tool tips state unequivocally you unlock slots on design iterations. This is not actually technically how it works. You only unlock the next slot when you use one of the highest-grade components. That one is really annoying but just because the instructions mess you up a little in a long-term way (the perpetual chase of improving parts design is one of the main game aspects).

Finally I will caution you that the game (at least since the GT patch if not before) has a serious actual bug, however, which I hope the developers will read about and fix.
When the 1st place, or perhaps other, driver is a lap (or laps) ahead of a chasing car, and that chasing car pulls ahead, the game bumps the former-chaser's time by one whole lap all of a sudden (you can see the seconds whiz by on the upper left display). This effectively jumps that car up a lap and in some cases a car which has been lapped can even take the lead this way. Not sure it *always* happens (it is a busy game) but I've seen it 5 or 6 times now and have confirmed what seems to be other plays who have seen it (see link below).
For what I suspect is another example see...

The game lacks on many things yet and seems a little bad when registering the results right specially when it comes to positions achieved . I believe though that it can be improved largely as much as a Football manager , but untill there the game is playable and very enjoyable .

- racing management.
- Athmosphere
- Not overpriced
- One more turn feeling (One more race!)
-Jean Todt/Ross Brawn simulator. But rly. Its cool.
-New content, eg.: team creator

cons:
- Infamous Vettel Bug ( BLUE FLAG! BLUE FLAG! ™ )
- Retarded damage model, especially at season start(parts breaking almost every turn)
- Calandar too slow in season, it should be as fast as after/preseason. Wasting a lot of time.
- Race sometimes too slow need at least one more speed option(4X)

I've just played a couple of hours with the new 1.3 update. Some excellent changes have been added, the top in my mind is the change to qualifying to allow you to have the driver do the outlap warming of brakes and tyres rather than having you (the player) do it. Really a change that makes the whole game much better since your role in qualifying is now that of the team manager rather than also the driver too. And now there is a rules option for qualifying to change it to be like Formula One with three segments where after Q1 and Q2 the slowest part of the field is eliminated. A third, more minor but still important change is to the emails that ask for interviews from you. They now have actual effects on the drivers or team and so really mean something. And there are a host of other great changes. Makes the game even better.

[u]Update 2016.11.23:[/u] 
After now having played just over forty hours on the game, I can continue to give the game a positive thumbs up. I have played a season and a few races at the bottom of the three tiers of competition, and most of one season in the top tier. The game does have a few bugs which hopefully will be fixed in the first planned patch. Otherwise however it is really quite good in the long run. 

I would categorize the game as something you experience rather than something you play to win. I spent 19 hours in the lowest tier, and now 21 hours in the top tier where I have not yet finished my first season. You really can spend a couple of hours of real world time between the end of one race and the end of the next one. You manage finance, part design, and just running your team, including evaluating drivers and staff. And then at a race weekend you spend time preparing for practice, overseeing practice and the same for qualifying. And then comes the race and you are calling the shots for your two drivers regarding fuel use, tire wear and pit stops. 

Now I do tend to play slow and fret over every detail, so most folks will probably spend only half or a third of the time that I do in a season, but if you really want to get down to the nuts and bolts of running a team, this is the game for you.

[u]Original Review:[/u]
My impressions after a couple hours of play...

Much, much better than the mobile game. Seriously. Very seriously. I think I spent the first hour just going through the tutorial that puts you right into the first race of the season and then walks you through every menu screen and option. Really top notch presentation. 

There are some compromises, because it is game that has to be actually played by a single player rather than a huge team of technical specialists, but wow the developers certainly tried to give you the feel of running a race team. Little things like how your driver develops a relationship with their mechanic which improves over time. Or that you can build parts that [i]might[/i] not pass scrutineering, which happens after each race and could get your results invalidated. Or that the series rules change over time, like different tires or removing fueling. And there was even a case of a track changing it's configuration from one season to the next. 

Truly an awesome effort, and this is from someone who started back in nineties with different racing management games. And so far (two hours), no glitches or crashes.",1478734007,1487916078,True,81,4,0.855914533138275146,0,True,False,False

With a game with this much depth in it you need that. So i would say that this game is good for both Experienced and, Non-experienced Motorsport Managers.

I love the football manger franchise, and was hoping for a cut down version of that game. Unfortunately this is to cut down for my liking.

Staff Options:
As the game stands there are limited race series options and very limited actual team management availble. Pretty much just hire or fire your drivers, desinger and the mechanic for each driver. I really was hoping for more staff options and of a more detailed breakdown on the relevant traits.

In Race:
I've completed 3 seasons so far, and find the game very repetitive. What tyres do I want, X amount of laps, X amount of fuel in the car gives you an estimate of how many pits you are going to do.
Though more may be required if your parts aren't very reliable.

Car Prep:
You basically have 3 things here:
1. Designer - please create me a new part (obviously the better designer, and more money you have the better the part)
The are limited options on risk/reward with the parts. And you only have 1 resource designing 1 part for 1 car at a time.
2. Mechanics - Post race repairs, and between race tuning of parts for performance and reliability. 
3, Car Design - limited options on actual build of car (how much money you want to spend with suppliers) and is done at the start of each season. Apart from that what (basic) colour scheme and livery you want and the occasional change of sponsor.

All in all, a few clicks at the start of the season, a couple in between for new parts and then telling the drives how far to push the car or pit during the race itself. I wasn't expecting (and didn't want) anything to complicated on car design (not being a mechanic myself), but a couple of clicks and sliders didn't make this the game for me....

My advice, if you plan to buy it.

I'm not really a fan of racing, but this doesn't require that of me. I don't need to be a mechanic to understand and operate my racing team. 

So after 17 hours of time, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in management sims. The in-race decision making will bring with it a learning curve if you aren't already knowledgeable about motorsports, but it's something that can certainly be learned. Constant winning won't be easy, but what good would the game be if it was?

The game isn't perfect of course. I was hoping more of the drivers might be procedurally generated rather than being the same career to career (while learning I started over a few times). I also would have more liked to start my own company, but that is DLC coming out in just a few days from my writing this. The voting system on rule-changes is an interesting mini-game, but how it tells you if it would benefit you isn't always clear. That may be more my failing than the game's, however. 

Another thing was the adjustment of your driving team after you signed them to a contract. The contract will denote if they should be the #1, the #2, equal with each other, or in reserve. It took a bit to figure out that the only way it actually manifests is in how they feel the car they are driving is outfitted compared to the other driver. That might be okay, but a more immediate visual representation of driver status is something I would like to see.

All in all I'm having fun with this game. For me part of that is nostalgia, but I wouldn't have even considered trying it without that factoring in.",1487577712,1487577712,True,0,0,0.498264402151107788,0,True,False,False

between races you spend you time developing and upgrading your vehicle and base to get the edge on your other teams and dealing with the squabbles of your drivers and media

on ""race day"" you participate in practice which can be used to fine tune the performance of your cars fitting it to more closely match the driver to the car by adjusting the spring stiffness, gear ratio's tire pressue, camber and front and rear downforce, then you go to qualifying and try to get the best position for race day, then the big day comes you tell them when to pit so their not driving with slicks while its raining, and keep their cars in working order and hope you get a good spot so you can get money to advance

and there is where it falls down how you make money, most is from race winning but you also have sponsors that can give you a little extra, but they dont care who you are 90% of them want you on the podium even if they are a ""one star"" sponsor and you are the team with the least experianced team and with basic upgrades. i mean i am going off on a tangent here but i chose a team that was well known as being a particpator useually finishing at the back of the feild yet i got a sponsor that was asking my team to finish in 1st, like that will happen within the signing date with other technolically better teams than me on the feild, an i supposed to hope that everyone else has a huge pileup?",1487488089,1487488089,True,0,0,0.498264402151107788,0,True,False,False

Really enjoyable, and in some ways quite theraputic, but the 3x speed is just not quite fast enough at times.  If you lose both cars in a race on the first lap (v unlikely btw) you'd be ""forced"" to watch the entire race to be able to progress, and there's something wrong in that being even possible.  Or, if you're comfortably leading then a faster setting would allow to move the game towards the next pitstop window.  

Have enjoyed some epic races with cars qualifying 13th and squeezing the last few % of life out of the components and holding off the faster cars with a one-stop strategy.  Perfect mid-tier stuff, in my opening WMC race, so the excitement is there when needed (and no need to speed up at that point).

Suggestions (to speed up race e.g. 5x - 10x speed):
* unless red line on component reached on a driver
* unless car < 3 laps fuel
* unless car < 30% tyre
* or both cars out of race

In those scenarios you would (as a user have to) accept that you are able to slow the race down should any qualitive decisions be required (e.g. faster car approaching you or you approaching another).  It reduces the effectiveness of the orders changing rapidly, but moves the game on.

Definitely worth playing, but don't feel it's worth the premium price.  Bought on a 50% deal and I don't think it's worth more than that.",1487446043,1487446043,True,0,0,0.498264402151107788,0,True,False,False

Almost 24 hours in, and I still want to improve. However, if I would start all over again, I would not pick Chariot as my starting team. Boy, does that team have issues! So far, I've been relegated to Asia Pacific AND I'm on the verge of losing my job.

I've read reviews from folks that don't like this game. To each their own. Some say this is a scripted game. The tutorial is scripted but other races are not. I've had different results racing the same race multiple times.

Others say that this game is ""the same"" once you get a hang of things. Perhaps if you're playing with the strongest team in the highest league. But if you start in the lower leagues there is quite a bit of strategy at play (both long and short). 

Get it while it's on sale folks. Definitely worth the buy in my opinion.",1487289366,1487341709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The strategy is great, you can change rules of the series you are in, you can move up and down series, change your livery, improve you team from year to year.  You have the ability to change your race strategy on the fly.  The only two negatives would be no F1 license.  You can change team names and livery with mods, but the tracks are still not real.  Although they are very similar.  A track creator at some point would be great.  The only other issue is (not that it is an issue) is you cant get really close to the action.  A 1st person, view of an overtake, or on track cameras would make it feel more like race day.  

It looks like other series are coming, so a NASCAR or Indycar in the future may be possible.  

I would recommend this game.  It is right up there with OOTP and Football Manager.

Player choice- Or not? The game ensures you have things to do during most races, but these things are pretty arbitrary. Maybe you have a driver whose tire temps are too low for no real reason at all so you have to order them to ""push"" or even ""attack"" to get the tire temps up- why? Shouldn't they just be maintaining the tire temps I ordered in the first place?

The game throws a lot of little bits at you like this. Every time you want to add fuel to a car you have to click the plus for every single gallon- the game won't default to a full tank or anything. So when your car comes into the pits you HAVE to click plus for every single gallon to add, or your car would run out of gas. If your brain gets in gear for half a second you realize this is mindless busywork they added- any other game defaults to some reasonable value you can tweak to your preference. To compare this to a real race, in every race series in the real world, teams agree to an ideal schedule before every race just in case the radios go out or who knows what. Maybe we plan on stopping at lap 11 for tires and fuel, then again on lap 22, and on to the finish at lap 33. This game doesn't have that feature, because then you could finish some races without ever having to click any buttons. They had to specifically choose to put some clicks in, just to keep you busy. Once you realize these tricks, the veneer washes away, and you see this is just bargain-bin time-wasting game. Not a bad one, just a cheap one. If they wanted to add in fake clicks, why not have people negotiating sponsor deals in the middle of the race or some other arbitrary stuff? It could be anything.

Same goes for the start of every new season. I saved up the absolute maximum budget you can possibly put in for the next season, and my staff are rated #1 in the league. So at the end of the first race of the second season my cars are... in the mid to back of the field, of course. What was the point of struggling all last season to barely get above the middle of the pack on my limited budget, if I'm just going to end up where I started? Yeesh.

So this is a fun time wasting game, I'll probably put a solid 50 hours into it before I get totally bored, but it's really just not worth more than sale price.

Oh and the graphics? Ha. It has a 2d mode with a pixellated background that look like it could run on a 1990s computer, and a 3d mode that zooms way out on the race to make it seem like there's more going on but in reality this could probably be rendered on a computer from the 2000s.

Finding the right balance was the hardest part of the game, (what to upgrade and who to hire.)

Cons. I think they only issue that upsets me is still the blue flag issues cars have during a race. It is impossible for your car to pass a car that is a lap ahead of you, even though your car is faster. The way you have to qualify your cars is pretty stupid, and I rarely do qualifying. I just have the computer do qualifying automatically, since it is just a waste of time in my opinion. 

People have complained about how many women there are in the game, since it seems to be about 50/50, but that doesn't seem to bother me, since I care more about stats than what is between their legs.

Management sims are my favorite genre of games and I love Formula One, so this game immediately took over possession of my heart, life, and soul.  I strongly recommend this game to any fan of management simulations.  And what if you don't like Formula One or auto racing?  Then you'll be more forgiving of some of the game's flaws than I am!

Motorsport Manager contains three tiers of open-wheel auto racing leagues called the World Motorsport Championship (obviously a play on Formula One) and two inferior leagues known as the Asia-Pacific Challenge Cup and the European Racing Series which are more regional and not based off of any real life motorsports association.

The World Motorsport Championship contains the likenesses of real life Formula One teams and drivers in 2015.  If you know Formula One, it isn't difficult to match up teams to their real life counterparts.  Several of the drivers are female (unlike their real life counterparts), but if you know Formula One, you can tell easily enough who the Australian woman racing for Panther Race Team is supposed to be, along with Dieter Wexler and Niilo Saarinen who drive for Scuderia Rossini.  Circuits are also much like their real  life counterparts, yet anything but identical.  The closest any of the circuits come in this game to the locations of their real life counterparts is Singapore, but it isn't difficult to guess at which race is which in real life with the exception of the Cape Town Grand Prix.  It took me awhile to see the resemblance to the Monaco Grand Prix, but anyone familiar with the Monaco Grand Prix will eventually see the resemblance.

Although management sims are hardly graphics-dependent (I can amuse myself for hours with text-based games), the graphics of Motorsport Manager go above and beyond aesthetically pleasing.  The layouts of the track and scenery around it never gets old to see.  The graphics would have been better if more 3D angles were provided than merely a camera that follows the desired car.  The direction and pitch of the camera can be changed, but apart from the lack ability to zoom-in incredibly close, I would have liked it better if the game allowed for TV style viewing and (even better) a view of the race from a driver's cockpit camera.  But the worst part about the graphics, is the fact that you will occasionally see cars travel straight through one another.  Another flaw to graphics, is that the numerals on cars featured on the track map are all white, which naturally, makes this difficult to read on lightly colored dots.  (""Metal on metal"" in the case of white on yellowish colors.)  Screens between races are rarely exciting, but that's management sims for you.  However, the screens for HQ and Sponsors are pleasing to the eye.

Being a management sim, sound is even less important than graphics to me.  Just for the sake of writing a review, I played this game with the sound on...  Once!  The races all sound just like the V-8 engines of Formula One before 2014, though this may be a negative for any gearheads playing this game, because the World Motorsport Championship uses V-10 engines, and V-10 engines all make a distinctive whine.  The music doesn't help set the mood, but at the same time, the music doesn't sound out of place.  But it's easy to enjoy Motorsport Manager with the sound off, and listen to your favorite sort of music while making between-race decisions and watching in-race action.

There's much I would like to share about my game experiences, except that Steam puts a limit on reviews.  (I would like to see Steam put a minimum number on words for reviews.  Single word reviews here are comonplace, and jackwagons who write them seem to think they're actually being helpful!)  My list of positives and negatives are anything but all-inclusive, so I'm unable to share other important details that may also be important to the reader.  (Particularly the lack of Formula One rules applied to the game...  Even the stupid ones, like the current ""engine"" formula and the maximum engine rule.)

The biggest positives of this game have to be the large variety of buildings you can build for your team headquarters.  (Though a single ""administrative office"" is mysteriously absent.)  Weather patterns (including temperature) are flawless, and the in-race and random events that happen between races that affect a driver's skills (either temporarily or permanently), moods, and health are something to belove.  I was skeptical when I noticed there wasn't a driver skill dedicated to wet weather racing, but then I saw this intergrated into driver traits.  (If a driver has the trait when the condition is active, they will receive bonus points to their skills.)  I also love how practice actually means something!  I really enjoy the challenge of making a car that's ""built to win."" (My apoligies to Seta.)  Elections are always fun, and I enjoy the possibilities.  (Including the ability to accept bribes from another team's chairman to vote their way.)

On the downside, the movement of cars during races is often nothing short of unrealistic for any sort of racing series that I'm familiar with.  The game makes no obvious mention of how much money a player may overdraft, and loans cannot be secured.  (Overdrafting is a must for building up a team, especially a weak team!)  While interviews are an important part of the game to fans of sports management sims, the interview sessions are deeply flawed.  There's frequently only three choices for answers, and none of them are ""no comment.""  Interviews rarely seem to factor in if a driver had overachieved in an inferior car, and post-race interviews are only two questions long, and with no ability to clarify one's answer.  I also highly disagree with the fact that parts other than the front wing can be repaired in the middle of races.  This isn't supposed to be endurance racing, and this takes away from the ability to have races with high rates of attrition. If this option had to be included, the game should have included ""meatball flags."" I particularly hate the system of promotion and relegation.  This isn't Soccer, and only three leagues (and thirty teams) is far to few to make promotion and relegation viable.  Promotion and relegation may be viable if one is playing the ""challenge mode"" of this game, but the game should require a promoted team satisfy a number of requirements in addition to finishing first.  (That is, have certain buildings and facilities upgraded to a minimum number.  Maybe even require a team have a certain amount of money on-hand.)  To be fair to the other teams, a relegated team should have their buildings operate at a reduced level to a league's maximum.  Sixteen locations is far too few places for races, and the ERS and APCC should not have races outside of their region.  I was skeptical when I saw there was no skill for race starts, and for good reason:  The programmers had no idea what they were doing in this important stage of a race.  (Especially since erratic starts do not result in multi-car pile-ups similar to the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix.)  Excellent starts on the other hand, are thwarted by a driver simply slowing down to match the speed of the car ahead, while even people who don't watch auto racing would know for a fact the faster car would try and pass the car ahead of them!

Simply put, if you're a fan of management simulations, this is the game for you regardless of your interest in motorsports.    While the erratic movement of cars and lack of blue flags for drivers who have just exited the pits with a faster car approaching drives me crazier than a laughing hyena on crack rock, this still does not take away from the fact that this is one truly amazing management simulation.",1485291237,1487209243,True,82,2,0.785474896430969238,2,True,False,False

Only thing i would do to improve the game is adding an option that allows you to create your own team (being able to set the budgets , and other stuff.. and if you wanted to start this process again you'd sell your team). Also , allow regelation for the last team in the 3rd division (european championship) and a random team would join in.. A youth academy for young driveres where you could recruit the best ones (pretty much like fm) would be a good thing to add as well.. 
To improve the carrer mode for the people who play a lot of seasons , a country without a race track should be allowed to build one. For exemple , lets say that Saudi Arabia decides to build one and then you could vote if you would add it to your calender or not pretty much as you do for normal races.

AI - Unbalanced
Sound - Good

Overall: 
I feel the company did a good job with the game especially the User Interface and Functions but the AI was severly lacking. This is a key concept element for this game. For this sole reason i can't recommend this game. Maybe if the company spent more time on AI than UI then it could have been good.

The game is very interactable, plenty to manage but i find when i race that the AI is unbalanced and hard to beat. It seems to me the only way to beat the AI and get pole is to hire one of the best drivers or Micro Manage every single turn with both your drivers at the same time.

You start and fall more in love with it with every single moment, you lie awake at night thinking about it. Your work suffers as you want to be with it....

Little things, like always wanting to take you through the tutorial. Engineers telling you that the perfect Qualy set-up is actually now pants when it's the same track/tyres/weather. Achieving pole when your flying lap was started just before Qualy ended but not being given it, then watching NPC drivers drop you down the list doing the same. Drivers telling you ""That felt good"" when you could have walked it faster.

The core game definitly is on the races itself, managing your pit stop strategy, ordering your drivers to go faster or slower, choosing the right tyres, setup and so on.

It has a nice balance between fun and realism (possibly because it's not nearly as detailed and nuanced as Football Manager yet). One thing which I think particularly exemplifies this is one aspect of the practice sessions: You have limited time to try different setups of 6 car components in order to find the perfect balance between 3 different car characteristics. You can either think of this in terms of gear-ratios changing the acceleration/topspeed balance, or you can think of it as using this slider here to move that peg there to zero in on the place where the face will be smiliest.

There's the financial side of the game (sponsors, contracts, HQ improvements) but IMO the best thing about the game is the races themselves. They're so dynamic. Just like a real-life strategist you decide your plan before the race and set your starting tyres and fuel level, then you watch the race and juggle in your mind the information about tyre wear, tyre heat (which depends on aggressiveness and ambient temperature), fuel level, engine mode, the weather, track position, etc, for each car and then change things in order to finish the race in as good a position as possible. Then someone loses a wing or there's a safety car and you have to re-calculate again!

So it's good fun for motorsport fans. And IMO it's a good investment for now so that they can improve and grow the game for a future version.",1486392842,1486392842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You pick the drivers, the sponsors, the mechanics, lead designers, your car appearance (after the first season or pay in-game monies), your home base buildings and upgrades, and whether you wish to push your drivers to driving their cars harder or easier.  In addition, things happen that need your attention such as interviews, scolding your drivers, car malfunctions, etc...

So, overall, a very interesting game.  Not exactly action packed as it has more attention to decisions and the way your decisions impacts the future of your team.  The best way to describe it would be a leaning cross between actually watching a race (more so) and being behind the wheel in a race (minimal).

So here are some pro's and con's...

Pro's
+Once you pay an in-game fee or after completion of each season, you can pick up to about 17 different designs for your car.  And yes, you can pick different colors....
+You make the decisions.  You can choose multiple different things.  Some may hurt you.  Some will benefit you.
+Has two different views to the races.  a 2D version and a 3D version.  for graphic reasons if you don't have ""enough"" for your system to handle.
+Drivers can ""grow"" on you.  Outside things they do can benefit their abilities for a bit or hamper them.  You can rpg this to some extent with your imagination.  Some drivers are dicks.  Others are nice.  Some crash a lot.  Others don't.  etc...
+Decisions on pitting, how much to push your cars and/or drivers plays a serious impact on overall performance of each race.
+Contract negotiations.  You can hire rookie drivers, ""steal"" drivers from another team, or re-negotiate contracts with your current drivers.  Same goes for mechanics.
+If you are tired of one team, you can always go looking to get hired by another.  This also goes the other way.  If a team doesn't like your decisions or your not fulfilling your agreements, you can be fired and end up looking for another to join anyway...
+Multiple ways of trying to win each season.  You can ""save up"" and go the money route.  In this way, you can literally build up your car well enough that you could win races with the worst drivers.  Another way is to find the good drivers and fight your way to the top.  And another is to grab a high priced and great driver to win the races for you.  I call this the three tier system.  Lowest tier ""saving up"" is there to ensure that a person can eventually progress their teams (time consuming, somewhat boring, but effective).  The middle tier ""fight it out"" is the most exciting.  Takes the longest to progress, but your races can be more exciting as juggling between drivers and car enhancements makes the difference.  The top tier ""great driver"".  You can sneak a few rookie drivers that ""should have been"" in the more advanced divisions in a lower division and sign them on your team.  Easy wins that gain you money through fulfilling your sponsorship deals (although this is only marginal and the most boring of the three as you always see your driver advance through 19 other drivers and take wins with huge leads and no other driver to challenge).
+can literally play the game with just a mouse.  This is the only way I play the game.  Never need two hands...lol


Con's...
-There is no great crash scenes.  Cars simply drive off the track and stop.  There is no visual damage to cars.  Every once in a while, a car starts to smoke, but that is about it.
-AI cars tend to crash waaaay less than your drivers even though your driver is statistically suppose to crash way less than them.  Ratio seems to be about 6-1.
-no special scenes.  don't expect any.  for example, you won't see a tow truck tow your car back to the pits during caution.
-car to car collisions do happen, but not often...and of course, you won't see any damage although you got damage...it will tell you that you got damaged, but you won't see it on the car....
-your cars can crash during caution.  thought it was funny the first time...
-pit stops don't seem accurate with percentages of a good/great/bad pit stop times.  if it says 31% of a mishap, it seems to be 60+%.  Doesn't really seem to harm you a great deal, but might cost you a few places in a race....
-there is no multiple car crashes.  in other words, you won't see your car losing control and hitting another car or cars.  Usually if you hit another car, you won't see it.  All that happens is that you and the other car will suffer wing damage that can be repaired in the pits.  You also will never hit more than one car.  So, either you wipe out off the track (ie: drive and stop off the track) and are out for the race.  or you are notified that one of your parts (wings) are damaged and need to pit.  Sometimes you are penalized for it and must make another trip through pit lane.  Sometimes your are not...


Overall, the game is a simulator that is based off of your decisions.  Random events do happen, but are not devastating regardless of your decisions.  You can benefit some, or lose some.  

This game is worth the price tag they gave it.

25% off = great deal.

This game combines the technical aspect with a highly addictive but not repetitive gameplay.
Is unprecedented in this genre for the last 20 years. Yes, better then all of them. Including the backing from a company like Sega the graphics engine is even A-list level. Buy this game before the workshops opens, it will take off when this game gets online multiplayer. IF you are a F1 fanatic. You need to buy this game.

This game when you take your time, has not a high learning curve, is not a too complex tech-fest, and stays fun and highly addictive after multiple seasons.

Many Pro's
>> Every aspect of the F1 world, before and behind the scenes is in the game
Managing Part;
- An addictive but not to complex base form the managing part.
- Teams have their own facilities that improve their performances and sets a base of hierarchy in the game. The building processes are long, hard to make and must be carried over seasons providing an excellent longevity of your level of addiction. From the weather center that will provide you with more precise predictions to the scouting center you need to scout for better personnel.
- Teams have their own technical staff that provides them during the season with new design, and influence the progress of the design as well during the race where race mechanicals make the difference in winning the race or not with many special traits. From designing forbidden parts to hiring brutal mechanics that can improve pit stops dramatically and give you that successful undercut.
- You need an extra influx of money? Hire a pay driver.
- You have a driver that stars a fierce rivalry but you do not want to lose him when he cannot stand the heat. Just give him better parts then your second driver. Or give him team orders. It is all in the game.

The Racing Aspect
- Different practice and qualifying formats, can be altered, and are in the game.
- The virtual and physical safety car are in the game and the AI reacts swiftly and accurate to these sudden unexpected changes.
- Crashes, mechanical as well as driver errors or dilemmas form the dynamic and realistic character to the race. From the problem to save the tires to choosing whether or not to lower the Engine settings, is it in the game.
- Dynamic weather that results in different tactics along the AI as well as your mechanic feedbacks on the set-up as well as your drivers feedback and their capability to handle and to sense when and how to adapt.
- The infamous stewards aren't missing either. From start accidents to locks up or just plain Maldonado-squeak moves resulting in penalties. Or banning your parts and giving your grid penalties. It is all in the game.

The Political Aspect
As hinted by the devs, the political problems that you often face are in the game. You will become a politician yourself.
You are Red-Bull in the hybrid era and cannot stand to win never in Monza? Remove it from the calendar during the FIA meetings!
You are Ferrari and lack race pace but improved your qualifying pace? Make qualifying an one lap show!
You do not like the Pirelli high-degradation tyres? Vote. Them. Away. 
The Privateers will even try to get the top teams into traffic by voting to reduce the pit lane speed!

In this game you can do it, and the AI also votes with multiple season in mind. 


Multiple Season Quality.
Well now you think? 'Ah ok. But how is the game after one season, can u win easily?'

Starting from day you put parts of the budget aside for next season.
Your drivers can improve or get worse and gain certain traits. From Jenson Button triathlon  skills to a Verstappen that not listens or just goes full-risk in the rain.
The winter season has the one of the most revolutionary aspects of this revitalized genre. 

You will negotiate with your design crew in the winter season and during pre-season tests how to build your car in all aspect of the chassis, ranging from - Improvability (is your design crew for your engine not yet wicked enough to catch up on an important part for that season, Mechanical grip or just the hybrid engine, then settle in the beginning for second or third and play catch up) - to choosing your engine supplier and negoiate the best config for your fuel suppliers. And yes the alliances made during the 2016 are visible in the game. e.g. IF you try to buy a Ferrari engine as Williams you will not get a discount like Haas would get.

The game changes a lot during season, from all the privateer teams voting certain circuits out because your car suits the track well last year to the always recurring questions. Bring refueling back? Or even better, the choice to even cut qualifying.

Sometimes political actions will screw up your build for next year because you have to rebuild it for next season, or your drivers aren' one lap wonders. Or you dropped a place in the championship last race and miss that constructor money and need to hire a pay driver because of that. Or catch your chief engineer being corrupt and passing over your designs over just before the start of the winter season. It is all in the game.

Cons about the game:
Do not think I work for SEGA or such, but many of the problems hinted by infamous users simply aren't true. Here to name some;
- Blue flags are fixed in the previous update. Ghost cars now yay. The maximum although not damaging impact backmarkers can still have is completely normal if you watch pay-tv F1.
- Crashes happen often enough especially in lower classes, although because of Mechanic-driver relations, highly reliable parts and the simple fact F1 drivers aren't that bad in handling a car, especially in the highest class of the game, some races do finish with all cars. Which is again, completely normal if you watch F1.
- First corner crashes, however are seldom more then 2-driver-collisions.
- Yes, there are a few mistakes, from translation errors to non-impacting graphic glitches in the menu. They are being fixed. The developers are backed by SEGA do not worry about that.
- Just like real F1 the media although present and interviewing you, have to little impact. The Ferrari-Verstappen media clash and opinion are not available but can be built to have more impact in the steam workshop due to open within two months.
= Camera work can use improvement although the game is already GPU-heavy. This and the game speed  - Which I would say we should be able to lower too -, should get better with the Steam workshop.

All these managerial highlights, along with the not too steep learning curve and the 2017 graphics, make this game one of the best of the year already,",1485269925,1485269925,True,2,0,0.506132781505584717,0,True,False,False
415200,29437403,76561198014645565,0,37,9443,0,1706,1625027969,"This game and Football Manager - another title published by SEGA but developed by a different studio - are not that different. Both rely heavily on data sets that can be refined and shaped by the player to determine the outcome of a sporting event. The difference - and where Motorsport Manager bypasses its peer - is that this is how motorsport is *supposed* to work. 90% of the work is done before the race in designing car frames, tuning parts, and making on-the-fly adjustments in practice, so that by the time the driver even gets in the car, there is a general idea of how the race will go, and there's no chance an otherwise competent fullback will watch a winger fly right by him to have a crack at goal while he stands there picking his nose.

MM takes that built-in advantage over other sports sims and runs with it; while it's not some sort of massive, revolutionary triumph, it does what it sets out to do and does it well.

Sim games like this normally are about the underlying mechanics rather than the visuals, but credit where credit is due - this game is a lot prettier than many of its peers in the field. The diverse list of tracks (most of which are unliscensed stand-ins for their real counterparts) cover a diverse range of locales and all have different personalities, from the wealthy ports of Qatar to the desert heat of Phoenix to Belgium's corner of the lush Ardennes forest. Beijing's circuit even has a noticeable haze from all the smog!

While it could end there, tracks all have different personalities on-circuit as well. Some places get more rain, requiring more intense tire strategy. Some of the hotter spots might affect part wear differently, and every track has a set of parts that need to be at peak performance to have the best chance at a good run.

That's where part design comes in. You build your base car at the start of the season but are able to add parts to it in one of six categories (front and rear wings, brakes, gearbox, suspension, and engine) which all affect the car in different ways. Those parts can be improved and made more reliable over time by your performance team as they tap the potential you lay into the parts when you order them built. Parts can and will break down or outright break on you during the season, so all these various organs have plenty to keep them busy over a full season.

Players also get to negotiate sponsorship deals and use that money to develop cars, parts, and the campus on which your race team works, going so far as to add a theme park and production car factory once you hit the biggest of big times.

But to do that, you have to win races, and, surprise, that's really freaking hard. Strategy is crucial to beat the aforementioned dynamic weather plus other drivers, and a bad practice session (or one that doesn't reflect likely race conditions) can put you behind the 8-ball before you even set your qualifying times. This is where your drivers come into play and disrupt all the cold, straightforward math; they might not tell you if certain things are working certain ways, and that could cost them precious seconds in the long run. The less information and feedback you get from your drivers, the worse the cars perform vs. their potential, and the more likely it is that your driver becomes a self-absorbed diva, especially if he (or she, as there are a ton of female drivers in MM) is winning races anyway.

My complaints are relatively minor. The big one is player-managed cars crashing too frequently, even with average drivers and reliable parts. There's no indication it might be coming, but I've had both drivers on my team crash in the same spot moments apart before, an infinitely infuriating experience. I've also noticed that, after non-damaging collisions, my drivers tend to take a massive nosedive in performance, almost like they're sulking on-track. That's an immersion-breaking moment in the game when it happens (which is fairly often). Players get to vote on political issues within the sport (spec changes, track changes, etc.) but never get to frame or set the agenda themselves. You also don't have any say in the design of your base car beyond material sources. Oh, and the scouting department is weird and never totally explained; it feels like the one area where the developers got a little lazy and just transplanted ideas from other games in the management genre with no special twists on it.

Overall, though, the good far outweighs the bad in my mind, as the chance to run an F1-style racing team is extremely rewarding, with well-built feedback loops and strategic challenges that make this worth the rather heavy investment (thank you indie devs for making $35 feel like an expensive game again). It has come a long way from its mobile roots, and sim fans will definitely want to check this one out.",1485151278,1485151278,True,2,0,0.540673255920410156,0,True,False,False

The refuelig with me is dodgey, it's always a lap or 2 off. Not only that but blue flags are frustrating, if you unlap yourself you instantly get blueflagged and slow down again, ruining your chances of any decent position.

For the rest this game is amazing! It is very enjoyable. Just fix these minor irritations and it would be flawless.

One thing I would like to see, either by option (like Football Manager) or by design is to throw the challenge curveball.  I'd like to see randomised abilities of staff and drivers for every new game so we don't get to the stage that once strategies are refined, there is a roadmap to guaranteed success by hiring Driver A & B and Staff C, D and E for 2 seasons then etc etc etc.

1. Fast Forward
As in most sport manager games you can fast-forward when it comes to the match or in this case the race. There are three paces and the fastest one is still too slow. It should have a faster fast-forward.

2. Create your own drivers, mechanics, designers and race teams
You can only create a manager character. You should at least be able to create your own race teams. The game offers 3 leagues each consisting of 10 race teams. There is no option to create your own. The same applies to drivers, mechanics and designers.

3. Influence of manager character
Your own manager character has three attributes with an option for a special trait. If you don't plan on changing the race teams your attributes are pretty useless. There should be attributes like ""negotiation"" which affect the outcome of negotiating contracts.

4. Vote of the manager committee
Each league has a committee consisting of the managers of the race teams and each committee votes for rule changes in thier respective leagues, like which tires are allowed and stuff like that. But subjects of a rule change are predefined. You cannot initiate a rule change on your own. For example, if the rules of your league forbid refueling you cannot initiate a vote for removing this prohibition.

5. Turn down Sponsor Contracts
You cannot turn down sponsor offers. You have to wait until the offer expires.

6. THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE ASPECT
There is no driver with a similar name (due to license issues) and corresponding talent to Michael Schumacher! I mean, honestly? A motorsport game whithout the legend of legends? It's like playing a physics game without Einstein or Newton.

In the main menue of the game there is a section called ""Workshop"" that is labeled ""Under construction"" and ""Coming soon"". So I hope some of the above mentioned aspects will be rectified.",1484734194,1484734194,True,2,0,0.52476954460144043,0,True,False,False

Since Xmas I've played 181 hours, its highly enteraining and enjoyable.

There's lots to do between races, hiring staff, upgrading parts and buildings , improving marketability to attract better sponsers, Hiring designers and mechanics who specialise in certain components. Throughout the season, every 56 days,  the GMA, that you are a member of, votes on proposed rule changes that take effect the following season i.e. faster pit stops, no refuelling, more races, different tracks, what components are spec and which are developed through the season. The interviews are a bit meh and repetitive  as well as the comments from fans and the press, they need more variety. The tracks are well designed and some are identical to real life like the Milan race is really Monza.

Pros:
Off Race features:
upgrade your cars with up to 6 different catagories of parts
upgrade your buildings, build new ones, and enjoy the heaps of rewards they bring
research new tech, unlock new and improved parts for your cars 
hire and fire staff as you see fit, scout new talent, make a winning team
In Race features:
Implement team orders, increase power output at the cost of fuel, increase overtaking/aggression at the cost of tyre wear
strategise pit stops, will you change to a new set of tyres, refuel the car, repair a part, or try for 1 more lap
work out a winning formula, every race demands a very precise combination to win.

cons:
These you will find are the only real issues, and perhaps will be ironed out in the future:
Qualifiers; theyre just a complete joke, there is no strategy or tactics, just heat your tyres and your engine... sounds simple but the tyres heat up 3x quicker than the engine, and the whole thing lasts a minute. be prepared to lose half of your sponsor cash every race because its split 50/50 with the qualifiers.
Staff skill level; nearly all of the staff have a 2-3 star rating, and very few have any potential for improvement (which by the way is either painfully slow or a myth, as after 4 seasons of consistant pole position wins, 5 star potential drivers simply havent improved a bit), and you cant view staff traits or skill without scouting first which takes weeks.
Cars reset every season leaving your 1st class highly researched polished pride and joy straight in the bin, and back to the drawing board, And the start of every season you are presented with a bunch of parts that are heavily damaged and it takes 2 races to bring these parts up to enough durability to sustain a whole race without having to sacrifice 20+ seconds in the pit",1484408551,1484408551,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because while I recommend it, I reached a point of exhaustion and every time I see it in my library now I wonder whether I should play it, and then talk myself out of it.

The game is addictive, there are a lot of nice touches. There is a lot to manage, but it gets samey after a while. I think a better word would be ""cyclic"". You don't just do the same thing all over again to get better gear, better tech, better headquarters, better positions on the leaderboard. You do these same things, get some results, and then said results are taken away from you. If you have more patience than I have, you might be fine with this. The problem for me is that the game makes you feel like you have made progress and then takes that progress away every time you start a new cycle. You believe you start from a better position, after all you get to build a better car in between seasons, but you are very wrong about that.

In my first run I picked a decent team in the lower league, first season I think I hit the middle of the leaderboard. Second season, same league, I managed, eventually, to get first and get promoted to the middle league. But not without a lot of sweat. That's fine though as you feel you have achieved something. Let me explain how it all went.

First season you start off with car parts with low durability. You improve both performance and reliability (they are the two sides of the coin in this case). But it takes time, so your car breaks down, and you have to go to the pit stop and hope that the AI cars also break down (they do, actually). Anyway, your car is so unreliable you wonder whether you built it out of Lego. Your car gets better, you need less pit stops, and if you play it right you eventually wind up winning the races. Unless of course a random safety car appears so everyone catches up with you and you lose that beautiful lead you built over the course of the race.

I finished the first season and now I build a new chassis, which should improve your car. I upgrade my headquarters etc, although the boss slaps me a couple of times when I try to buy way more than I can afford. Spoilsport. Literally.

Anyway I start the second season and the reliability of my parts is awful again. The performance tweaks are still there, but they are useless when you have to go back to the pit stop many times over. You have to do the same thing you did in the first season, however this time my drivers have more experience and yes my engine is better, etc. So I did wind up first in the league and got promoted. For a few races though, up to the middle of the season, I thought that was never going to happen.

So now I went from the lower league to the middle league and I am starting over again for the third time. Same thing, all the parts I have created now have the worst durability... yes the performance has transferred over, but it's pretty much useless when your stuff breaks every two seconds.

You would have thought that as you go through the seasons, your team would have learned how to build a reliable part and would not leave the cars out in the rain to rust away, right?

So despite having been promoted to the middle league, I felt like I gained nothing. You also have to be very careful on the expenses mid season - if you go too overboard you will handicap yourself with debt and will not be able to build new parts but only improve the durability of the parts you built the previous season. While I understand this concept, as in reality you would need to strike the balance anyhow, it just feels the game proceeds at snailpace. I shouldn't need to concentrate on the durability as much as this game wants me to. I should keep an eye, but it shouldn't just be completely wiped out every time you start over.

Despite all this, you feel you want to do one more race. Another one. And, no, I am serious, only this one then I go to bed. Then my car breaks for the twentieth time. I close the game. I haven't opened it since.",1484389231,1484401600,True,1,1,0.52173912525177002,2,True,False,False

I am an 'elder computer gamer' of over 30 years since the early 'RGB' days, and as such, have played hundreds of computer games.

There are short and long-term decisions required; strategic as well as tactical decisions; real-time elements and thoughtful 'over a beer' decision-making without the pressure of a clock.  There are building game elements, racing game elements, team management elements, financial decisions, car livery colors, voting on rule sets, on and on.  Regardless of your interest-- or lack thereof-- in Formula 1 Racing, this is an exceptional management game ranked near the top of my list in this computer-game category.

I think I have put in nearly 50 hours in barely over a week.  There hasnt been a game that monopolized my free time like that in many years.

Basically you become the team boss of an F1, F2, or F3 analog team.  You run HQ, the drivers, the car development, staff, and of course the race itself.  I wont go into great details, but its engrosssing and addictive.  Even media, rule voting, and scouting of drivers play a crucial role, and change from year to year while maintaing continuity across all divisions, teams, and, individuals.  You could concievably play forever as I am not aware of a year cap. 

I prefer to start at the bottom and work my way up in games such as these, and I am currently 5 season deep with ZRT.  They are an F3 outfit that are ranked 9 out of 10 at the begining, were now up to around 4th-5th, but I am looking to move to another team soon I think as I dont see ZRT being able to win a champianship anytime soon.  Maybe a move to F2 is in my future?  Did I mention you can apply for the boss job at other teams?

For motorsport fans:

Looks: I does the job of pleasing your eyes with nice and detailed graphics and well selected colours, the 3D view is customizable but its got it's limits, you can turn camera around zoom in a bit and zoom out a bit. But what else would you need? well the cars are driving mostly off the natural raceline and that doesn't look good. Behavior of those machines is as strange as possible, sometimes your driver can be outbraked by a car that was miles behind... (more about it later). the looks are alltogether good but I'm worried that they focused the game on console market and you can see it pretty much everywhere.

Gameplay: If you are a motorsport fan then dont go anywhere near this game, it's the most anoying thing I've ever tried! The mechanics advice on setup is useless, there's just one practice session to get the setup sorted comepletly from scratch, the drivers are useless whatever level they are. Quali is extra short (If you're lucky you can do 3 timed laps) and you still miss any good setup, then on outlap you have to manage drivers car so by the end of lap his tires and brakes have perfect temp (with two drivers its close to impossible). Ah yeah the setup... well try to skip Practice session and check what they've done to the cars before quali, what a waste... overall the setup screen again looks too simple too much consoley, got simple settings of wing angle, tire pressure, gearbox ratio in ""xx%"" (why??!!), camber and suspension stiffness again in ""xx%"". the drivers dont give any good advice on what they need messages like ""I need more wing"" tell us nothing. The difference between car setups for both drivers sometimes is so different that you start to think ""how the hell can they do same lap times, front wing max, rear wing minimum?!"" and another one ""how the hell this car can drive on that track??!!"". Further on the game is missing choice of racing series, theres just one and some tracks for it nothing else, again too consoley. The race itself is as boring as you could expect from game like that, if you really lucky, you might see some sort of weird looking ""fast paced"" and ""exiting"" ""action"" yeah it won't cause you heart attack. Then its rain prediction, in place of giving any sort of signal that there might be rain soon you need to check the top weather bar to find out, if you dont then well take your driver into pits for new tires, as soon as he stops it will start to rain (and theres no way to swap tires on the fly in pits, only let him go and bring in again). Another thing, the lap times... you got your driver with fresh wet tires, the track is soaking, some other driver got his tires down to 30% and does laps 20 seconds faster then you!! ah and being tactical and trying to cut on pit stops or pushing makes no sense, if parts wont brake down then something else will stop you from advancing... one thing did stand out of this misery, it was the parts development, again not a lot but it actually worked.
This game hasn't got much of a proper motorsport manager...

For Non motorsport fans:

game looks good, got all the fancy graphics you might like and is simple to play, no complicated statistics or telemetry (if you know what it is). It's a simple layback game with a bit of exitement when it all comes to a roll of a dice in quali and race...


I'm really dissapointed with this game, had great expectations, was thinking of my strategy for every race, and then after first gameplay it all went down from a very steep slope... Was hoping that SEGA trademark will help it to be at least a good product, but turns out games for fans dont exist anymore, now we have to cope with universal UI for console and PC, forget all what goes into managing a racing team, forget our dreams about it. Five clicks, quick look on useless sliders and off you go.
So if youre thinking about buying it, think what you expect from it, and based on that make your decission. 
Hope you wont be as dissapointed as I am.",1483900659,1483900659,False,6,0,0.411955684423446655,3,True,False,False

I think of it as F1 meets OOTP Baseball lite. Some of the best parts are changing rules during the season. You will vote on changes to things like spec parts, pit lane changes, added races etc so even while playing in a particular season its constantly changing and effecting the way you run your team. The most fun is trying to take a terrible team from the bottom up to the top, signing new drivers, mechanics, and engineers to improve your car over several seasons. 

While the game has kept my attention is does have some problems. The race/race weekends themselves are fairly boring and a little tedious. theres not really much outside of move sliders around until driver is happy and watch cars go around a track. I think its here the initial mobile roots of the game show the worst but the tracks are nicely detailed.

My Second problem with the game is that parts of it are severely unfinished. theres a ton of missing strings in the game so youll see a lot of ""During the race {INSERT_DATA HERE} had a crash"" and stuff like that where things aren't translated or are straight up missing. 

lastly while I've found the game fun its spread a little thin. Its a little shallow in all areas. Creating parts is just checking premade ""components"" in order to up the stats of whatever you're building. Signing contracts is scrolling through a list of names, looking at their stats and seeing if you can move some sliders around to fit their wants so they'll sign, and the ""interviews"" outside the race are just fluff.

Playing this has made me appreciate watching Formula One even more because of the intense strategy decisions you have to make during races.

It's very good pick up and play game, for 20 minutes, a few hours, whatever. Although I haven't been able to play more than a couple of hours at a time usually, it stresses me out trying to get the perfect balance and seeing whether my racers will actually do as well as I think they should. Sometimes they do poorly and it sucks, but there will always be more races, which is one thing that this game is good about.

If you start from the bottom as I have, (I started at the 2nd worst team in the bottom racing group) their will be a lot of playabillity, and it will take a while to get to the top. I started my first season expected to finish 9th out of 10 and did. I'm on the next season now and I am 7th now! This is one of the best things I love about this game. There are a lot of games on Steam that are fun, however not all of them are fun for over 30-40 hours. I'm positive this will go over that.

A few of the things that could be better is the messages. sometimes you'll get a message of someone asking for an interview, I've only seen them ask ""Your racer didn't do so great that race, comment?"" the only answers are 1. They did badly 2. This wasn't their day, but they'll do better next time or 3. It was my fault. The only problem with that is when your team is expected to be in 9th place overall and your 2 racers get 6th and 14th respectively (out of 20 racers) You in fact did really well in that race, but there is no interview for that.

As the game stands right now- I cannot reccomend it to my friends.

Pros- Awesome management options and lots to grind for.

Fun content and conept of the game

Cons- Technical issues with the game really hamper ones ability to be successful.

If you choose a lower tier game you will be frustrated watching all other cars pass you by and never being able to finish in the top 10. Blue flags will cost you races and it's a losing battle to keep your drivers/team/chairman happy. 

If you choose a decent team you are still going to suffer through being stuck behind slower cars while your driver does nothing to pass them, Pit stops are slower then the AI's and one tiny mistake during race time will cost you. 

After making the mistake of going with tier 1 I restarted at tier 3 and picked a moderately rated team because I wanted to build a team not be handed one. No matter what I do it's impossible to finish on the podium. I finally finished a race in the top 10 and my game crashes and lost the progress. 

Advice to game devs- Make this game more forgiving in the middle of the pack. It's too black and white where you either are the best or the worst- there's no hope for teams in the middle. 

-Blue flags are game breaking, get rid of them completely 

-Make more aggresive driving pay off more, If I'm on Attack and overtake it shouldn't take 5 laps to pass the car in front of me running on conserve and neutral fuel.",1483646433,1483646433,False,1,4294967295,0.4012126624584198,2,True,False,False

Every nuance of motorsport is covered, including tyre choice, fuel load, chassis development, driver negotiations and behaviours. The 3 series on offer (representing GP3, GP2 and F1) are too similar however and after a while all the races play out the same - if your car is unreliable, you won't get lucky or have a good race until that is fixed. If your car is slow, you won't get any decent results until you upgrade parts etc. It's a shame because some of the most exciting moments in motorsports occur in these situations but you end up feeling like giving up on the season only a couple of races in once you realise you have these problems with no realistic way of fixing them or having a good result whilst they aren't dealt with.

Overall a fun game, perfect for dipping in and out of for even a non-motorsport fan but after a while things start to follow a formula (pun intended) that is hard to get out of. There should be more variety in the results, performance of other drivers and speed differential between various part/tyre choices on offer.",1483633485,1483633547,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all I'm using a real mod with this game... I started a career with McLaren to try and build them back up into a contender. The first four races were difficult as our car clearly needed work and we finished anywhere raging from 11th to 17th. In the fifth race Fernando Alonso picked up 1 point for finishing 10th which I celebrated like a race win. Going into the 8th race of the season the chairman decided I wasn't getting the job done and gave me the ultimatum of finishing 7th in the upcoming race or lose my job. I came 9th with Alonso and was fired. Currently managing a team in GP3 slowly plotting my revenge on McLaren for my return to F1. 

Suggestions:

- It would be nice to have Q1, Q2 and Q3 in the future.
- It would be nice to have an option to turn off being fired.
- It would be nice to have more teams (11 or 12) rather than 10.
- Have the potential for new teams to emerge and perhaps teams to go bankrupt and replaced.

I watched BSB, MotoGP, F1 and BTCC and being a technically minded child who always asked why, i loved the tech and setup side of motorsport as much as the racing and the skill involved.

I played racing games since day dot, from the notoriously difficult TOCA series through the GranTourismo and F1 franchise. 

I have dabbled in manager games before but none quite tickled my fancy, until now.

This game is fantastic, for anyone who is a fan of motorsport and has an understanding of how teams, cars and drivers work. This game is a must. No game is perfect and this one has had its teething problems, which are being worked through (none of them are really game breakers) The community support, tips and guides is amazing, which shows the spirit of motorsport fans and soon we will have the workshop section of the game active.

I have currently clocked 172 hours on the game (some may have been afk whilst eating etc) completed 9 seasons working with team China. Working from Euro, through Asia ensuring i upped my staff and HQ i have reached my first season in the World Championship, second worst car on the grid, but through using light, fast strategy with 3 stops i have won 2 races =)

There are quite a bit of management tools built into this, but not an overwhelming amount that bogs down the enjoyment and flow of the game. It is simple enough, yet detailed to understand that everything makes a difference. The graphicsa are decent enough and can be played on a mid level laptop with 2D mode. The game isn't a pushover and can get frustrating from real life scenarios out of your control, happening to your team. There is enough in race strategy that decisions really do make a significant difference. The rules changes throughout the year are nice added touch for immersion. The amount of motor tracks is nice.

The Bad

It can be a bit too simple at times. Some of the responses you can give to media questions are overly simplistic and become repetitive. The game replayability isn't as diverse as some other games. A few wierd graphical and play glitches show up occasionally. Some of the team member responses are simplistic and odd. They occasionally remind you that you  are playing a game that is occasionally too simple.

The Ugly

Honestly not really anything game breaking or fun breaking. About the worst thing I can say, at this point is that it can be  too simple at times and some responses in game are a bit non-sensical.

Final word.......

The game is addicting because there is real progression, not too steep a learning curve and snappy in pace. They need to keep adding to the game, and they are. The mods will come pouring in when there is a real ability to mofd the game, which is coming.

- Game takes too much time, need to be able to speed up races. More speed levels and/or being able to get instant result of race.

- overtaking is too extreme, losing too much time when being overtaken and sometimes even drivers can ruin each other races being too stubborn to trying overtake every corner.
- Designing illegal parts not being used in race instead for boosting next years base level should be prevented, I see it as an exploit and never do it.

For me, this game strikes the right balance between amount of detail and interesting decisions to make, combined with slick presentation.

For example, which part to redesign: can I afford it, will my designer do a good enough job to warrant it, does it lead to even better designs, which race will it reliable enough for, which driver will get it and will it help long term by carrying over into next year (if I'm not fired).

Races require attention!  It took me until the fourth career race, even with a few practice races, before I got all the calls right.  You have to stay on your toes and react quickly to things like yellows and rain, although thankfully you can pause to take a moment to reflect on your decision.

All in all, a nice effort for a first release of a game, and it looks like its still being improved.

This game is one of the best open wheel team manager simulator on the market! 
I use to play TrackDay Manager... Use to. This game blows it out of the water. 

You start the game as the manager for one of any number of teams. You get to choose between starting from scratch with a green crew, car, and sponsors or you can choose a team with all the bells and whistles already in place! 

Manage every aspect of your team with the ability to design and build different components for your car. Hire the driver type you want. Hire the mechanics and designer you want. CUSTOMIZATION IS AMAZING in this game. 

Highly, HIGHLY addicting gameplay! I have racked up 51 hours and only owned the game a handful of days now. You want to race. You need to compete! You are compelled to continue to grow your empire as you build upon previous seasons.

If you like racing sim managers, BUY THIS GAME! You will not regret it. It is a bit pricey, but worth every cent!

I personally started off in the European Championship with Team Silvia Racing. They are right in the middle of the lineup so it gave me a good foundation to start my game without handing me everything. I had to master the game in order to pull of my first win, and my goodness was that an epic moment. 

Ultimately, yes, the game does become ""the same thing"" over and over, BUT, your strategy changes after each race. And the depth of control over your strategy is pretty deep. 

The graphics are good enough, nothing to win awards over, but it does everything it needs to. Cars emit sparks when flying over corners, and smoke when a part completely breaks down. The menus can seem overwhelming from the screenshots, but the tutorial eases you in gently to come to terms with all the systems and controls you need to monitor and adjust during a race.

When not in a race, you're developing parts, scouting new staff, and preparing for the next race by checking weather etc. Its not always rainbow and sunshine, I couldn't pull off a podium finish my first couple of races, and the team founder gave me an ultimatum to get a 5th position or higher in the next race or I was fired. A few attempts and Alt-F4s later, I finally fired my worst race mechanic, developed new brakes for the next race, and set my best driver for a long haul 3-pit strategy. It paid off, even with a bum engine 3 laps to finish and managed to bring home the gold and save my job.

The basic idea of the game is to climb through the ranks with whatever team you decide to join and climb to the top of the fantasy racing mountain. The game has 3 different racing groups each with their own set of rules, with 10 teams in each group. As you go through the seasons you'll find yourself having to upgrade your cars, your HQ, drivers, sponsorships, strategy etc, to make the best out of your team. However, during each season new rules are voted upon by each season which will affect the next season (as I've only played in the bottom group I can only say their get to vote 4 times per season, other groups may vary). But its not as simple as it may appear. As each vote comes you can decide to be for, against or decide not to vote at all, and since each team gets a vote they'll be wanting to try and get the rules in their favour. If you decide not to vote, it gets carried over to the next vote effectively giving you 2 votes instead of 1. So it can become a mini game where you'll have think whether or not the rule change is or is not worth voting for, as well as would your vote make the difference and if not you can save it for the next vote. I will also note that in the event of a tie vote, the npc of the governing body will then cast an 11th vote to break the tie. 

As well as all that when winning the constructors championship, you get to decide whether you should ""promote"" to the next series or not. Of course its risk vs reward and whether you should promote is up to you to decide.

However, despite this there a couple of negative things I want to add. At the HQ, building new buildings (as well as upgrades) seem really expensive, so teams who struggle with income will find it harder to improve in the long run. The pre-season improvement option e-mails that come with the extra cost, seem to be the same each pre-season. When a driver ""crashes"", just looks like their driven off the track when it doesn't involve another car. Blue flagged cars sometimes get in the way which can cost you a position when you're racing against another car. Limited colour options for car liveries. Sometimes drivers waste a bit of time behind the safety car instead of going straight pass so it can pick up the 1st place car. The safety car only last 2 laps, so sometimes your drivers won't be able to reach the back of the Safety car line leaving them at a disadvantage.

But overall, the game is worth its price and I would recommend it to other people.",1483055889,1483055889,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

The game do not have all real life names of drivers or teams, but in my humble oppinion it dosent matter.
I am the manager of an F1 team and desided to start in lowest level with worst team and I enjoy it though
I after one season havent won a single race yet.. Ofcourse as manager that is my fault and not my drivers, and it dident help i put wrong tires on them in the rain so i had to go to pit again with two cars to fix my fault.. and it also dosent help they ran out of fuel on last lap when I had possition 1 and 2

Well what I want to say is thought the race it self is kind of basic and you more or less during the race only can change tires and change your fuel and tactics then the gams race is actual kind of fun.. You see thel ittle cars battle it out and win or loose the fight. And yes you even see them break down or crash, it is really ""fun"" with such events.
Before every race you get the option to test drive/quality.. during this qualification you can adjust gearbox/spring and handling of the car, and depending on how the drivers feel about it during test driving then you can tweak it to your liking.. Do no worry it is not so difficult as in real life but work in a more simple and initiatuative nice way that is fun with smiley rating. You aslo sometimes get some bonuses during this testing such as 5% better tires or so.

As the manager you also control everything from buying or upgrading buildings. And you also can build new parts for your f1 racer, and improve excisting ones so they become much more reliable.
On top of this you also have to manage your economy with sponsor deals where you before every race have to select only deal.. well you belive you do better than top 10, top 5, or maybe top 2 ?  well if you choose the correct sponsor deal before the race and you complete the goal then you get extra money.. If you fail your goal you get less sponsor money.
You also just like in a good manager game, can scout new crew or drivers and they all have different stats. And just like in real life they do from time to time develop different skills or have accidents that make them worse.
You have to negosiate contracts and hire/fire.
Once the season end you have to choose next seasons fuel provider, and spare parts provider ect ect. this is pretty cool and you have 3 different contracts to choose from in different categorys all with different outcoms good and bad.
Also at end of season your mechanics present you with next seasons car. Then you again have to improve it and so on, to compete with the others. Actual you even have good statistics that show you how example your gearbox compare to other teams so it is more easy to find out what you should try to improve.

Well all in all I like this game, it is pretty cool and very well done.
If you like manager games and f1 then give it a try.

Before you know it you have somehow managed to get on the podium with a crappy car, won a million dollars and scouted a god of driver with 3.5 stars,  great improvability and 96% marketability , ""Lord Rodriguez"" ( I like to thank him everyday or everytime I start the game, it's necessary) * Thank you Lord Rodriguez *,  and promoted to APS, getting your asskicked there.. So on and so forth.. And in the real world trump has started the third world war, earth has been proved to be flat and you're  a hundred years old at least. 

The way the game integrates complex real life events with subtle and easily accessible features is very impressive.  The menus are easy to navigate, the graphics are excellent. You woud'nt be confused anywhere in the game because everything is so well placed and explained. Gameplay is very satisfying for a Managing game. There's also an element of humour involved, drivers joing cults, "" dating teammates"" irrespective of genders, i would love to see Seb date Kimi, really would and tell the world in what the reporters in the game call ""vomit-inducing scenes"" of the press conference.

 Admittedly, this game has many irritations /bugs and exploits that we could do without, like

-the ever so consistent blue flags issues, even with updates constantly rolling in (-_-) 
-insane driver impact on race results 
-dodgy AI strategies, scratch that, ""***arded AI strategies ""
-Pre season reliability and performance improvement exploit ( not that I am complaining about it, but an exploit nonetheless) 
- other minor irritations. 

The silver lining here is that, the devs are constantly listening to the community and are working to make the game better. The recent beta patch seems to address most of the above issues. These few inconveniences are nothing compared to the joy you get when you win the World Championship with a tier three team and build a team from scratch. With the workshop coming soon, it's only going to get better. 
If the devs could release an expansion or dlc with other formats and multi-player, I am ready to wave goodbye to my life and everything else. 

In short : If you're an F1 fan, get this game. You'll love it. 

11/10.

So I start out with a team that is a little inexperienced and underfunded.  OK, I like the challenge.  I figure out we will not win early but get a good long term stratigy. I run the cars in weaker settings during the race to conserve them.  I just barely stay on the lead lap even at times, but open them up and gamble like mad on the last lap or two.  This works untill we can afford better parts and research facilities.  We place consistantly in the top 4-10 spots, but no podiums this way.  The team has a great first season by defying expectations, everyone is happpy, every part is created and maxed out, and the prize money and sponsor pay is mega big.

Off-season comes.  We expand the HQ and get more abilities to upgrade car parts for next season.  We buy the most expensive everything while developing next years chasis.   We turn down no research funding what-so-ever and say yes, spend for speed and durability at every corner imaginable.

Second season.  What in Sam Hill happened to all that money we spent.  The car is utter rubbish.  No joke, it runs worse than the first season car in every category.  Best durability on a non-wing feature is like 43.  We maxed all of it out and upgraded all of it last season.  We spent millions in the off season for what?  This is garbage.

You can't compete at all.  You have to pit every 1/3 of the race to even keep the car running replacing 2 to 3 major components each stop even when only running on the lowest settings trying to conserve your car.  Apparently teams with worse HQ, Staff, and all did not have that off-season drop you experienced because some how your car is rated 9th out of ten teams and they somehow have the money to out develope you at every turn this season and run full out without blowing up, but if you run even two laps at medium your car will be a ball of flames.  Come on?

There is zero point of a franchise mode or building for the future if you have to start over every year with such a massive handycap and utter garbage system.  Having multimillion dollar facilities and paying tens of millions of dollars in the off season will get you parts your local Ford dealer would not even put in a Ford Escort let alone a Mustang and a stock Mustang would out perform your multi-million dollar open wheel peace of trash at this point.  

I give the game a 5 out of 10.  The graffics are fine, the concept is good, but the Franchize Mode needs to be a little more on the level when handycapping your team at the start of each season.  Winning in the first four weeks would be an utter myth any season if this is the pattern.  3 races in and spending on upgrading and making new parts; it will be race 6 or seven before I have durrability to a run a full race level assuming there are no bumps and such with other cars and drivers.  Not looking forward to playing multiple seasons of this game if this is it.   They make FootBall Manager and I could not imagine if I lost my stadium and over 3/4 of my roster every off season as well.

In general, it's good. I don't think there is a modern racing manager game that comes close to Motorsport Manager. But it's far from perfect. I'm not sure what changes are coming to the game, but there are certainly some areas where it can improve.

The game has two major aspects to it and I think it makes the most sense to review them seperatly.

1: Manager aspect. This is the part where you give interviews, hire players, fire players etc.
This part of the game is so-so. The good thing about it, is that it is fairly straightforward. But when you compare it to Football Manager, it really falls short. This being said, I suspect Football Manager is the golden standard when it comes to these things. But there is a clear gap.

Talking to the press needs a bit of work. To me, it adds close to nothing. Right now you're told either by the press: 'Your driver did good, right?' Or 'your driver did bad, right?' And that's just not enough to make it interesting. Also it's odd that when you're leading a slower team and your driver gets 8th, which is a huge result, the press will still say you did poorly. 

Hiring players is fairly good. It's really simple, which has its advantages and disadvanatages. The one thing they really to add is an option to hire a driver at the start of next season, instead of at the moment the conract is agreed on. Still, one of the stronger parts of the manager aspect.

Improving your car and HQ. In the game you can improve your car and your HQ. This aspect of the game is really good.

I think they could add a lot to the managerial part of the game. Things like 'talking to your drivers.'

2: Races

To me, the race engine is what makes the game really special. And from what I've seen from other games, it's really hard to get this to work right. Others have tried, but I've never really seen it work. In this game it works! The races are really cool. 

-

It's also a shame you can't make your own team or drivers yet. I would hope that these are things that are coming to the game. But right now, they are sadly missing.",1481542056,1482151834,True,1,0,0.536231875419616699,0,True,False,False

I'm from the era of the original motorsport manager games, mainly Grand Prix Manager 1 & 2 and Grand Prix World. Just so you understand what I'm comparing Motorsport Manager to. Great 'MicroProse' Formula One management games that were made very well.


So instead of dragging out the paragraphs, I'm going to use a 'Pros and Cons' system for my opinion of the game.

Pros:

- Depth that lasts season after season. (Lastability)
- A simple but effective layout of most interactive screens.
- Ability to apply for management jobs in other teams.
- Three progressive divisions.
- Nice looking graphics, especially during races.
- Multiple different strategies that can be applied during races, and even in-between races.
- Interesting way of designing new parts and improving parts.
- Good way of implementing pre-season testing in the flow of the game.
- Rule changes you can vote on that can have a massive effect on the structure of the game, series to series.
- Overall well balanced racing manager game.
- The simple fact of having the first good racing management game in seventeen years.


Cons:

- Good management, but not really micro-management.
- Limited to a maximum of three sponsor options per slot.
- Very limited car retirement/crashes during races. (Really only pull in the pits or park off circuit, no real crashes)
- No spins or offs or mistakes from drivers, as such.
- Ineffective blue flags and back markers constantly ruining your race.
- Very little explanation on how some things work.
- The constant unrealistic lines your driver takes when 10-20 car lengths behind a backmarker.
- Little variety in email texts. As in responses to race wins, new team jobs, etc.
- Other little bugs like incorrect budget numbers, safety car in middle of track, etc.

I realize that most of the cons are nitpicking, but isn't it the accumulation of little things what makes the whole enjoyable? I think so, hence the nitpicking. Not to say this isn't an enjoyable game, because it clearly is shown in the amount of hours I've spent and will continue to spend playing this game.

All-in-all an excellent game with a bunch of cons that can be fixed/altered if Playsport Games so desired. Access to steam workshop would be excellent by the way.

Motorsport Manager is a brilliant strategic game where development, finances and strategy all come in to play to see success. Now includes many new features such as; livery's, weather, events and watching the race in 3D adds to the immersive nature of the game. One of my favourite features is the changing of the rules between each season, this is where during the course of the season rules are voted for or against to implement the rule or not for next year. This can spice up the season and can cause teams to change their competitive streak.

[b] UI [/b]
The UI couldn’t be simpler. It is stylish which gives the game a great look and feel. It is easy to find the information you need and you can quickly react to events if needed. The logos and sponsors also have a great cartoon simplicity which look great on the car.

[b] Graphics [/b]
The graphics is brilliant and have now added a 3D & 2D feature for those computers and aren't as powerful. The look of the circuits also has a cartoon feel while still looking realistic. I really enjoy the style of the game, although the look of the water can sometimes appear too dark depending on the angle you are looking at.

All in all a nice game, after a while you get to grips with it all, money is everything so look after it! Better to have reliablility than outright performance, as the end of the race you can over take the faulty cars.

From a newcomer's (to the genre) perspective, this is a challenging yet highly rewarding game to play.  The amount of detail is just about right without getting too technical.  I think if the developer made Normal and Advanced modes, they could make it appleal to everyone.  As of right now, it's got just enough detail to get inexperienced players (like me) to dive into a strategy/puzzle game such as this.  Yes, this is a puzzle game in a broad sense of the word.  Trying to make everything you want to do to the car fit into the timeframe before the race is a part of that puzzle.  When I started playing (after going through the nicely informative tutorial), I immediately chose the hardest team, Predator Racing.  The first thing I did was piece together my plans for improving performance and reliability using the calendar and trying to fit everything in so I could end the year at a decent position in the standings.  As a manager, your job is not just to look at the immediate situation, but look many races ahead and plan your strategy to win those.  I love this type of planning game (like Civ).

This game is one of my new favorites.


EDIT: It has now been one month since I started playing this game and I'm still finding it highly addictive.  I haven't played any of my other games because of the challenge this one posesses.  I have been keeping myself away from the Steam discussions on how to quickly beat this game with Predator Racing Team.  It's currently 2022 and I'm slowly working my way up the ranks in ERS.  I focused on my staff, then HQ, then drivers, and now I'm working on improving the car.  I know I should have concentrated on my car first, but that's all a part of how I play.  I look for the ""long, slow win"".

A couple of things:
1. You should either use Excel or buy a notebook to record car setups.  I prefer a notebook.
2. The car setups are not going to be the same every year, but they will be close.  Driver's change, cars change, parts change, weather changes...all this goes into why the setups are never the same.

- Every interview after race press says you've done below the expectations no matter what position you are in. My driver finished 6th on the slowest car on the grid and still the performance was dissapointing. Also midtable teams finishing on podium is ""below expectations"" according to the press.

- If qualifying session starts out in wet condition, but eventually dries out the AI wont change to dry tires giving you easy front row start.

- Most AI push ludicrously fast through their tires and pit 4 times when you could do easy 2 stop strategy.

- Rain comes in very quickly, but also dries out in matter of 2-3 laps.

- Sebastian Vettel would lose his mind if he would play this game. Blueflag system is appaaling.

- Getting stuck on traffic on a qualifying lap costs about 6 seconds because the AI doesn't give a f*** if you are behind them.

- If you are managing backmarker team it takes ages to get your car improved from worst on the grid. No matter how much money you spend. (If you are lucky to obtain parts from another team then you might make some progress. And those parts are usually risky resulting in penalties)

- Qualifying is horrible experience. You are almost certain to be held up in traffic and its very hard not to overheat the tires and brakes on your out lap. (I always let AI do the qualifying because its needlessly complicated to do by myself).

- Requires some performance to run smoothly even on lowest settings available if you want to play 3D mode, But 2D mode runs very smooth even on slower computers.

Now for the positives:

+ Isn't too hard if you have planned your tactics before the race. Even backmarkers can score good results, but still offers challenge in terms of executing the plans and getting both cars to the chequered flag.

+ Driver traits: Traits tell something about their personality. For example some drivers are prone to crashes, some hate duelling and some are chatty. Traits really liven up the game and helps you keep interested on the game.

+ Game allows you to be involved in many things during the season (designing new parts, improving new parts, scouting new drivers. finding new sponsors, designing next years car (even the livery and colours), solving problems in the team  and so on).

+ The sensation when you finish a race where you started from 19th and got up to 2nd just by tactics and especially when you have the worst car on the grid.

+ Politics. Game allows you to vote for rulechanges towards next season. There are many rulechanges (points system, spec parts, new tracks, new tires etc) so you can vote for or against rulechange or save your votes for the most important votes.

+ Hasn't crashed once when i've played it.

Some ideas for the future:

- Manager should be able to talk to drivers during the race (to calm them down when they rage on about being overtaken or cheer them up when they overtake somebody)

- Something to liven up the scenes after the race. Maybe podium cutscene or winner doing doughnuts at side of the road or something instead of showing the race winner in the garage.

- Menus could use some real music. Doesn't bother me though because i listen my playlist here:   

- More tracks would be nice on ERS. Not that nice driving some tracks twice in one season.

Pros:
*Freedom to choose to start at the top or work your way up from the bottom
*Full control of the factory/ buildings/ team members
*Part design and car mods system is good and makes you plan upgrades for each race
*Tweak the car set up over a race weekend with dirver feedback

Cons:
*Tyre wear/ temp hard to understand exactly how it effects laptimes
*Strange laptimes during wet races(big swings in laptimes)

The fact that this is so difficult to fix, coupled with the lack of communication from the team regarding further improvement, suggests that the team is a bit over their head in terms of what they tried to tackle.

However, I still recommend buying it! There's a sparse but long history of racing team management games that I think this has the potential to grow into being a major part of. It's no Grand Prix Manager 2 yet, but it's probably close to Team F1 (a relatively forgotten title from the mid 90s). The team needs, and deserves, support to get a real V2 out there that's a bit better thought out in terms of race gameplay (blue flags and overtaking being the worst offenders).

The game seems to move along at a quick enough pace but still have that feeling about it of been able to blow 150 hours on a save before it becomes easy. 
It feels alittle cut down (not to the point of an early access game) but you can see that they have left enough room for easy expandablity i.e New tracks, new championships, new cars.

The game is good but not complete, i suggest waiting to purchase the game in 2-3 months when the developers have refined the AI more so you can actually play qualification and be competative in beginning of races.

The attention to detail in a lot of areas - mainly towards the race weekend - is excellent.  You always have to think about how hard to push your drivers - the harder you tell them to push the higher the fuel consumption, tyre wear, engine wear, etc, so you have to plan it out.  It's not the type of game where you can tell your drivers to go as fast as they can and then just leave it at that.  You also have to plan when to bring them in for their pit stops, whether it will be a 2 or 3 stop strategy, what compound of tyres for them to use, howmuch fuel to fill them up with.  Pretty much everything that involves a real life race day experience.

Behind-the-scenes, you get options to design different - and better - parts for your cars as well from getting better engines to upgrading the suspensions.  These newer parts aren't cheap though so combine that with needing to upgrade your HQ so you can improve your drivers, your designers, your mechanics, as well as your car parts and you have a task on your hands because upgrading current buildings or building new ones is obviously much more expensive and you don't have an endless amount of cash.  The graphics are really nice and the attention to how the different race tracks look is very pleasing to the eye.  There's nice attention to detail from the smoke that comes from the tyres if a driver locks up his tyres to the spray that comes from the back of the car when the weather is rainy.  It's a very nice game to look at.  The only main gripe I have about the race weekend is that the time for the Practice Session goes by FAR too fast.  You have 12 minutes, but that goes by so fast that you don't feel that you've had a proper ""practice"" to tone your car.  12 minutes would probably be fine if the time went down in real-time instead of ticking by quickly.

The main downside of the game as a whole for me is that there's no real depth to the behind-the-scenes section of the game.  There's virually no interaction with the drivers/staff apart from hiring or firing them.  More one-on-one ""chatting"" or interaction would be MUCH better - similar to the way you can interact with players and staff in Football Manager for instance.  The media reports are extremely limited as well.  When you get asked for an interview for instance you only get asked two questions and they are practically the same questions ALL the time, and I think even those are a bit screwy because one of my drivers had a good race but the 1st question I got asked was referring to how my driver had a ""testing weekend"".  I'm playing one of the Game Challenges and I am in charge of the worst race team in the game and when one of your driver's is 2nd on the grid at the start of the race and finishes 4th it's NOT a ""trying weekend"".  The end of race media report is the exact same one too, as are the reports on the Practice sessions.  The Twitter feed isn't too bad, but some of these tend to get a bit repetative as well.  I know you can't have a ton of reports but surely there can be a very good amount of varying degree's to the reports.

This is still a very addivtive and enjoyable game, but if there was as much depth to the behind-the-scenes parts of the game as there is to the actual race weekend then the game as a whole would be MUCH better.",1481256442,1481256442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The macro game is building up your team to compete and win at the highest levels. Hire a 2.5-star driver with the potential for 5 and train him/her up over time. Save up enough cash to upgrade your factory so it can improve more parts at once. Take the proceeds of winning due to upgrading your parts and buy a practice track at your HQ to help improve the skills of your drivers and pit crews. Take 1st place in the Team Championship at the end of the season and ""graduate"" up to the next tier, if you want/dare to.

The mini-game is doing the best you can in each race. Manage how aggressive or passive your drivers are driving. Decide when they should come in for a pit stop, and what tires they should go out on based on the weather forecast. Otherwise, watch the race. It's pretty exciting!

A mini-mini game is tweaking your car's performance before each race. It's a little bit like the Mastermind game: Take a guess with the settings and go out for one lap. Check the feedback of each item (Poor, Okay, Great, Excellent, etc.) and make small or larger adjustments to the settings and send them out again. Try to get them all to Excellent before practice time runs out. After a few tries, it's pretty easy to get them to Great which is sufficient for the race, but leaving them at Poor or worse will have a noticible effect on the race. You probably won't finish on the podium unless your car tweeks are Great or Excellent.

Another mini-mini game is Qualifying. Compared to the rest of the game, this feature seems overly simple yet hard to understand. You drag a slider to try and find the sweet spot between tire heating and brake heating while your driver goes around the track. I've never found it.

In-game Emails/Twitter, sponsorship deals based on team marketability, media interviews that can affect team morale, employees having secret affairs or starting a modeling career on the side. A lot of depth that makes the game very immersive for a management sim.

Some negative reviews complain about things that the game lets you address:

- Parts failing during races: You can upgrade their reliability at the factory. AI cars break down often in the early season too, and you can use that to your advantage by driving easy and winning by attrition. Also, HQ and Parts Designer upgrades let you build more reliable parts without having to upgrade them at the factory.

- Drivers doing well in one race, then poorly in the next: Each track requires different skills from drivers, and different car parts to perform effectively. If you have a killer engine in an otherwise basic car, you'll do well in Milan but not so much in Yokohama where the cutback curves require more acceleration (gearbox) and deceleration (brake) performance than sheer top-speed. Drivers also have cornering and overtaking skills (among several others), and they are considered on a per-track basis by the game.

- I think I've *maybe* seen the blue flag thing. You're about to lap a slow-poke but he won't get out of the way. For me it hasn't really affected much. My driver has always been able to overtake him within a half a lap or less. Maybe it's been patched since those reviews came out.

Another annoying thing is the reliability issues when starting a new season. You always have trouble in the first races but the AI doesnt have the same amount of reliablility problems. This makes me want to fast forward over the first race or two.

My first start I thought I would go through the tutorial but as helpful as they are, I didn't like some of the decisions it makes you make. I restarted after I completed them and decided to make my own way. Starting in Tier 3 as The Predator Racing Team and it's meagre budget and massively underpowered /performing car, I started my first race and picked my Tyre and fuel setup, going for soft tyres and only a third of my fuel tank full for obvious reasons. My strategy worked out well and my best driver managed 12th place, not a  podium finish but if you have played the game you would understand how bad the stating car is and I felt like I earned it.

I haven't played a huge amount of time yet but I know in the five or so races I have played that this is a fun game that I am going to enjoy spending time with. While probably not as indepth as Football manager there is still alot of Tinkering to be had, Staff, car and components, HQ upgrades, drivers with perks and skills. I still have not got to the end of the year but I believe I will have to purchase my chassis for the year, something I am looking forward and saving towards. You also have to vote in political dilemmas, example of this was I was asked to vote on teams using the same brakes the following season, I voted yes, as a small team this would be one less expense and work for my staff to do, it was voted in so becomes law next season.

Very happy with my purchase, would be nice if there were a few additions or dlc a little down the road to enhance it but as it is now, it's a great game.",1481006618,1481006618,True,1,0,0.503225803375244141,0,True,False,False

My biggest disappointment is the career aspect of the game. Each new season is like starting again from scratch. There just isn’t enough recognition of the development made in the previous season. Even if you have invested the max amount of cash during a season and purchase the best fuel, materials etc. pre-season every component is awful in terms of starting performance and reliability. It then takes half the season to bring the cars up to the levels of the opposition who all seem to suffer no such penalties. I am not expecting a new car to be faultless from the start, but the car I start with ought to better reflect the investment made and the developments made in the prior season. I would be better off running last year’s car than investing in a new one each year, but that isn’t an option.

I love the idea of voting to change the rules as this certainly offers some extended playability to the game. I also like the traits of staff that change over time and the little back stories, which gives them some personality.  

Signing new staff could do with bringing forward, we all know that most new contracts are negotiated and sorted in the last third of the season and not exclusively post season. You ought to be able to line up replacement staff to start at a future date. 

Mentioned by others I know, but too many opposition cars seem to run perfectly well for far too long with problems passing others with ease and even achieving fastest laps. Clearly I don’t know what their problem is but it happens too often to be believable.

Even with its faults I keep coming back for more so it can’t be all bad. Fix the annoyances and it will be a great game. Add multiplayer and online leagues and it could be fantastic!

That’s not okay.

The qualify is also a joke. When you are trying to get a top lap there cars in front of you how isn’t racing and then that lap is destroyed. Is that realists? No the car in front of you should give you room, if they isn’t racing.

Motorsport Manager is a game that gives you the command of a racing team and lets you manage every aspect from it, from the design of new parts to the improvements of your HQ. And of course, it gives you the helm at the time of calling the proper strategies as the race unfolds.

Without being overly complex (probably this could do with a little bit more hardcore version for motorsport fanatics), it has a lot of aspects to it that you need to properly manage to meet success.  Even while it could be a tad more in-depth, it's a great racing manager. very fun, quite addictive, and one of those games where you'll go ""ok, one more race and that'll be it for now"", yet find yourself still playing hours later.


On the not-so-positive side, the AI needs a bit of work here and there. AI drivers need some tweaks because it's rare the race you finish without witnessing 3-4 of them crawling to the finish line without fuel, there are some issues with lapped drivers (the infamous blue flag problem XD), and specially it's a bit annoying how the AI is sometimes seemingly unable to deal with slower traffic, which makes things as qualifications a bit of an infuriating thing at times (when your driver on a flying lap just slows down behind another who's just driving around slowly making his way back into the pits). And in general if you know what you're doing, it can be even easy at times (probably a better balance between driver quality vs car quality wouldn't hurt at all).

The game is obviously not perfect, but the problems it has are relatively minor and I'm sure will be solved or improved by future patches. In the meantime what's left is an awesome game that, if you like racing, you'll enjoy a lot.

I can't stop playing this game, it has its flaws but it's got everything a casual fan and a motor racing fan would need. 

I'm currently doing the predator challenge and it's so rewarding to be moving up the ladder and within three seasons I was promoted into tier 2.

There are flaws though: 

AI sometimes will make stupid decisions on pit stops, I've won races because they changed to the wrong tire when they should've gone for wets and they put on inters, means they pit again 2 laps later and so the win is in the bag for me.

Slow moving cars during practise and qualifying also take the gloss off this game as sometimes it's impossible to do a fast lap because you are blocked, this also happens during the race with backmarkers but I haven't thrown the mouse through the monitor just yet.

I'm sure these issues will be cleared up in future patches and I can see me easily clocking 250 hours on this game in the future (maybe more)

I have wanted a Formula One flavoured management game for a long, long time. Does this game deliver for racing fans like me?

Yes, it does, but not completely.

The actual race element of the game is excellent, with the very real ability to implement strategies to make the most of your cars & drivers.The weather changes, parts fail, the safety car is deployed, drivers get penalties, drivers flat-spot their tyres, drivers take out their teammates...all good stuff.

The graphics and sound are basic, this being an upgraded mobile port I wasn't expecting it to look or sound like Codemasters' F12016 in action, but they are perfectly acceptable and do not detract from the experience. You won't be needing much hardware muscle to enjoy the race.

The only bit that feels missing is the actual man-management aspect. The drivers, your staff and the media repeat the same handful of lines over and over every single race. The mock Twitter feed is particularly painful, being literal repetition every single time it appears on your screen. And when I say the text is limited, I mean it is VERY limited.

The interactions with drivers and staff are non-existent. You do NOT manage them at all. Not one bit. At no point do you get a sense that you are dealing with a person with thoughts and opinions, it is just the same few YES/NO interactions over and over, with no nuance or depth. The way Football Manager manages to instill personality into the AI is infinitely superior, but maybe future releases will address this.

It needs a few more dollops of serious in the recipe for the next one. Not enough to make it impenetrable and offputting, but just more meat on the bones of the interactions with supposed people. Take a bit of the comedy out of the text, put a few more bits of tension in.

As a game about managing two cars through a race it's good, the pit-wall experience is there and very satisfying when you feel your strategies are controlling the race. It's also enough to make you swear at the cat when some Maldonado shunts the car you've just bolted all the expensive new parts onto at the first corner! Winning feels great, too.

Buy it to try and win races with fuel and tyre strategies, and you'll be very happy with your purchase.

But the man-management side is completely missing, in my opinion, and I wouldn't buy it for that.",1480430171,1480430171,True,7,0,0.610463201999664307,0,True,False,False

The leagues are sufficiently different, and the rule changes sufficiently varying between seasons, that you cannot do the entire thing on autopilot like many previous games in the genre.

Most of the complexity/dynamism is hidden in deceptively simple mechanics. Fuel/engine toggle interplay isn't obvious; there is sufficient variation between drivers/mechanics/designers to make decisions a decent quandary (if you're going for highest stars, you're missing a lot of the game), and even when you're performing well you seldom hit a point you can say ""I've tapped out my options this season"".

For comparison, I've played 3 seasons as the 3rd worst team in the game and have just been promoted to the 2nd league, where I'm currently sitting last due to points only going to the top six teams. Although, tbh, that rule is about to get changed, and I've saved up some voting power to make it happen. When I do so, however, I'm wondering if I need to improve my 2nd driver's car, or replace the driver, because it will really help the team if both drivers are effective then rather than always pushing my 1st up the field. Of course changing the driver will reduce my loyalty rating, and I've improved their skills, and their mechanic relationships are really solid, so probably not. Also, I still have that horrific deficit going on. Fortunately everyone gets paid equally in this league, so I don't have to do anything drastic; I'll be brought up to parity(-ish) at the end of the season, and can compete properly. Esp. if I focus on qualifying, so I can maximise my sponsor payments, at the cost of potentially upsetting the chairman and getting nearly fired again...

This sort of train of thought is typical of the game. It's not as deep as, say, Football Manager, but then that's not surprising given it's a first release in a very underloved sub-genre. For those who, like me, still pop back to play the 1999 game GPW, it's basically a solid replacement. It's not a sim, but it's an enjoyable, fun management game, with plenty of 'oh just one more race...' to it.

To address some of the criticisms from other players:

1. If you don't think you get enough setup information, this is partly to do with the practices being very short in your league, but even then if you can't reliably get 90%+ then you're missing something. If it was trivial to figure out, one'd argue it was too shallow...

2. What happens on screen is a representation of what happens in the underlying mechanics. What you see on screen (cars randomly slowing down, weird overtakes, etc) isn't really happening, what happens is dictated by dice roll. This is how all F1 management games work.

3. Cars do not reset to factory stats at the end of the season. They retain their core statistics. But then, so do other teams' parts. Designing parts and chassis' are different things.

4. If your camera and menu are broken, it's probably a driver issue. That's not the actual game UI.

5. Clicking skips the start screen after a few seconds of loading. Srsly. Not that hard.

6. If you're both arguing the game is too simple, and that you never get anywhere and can't get a break and it's too hard, maybe it's more complex than you're imagining it.",1480384178,1480384178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is ideal for me as I enjoy motorsport, management, business simulations and strategy. Having waited over a decade for a worthy successor to the wonderful Grand Prix Manager series, this game finally brings the motorsport management simulation genre up to date!  I can see myself putting in 100’s of hours into this game and it’s very refreshing to see a developer price the game FAIRLY without needing to do large discounts or rip off buyers.  I would value the game at around £34.99 but the full price is £24.99, so there is good value to be had here for buyers.

The key features of the game are working as the manager of a single seater racing series team you need to keep the chairman of the team happy.  This comes from meeting his expectations – for some teams he expects you to finish last, other times you’ll have a target to achieve in the races.  Also in the races you’ll have a marketing target – hit a position at the finish and you’ll get a bonus of cash.   You do well in races by hiring good drivers.  It’s tough in negotiations, and you have to think very carefully, as a small team, what you want to spend on drivers vs their skill.  Some drivers will refuse to negotiate. Also you will hire chief mechanics (who get better the more they work with a driver and they can deliver race bonuses), and a chief designer (who can add special parts to cars and each have their own bonuses which you need to carefully consider).  In between races you can pay the designer some hefty funds to build parts and the mechanics will work on making them better in performance and reliability for the races.  You have MANY (expensive) options to build facilities, from factory and test track to a theme park.  Each building gives you bonuses and allows you to build better parts, scout new drivers easier, better weather forecasting, etc. All the while you have to save money for next years’ car – the more you save the better options you’ll have next season. Some nice features that add to immersion are modern e-mail inbox, twitter feed after sessions, you get to vote in the management meetings to set the rules for next season.  To keep afloat you’ll need to work on building a marketing rating, the drivers you select will heavily reflect on this using their traits (e.g. if they are a ‘model’, have a ‘famous father’, like 'motor racing sims').  Better results and a better marketability allows you to attract better sponsors who pay more cash. At the end of the season you’ll get creative and design a livery for your car, a nice feature to colour it as you wish.
  
The races themselves are immersive, and you can play short races or long races lasting over 40 laps in real time (so the race could take 45 minutes or over 1 hour to play if you go for the long setting, but there are 3 speed settings in the race, even on top speed it can be a long race). You’ll participate in practice sessions to work on your set up (which you will have to get right), and, if the rules permit, qualifying. There are 3 series to participate in – a European Series (which currently uses reverse grids based on the current league table), an Asia Series and a World Series (equivalent to F1). The races feature crashes and safety cars, changeable weather (requiring tyre changes to wets/intermediates), pit stops for refuelling and tyres, break downs, run out of fuel, drive through penalties and after race penalties for illegal car parts.  Everything a F1/Motorsport fan would expect.  The graphics are not bad and a nice improvement on Grand Prix Manager.
 
Yes, there can be improvements made. This game has only just been released so will need some patching. In my view the changes required are minor tweaks only. My main hope for the future is the developers stick with this game and we get good steam workshop and DLC – hopefully sports car series, perhaps motorbike racing, touring cars, more tracks (maybe a national series such as a UK series)? The limits are endless to truly make this a ‘motorsport manager’.

The game also includes trading cards.  

For those worried about required specs, like I was, there is not so much need to panic.  The actual download required is around 6GB.  My laptop is a good few years old and within the bottom quartile of machines for performance, but still plays this game fine.  The initial spec requirements were very cautious.

In summary, for business/motorsport/strategy fans this is a 9/10 MUST BUY GAME! The 21st century version of Qvadriga (with a LOT more features than Qvadriga – this is everything Qvadriga should be), and the sports management version of Civilization – building a racing empire from scratch (if playing Predator Racing), with each race having a ‘just one more turn’ feel.

Very repetative
The number of option you have to play with in this game are very limited. You basically just upgrade parts, try to find the right setup for the cars with very minimal feedback from the drivers or your engineers, and micro manage the races. When it comes to the people management side of the game, there isn't any. Drivers can hate eachother or love eachother, but there is not a single thing you can do about it.

Lack of control
A manager game becomes fun when you have the feeling of full control and more options then you can keep track of. When you need to remember to do a whole big list of things and you can tweak you team in every tiny little way possible to squeeze out more funding, better morale, more skill etc.
Motorsport manager lacks most of this, in fact, it actively tries to screw you over. 4 races in a row one of my drivers was in 1st place and expanding the lead when we have 1 or 2 laps until first pitstops. Just as I cross the pitlane entry the safety car comes out and there is no way I can react. Rest of the field makes a free pit stop and my guy drops down to 14th. Ok, can happen, but not 4 races in a row.

Very few tracks
Tier 3 only has 5 or 6 different tracks

Very few budget options
You get very little tools to make money in this game, sporsorhip offers are dumb and always just want a sticker on your car for x amount of races. No team naming rights, overal sponsors, and only room for 6 sponsors in total.
Sponsor offers often are bad, but you better take them as you won't get anything else as each offer stands for 2 races and you cannot get more then 2 offers at a time.

Scouting very simplistic
You cannot search for drivers, you just have a list of all available drivers, use your scout to get more information on the driver. Scout will take a couple of weeks, then reports on the driver. Et voilla, you know all there is to know on the driver.
I wish we could actually do something with our scouts, like search for young talents, or give us updates on contract situations of potentially interesting drivers at other teams. Also the scouting process takes quite long, and you won't get any info until the end. I can image that the numbers aren't final, but can't the scout give me a clue on what the expect ahead of time?

Anyways, unless you don't mind a simple, repetative game I cannot recommend this game at all. Feels very much like one of those free to play micro transactions kinda games, except, it isn't free to play.",1480272388,1480272388,False,33,2,0.555161416530609131,10,True,False,False

If you like picking the worse teams and making them good be ready for endless amounts of frustration as you spend millions improving, only to end up back at sqaure one again the following season, while the other teams around you seem to get better and better.  Reliability sucks and takes too long to correct, by the time you have, you are probably bottom of the team standings with 4 races left after which it all starts again.

Also lots of things make no sense, other drivers seem to be unaffected by wrong tyre type during weather events. they can drive their broken cars around the track at record pace, overtaking my perfectly working one with ease. these two things alone leave very little opportunity to capitalise on your opponents mistakes/bad luck.

I saw a driver demoted after the race by the DMA 4 places, he finished second overall after the race. HOW?
2 drivers got stuck in the pit lane meaning my unexpected 9th place finish was scratched because I had to reload and rerun the race and then get 16th, I've had races crash when exiting back to the main menu at the end of the race, meaning I have to rerun that race again. There are numerous other little things other have mentioned to that need improving.

Hopefully they release a patch to tweak or fix issues. because this is a really good game, I just want it to be good over 30-40 seasons rather than 1 or 2 I can't play it much more than that before the enjoyment runs out. 

Maybe this game was taliored toward picking the best teams at the start, I'll have to try.

My friends used to laugh at me cause each year when I bought NHL for the Xbox(Only console game still played to this day...) I loved the management side. Drafting, contracts, ect. Motorsport Manager warms my heart in so many ways, providing the most enjoyed elements I could ask for in a game of it's kind. 

Being able to start from the bottom, sign young talent, and watch it grow as you build your team up from humble beginnings, there's little that satifies more. The race-weekend elements of the game are incredible too. As someone who has only limited knowledge of racing(and most of that knowledge being from NASCAR/Stock Car racing) there's a lot to learn. However, the game does a great job of making it easy to learn for the newcomer. After a few races you'll start to understand the tendencies of the tracks. 

Another element I really enjoy is their inclusion of a political system in the game. Being part of group of owners/team principles and voting on future rule changes as well as circuit changes- new locations to race. Big fan of that element, and makes the game all the more interesting.

As far as Con's go the only major issue I have right now is signing contracts. I really think they should include a side-by-side of your current staff member/driver(s) as a reference point when offering contracts. Alternatively, include a baseline 'asking price' for unemployed staff/drivers so you have so grasp of whereabouts the contract negotiations can begin. Right now it feels like a crapshoot. What you might imagine is reasonable comes back as insulting, and suddenly, the prospective new hire has lost their patience with you. Or, you over-pay out of fear of your initial offer being too low. There needs to be some sort of jumping point as a reference for the player to give an idea of where to start.

TL;DR: As it stands, this is the best sports management game I've ever played. There's only a few small nit-picky things I'd like to see different, but I would for sure recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Sports Management games, or Autosports in general.

Let me say it delivered! This game is great! Very addictive and rewarding for motorsport fans. I think it´s better that it´s not licensed because the developers were able to do all sorts of things that wouldn´t be possible in real life (like team promotions\relegations) and that are FUN because this is a GAME! Let´s be honest, nowadays F1 is booooorinnng... I think Playsport achieved the right balance between realism and fun management.
The interface is very good, the choices you make really do have logical consequences (either on business or race simulation). I´m portuguese and really happy to see us represented so well in the beginning (Tondela circuit, Boa Esperança, Rafael Rodrigues.. :)) - although a small country it actually has great drivers and tradition in motorsport.

Not as in depth or vast as I would like for a management sim but it feels complete and well polished and you're able to quickly build an understanding of each area it covers but still takes time to master them. For the price this is an absolute bargain.

This isn't a AAA title but this has been embraced. Rather than striving for everything and overreaching it feels as if realistic goals were set and the devs have perfected and polished the exact product they had intended.

This isn't just about getting the quickest cars around the track, the whole works behind the team are manageable and although I said I prefer a little more micromanagement there is still plenty of areas to keep on top of. I have only played a short amount so far but I can see this has been designed for long lasting runs. There are aspects of the team you can invest in for the long term, creating your own legacy and bringing a team from the lower league to the top whilst slowly imprinting your own methods into its way of working. This, combined with the shorter term things such as individual car upgrades and team ""dilemmas"" keep you engaged and the game fun even when not competing in a race weekend.

As well as the obvious things such as car setup, staff management, tactics and headquarter upgrades there are also some mechanics that are more original and interesting such as shaping the rules of each competition by way of votes throughout the season. Wether it's track layouts, race weekend formats, pit crew size or prize money allocation you can decide which way to vote or save your votes for things that matter more to your team to try to shape the next season to your benefit. With only 3 racing series included with the base game this ensures your racing series remain fresh even if you end up building a team up within the same one for several years and adds another fun way to add intrigue to the game.

I could go on about the various aspects of the game: Driver-Mechanic relations, Marketabilit etc but these are all explained in the games description. Over all it's a great game and for the price an absolute no brainer if you love motorsport and are in any way inclined towards management games.

Absolutely impeccable game but there's a thing that's come up that's ruined it for me, I don't know whether people are experiencing the same issue or it's just my potato of a computer (somehow runs the game well, though).

I was able to play *almost* an entire season in tier 3, with two of the best drivers in the game, one of the best teams in tier 3 and had got up to 2nd place - 6 points behind top. Come to the last race, finished 4th and 5th (£1.4m bonus!)... CRASHED! I just thought ""okay, maybe I've been on too long"", so I left it for an hour to cool down and came back, same thing happened, so I repeated the process but leaving it for 3 hours to cool. Nope. Still crashing.

So I started a new season to see if it was my save, but it crashed after the first race. So I then started a new season in tier 2 to see if it was tier 3 causing the issue, but, nope. Not that either. I don't know what's going on. :(

The patch made this game much better. I change my review to recommended, but I still say that more patches are required.

First review:
This game looks final in regards of functionality, but there are simply soooooooo many small and big bugs in it that I cannot recommend it in its current state. Just look at the discussion board and you will find several topics for the bugs.

If you really would like to enjoy this game, wait a few more weeks/months before buying it until the devs fix at least the most common issues. At the moment - after the first patch - this game is 6/10, so only buy it if you would like to support the devs (like I did).

This game makes you think ahead, what tyres to use and when, what are the other drivers doing and what type of style are they using.

I started poorly in the lowest category, so much so was given an ultimatum to come 3rd or face the sack! I'll admit I was very frustrated and worried that I would need to restart all over...then I won the race!

That was then the start of something special, from there on in, my lowest position of either driver was 5th! Simply, this was a case of learning from mistakes, you will make mistakes or miss out on doing something important which costs you hugely. I ended up winning the championship in my first season with a 1-2 finish. This, having been so close to being fired only 7 races prior! I've now moved up a league and it may prove tricky, but I am confident I can punch above my weight. So much so, I somehow managed to convince the 'Max Verstappen' equivalent (a 19yr old Dutch driver with huge stats and potential!) to move to my team! Not sure why he left his World team after one season?!? He is costly, but I think if I give him a good car on good setup, I could easily be challenging up in the higher echelons. I kept my title winning 21yr old from my first season on a cheap contract so hopefully she'll continue to give me strong performances for a cheap price!

Advice would be to concentrate on:

- Setups, once I understood the mechanics and found the best way to test, practice and refine the setup process, I was often going in with figures in the 90%'s and performance was greatly improved.
- Performance vs. Reliability - tweak and play with the mix between performance or reliability. I eventually figured out I could bang out quick reliability developments and still manage performance upgrades before the next race
- New Parts - make sure you buy new parts in every single gap between races (unless it is end of season). Stick to those with base upgrades and reliability enhancements.
- Don't be afraid to spend - All season I was around the -4million mark, it seems mad to live life in the 'red' but this guaranteed I was able to continue the development and build a strong car. Note, I actually ended the season making an overall profit, so don't be afraid to stay in the negative. Though it did mean I missed out on some dilemmas as I had no cash to spend!
- Don't think you can take your eye off the race! I'll admit it is a bit of a bore sitting watching every lap, but if you don't keep an eye on your tires/fuel all of a sudden it will be too late and your car is barely moving and you lose 20-30secs! Keep on top of your cars and pit stops and it'll be a breeze.

Overall, well recommended, a great game for a simulator enthusiast and once you get over the initial hurdles and learning curve, you'll be smashing it out!",1479993275,1479993275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:
- YOU are in charge. Fire, hire, improve, design, scout, improve hq, vote and manage the race strategy,
- Very simple and not too complicated.
- Each season can be different, depending on the voting outcome. 
- You can change the car's livery.
- Watch races in real time 3D

CONS:
- Interviews., Bad and repetitive questions which sometime do not reflect what just happened in the race. For example, if you are the worst team and manage to finish in the top 10 or slightly lower, against all expectations, the interviewer will treat it as a disappointment. 
- No control of pit stops

Cars appear out of nowhere and overtake you.

The game is far from bug free (from minor like wrong winners announced in social media, to major like driver penalties not processed or sponsor objectives that are achieved but not paid out) but the experience is awesome!

So far i'm almost done with my 2nd season, playing with the Van Dort racing team. And I must say it feels realistic! In my first season i managed to grab 1 win and 4 podium places. In the second season ,  its become a lot harder with Steinmann (Mercedes) and Scuderia (Ferrari) dominating the field. Still managed to grab a 2nd spot and I will be able to achieve the goal of getting 4th spot in the Constructors Championship.

This game can be so much deeper and better, but in its current state its already a good game.

My Verdict: 7/10 

If they manage to improve:

- social media handling
- contract negotiations
- car building (seems to bug out every start of the season where you get the same tech as the 1st)

It will become a 9/10 for sure.

If you like F1 games and Management games, BUY!

Then it lingered on my mind a while and I got it back, and have now taken the bottom ranked team to thier first podium win. I've scrimped and saved all season on upgrades so my car for season 3 can be top notch to try and escape the midfield of F3 racing. 

I had to let my young Aussie driver go and hired an even younger italian kid, he's turning out to be a superstar in the making! My old veteran driver from my first season resigned as the number 2 driver for another year until he retires.

Now the car has been upgraded and been through pre season testing I need to start scouting some new lead designers. I also have an owners vote coming up next week to allow development on the rear wing next year rather than using spec parts - as a low ranked team I can't afford to design another set of parts so i'll be voting ""No"".

Ok so Germany is next, need good brakes and good suspension - got the guys in the factory improving the performence on those parts, wow it will be ready 1 day before the race - lucky me!

New email - My young driver has been mouthing off to my engineers? What!? Argh but if I go hard on him his morale will drop before the big opening race, if I support him the engineers are going to go slower and the parts won;t be ready it time... what do i do?

1: A minute worth of unskippable splash screens when starting the game...
...that has to be re-watched every time the game crashes.


2: The game crashed at the very end of the 45 lap tutorial race and while the game options
suggests that there are auto-saves - there were no saves to load. So - no initial save is
made when starting a new game(creating character, etc) and no saves during the 1 hour
race. I'm doubting the save-function even works. Oh, hey... at least I get to watch the
unskippable splash screens again. Screw you, devs.


3: The camera flies all over the place, in a nausia-inducing manner when choosing sponsors.


4: The camera keeps rotating around the car when checking its stats, which is nausia inducing.
(Just let me stop the camera, so I can focus on the actual menues, please!)


5: Most menus are transparant with moving stuff in the background, making it extremely taxing
to read the menues. (Please allow for opaque menues, or a way of STOPPING all these annoying movements behind the text & numbers)


6: Placing ""Next turn"" at the exact same place as the ""close window"" for the massive stack of ""debriefing"" screens can be nothing but a willful intent of cruelty.


7: Said ""debriefing screens"" can not be closed (as is standard on PC)  with the ESC-key.

Pros:
- Graphically pretty
- Good UI
- Not too shallow, not too deep
- Logical decisions usually work
- Rewards good management
- A good example of what its like to run a team from all angles as well as be a race engineer/strategist

Cons:
- AI is the weakpoint at the moment. Its not terrible, but its not great. Right now the game just rewards staying away from the AI drivers more than actually racing, and this isn't a good thing in my opinion. They need to tweak how the players cars race the AI cars, though I think it is reasonbly possible for them to make it a good bit better with a patch or two.
- The game is unclear. Im not sure if this is because im not a football manager player or what, but there are concepts in the game that just aren't explained clearly, and its hard to determine what does what. Some of this is ok, as it means trial and error will let you improve over time, but a manual or more tooltips with more detail really could help.
- Sometimes you feel helpless in a race to change the outcome (this isn't totally unrealistic) but the reasons for it usually revolve around poor AI, and that can be frustrating.

Bottomline, its good, but not great yet. I think it can be. Unfortunately the racing is the most frustrating part of the game most of the time because of the AI and your just yelling at your drivers as they do stupid thing after stupid thing.

If you like Football Manager style games and love F1 then you will certainly enjoy this.  It is challenging but I have been playing as two teams sat at the bottom (I like the underdog journey) but I'm enjoying seeing my drivers, team and HQ develop.

You manage:
Drivers (scout, hire, fire, negotiate contracts)
Staff (race engineers and designers)
HQ (wind tunnels, factory etc)
Sponsorships
Car upgrades (performance and reliability are the main stats)

You start with Practice and fine tune the car setup based on feedback from the driver.  Then you go into qualifying, again giving another opportunity to setup the car.  Then it is race time where you manage the tyres (ultra softs right through to wet), engine modes, fuel consumption, pit stops, even overtaking to an extent.  The race reminds me a little like the B-Spec races you get in Gran Turismo.

Cons:
- No official rights mean it has a Pro Evo feel to it rather than FIFA.
- There are some annoying little things they have missed like knowing who you are speaking to when negotiating a contract - there are no labels to say it is an Engineer or Designer or Driver you are talking to while in their screen (it's easy to lose track when you are scouting a lot).  I've noticed other little annoyances like that throughout which I hope they solve.
- There is also little in the way of tutorial information about what to do.  In the end of season/pre-season gap I frantically started spending a lot of money upgrading parts on my car only to find it was a waste of money.  There was no warning or 'advisor' popping up to say ""We don't need to updgrade our car until the season starts as there will be spec changes"" or anything like that.
- The major issue is that there is a cloud sync problem - I sunk 20+ hours into the game while commuting with my MacBook Pro, then started another season on my gaming PC at home.  The PC game (only 1 hour into it) must have synced in the cloud and overwrote my MacBook game meaning I lost 20+ hours and my first game is gone forever!

It is easy to get into, the UI is intuitive and simplifies the changes you do to the car setup, and there is plenty of things to upgrade at the HQ. There are quite a few bugs (such as a progression bug that limits how much of your car's stats gets passed on to the next season), but it is still fun as it is. The in-race simulation is a bit weird, with cars sometimes pulling off impossible turns and grinding pretty hard with another car, so if you're looking for a realistic in-race simulation, you won't find it here (however, a lot of the details are there, such as safety cars, tyre options, pit stop management and many others). All in all, if you like cars and racing or you would like to get into them, this game is fun and easy to learn (there is also a tutorial to teach you how the basics work). There just needs to be a command to tell drivers to shut up about intermediates.


Pros:
[list]
[*] Easy to learn
[*] Simple and intuitive UI, shows car setup changes in an easy to understand format.
[*] Able to control strategies in a race and determine pit stop timings.
[*] Manage many aspects of a team.
[*] 3 league tiers, each with their own rules and the ability to vote for next season rule changes.
[*] Weather system makes for interesting tyre change and pit strategies.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Pretty simple interview system. Repeated questions with the same answers to choose from.
[*] Race simulation is a little bit too simplistic than I had thought. Cars make some crazy snap turns that would certainly rip apart half the car.
[*] Unable to create your own team/drivers/etc.
[*] Cannot separate sector strategy without micro-managing during the race.
[/list]

Notes:
[list]
[*] The 'Expected Result' at the post-race screen is confusing. I had a driver in the 8th standing, finished 7th in the race with the team in 7th standing, but the 'Expected Result' showed my position as 5th. There have been a couple more times where this has happened.
[*] Drivers love to complain about the tiniest bit of rain and switching to inters.
[*] It would be cool to be able to zoom closer during races.

As a first go at this genre on this platform the guys have done a cracking job, the AI is good and getting your car set up and strategy right make the race weekends very interesting. 

I have started with one of the challenge modes (3rd attempt) and now that I am starting to understand he mechanics of the game I can see alot of time being put in to plaging this game.

Politics plays an interseting part too as this can shape the way in which the following season unfolds, i also like the added touch of other team principals approaching you and offering a back hander for your vote! being in a smaller team I sell out every time!

The overtaking could be improved though, in paticular, if you attempt to overtake up the inside, you'll more than likely fail as the driver won't break late. The outside line is usually more successful. This happens a lot around the Tondela circuit so I urge you to get rid of it if the oppurtunity arises. I also suffered a glitch in the Brazillian GP. I also think the team managers get too long e.g Kitano(McLaren) boss got to keep his job despite the team failing to score a single point. There could also be a bit more crashing and reliability failures as most races finish with all 20 runners left. Im sure there will be more catagories like Touring Cars in the next version.

There are a few rookies from junior catagories and the new drivers or driver swaps are usually based on performance and is very realistic. The driver problems are also good such as speeding can actually improve your marketability. The attention to detail on the tracks is very good along with aerodynamics and staff are also realistic. The driver-Mechanic relationship is very good and so to are the sponsors, HQ. The game does desperately need an EDITOR though.",1479656217,1479656217,True,1,0,0.50304257869720459,0,True,False,False

It's not too complex where you need a degree in engineering to play, but not so simple that it becomes repetitive (though obviously you're essentially doing the same thing over and over, because that's what motorsport is).

The races are often full of drama, without being so unpredictable that it feels like you're playing a random number generator. Your decisions definitely matter, the wrong strategy or bad decision making can cost your driver a few places, or even the race.

The graphics, for the price, are good. Sometimes the cars can be a little bit flaky out on the track (suddenly accelerating because the game has determined an overtake should happen, for instance) but overall it looks and plays out pretty well. Although standard speed seems a tad slow, that might just be because I play on 3x speed most of the time. :p

It has fictional approximations of real life tracks, all fully featured with their various different layout options.

There are several nifty feaures, like driver-mechanic chemistry giving bonuses (some awesome, some situational, some a bit meh, depending on the engineer) so it's not always a case of finding the driver and mechanic with the most star ratings that you can afford and hiring them. An experienced duo can be much better than two talented individuals who've never met. They also keep their chemistry, so if you hire a top driver away from a rival you might also want to think about hiring his/her race mechanic to keep the bonuses. Likewise, a 'better' mechanic might not have such useful bonuses as another, technically 'worse' mechanic does, so that needs to be considered to.

The game is split into three 'tiers', representing GP3, GP2 and Formula One roughly, obviously without any licenses. They have differing rule sets (which can change throughout the game depending on votes that happen during the season). At game start for instance GP3 has spec rear and front wings (meaning you can't develop them, everyone uses the same), with no qualifying (grid position is determined by reverse championship order, with the guy last in the championship standings on pole position). I'm not sure how authentic this is but it's great. Likewise, GP2 has spec engines, and qualifying, etc, etc. Winning a championship will get your team invited to the series above, which is neat (you don't have to accept).

Overall, I've had a lot of fun with this so far.

great management game for motorsport fans
it forces man think about strategy


NEGATIVE

weird behaviour by ""blue flag""...it happened many times that I've been flagged due faster car behind me - my driver slowed down and was overtaken by my competition and dropped 2 places. that's great SCREW UP

my driver has great consistency, qualifies great but drops five places during start...really weird.

further more on consistency...my driver pushes hard and then suddenly loses 2 places without any logical reason :-D

waiting for slow cars to finish...broken without fuel and one waits minutes until those cars finish...WHY?

It's a fabulous game to play, largely because of the amount of things you can do within your team. Obviously the main attraction for me is the car setup section (loved doing this on Nascar EU on xbox 360!) During practise it helps a lot especially when you make at least 2 runs for each driver, because then you have an opportunity to get your drivers through each race with as much help as possible, along with the stratergy of the pitstops. The improving parts and reliability section is very good, seeing as this not only allows you to improve your car parts, it also allows to get their reliability during races up too. Not only that you have the opportunity to build new parts for your car (ready for next season) which is cool too, especially when you have to improve their reliability in order to possibly use them in future races.

The growing of your headquarters is a good touch because it also gives you something to aim for, depending how long & how many Championships you wish to stay with one team. 

To be honest there isn't much wrong with it as far as I am concerned, yes there is the licensing perspective, and I do wish there were a way around it such as being able to edit driver/team names, but I can live without those.

Smooth 60+ fps, although turning off ambient occlusion & tilt shift makes the graphics much less blurry to my eyes. 
As for the game itself, it's the new standard in racing management games IMO. The depth is amazing allowing for different strategies depending on car & driver lvl. The driver interaction via radio comms in the race itself is immersive & a bit humorous at times, as they comment on their performance & car condition. Team management outside the race is top notch as well, with choices that have to be made concerning car & facility upgrades, as well as choosing sponsors.
With unlimited seasons, driver & staff scouting, retirements, drivers team hopping, and the possibility of being fired for not achieving set goals, the playability & replayability is through the roof.

The thing that I'm most exited about is the replay value of this game. With the teams evolving and the rules changing there is always something new and interesting to think about. Both the on and off track elements of the game are really interesting.

Also, the game can be really challenging but completely fair and extremely rewarding at the same time. The races are genuinely exiting, more so than watching real F1. The same goes for how a championship progresses over a season.

It starts off great with a solid introduction to the game.  It has you calling tactics on your drivers for the first race and introduces you to all the controls dealing with race days.  After the first race it introduces you to the plethora of in game features to deal with both off track and on the track concerns.  You can easily see that there is a lot of well thought out detail to the game and plenty that will have a drastic impact on race performance.  Herin lies the problem however

You start doing like anyone would do, sink a tonne of money into parts for your car to bring its performance up.  Heck you can even see if you are on par with the car average and what areas your car is weak in.  By the end of the season, you've done a pretty bang up job of creating an on par or even better than average car.   Even with that tutorial race (which turns out to be a disaster for your standings) you have managed to finish up strong in the standings at the end of the year.

Now it's time to design next years car.  If you are anything like me, you saved a lot of money for this and have a sizeable chunk of change to sink into it, and you do.  You assume that this will bring your car stat up and you will be a strong competitor next year.  Well, you assumed wrong!  All this does is improve the chasis stat's, which can help tire wear, fuel burn etc.  None of these do anything to boost your cars actual rating.  In fact, by re-designing your car, all that money you spent on new parts last year?  Gone.  It resets all your parts back down to factory stats and that car you just sunk 32 million into is now at the bottom of the car averages.

You have a big hill to climb, so you get at it, sinking huge money into parts this season.  You are climbing, but you are still very far behind, and you finish the season with decent middle of the pack standings and your car is still far below average.  Then you realize that this is a never ending cycle of pain.  This never stops, each season you MUST re-design your car at the end of the year and it resets everything back to garbage.  Your competition?  Nope, their cars retain their stats.  In fact each season THEY GO UP while you start with scraps and garbage duct taped together hap hazardly which rears its ugly head for the first few races.  Parts explode mid race like crazy, your driver who was doing good is forced to make incredibly long pit stops and drops to 20th position while you scramble to improve part reliability.  Then you get to watch the screen helplessly as your drivers are overtaken over and over and over, not because they lack skill, but because your car just plain sucks and you CANNOT get it better fast enough.

I just can't handle this rinse and repeat process.  Each season becomes the exact same as the first, a struggle to get the car a somewhat crappy form of decent that's worse than everyone elses cars.  Nothing changes, a routine forms and the game get's boring in a hurry.  After 4 seasons I'm done, and the third season was a massive struggle.  Maybe the game is more fun on a high performance team where your expectation is to come in 1st in the standings, but at least your car dosn't suck.

When you guys came out with the app.. I was already like wow.. Okay someone s pulling the right ideas.. 

This game is a world of its own. Dont compare to F1 and its reality but think of how they manage to create a whole new racing world.. With its own rules, team and tracks.. Brilliant.. It's like a whole new racing league , which im so impress with. 

Diff drivers have diff traits which makes the game so interesting season to season.. Thank God for liveries ( hopefully create a team will be on the board soon) so the car can look diff every season. 

First season with ZRT autosports and already won 2 races and 3rd in drivers championship. Bloddy awesome.

Excellent game IMO.. Polished graphics and very detailed in the options you have to tweak with your team, both at race time and between races.  Practice, Qualifying and Race time is great and varied which keeps the game play fresh.

at £25 it's Great Value for money too.  The lack of F1 licence and real teams/drivers does not detract from this game at all I believe.

I would give it 8/10 - Two reasons it doesn't get 10/10

1) There is (currently - I live in hope) no option for multiplayer - would be fantastic to have more than 1 player controlled team in the race (LAN only would be fine !!)

It's in-depth and fun, like a lighter version of Football Manager for Formula cars. However, there's one flaw. The AI. The player-managed AI are so scared in my experience. If a car comes just a bit too close from the side or the front, the driver will slow right down to ""avoid"" the car in front and in turn let 5 or 6 cars past behind. They'll sometimes also give up places even though they're on the inside line and in front. It's irritating and I hope it gets patched soon.

EDIT: I'm going to have to change my review to negative. There's no way I can drop from 4th to 20th in one of the best cars on the grid consistently.

[b]Pros[/b]

1) Driver Skill System - Realistic & rewarding to see drivers growing as you are growing when you pick up the game. Albeit the improvements are a little slow.
2) Strategies - The diversity on race strategies makes the race always the most interesting thing in the game. Should I 2 stop and pound my tyres or nurse them and 1 stop and save 20 seconds of pitlane time?
3)Expectations - At no point did I really feel like the expectations are too unrealistic, at least for a prolong period of time. In other games the expectations are far too unrealistic(Looking at you F1 2016) but this seems fair enough.
4) Voting on rules system - Phenomenal feature. Should I look to bring in Belgium due to it suiting my powerunit or keep Monaco because I have state of the art brakes? Do I want the gripiest tyres even if they cost a lot of cash to see my drivers going flat out? You can try to influence the rules in your favour!
5) Overtakes - Some of the overtakes are Verstappen like. And the battles sometimes are amazing to watch even at 3x speed! I can't emphasis enough how awesome some of the wheel to wheel battles my drivers have had and I'm in my 4th season.
6) Interface - Quite nice, slick and not too clunky
7) Car Development - Rewarding and it's not too pick on quickly and get it over with. You need to think how you want to develop your car. For eg. my number 1 driver excels in qualifying. So to further improve his chances I developed a gearbox with a ""qualfying mode"" (+40 Accel in Quali trait) to help him get as far up the grid as possible.
8) Finances tab - Can plan budget well and make educated decisions for the future
9) Some F1 Cameos being females - heheuheuheuheh looking at you Nina Holz.
10) Pre Season - Very good. Enjoyable, purchasing the ""right"" suppliers is key to how the season will unfold. Shall I go with a Steinmann with better improvability or a more powerful Rossini engine?

[b]Cons[/b]

1) Interviews - These are so terrible that after 3 you see the same stuff. Not to mention they always think your driver performed below par when they had a cracker. Please work on this as this is the most annoying thing in the game.
2) Sponsor system - It's not bad but it'll never come close to the system Grand Prix World had which made you spent time chasing sponsors. Here you get offers and you just pick the best financially.
3) China track - Buggy. Lead driver sometimes gets a lap on everyone else
4) Bernie - He's a complete and utter &*$% who keeps voting against what I want.
5) Scouting system - This is also awful. Literally start up the game and scout anyone. Before you scout you should be looking to target someone but since you haven't a clue on anyone's stats or potential you are blind to everything. Needs a big overhaul.
6) Facilities - Doesn't feel engaging and I have barely looked at it. Literally feels like you get money and then buy them and that's it. Doesn't feel like you need to target one in particular. Also scouting centre is pointless.

All in all, very impressive first crack at a full management sim. I'm happy with my investment and if you have a longing to play a decent F1 like management sim since Grand Prix World way back in 1999 then look no further.

Most of the aspects of the racing team day-by-day routine is neatly covered, from parts designing and fine-tuning your racing cars to financing and staff relationships. There are place to improve upon yourself always and there are a lot of place of making mistake that could heavily affect the course of your season or more.

The only downsides for me are the silly cartoonish representation of people's faces in this game (could be my taste only though), unrealisic names and nations of staff (so much Asian drivers outside Japan? c'mon!) without ways of editing, a sometimes chunky on-track behavior of racing cars  (loosing several places to gain twice as more on the next lap?) and oversimplified finances. By the later I mean inability to talk to sponsors - you either accept their proposal or decline it in hopes that someone comes up with the better one soon - and usual ingame 'server updates' where you must regularly throw away half a mil...

Most of such negative moments could easily be fixed with patches / updates, if the Devs & Publishers want to support their game. Motorsport Manager will greatly benefit from increasing the number of ingame championships, races, sponsors, abilities to create your own racing teams and so on - a huge potential for the updates and expansions overall.

Positives:
The game is addicting, and absoultely very fun. I absolutely enjoy it very much. There isn't much to say other than ""it's just a really fun game, with very interesting dynamics"".

Cons:
The bugs. There are several bugs, that really...bug me. 

1. If the 1st place car laps any other cars, when he finishes the race, everyone else does too when they cross the checkered line. Anybody he laps doesn't do their ""extra lap"" after he finishes. They finish right after. For instance, if the 1st place car laps the 20th place car, but not the 19th place car, when the 1st place crosses the finish line, the 20th should have to cross the finish line then do 1 more lap, right? No, the 20th place car crosses the finish line and comes in 20th place, while the 19th place car has to keep on going for the rest of his lap, which ends up meaning the 20th place car finishes the race before the 19th place, but finishes behind #19 in the standings. Basically once the 1st place car crosses the line, the race is over for everyone else when they cross the line as well, and they finish in whatever place they currently were. This takes away from those ""last lap"" battles. It actually happened to me, where the 1st place car lapped me and I was in 6th place, ready to overtake 5th place. He crossed the finish line and we still had 1.5 laps to go...and I easily would have gotten 5th or even 4th place if I had all 1.5 laps to use. But my race ended after 0.5 laps, and I got stuck with 6th place. Very annoying.

More bugs. The financials/bonuses seem to be very wonky. I toggled between a 1mil bonus, and a 1.8 mil bonus, and it would show I'd make MORE money with the 1mil bonus selected...what?!?!

My last con, is the seasons. Every season, you start with a brand new car (you buy this car with money saved from the previous year/season).  And every season, you start right back at square 1 with a new car and no upgrades, with the ability to only build the shittiest upgrades on your parts, and everything is fucking broken, and low durability, and it really takes the fun out of the first few races of the season. All the hard work I put in last season? Gone. Upgrades are tiered. Once you build tier 1 upgrade, then you can build tier 2. Then you can build tier 3. And by the end of the season, you have a monster car with tier 2-4 upgrades, and all your hard work, and then next season...you have to build tier 1 upgrades again. Very frustrating to me I think. It's basically starting a ""new game"" every season in terms of your car. Your drivers and staff all retain their improvements though, so that's alright.

I know I gripped a LOT more than I praised the game, which is weird because I gave it 8/10...but those are literally the only things wrong with the game I truly believe. other than those couple of issues, this game is phenomenal. And those couple of issues (bugs + new car every seasons wtf;oaisjhdf;oaisdjf;aosdfj), are the reason I didn't rate it a 9 or 9.5/10.

As a hardcore motorsport fan, it's just in one word... Dissapointing,
for a general gamer I can see it being good. I go into extensive detail below...

There is no depth to the racing, you don't feel in control of what is happening at all, you have to run around on the highest fuel  and the 2 highest tyres or you get passed easily. For the first 5 or so laps of a race it's just annoying, you get overtaken so easily you may aswell not bother. No control of pitstops, fuel lasts for no time at all comapred to tires. You can quite easily run the softest tires all race and not worry about their wear at all. Part of managing a race team is race strategy, that in-game you have decide the lap you want to pit. There's no pre-race strategy making. 

As for the management part, it's good. But after doing a few races and only getting a couple top tens it seems pointless to race as a lower team and work up. It's annoying how simple upgrades are, basic parts such as engine, gearbox, front & rear wing. There's just no depth for someone who watches racing, even a little. They've gone to far to the point of getting everyone involved, and not making a game enjoyable for people who find the sport enjoyable and interesting.

The lack of liscensing also effects your enjoyment of it if you watch the sport, some of the tracks have layouts vaguely like their real counter parts, there's just been no effort at all to get any licsening. 

What's also disapointing is that it's just F1, and two run up series like GP2 and GP3. Be nice to have F1, Sportscars, US Series like Indy Car and manage a range of teams across a couple series like Carlin do in the lower formulas.

Overall for the general public who like management games it's probably quite good, but for someone who loves all motorsport it seems to be extremely disapointing.",1479160924,1479160977,False,1,0,0.41060224175453186,1,True,False,False

If you enjoyed any of the Grand Prix Manager games in the 90's, you will love this game. The race weekend format is good, and a huge leap forward from the excellent mobile app. You have a short practise session (but there is plenty of time to do what you need to do) to set up the car, followed by qualifying and the race. Qualifying and the Race are similar to the mobile app, but just in much more detail. 

The elements of the game not directly related to the race are also very good. You can hire staff/drivers, improve facilities, and develop new components, so theres a bit of a development race going on. There is also a simple sponsorship section and you have the option to scout up and coming driver prospects. Having said all that, i do have a few minor criticisms.   

1- Lapped Cars 
This is my only big complaint about the game at its the way backmarkers are in the game. Its not unusual for you to lose 15 seconds or more behind a single backmarker. The blue flag symbol shown to them means nothing, the backmarkers go by them then still throw a kamakazie move down the side of you to unlap/prevent themselves for being lapped. It's like the game can't tell the difference between a backmarker getting lapped and a fight for position. They really fight you for a number of laps, even if you're 5-6s a lap quicker. Having said that it does go both ways, and they do hold up your competitors also, but the level of hinderance isnt constistant. In 1 particular race though, i came out the pits in the lead by 12 seconds, and by the time i lapped the first backmarker 3 laps latter i was in 4th and 25 seconds off the new leader. Effectively my race, even for a podium, was over. That level of influence is clearly crazy and does ruin some races. I'm all for backmarkers being realistic and costing time and sometimes positions now and again, but they actually determine who wins a lot of the races.

2 - Technical Staff 
The technical staff area of the game is pretty weak. You only specifically employ the technical director and the two race engineers. Other than that the numbers of technical staff is dictated by you facilities and you have no imput as to the quality of the staff. For example, i would like it if you could employ an areo specialist or a cheif mechanic who had a great reputation for improving pit stops etc. This area of the game just seems a bit too simplified. 

3 - Set-up 
The way the cars set-up is decided is done individually. You cant put both drivers on different set up in practice and then pick the best and put that set-up on to both. Isn't a big deal, but it is slightly irritating.

4 - Weather Forecast
This area also feels a bit weak. From what i can see you get two types of rain; Light and Heavy. I would prefer if the forecast gave you an estimated intensity from 1-10 and an estimate on how long the rain will last for. That being said, you can improve your teams weather centre to get 'improved' forecasts. I have not got that far yet, so im still not sure what that entails.

5 - Contracts
When you employ someone, it seems they have to be employed there and then. This may cause you to pay a large fee to break the employees contract. It would be better if you could have the option to sign a pre-contract agreement so you could plan for the following year.

6 - Young Driver Programs
It would be cool if you could sign up one or two prospects and attempt to negotiate place for them in other teams or place them in junior formulae.

7 - Licenicing 
This one is really knitpicking. The game isnt licenced so all the drivers, staff and team names have been made up. Nothing wrong with that, but it would be fantastic to have all the teams and drivers and proper support series like GP2, GP3 and F3 (maybe even karting) for you to progress through and place your young drivers once you get to the top. 

I have only played the game for 13 hours so some of these criticisms might be unfair if im just missing something, but even if they are correct criticisms then i would still highly recommend the game. There are a huge amount more positives than negatives.",1479147780,1479147819,True,3,0,0.465517252683639526,0,True,False,False

But I have to say, the game keeps me motivated so far. I think the management part is very in-depth and the races demand strategic thinking to be successful. 

And even features like promotion / relagation of teams between leagues, which didn't seem to make sense to me at first, work for me. It's kind of Football Manager with Racing Teams, and a simulation model of a full in-depth racing manager.

There are several glitches in the races, like drivers sometimes make braking mistakes every lap causing the tires to not last longer than 2-3 laps, so every car will pit like 10-12 times a race. But those are rare, and the game has only just been released and those errors will hopefully be patched soon. 90% of all races work without any relevant glitches and I didn't notice any bugs in the management part so far at all.

I find the UI and flow of the experience took a bit to get used to.. wasn't too intuitive. Get better once you understand where things are at. Like, the continue button which continues through your calendar, then the back/forward navigation buttons? Some interesting design choices.

My experience thus far:
Only 8 hours in so far. 3 races into the season and a couple of practice grand prixs. I recommend to do the exhibition races until you're comfortable enough for the season otherwise you'll throw the first couple races away. The drivers AI can be a little frustrating at times since they don't really drive like real racing drivers. The most frustrating thing I've run into in this game is lapped traffic. I lost a race because the lapped traffic decided it was going to race against me. Destroyed my soft tires and allowed 2nd place to catch up and pass me right at the line.

The game is brilliant and has many little gems:

Designing new parts and fitting them to your favorite driver to upsetting your number 2 driver in the process.

Improving parts and giving one of your drivers a weaker part only for the weaker part to start to fall to pieces during the end phases of a race forcing you to make a longer pitstop while you fix it.

Trying to get in as many laps during practice and tweaking the cars as best as possible for maximum track potential - this part is great.

Trying to get the perfect brake heat and tyre heat in your drivers Out Lap in Qualifying by trying to maintain a medium on your driver orders to speed up on the straights or bends.

Trying to maintain tyre heat by ordering your driver to drive harder due to tyres cooling down, only for your misjudging to force your driver to pit in earlier than you'd planned.  

Having your driver swear at you, because you pit them in a panic that your tyres won't last the next 4 laps, dropping him from a top 10 finish.


I have no negatives about this game, other than maybe the spelling and some repetitive news pieces/emails.


Some atmospheric improvement ideas for a future patch maybe:  
- Actual voice actors for the driver communications during a race.
- Event cameras - Grand Prix Manager (2?) had side track cams.  It's great to see a cars engine blow, or skid marks on a bend from driver lock-ups - adding a close-up of this happening would add to the atmosphere.

But these are little things that would only add the the already great immersion.

Sound: 7 (Engine noises, radio comms, atmospheric music)

This game offers so much in managing your team. The stuff you can do like researching tech, improving tech and improving the car overall throughout the seasons.

I think this has to be the single best F1 Managment game to date PERIOD.

It always has that ""I'll just have one more game"" feel to it so the hours soon mount up.

I enjoy the game, and I don't regret buying it at all. But I don't feel I could readily recommend it to anyone without a carload of caveats.

In short, you will like this game if 1) you're a casual Football Manager player that doesn't go for 20-season-long dynasties, and 2) you like motor sports a bit, but not enough to be annoyed at how comparatively shallow this is.

There's just not as much to dig into here as I'd want. Everything seems a little too surface-level, there's so very little nuance for the most part. As a car guy I really want to dig into it. What's the compression look like, how's the airflow to the engine, what's the fuel mixture here. Maybe work on specific engine components, not necessarily down to a micro level, but at least something to give it variance. Instead you've got GOOD engine and AVERAGE engine, and some have bonuses to things like top speed. Ok... can I get something more please? 

The overall team management is the same. you can hire three drivers, two mechanics, and a designer. All of that works vaguely like Football Manager, but there's far less nuance to building a team. Or to hiring sponsors, or to building out your facility beyond ""do you have enough money"". Managing the whole affair really isn't difficult once you've got a few basic HQ improvements in hand. 

And it struck me shortly ago that if they tuned down the graphics and tweaked the UX, this would very easily be an iPhone game. Actually, is it? Might already be. I should check. But it carries that kind of feel to it.

Playability - Its deep without being complicated, all changes you make to the car have an effect. Of course if you not a motorsport fan things like understeer or gear ratio might be a bit too much I guess.

The ability to work your way through from the the lower championships to the top tier is brilliant, giving you a sense of connection with your team - avoiding being relegated by my driver making a pass into the final points position on the last lap of the last race of the season gave a sense of joy I can only imagine real team bosses feel, they've hit the nail on the head with this.

This in mind, it still has a number of bugs that over time will need fixing, such as lapped cars racing you and screwing your chances of gaining positions, similarly finding your car blocked by one and losing handfuls of positions because your driver doesnt move around, and intermediates/wets offering same lap times as dry tyres. All of these I hope they will fix in the future.

Having played Grand Prix Manager 2 to death back in the mid-90s, I've been eager to play a modern ""F1"" manager game. The last one of note was the imaginatively titled ""F1 Manager"" back in 2000 or so and it wasn't brilliant.

Motorsport Manager, however, is. It's in-depth enough to keep F1 die-hards interested but without it getting bogged down in the details. You have to manage driver and team relationships, the mechanics and drivers bond the longer they work together and you have to get the results to keep your team owner and sponsors happy.

The presentation is fantastic, if you've ever played Football Manager then the UI shouldn't take getting too much used to. The race coverage looks beautiful; the tracks are sublimely detailed with an abundance of cranes, tents, crowds and other assorted things you tend to find at a real track.

The races do lack a little excitement (so far); it would be nice to speed it up beyond 3x (though I understand the limit here, any faster and your liable to miss a pit call or damage to the cars etc). The other area that is a little lacking is the car setup - it's pretty simplistic. Again though, I can understand this as it helps keep the game accessible to those with less enthusiatic knowledge.

Honestly I think this game is incredible especially for someone with 0 intrest in F1, after a couple races and maybe a career restart you finally understand how the practice, pitstops and the whole fuel and tire tread system works.
Also in some games you can play the shit team and still win because there is a difficulty setting and you can usually beat the AI. In this game honestly goodluck getting passed maybe 9th with the bottom team in tier 3 (out of 10).
Honest rating 8/10 would love if you could skip time easier instead of simming through the days and also if the tips your driver gave you were on a sort of document so you could edit the feel of the car for the driver during the practice run.

I just completed my first season and have fallen in love with the game. Throughout the season, I was able to grow in knowledge as well as improve strategies, drivers, and the car. The wonderful thing is seeing these changes in motion during practice and race-day. Acheiving my first podium was an excellent feeling and left me wanting more. The next race showed that no matter what I do, sometimes it just isn't my day. One of my drivers was plowed into, breaking the rear wing and effectively ending his race. Frustrating? Of course! But sometimes that just happens. The following race I was able to make up for it, passing the same driver that plowed into mine on the last lap for a second podium in three races.

All this just to say that the game is incredibly enjoyable. It's addicting in the sense of clicking continue just to get to the next event, the planning that goes into the race, and the reward or failure that comes with it as you learn along the way.

Motorsport Manager - while not aligning perfectly with my dream F1 management simulation, comes seriously close.

First of all, let's talk UI. Cleanly designed and intuitive without bombarding you with needless detail. Teams, drivers and staff members are linked within mails and news posts in the style of games like the football manager series, enabling you to easily keep track of who is being discussed without having to dig around clumsily.

The graphics are hardly groundbreaking but they are good enough for a game of this type, the pervasive tilt shift effect isn't for everyone but can be easily disabled in the preferences.

Choice is the name of the game here, the game offers a lot of flexibility in both how the game runs and how it plays and the extra effort taken here really shines through.

The game does an excellent job of communicating with you without shouting, you can understand quickly and easily when you have made an error, the effect of that error and why you made it - all without a writtene xplanation breaking the flow and for me, that is a sign of exceptional design.

The game itself has plenty of depth and detail without becoming needlessly dry or offputting to those who may perhaps be put off by an overabundance of complexity, which oftens masquerades as depth.

Drivers, cars and mechanics have both permenent and temporary traits and the game tracks the synergy between driver an dteam, driver and mechanic, car and tyre, driver and tyre and more - this really enriches the gameplay and is something I've always wanted in my F1 management games but as yet has not been delivered.

My only critiques would be;

- Over simplified sponsor system, which removes the challenge presented by managing oyur commercial department in games like Grand Prix World

- No team or driver editor - this is a small issue, truly. However, it would enrich the experience I feel.

- No 'key' suppliers - One of GPW's strengths was the multiple kinds of deal (customer, partner and Works) that were available from engine, tyre and fuel suppliers. Suppliers leaving and entering the sport also shook up gameplay nicely and I'd really like to see this kinda stuff added here.

All in all, I have no hesitation in recommending this game - even to people who perhaps aren't motorsport fans but simply enjoy a good management game. Gameplay is rewarding, the gam eruns buttery smooth even on low end systems and seems, at least for me, to be bug free and very nicely optimised. The design is excellent with enough depth to keep you interested for hours and hours and the icing on the cake is the fluid formula rules and multiple tiers of racing. The strategic impact of rule changes within the formula really do shake things up in interesting ways.

Buy it now, even at full price it's absolutely worth it.

I like this game! I missed the old Grand Prix World games and this is very good indeed. Even though it's not official it has a better system as teams move up and down in the tiers. i.e. you can be promoted and relegated! like in football. A much more sensible system than the closed ""professional"" American leagues. (side note: The American way is actually resembling a more communist economy than the cutthroat market economy America is supposed to represent). I wasn't talking about Football, but Motorsport Manager which so far is great. It's difficult and fun! (I chose a lower tier team to start with) but I am getting into it now. Very exciting stuff. 
Please buy it so they can make another one in a year with updates like you can create your own team from scratch, like Stewart racing etc. (however shortly lived it was).

Takes the best parts of the mobile game and expands on them. Beautiful presentation and graphics for a management game. 

I got tired of the mobile game before reaching the top series, as it became a grind and the depth just wasn't there. The PC version is an entirely different story. The part researching/upgrading system; the ""practice"" setup dynamic (which might be my favorite addition); the scrutineering; the politics and dynamic rules... it's just all there. The mobile game now seems like a rough college paper outline of what this PC release would be someday.

Granted, I am only 7 hours in and still on my first season. This game could still become a boring grind down the road but... I just don't see it. Even without the deeper in-race strategy options, the stuff I discussed in the paragraph above would have been enough for me. I will update this review after I progress further in the game, but for now, hats off the devs.

My only nitpick so far would be graphically: it's a beautiful game... I'd like to be able to zoom in a little bit more! Also, a slider for the DOF effect would be nice - it's pretty strong by default, and when I have the setting on, I can't really appreciate the nice looking game as much. I usually end up turning off DOF as a result.

Pros:

- Depth (at least initially - will update)
- Exciting races
- Much-improved engineering side of the game
- Realistic F1-style politics and atmostphere
- LOVE the radio messages from drivers... really adds to the immersion

Cons:
- Wish I had a little more freedom with graphics options/zoom level
- My reserve driver gained the random temporary trait ""addicted to video games""... I assume because he sits in the trailer every weekend?

Some gripes: the qualifying is really stupid. I have to tell the driver to speed up/slow down and the brakes and tires heat/cool at different rates so it's this supid dance with a slider. Not very in line with the performance of the car or the driver, just how perfect you can get that slider action. Really frustrating.

The drivers tell you in practice if the set up is off, and they specify what. However, when you go to the setup if you don't remember what they said, you don't know which way they want it adjusted. This would be better if it told you more/less downforce, etc. so you can realy get it dialed in.

Also, it doesn't make sense that parts don't carry over from season to season. A brake kit is a brake kit, no matter if the chassis changed. You have to start all over next season, repairing your engine twice per race which makes literally no sense.

I jumped in and found this game to be an grate gap in the market as the only real compettitor i can find on steam is trackday manager, this game is 100 times better than its only rival and that comes from the grate depth this game seems to provide, it almost like football manager from when that was good for fans of motorsport, well more specificaly Formular motor sport which isnt nesasraly a negitive but is an are where a future patch or dlc could add some replay ability. as it would nice to have a wider range of diffrent sort of racing to jump into.

but with that one only stight negitive out the way all the game has to offer is positive after positve. as i previosly mentioned this game has grate managent depth and by that I mean you make all the key decitions that a team princable would have to make in the real world. this is everything from staffs wages, pit stops to team bases expantion offering, and this offers grate emution into the world of motorsport manager as im 8 hours in and I have only just finished my first season in the europ racing series and all i want to do is play more and more of this amazing game.

Along side its depth and solid gameplay it also has some of the nices graphics i have seen from a managment sim and this real lets other games in this area down in my opinion as its all well and good having that depths, the challanging game play and strategy it needs to offer visuals that are nice to look and at and in some ways make there reward of a perfect race weekend seem more rewarding that ugly graphics with good maths. what im trying to say is this game draws you in with the visuals and offers some of the most depth i have seen in a managment game in a few years now.

You can also pull into the pit lane and if you don't immediately change your strategy, even though you're going slower, tire wear and fuel burn will still just carry on as if you're racing.

Passing in this game is just a joke. There is NO logic to how it works from what I've seen. I could have the best specs, the best drivers, and I'll still watch someone cut inside and pass me while my driver decides to make a wide turn. 

There are absolutely no penalties or reprocussions for AI when they decide to smash up your car. You basically just lost the race because someone fucked you up. If you have to fix ANYTHING on your car, you might as well just call it a day.

Pros:
+ Very addictive gameplay!!!
+ Slick presentation (UI is easy to use and well presented; graphics of races, cars and hq are really solid)
+ Huge variety of different rules that apply to different championships (in lowest tier there is no qualification and starting grid is determined by championship order - it is reversed, in upper tiers you get normal qualification - short or long; all 3 championships have different points system; various pit stop options per championship - refuelling or no refuelling, full crew or smaller crew, etc. )
+ Dynamic gameplay/replayability (all rules of championship may change and you get to vote on them; winning lower tier team can replace losing team in higher tier championship; team personnel changes - after my 1st season AI teams swapped drivers quite a lot; all personnel ages, etc.)
+ Races can be really dynamic (weather changes, crashes, safety car and so on) and it is fun to try benefit from all those changes
+ Loads of information is provided for player which gives immersion (media always comments everything, you can check progress of other championships, all teams and their personnel, etc.)

Cons:
- Racing engine could be improved a little (blue flags are often ignored by AI for example)
- It would be nice to be able to create your own team; edit stats, names, looks of other teams and drivers
- Some minor annoynaces with UI which will probably be updated soon (results table after race scrolls down automatically for example)

Overall - amazing effort!!! I haven't tried their mobile game, but everyone was concerned that it will be a port with minor additions. It's not the case with this game.

pros
+about motorsports and we all loving it.

cons
-practice sessions absurdly short
-no license !
-only 3 series gp2-3, f1
-Maybe  i'm the only one but there isn't  you can much to do with setting up car but also effects so much.It's like f1 2016 with ai feed back ,nothing more.When you think football manager games, it's a bit dull
-a pre-race strategy planing screen might be handy

- details in mangement, sponsors, pit stops etc
- weather and tire mangement has more to do with the race
- larger selection of teams and leagues
- upgradable parts which are customizable

however there are some major flaws that need addressing:

- I'm all for having parts having reliablity ratings on parts but having to fix them during a race and cost you time no..big no no in F1 if something was failing like brakes or electronics they'd retire the car only difference between leagues is you don't refule
- drives on your team seem dump despite their perks they give up places too easily and they don't tend to fight for positions even on high settings.
- costs for parts and expectations seem a little too high though thats my own opinion

there are many more pro's and cons i could go on about but for summary

this game is not 100% there yet they need to fix the flaws and blanace the game then i can give it a better review till then 7.5/10",1478892249,1478892249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Initial observations are the game has a somewhat steep learning curve. 
The tutorial,  Walked me through a step by step process of managing my two drivers through a race.  
On my computer, I have W10,  and a standard issue Dell Tower that is about a year maybe two years behind the current shelf items and DSL.   The graphics were pretty awesome.  Per the top side view of the cars cobatting ech other.  And ran perfectly

The tutorial, walks you through the meat of the game which is actually running in a race. 

You are given the teams you are given in this game. No making up your own race team.
BUT, in the career mode, you can opt to JOIN a race team. 

The first tutorial is the only one I hve witnessed. f there are others, speaking to the techinacl a buisnes side, of the game.  I have yet to see them, and my ba missing the, 

If you area a racing fan Grognard.  And Old, like me.  This is a must buy.
You too can be The Boss.   No actual being in the car, and working it to the limits here. Them days are long gone for me, as I have aged and just want to be The Boss.   And have worn out my thumbs, on my Nintendo controller, and the bunjo cords of my wheels and pedals, When I bought my first computer in 1998. 


Right now my profile is a guy who won the Worldwide Super Lottery,   And wants to be part of a Open Wheel Racing Team as a hobby. Has no area of significant expertise.  Just and all around knowledge.  Of watching racing on TV/ 


Initial investigation.  Tier 3 offers up an American Team.  Tier One appers to be Team USA nonexistant  Maybe I need to promote myself int it.  Cool beans
While I establish a Tier 3 (GP3) race team somewhere in Germany  
Under the banner of the Stars & Stripes.  Team Cold War, happeniong. 
My first job will be to hire some German Engineers.  
And learn the metric system.  Euros be damned.  
My lottery winnings were US Dollars. 

Not saying you should buy this game.  How you spend your momney is NONE of my business
So far,  glad I did.

Tinker around with your cars, beat the opposition. However, it's not all good. Some points that should be worked on, because they already start to annoy me pretty early on:

[list]
[*]The opposition runs out of fuel in the last two laps (this occurs to like 1/3 of the drivers), completely changing the results in the last two laps. 
[*]Bad player AI on takeovers; while my character has a 17/20 for takeover, which is his best stat, the AI just seems to get some sort of bonus on takeovers; during most starts my riders just instantly drop, because for every takeover they do, they are getting taken over twice themselves.
[*]Information is not available, or can not be found. For example; during the last race of the season, I had to gain 4 points on the opponents team to advance to the next league. However, during the race I forgot the number, and I couldn't pull up any kind of championship standing. More of these problems exist.

However, still a fun game, but it still needs some polishing.

 Pros -
1. Company management and aspects of sponsors, part development and personnel are decent
2. Its got pretty graphics

Cons -
1. One 20 minute practice session to get that perfect setup
2. Unrealistic weather and tyre performace in certain weather conditions. It rains almost every race weekend in my experience.
3. No breakdown of lap time or sector analysis of any part of practice or the race
4. No adjustments of the car during a race for fine tunement
5. Setups for both cars match almost completely. Although they may vary slightly
6. No tyre degridation analysis of any sessions to determine race strategy. There is little to no race strategy involved.

The list goes on and on. If you want a company management game with a small flair of unrealistic racing simulation management thrown in than this game is for you. Maybe thats the way SEGA planned all along. I for one was hoping for a true strategic type racing simulation. I can do without all the pretty race graphics and track pictures. 

Someone needs to take a game like Rfactor(2), Assetto Corsa or another racing simulator and add all the racing mangement spects to that.

Between those races, you have to take care of your mount, discover and buy new buffs for ""her"".
You must X-pand your castle and your realm, plan your strategies while you X-plore the Motorsport world and ensure that all the people that you X-ploit (and the two dumb knights kindly allowed to ride the beautiful roaring steeds that you raised yourself) are satisfied, and are always improving in their fields.
Or you can fire their peasant asses if they're not worth the money, because in this game you also have to be an accountant.

And after that, the X-termination is on the track.

I'm not typically one for manager games, they typically bore me and I find the lack of depth to be a big barrier for my enjoyment. After some dated experiences with iGPManager (An all-online GP team manager) and fiddling with the mobile game (which is fun, but only for about a week), I pre-ordered this with the hope that it would scratch the itch to have a deeper world to dive into.

Now, I saw a lot of potential from the mobile game, but this is another level beyond what I imagined. As an avid fan of motorsports on an international level, it is rare any video game released has truly done the sport justice. They usually miss a few things, or dumb too many things down for accessibilities' sake. This game has missed nothing. I haven't completed a whole season yet and haven't gotten to all the features, but when I saw this game has depth, I mean it. You could bury it all the way at the bottom of Mariana Trench and it'd still out-crest Mt. Everest. Maybe it's just the excitement talking, and maybe it'll start to get repetitive, but with bi-monthly votes for rules changes, constant upgrades and expansions to facilities, and the dynamicism of the races, I doubt it. I think I've found my home in the manager games market.

With that said, I still do consider this game to be accessible to the masses. The tutorial started to get a bit naggy to me as I got off and going, but it is presented in a pleasant and ultra-informative way. I have no doubts you could pick this game up and play with no motorsports knowledge, although you will learn a lot along the way. A suggestion to all, fans of racing or not, poke around all the menus, and read all the tutorial screens, and peek at all the tooltips. There is no way to have too much information in this game of milliseconds.

There are tons of buffs and nerfs that drivers either possess for their life, or for short times based on life events. I scouted one driver that was down on focus because of his secret affair. Another driver was labelled as a 'scaredy cat' and was not keen on overtaking or braking. Also, all of the personnel have histories, some reaching back decades. They've worked for previous teams and can even bring over knowledge as you progress. The negotiations for hiring new staff are, in my opinion, robust, as well as the relationship and morale systems for drivers, mechanics, and teammates.

There are more things to this game, single race mode and challenges, but I haven't even had time to look into them. I'm currently enamored by all the work I have to do to push my tier 3 team to the top of the standings so I can take over the next championship, on my way to world domination.

If I had any nits to pick, it would be the lack of customization. You pick an existing team, and go from there. Perhaps there is a chance to run a team from scratch, but I couldn't find it. However, that is more realistic for the majority of cases, not many managers start their own team. Regardless, changing the logo and colors, and even the name would be a welcome feature. Also, unless front and rear wing changes affect the looks (my series currently has sepc front and rear wings) the car is always looking the exact same. Not that it sits front an center very often, but sometimes the details play a big role in immersion.

TL;DR: This shit is deep, and it's good shit.

For $35USD, this is well worth it to ANY motorsports fan, especially an avid watcher of Formula 1 or WEC. You'll notice a lot of tracks are familiar, and there are lots of nods to the real world throughout the game. The developers truly are manic fanatics, and it has turned into one of the best motorsports gaming experiences I've had. If you catch this on sale by at least 25% and have any passing interest in racing or manager games, oh God please do yourself a favor and buy it.",1478836765,1478836765,True,12,0,0.616359710693359375,0,True,False,False

Don't just think you watch a 3d car go around a track for an hour. You spend more time looking at other drivers data working out if the guy in front is going to pit this lap or next, if the weather is going to change for the worst and should i add a drop of fuel on my next pitstop or risk and conerve?. Really this is more then just watching a car and you will find yourself very busy looking into data and other stats if you know how to play mamager games properly. 

PROS:
Great GUI
Grat details with driver traits and researching parts firing and hiring staff etc.
Great 3D enviroment
Very rewarding even finishing mid pack is feels like a win for the team.
Great for people who like to plan stuff and look at data etc

However, Suprisingly it has removed a few things that the Mobile version had:

1. Rookies: There is no option it seems to have a driver acadamy and to promote from within. It's a feature that i really loved from the mobile game and i hope it does get added in in the future.

2. Creating your own team: Unlike the mobile version, in this game you take over as manager of a team, not create your own. I found this disappointing and many people have questioned this decision and i hope they also add this into the game.

3. Less championships: Not a massive issue, progress seems a lot slower in this one than in the mobile version ( I did pick Predator as my team so it could be that too ). I do expect more championships to be added though.

So basically you create your team principle where basically you run the team and dictate what direction of development the team should go throughout the season. You also control staffing, drivers and any Head Quarter upgrades. I would recomend starting up with an average team to learn. I chose the second worst team in Euro Championship and managing on a limited budget is a bit tricky in this game. Although, the nice thing about being a team principle, you can jump ship and go to another team in the current series or another. So your never stuck at one place. 

One minor thing I wish was in the game would be not having the abillity to generate a race strategy pre-race but still have the ability to go off script like in F1 2016. But that is minor and overall the game has a solid foundation with its first installment. 

The only negative I have atm... is the fact that the speed delta's between each of the selections that dictate how hard the drivers push on the track. Just seems a tad unrealistic. I have almost no pace when placing it conserving while the AI seems to have a little more than my guys/girls do. That is the only thing I have that could be optimised a bit more.

This game is everything I could ask for.  You start the game as a beginner ""Team Principal"" and jump into the team management right away. Everything from race calls, car setup, part design and improvement, factory improvement, driver relationships to each other and their mechanics.  Its awesome.  

Pros
- Very indepth.
- Talk to drivers to hone in on the perfect race setup and collect feedback
- Design parts and piss off the number 2 driver because you didn't give him that new front wing.
- Pony up to your team owner, or jump teams if you worry your job is in jeapordy
- Decide how long you want race sessions to be and control every aspect of your cars.
- So many more awesome things

Cons

I have to say though, if you're not into F1, I'd find it difficult for you to ""love"" this game.  It is very technical, it is very detailed, and may be difficult to grasp for someone who doesn't know the world of F1.

At first, I wasn't sure how I felt about using fake companies and fake drivers, but that thought fades off by the immense quality of the game.

The Great:
- Gameplay and graphics are pretty amazing for a Manager game
- Details into the car is on point as far as upgrades, designing parts, etc...
- Very competitive and unpredictable, there are no particular team or driver dominating every single race [8hrs of play]
- So many aspects to manage, from car, to drivers, to sponsors, to staff, to HQ, it doesn't get boring!

The Good:
- Not too much time spent on practice and qualifying.  Having played F1 games before, it can become time consuming to do every single session.
- Good balance in difficulty.  I picked a team that was ranked 7th out of 10 and felt it was manageable to compete.
- Interface is good and smooth.
- Gives me a good insight of how it must be running a racing team

The Bad:
- If you know nothing about F1, chances are you won't fall in love in this game, unless you wanna learn all about it.

Vil ønske der var lidt mere ind bare F1 biler men det er sku stadig sjovt.
Med steam workshop der også snart skulle komme, så bliver det her spil meget sjover.
Det her spil er ikke for alle, så gå ind på youtube vis du har brug for at se nåde om det, og vis du godt kunne lide mobil versionen, så vil du også 100p elske det her spil.

Now that I have been playing the game for some hours, I would say the game is very fun :) Gameplay is easy to learn and fun at the same time, one seson can take several hours, but it is probably one of the things that makes the game fun.
i Do wish there was a little more then just F1 cars but it's still fun.
With steam workshop also soon to come, the game whould be more awesome.
This game is not for everyone, if you want to lern more then go to youtube, to also to se if it's for you, and if you liked the mobile version, so you will also love this game.
The training was a little anorying for me, but was glad that I could turn it off.
The price is a little high but all in all, still fun.
With the things the game has to offer. I would say it is one of the beste Manager games on the market right now.
Will 100% recommend it :) for me it's a 9.3 / 10. :)",1478793586,1478793586,True,8,0,0.633129477500915527,1,True,False,False

The tutorial takes about an hour and tells you everything you might need to know

The game itself is allot of fun, you sit on the edge of your seat most of the time trying to get your racer to the podium.

Its not an easy click and see game, it takes alot of effort to do good with an overall bad team that you start with. ( unlike games such as fifa where you can win from the best using the worst )

I have been waiting since i am 16 for a great F1 manager game and never understood why no one was making.  I am 35 now lol.

Anyway, I will cut to the chase.

Pros = Everything, game is awesome and a must buy, cant wait to start modding it.
Cons = Practice needs more time, more options on car livery design and sponsor colour and design would be much better.

Pros:
- Extremely polished (great UI, good performance, no bugs)
- Visuals
- AI is surprisingly smart when it comes to strategy
- Finally in 3D
- Much deeper than the mobile game (scouting, build your HQ, hire new mechanics and drivers,...)
- 3 different series (GP2, GP3 and F1)
- Good selection of tracks with different variants
- Dynamic weather, safety car, virtual safety car, mechanical problems, driver errors,... SO MANY SURPRISES!
- Setups are very important
- You can vote on rule changes for the next season
- Relaxing and stressful at the same time
- Never gets boring
- Drivers aren't as whiny as players in Football Manager
- Focus is purely on the management side of things - no annoying driving mini games or the likes
- Races are longer than 5 minutes

Cons:
- No mod support yet
- No official license
- No Gt3 or endurance series
- You can't create your own team, only join already existing ones

Manage an entire race team, from the ground up. Hire and fire drivers, engineers. Manage your money, and build upgrades to buildings giving your team access to better equipment, parts, drivers, engineers, etc.

Create car parts, and improve their reliability. Read emails and do interviews, increasing synergy between your teammates or increasing your marketability between sponsors. Keep the same drivers to create a bond between their mechanics giving them better abilities. Your drivers pick up traits, good and bad. Scout new drivers, at any time to see what they are rated, or just go out and find someone you want and offer them a deal. Choose between short, medium or long races, and change at any time. Do practice runs to increase your gear ratios, tire pressure, suspension, and more based on feedback from your drivers and mechanics to perfect your car for race day.
