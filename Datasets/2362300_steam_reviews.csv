Routes can't always strike the balance - Some long and boring, others far too short, often avoiding the mark of what the playerbase is after.

That said, some are really diamonds in the rough. Solidly suggest reading reviews or watching video reviews from those not looking at it through rose tinted glasses to assess what suits you and budgets, as well as waiting for sales. Numerous routes have additional timetable slots for other rolling stock from other addons, which is a double edged sword - The reuse of some locomotives is prolific, especially for British freight work relying on the Class 66 for nearly all modern timetables.

Lastly, in spite of them being a not insignificant request from the community, the developers appear to have put the brakes on steam based DLCs - Though the existent ones are only British based, with most adding one or two steam locomotives at best, with a simulation model that makes them difficult or impossible to operate to any schedule provided while also managing the steam pressure properly.",1709019791,1709019791,False,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

I bought the Special Edition at -70% price, around 35€ which is a good price for this game. But let me tell you, if I paid the full price I honestly wouldn't be happy about it. Overall a nice game but:

- Needs tutorials about railway signalling.
- Could have better quality textures,
- As far as I know railway signalling, some signals I see in the game doesn't match what the game hud tells you. For example speed limit 60km/h, where the signals show number 4 and flashing green light, which I understand as 40km/h. Also I have seen red ""danger"" light which was not preceeded by a yellow ""warning"" light, so I only knew I should stop because the hud told me. Definitely hoping for a fix to this as ideally I would rather avoid using the hud when I gain some more experience with the game, since this is supposed to be a simulator.
- Could use some opitmization, the game stutters and has FPS drops quite often.

I still give it a positive review since it is playable and fun, although there is a lot of room for improvent. Do not buy it at full price, it's not worth it. Wait for at least 50% discount.

The 4th installment is basically TSW3 with minor additions (that are being sold to us as the biggest thing since the invention of the wheel). They have added volumetric fog for example, which is literally a checkbox in UE. A Route Editor that was promised years ago already. A free-roam mode that is buggy, doesn't support all vehicles on every track and some vehicles just don't work at all right now. A updated livery designer - that broke nearly all existing liveries. Still running on a very old build of the Unreal Engine so performance is quite lacklustre.

I wish the developers would focus on some of the bigger problems their game has at the moment.
BUGS. There are bugs that have been around for years and haven't been fixed yet. Some so obvious it makes you wonder if routes and scenarios are actually being playtested by QA. (Like pillars standing in the middle of your tracks)

There is also no ability to map controls to third-party controllers like Joysticks, Hotas, Pedals, etc., something that almost all other games support. The ability to use the Axis of a Hotas for the Throttle in your train would be a godsend.

TL;DR

+ Good Graphics
+ PZB, LZB, ETCS, Sifa, AWS 
+ Steam, Diesel and Electric Vehicles
+ Ability to leave train and walk around (even manually change switches, etc.)

- Poor sound for most trains
- A lot of tracks have visual glitches and bugs in their scenery
- Some tracks look terrible when using third-person view
- Bugs
- Absolutely terrible options menu (Controls tab is a scroll-fest)
- incorrectly set brake levers and such on waggons in different train configurations (e.g. brake lever set to ON but is actually off, ruining both immersion and gameplay)


I could go on for hours probably...

If you're looking for a graphically compelling game that simulates trains in a 'somewhat' realistic manner, it's good. If you're looking for a true-to-life simulation, you're better off looking for something else. In its current state, I can't recommend TSW4.

I have owned every edition of the TSW franchise, and own many DLC's. In total i must have spent about 500 hours on the Franchise in total.

Without doubt, TSW4 is the worst.

Its not that it has bad graphics or bad game play, because it doesn't, the new graphics are simply incredible and some of the physics on the trains is absolutley perfect. Lines like Blackpool branches, and the ECML show what can really be done with TSW.

The problem is the bugs. They're everywhere, its like turning up a log and seeing all the insects underneath it. In free roam, you get to do something everyone dreams of, messing around on the railway, with whopping great machines, and it seems great, until the signaller decides to take a tea break for the day and you go nowhere, or you randomly derail, or you get a ""Service failure"" out of nowhere, or the whole thing crashes for no apparent reason. After you load up save games, the HUD disappears and you no longer have your objectives, and the service is practically unplayable. Even on timetable mode, the bugs make it unplayable all the time.

These bugs are most apparent on smaller, slower routes such as the WSR, where long periods of waiting and slow running make having bugs like these ruin the experience. 

And to get to Steam, introduced back in TSW2, a ""Revolution"" in train simulation, yet we still have no functioning injectors, the locos still randomly derail, the safety's are still constantly going off, we still don't run out of coal and water, we still don't have to worry about boiler pressure, because its almost always at the optimum PSI, and the fireman still shovels coal all the time. 

Dovetail has actively said they don't plan to fix all of the aforementioned features, so whats the point in having them?

There was a time, which i remember, when Matt Peddelsden and his team were greatly respected game developers, but i'm afraid, like most good things, consumerism, capitalism and profit has became the only focus on the developers on the TSW4 team.

So, in summary, don't buy this game, buy an earlier version, or even TSC. Train Sim World 4 has been like a slap in the face, its buggy, and the developers wont even fix it.

Bad things happen when game developers focus on profit and forget about the community, i wonder how long it will be before we see the downfall of TSW.",1707609369,1707609369,False,12,0,0.654084205627441406,0,True,False,False

All in all, the new features definitely do not warrant calling it a new game and charging full price for it. I suspect one of the benefits of this strategy being employed by DTG is that all their buggy and usually lukewarmly received DLC with mixed reviews get a reset on their score in hope that potential buyers will not check the reviews for the previous iterations of the game.

Although I would recommend this game, there are a few thing I think are a bit crap:

- Loading times aren't the best, but are certainly better then previous games, such as Train Sim Word 2020/2
- Some trains have TERRIBLE models and/or sounds.
- Lots of routes have very bad line side and distant scenery
- North American routes lack in quality compared to simular length routes in UK/Germany.
- German routes also have simular lacks in quality
- Finally, I have to say, the routes and base game are WAY too big. Train Sim World 4 is taking up 151 GIGABYTES OF MY SPACE. That is shared between 38 DLCs. That is about 3.9736.. etc GB per DLC. Like COME ON. There is 95 DLCs! How is anyone ment to hva that on their PC and expect it to run smoothly.

Okay... I get it... That's a lot of bad stuff. But there are a few things that are good:

-  Lots of routes are extremely good and have amazing scenery. 
-  The sales are brilliant and can be at least 20% off!
- I am already running out of good things to say... Anyway, the GUI is brilliant and is super User - Friendly, granted you have at least a tiny little bit of knowledge on it.

I couldn't bother writing the rest of good stuff. Instead, you can see my reviews of other routes. Hopefully you found this review helpful. 

Overrall, this is an amazing game. Please download OTHERWISE I WILL COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND BONK YOU ROUND THE HEAD WITH A BRITISH BASEBALL BAT FROM BRITLAND.

I've noticed a few glitches, usually involving clipping through the sides of a train. 

Imagine this, you spent an hour riding the rails, so you decide to walk to the train car behind you since its 5 miles to the next station. 
Clip and now you are somehow outside of the train, occasionally on the roof. Panicked you attempt to catch up. But of course the train is going 100 mph and you go 4 mph. 

At least its beautiful watching your train disappear over horizon of the English countryside.

When it works well, it's a good experience, but when issues arise, it becomes a bit of a nightmare. There are times when I spend a considerable amount of time trying to figure out why a train isn't moving, often attributing it to a bug. The tutorials work fine, but outside of them, there are occasional issues. The graphics are generally good, though there are sporadic bugs that can be a bit distracting.

One limitation is the limited map options for routes, especially when using DLCs. It would be more enjoyable if there were more flexibility in connecting routes, allowing for a wider range of choices. Additionally, the game lacks variety in terms of trains. It would be great to see additions like the A4 class or the Shinkansen, adding excitement to the driving experience.

In conclusion, the game is decent, but I question whether it justifies the price, considering both the base game and DLCs.

Would recommend, pretty much the same as my review for TSW3. Definitely wait until there is a sale on to get DLC and expand your collection. Bugs from previous titles are still present at times such as red light issues, derailements or other things but it's not as often as people make them out to be. Nice additions to TSW4 are the abilities to spawn any trains in freeroam/timetable mode and ""dispatch"" yourself by placing a path via the map great if you want to make your own services while the AI do their thing, photo mode is now been added, so no more missing that perfect moment for screenshots.

A side note, don't read too much into the Steam reviews for this game and dlc go watch videos on them instead so you can make your own mind up on what you've seen.",1705423353,1705423353,True,1,0,0.479865789413452148,0,True,False,False

The graphics are exceptionally well-executed, rendering trains and landscapes with a level of realism that is truly immersive. The Standard Edition includes 3 routes: Antelope Valley Line, East Coast Main Line and Lindau - Bludenz which are very well crafted. Each of these routes has a timetabled mode for which introduces an element of strategic gameplay, enhancing the overall simulation and increasing interest for players. Furthermore, the inclusion of a sandbox mode provides a creative outlet, enabling users to craft and personalise their own railway experiences. However these Routes get tiring and repetitive after a while and Train Sim World 4 Standard Edition does include many DLC. These DLC range from more routes  to more Locos which are quite expensive nearly more that the game itself. Overall, Train Sim World 4 is a good purchase if you are into Rail Simulation although I think it is worth purchasing the Deluxe or Special Edition to save on DLC later if you get bored playing the game.",1705381897,1705381897,True,1,1,0.498166710138320923,0,True,False,False

I read a lot of other peoples dislike of the cost of DLC and the lack of effort put into the core game and I figured I would give it a try and see for myself.

I started the training missions and right away thought the train model from the outside looked alright, but the interior seats and stuff seemed like carry over graphics from 10+ years ago.  Got in the drivers seat and started driving the train and was automatically aggrevated by the looping engine sounds...  I cannot stand stuff like that.  At first I didn't know if I was hearing gears change or something but after about 10 ""shifts"" lets call it, I figured it was just a poor audio loop.

Not a great way to start into the franchise, a lot of DLC doesn't seem to have great reviews, and a lot of people are upset with DLC being carried over from 1 game to the next on this yearly basis without any effort put into bringing it up to modern standards.

So I think I will have to refund and maybe DTG will put more effort into their product in the future and I'll consider trying it again...  It's a shame, I was looking forward to it, but I'm not sinking into this money pit for poor effort on the developers behalf.

There is nothing special or exciting about it, and the launch was boring compared to Train Sim World 3 with that live video of clues. One of the newest features being pushed is route editor which I did have some excitement for, but having looked at it since, if you don't have Unreal Engine experience then forget it.

The ECML route isn't any fun and I probably will not play it too often. Of the times I have played it, its just been starting and one and stopping at the next with nothing in between than some speed variations. It is a nothing route that borders on being pointless. I would have expected such a route to have been released as a standard DLC than as a big launch of a new game. There hasn't been an interesting one since Train Sim World 2 launching with the Bakerloo Line.

When it comes to recommending it, I would say yes, but only in the hopes that better DLC will come out for it before Train Sim World 5.

Realism: Train Sim World is known for its attention to detail and realism in depicting trains, routes, and the overall train-driving experience. The game offers a high level of authenticity, making it appealing to train enthusiasts.

Graphics: The game typically features impressive graphics, showcasing detailed train models, realistic environments, and weather effects. The visuals contribute to the immersive experience of driving a train.

Diverse Routes: Train Sim World often includes a variety of routes from different regions and countries, providing players with a diverse range of landscapes and challenges. This diversity can enhance the overall gameplay experience.

Interactive Gameplay: The game may include interactive features, such as realistic controls, in-cab interactions, and various scenarios that challenge players to manage their trains effectively.

Expansions and DLCs: Train Sim World often offers additional content through expansions and downloadable content (DLC). This can extend the longevity of the game and provide players with new routes and trains to explore.",1703928754,1703928754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Positives:
- Weather system has received an overhaul and is much better, especially with the addition of 'dynamic weather' which poses a driver with changeable weather conditions. E.G, when driving the ECML, when leaving Peterborough it was very sunny and clear but by the time i had reached Doncaster, it was heavy snow! (very accurate English weather)
-Train Models are good and accurate, especially the 801, having travelled on this extensively in real life. 
-Passenger volume is a great step up from TSW2 with numbers being closer to representing real life. 
- Variety of routes on the base game is good with the ECML being the standout to me. 
Negatives:
-Some minor glitches reminisent of the early days of TSW2 such as the information being displayed on the departure boards for the wrong platform, although i'm sure these will be sorted very soon like they were on TSW 2.
-The ECML is quite bland in terms of locomotive variety without any other DLC which i think adds AI services to add a bit of colour to the line.
-Lighting isn't great on the ECML with the headlights on full beam having the effectiveness of holding a candle in front of the driver's face.
-Very sad that no terminus featured on what had the potential to be a groundbreaking route (ECML) for TSW as a whole, with Leeds already being somewhat modelled on the old trans-pennine route I thought it would've been easier to implement this onto the route. Then again, I'm not a developer so i don't know how hard these things are!
Final comment: 

Overall, I am very happy that i did not bother with TSW 3 and was patient for the realease of 4, as i can say it has been worth the money. The ECML is a brilliant edition for TSW but had the potential to be so much more. I would love to see either a route extension in the furutre, or maybe a loco pack for the aging class 91s that will be retiring soon and have been a staple of the ECML for so long- plus it would add some needed variety to the 801s and 66s on this route. I can confidently say to anyone who has been waiting since TSW2 for more value for money, this christmas sale is your chance. Well done to everyone at dovetail and I look forward to what next year offers!

Personally it's my first one so I bought it with pleasure. However compared to the 3 or 2, graphics same, same trains, same scenery details. but what can be compared then? well,
an Austrian route added
Vectron added
A british route with class 801 added.
an american route added

FOR VECTRON LOVERS: seriously, if you want the vectron, don't get that unless your money has no meaning. you just spend the deluxe version while you have tsw3/2 ( no matter if on discount or standard price ) for way too expensive just for a locomotive you want so bad.
FOR OEBB TALENT 1 LOVERS: Wrong and recycled sounds, horn crack, lights don't exist etc.

Here's hoping for my locality to be made into a map from Swansea and heading westward 60 miles via Carmarthen and on to the far western line of Milford Haven, Pembroke Dock, Waterston, Hubberston and Fishguard Harbour.  
Milford Haven with it's deepest natural harbour supporting tons of fish from the mighty fishing industry, as well as a busy commuter route feeding the whole of Pembrokeshire county. Just northeast of Milford Haven if branches off 2miles to Hubberston (West LNG storage). Many tanker consists use this line daily to bring in empties and roll out full LNG Tanks several times a day, heading to the bigger cities via Swansea.. 

Just South West of Johnston there is a branch off South to a large LNG storage park in Waterston (East LNG storage) which also needs to move gas tankers by the freight-load many times a day to feed the UK's need for natural gas.   

Just west of Clarbeston Road station is an old manual signal box and a junction to the North West for the Fishguard line, which meanders through the Gwaun valley and terminates at Fishguard Harbour where passengers can alight for a ferry to Rosslaire in Ireland. 

Just west of Whitland is brand of to the South West towards Pembroke and Pembroke Dock, stopping at Kilgetty to view Carew Castle, Tenby for the seasonal vacation spots and beaches, with the line finally ending up passing through Pembroke for visitors to see Pembroke Castle and the great shopping centre, and finally onward to the end of the line at Pembroke Dock, with the line being fed by wagons of oil and fuel from  it's massive oil refinery on the river Cleddau, and also the busy ferry port for passengers to get a ferry to Rosslaire in Ireland.

If anyone should start to make this route, please let it be known that I would gladly assist with scenery and mapping. I have 100's hours to burn. Message me here on steam.

Its not like Flight Simulator where extreme information is needed. This simulator is fun for experts and starters.

The three new routes are a nice addition with a highspeed line in the UK, the East Coast Mainline A, Bludenz Feldkirch Lindau and the US, Antelope Vallyline!

My favorite is the route from Austria and as second the UK route. The detail on both routes are stunning. The mountains and the British landscape are very well shaped.

Livery editor has now gone up to 1000 decals and trains can now be placed manually into the world in freeroam. While new for TSW4 these features have already been available as mods in previous versions. 

We now have fog so the weather was updated a little. A new camera mode has been added and how it works is generally the same as the one available in ATS and ETS2.

Scoring system is updated for TSW4 routes and future versions only with extra points for accuracy, safety systems, rough handling etc, etc but you can still drive like a drunk and get full marks anyway. A disclaimer on older routes has now been added   explaining that said route won't necessarily get updated to current standards and likely an excuse to not fix bugs on older content let alone upgrade them. So far the only way an older route gets upgraded is if it's being used for a new version of TSW with the SEH upgraded for TSW3 and Dresden to Resia for TSW4 being prime examples.

Scenario planner is still awkward to work with and primarily A to B with routing trains being very restrictive and having to be done with just the map.

The game does have some upsides. Rollingstock usually overlaps onto other routes increasing the variety of what you can use and see. Dynamic weather is now optional so the weather can change as you drive but depending on the route this can render some services to stall outright as it seems this feature wasn't fully tested.

That's about it. I'll rate it as neutral as while it is fun, minor updates don't warrant it being resold as a new game. While the price and bugs go up the quality falls behind.

[h2]TL;DR:[/h2]
[spoiler]I love it[/spoiler]

[h2]Preface[/h2]
I am not an incredible [i]gamer[/i]. I play in the odd half an hour I get between working, sorting out the house, cooking dinner and keeping a toddler happy. Oh yea, and a wife! So my gameplay may not be representative of yours!

I play using a [url=https://shadow.tech/en-GB/shadowpc/offers#Details_Offers]Shadow PC[/url] with the higher spec which means:
[list]
   [*]GPU NVIDIA® RTX™ 3070 Ti
   [*]AMD EPYC™ up to 3.7 GHz 8 vCores
   [*]28GB RAM
[/list]
all streamed to a decent monitor using a stable high speed connection.

Because of that I am able to run the game in ultra settings.

[h2]Graphics[/h2]
I think they are pretty solid. with a long view distance it is easy to be immersed, there is plenty of detail around the immediate field of play so you rarely ever see empty space unless you go looking for it.

The interface is pretty intuitive, though I personally don't like the menu, it is perfectly functional and gets me to where I want and at the moment i haven't really fully explored the different methods of play so it's just frustrating as it takes me a few clicks to get to the bit I want.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Love it, it's a train sim and it simulates trains... I'm not a train driver so it is immersive enough that I get what I want without needing my hand held throughout. But from what I have seen so far, it looks like there is potential to do even more yourself which I rate as an option because the better I get the more I may want to do.

I really enjoy the realism of the signalling

The sound is pretty immersive though tunnels don't seem to have the impact I'd have thought they do.

[h2]Overall[/h2]
I personally rate it as the best train sim I have played, it hits the right balance of realism, challenge but importantly playability. Also some really good tutorials. I for now have only played the scenarios and know I will find the different play modes even more immersive and enjoyable.

If you're new to the series, the included routes and features make it worth the purchase. However, for the vast majority of players, who are returning from previous entries in the series, it simply is not worth getting, especially not at full price.[/b][/h2]

Train Sim World 4 (TSW4) is now the 4th separately released iteration to the Train Sim World series. The series as a whole attempts to provide a high-fidelity simulation to the operation of trains, by enabling players to take control from the driver's (or engineer's) seat. Each of the games now comes standard with a set of included 'routes', all of which also include 'unique' forms of traction (locomotives and multiple units) and wagons/trailers where appropriate.

This iteration comes with three new routes as part of the ""Standard Edition"", although other routes and trains are provided in the various other packages available. These routes are the East Coast Main Line: Peterborough - Doncaster, the Antelope Valley Line: Los Angeles - Lancaster, and the S-Bahn Vorarlberg: Lindau - Bludenz. I will discuss these individually in greater detail further on in this review, but to summarise, these routes are generally well made and are of a good standard, at least for the developer, Dovetail Games (DTG).

Other than the routes themselves, the main selling points of TSW4 were the updated Scenario Planner and Livery Designer, both of which provide only relatively minor updates to the overall user experience (UX) for the small segment of players that choose to use these creative tools, the new Photo Mode which provides a much better UX for taking nice looking screenshots in the game, a rework to the scoring systems in the game, so as to provide a more accurate dopamine hit to players that drive well. Additionally, visual improvements, namely volumetric fog, improved rain on windshield visual effects, and better overhead line electrification rendering, were also added to the Train Sim World formula, which serve as visually pretty, albeit rather minor, improvements to the overall graphical fidelity. Lastly, TSW4 was released alongside the long-awaited and promised Train Sim World Editor, which is available for download from the Epic Games Store and serves in providing a monumental positive change to the series' future.

With all of these changes, why am I not recommending this new entry, especially to older players? Well simply, these changes are all very minimal and will have almost no impact on a typical player's gameplay loop. Quite frankly, these changes could and should have been included as a free update to previous games, as should this game's predecessor, TSW3. Following the backlash after the announcement of TSW2, DTG responded by stating that the release of a sequel was fundamentally required as a result of updating the Unreal Engine version. While understandable in that case, this was not cited as a reason to justify either TSW3 or TSW4, leading many players (myself included) to suspect that the existence of these titles was purely to serve as a cashgrab for DTG. In effect, DTG stated that they would not be supporting these older titles after a certain period and that the only way to ensure that ongoing support was given for routes players had already paid for was to pay up for the entirely new version. Additionally, the prized feature of the TSW4 release, the Editor, had been a promised upcoming feature since the original release of the first TSW game, yet is now exclusively available and requires TSW4 to run.

On a more positive note, the release of the editor itself does promise a better future for the series in 3rd Party releases (as opposed to the limited 2nd Party projects which have been enabled officially, up until this point). However, of course, it will likely take some years before this has any tremendous impact on the game, owing to the amount of development time required to build routes in general, as well as the necessary training and learning required to use the editor, especially for developers not familiar with the Unreal Engine (as will be common amongst route developers for train simulators, I suspect). Nevertheless, this aspect of the TSW4 release is undeniably a major step in the right direction for the TSW series and for DTG as a company.

[b]Now, on to the routes included with TSW4.[/b]

[b]East Coast Main Line: Peterborough - Doncaster[/b]
The new traction (other than the very common Class 66) included with this route, the LNER BR Class 801 Azuma EMU, makes for a really nice drive and was a much-needed addition to the game, especially for British railfans. The route itself features some utterly gorgeous stations, however the rest of the route is incredibly sparse and boring, a reflection of the route's reality. Additionally, the route fails to have a logical terminus, crushing player's immersion every time they complete a run.

[b]Antelope Valley Line: Los Angeles - Lancaster[/b]
In contrast to the previous ECML route, this route features two very logical termini, which greatly helps to maintain player immersion when finishing a run. Additionally, the timetable has a variety of services that terminate only partway along the route, which gives players flexibility when choosing a service to undertake. Some of the scenery is not the best, especially near LA, yet this is fairly excusable in my opinion, given the enormous size of the city. The included locomotive and cab car are pretty nice, but very similar to what we have seen on other US routes up until this point.

[b]S-Bahn Vorarlberg: Lindau - Bludenz[/b]
I was really surprised by just how much I like this route. It's the first route in the series (partially) set in Austria and also features the first international crossing in the TSW series. It's a lot of quaint little single track lines set among gorgeous mountains and lakes. It also has more of a network feel, which provides the player with a lot of flexibility in choosing services. The included ÖBB 4024 Talent EMU is yet another Talent EMU to be added to the series, but is always a pleasure to drive, even if very predictable at this point. The scenery and flexibility on this route really help to sell it to me, though and I am thoroughly impressed overall.

[/list]

[h2] CONCLUSIONS [/h2]

While I very much want to remain positive for the future of one my favourite game series, TSW4 presents as a real mixed bag. It ultimately should have just been at update to TSW2, as should TSW3, yet I can't help but feel excited about the future of the series given the editors release. I am unfortunately also let down by the continued release of new routes at the $60AUD price point, rather than the roughly $40AUD price point of routes in previous years. While I understand the state of inflation around the world, I can't help but feel that this makes these DLCs increasingly completely uncompetitive with offerings from other games in the simulation genre, such as ETS2/ATS. Additionally, while it is nice seeing the series branch out slightly more internationally (into Austria), the series is still heavily lacking in global presence. As such, I nervously await the future of this franchise and sincerely hope that it can continue in a more positive direction.",1700650037,1700650794,False,159,0,0.896791458129882813,2,True,False,False

This game is unfinished, to put it simply. They haven't finished making it, so why it's up for sale with that INSANE price tag is anyone's guess.
It lags, hard. I have got a pretty good gaming PC, 3080ti, 13900kf, 32gb DDR4 etc etc, i should have no issue running this game, but it stutters, lags and sometimes just stops all together. Every other game in my library works absolutely fine on max settings but this doesn't.

Driver assist, an annoying popup which repeatedly tells you do something (like raise pantograph and close circuit breaker) when you've already done those things AND ARE CURRENTLY DRIVING, this is the sort of thing that gets picked up when you actually TEST your game prior to release.

Sandbox mode, a joke, it's not sandbox at all, the moment you pass a signal at danger it ends the scenario, which we were told would not happen as it's supposed to be a free roam scenario with no restrictions so you can just drive around an explore. Lies.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, or if you're lucky and have less than 2 hours playtime get your steam refund immediately. 

I seriously regret buying this unfinished, laggy SCAM of a game.

I will no longer purchase any Dovetail products, and I mean ever, this is the final straw.

Edit: 18/11/2023
No fixes have been made to the bugs listed above. Trains and locomotives now derail on sandbox mode when you try to couple up.

I have no interest in the majority of the new features that TSW4 brings, nor do I have any interest in any of the included new routes. However, if I want to continue playing new routes that I [i]am[/i] interested in, I'm forced to spend £30 in order to 'upgrade' from TSW3 to TSW4. (I bought TSW4 during the Steam Halloween sale when the 'Standard Edition' was around £30.)

So, is TSW4 a good game?
If you've never owned a TSW game before, then TSW4 could well be a decent investment for you. If it seems like a game that you would be interested in, then you should consider purchasing it. [i]HOWEVER,[/i] keep in mind the following:

- If the current trend continues, TSW5 will likely release in summer 2024, meaning if you wish to buy new route DLCs past that time, you'll have to buy the new game for full price.

- New content (be it new Route DLCs or routes included in a new game) are [i]regularly[/i] filled with numerous bugs, glitches and other issues. It often takes a while for the most serious (game breaking) issues to be fixed, and many smaller issues never get fixed as the developer pretty much abandons support for older content once newer content releases.

- Be prepared to spend money any time you want to expand your collection of routes or trains. Unlike game such as Derail Valley or Euro Truck Simulator 2, nothing in this game is free. Expect to pay upwards for £29 for a route (which usually include one or two trains) or £9 for a standalone locomotive DLC. You won't be getting new gameplay or 'core' features for free, they'll likely all get packaged into next year's TSW5. (which will also cost you £30 to upgrade to)

- Many of the features announced for TSW4 still aren't actually in the game over 4 months after it's release. The formation designer and new suspension physics being the two that spring to mind.

- Dovetail Games have created an incredibly complex system for managing DLCs when they release a new game. All old DLC will remain compatible with the new game, however DTG create brand new store pages for [i]all[/i] of the (many) DLC for the TSW series. This has two main effects: Some older DLCs are now more expensive than they were for previous versions & all the steam reviews for the DLCs don't carry across to the new store pages. So if you're looking to buy a DLC that originally released for TSW2, take your time to find the [i]original[/i] store page, it will be identical to the new one, but you'll be able to see the reviews and it might even be slightly cheaper.

What are the new features like?
TSW4 has a few 'new' 'features' when compared to TSW3. Let's go through some of them:
(Keep in mind that at the moment, TSW4 has three routes. The vast majority of content that people own will be for TSW3 and earlier)

""Improved"" overhead wires: They've made the overhead wires on electrified routes slightly thicker so that they're more visible. The result is the wires looking overly bulky and they sort of merge into a black blob in the distance if there are a lot of wires in one area. Any supporting wires that are used to hold up the overhead wires have [i]not[/i] had their thickness increased to match. This means you can't see the supporting wires from a distance because they're much thinner than the overhead wires, and as a result it makes the overhead wires look like they're floating. According to Dovetail on their forums, changing the supporting wires would mean 'updating hundreds of models' which would have taken too long..
Oh, and these 'improved' wires are only included on routes made for TSW4, no older routes.

Volumetric Fog: fancy new volumetric fog, how fun. Apparently enabling it is literally just ticking a tickbox in the Unreal Engine editor. They ticked a box that was always there and made a big deal about it being a new feature, cool. Also it's only for routes made for TSW4.

New Rain effects: They increased the resolution of raindrops on train windows. To my knowledge, this feature is only for Trains made for TSW4.

Livery designer '2.0': They added an undo button, increased the amount of decals you can use and added a tickbox so you can decide whether your liveries appear in the game or not (this tickbox does not exist for liveries by other people that you subscribe to). I never make my own liveries, for a PC user, the whole concept of it feels so slow, clunky and limited.

Scenario Planner '2.0': Now you can set the weather of your scenarios, add a scenario description and there are more path options now (for TSW4 routes only)

New scoring system: Is literally broken. The new 'Platinum' medal is supposedly really hard to achieve, but it's the only one people ever seem to get. As far as I'm aware, routes made for TSW3 and earlier still use the old scoring system.

Free Roam mode: Probably the biggest actual gameplay change in the whole game. I've had a fairly decent time with it so far. Lots of people seem to have issues with knowing how to actually get it working and how to utilise it's full potential.

Photo Mode: nice addition overall, nothing groundbreaking but nice to have.

New player assists: Apparently makes the game more accessible for people that haven't had any experience with train sims/TSW before. I do not fall into this category so haven't encountered them.


Overall, Do I recommend TSW4? (TL;DR:)
If you're not played a TSW game before and think you might like it, then it's fundamentally not a terrible game. Just keep in mind the things I've mentioned above and be prepared for the game to be abandoned once TSW5 releases. [i]Always[/i] wait for a sale before getting the game or DLCs.

If you have played TSW games before & want to continue doing so. You'll have to get TSW4 if you want to have any new content ever again (until TSW5 releases, in which case you'll have to buy that, and so on, and so on). You, like me, are stuck in DTG's infinite cycle of getting us to spend a significant chunk of money for the bare minimum new features. But we'll keep doing so because despite the many, many flaws that TSW has, there isn't really a better alternative.

-----
I really dislike Dovetail's monetisation strategy here. Presumably it works for them because this is the 4th time they've done it. Personally, I think that if they keep up this theme of making their playerbase pay full price for a new game every year, just to allow them to continue paying for any new DLCs, people will start to get tired and give up on the franchise. With TSW4's release, I will no longer be getting Dovetail's DLCs unless they're a [i]big[/i] step up in quality (like Just Trains' first route appears to be) and even then I'll be waiting for discounts in order to give DTG as little money for them as possible. I'll never say that Dovetail devs should work for free, obviously they need to be paid, but they'd have a much happier community that's more willing to give them money if DTG wasn't so stingy about locking content behind a paywall every year. Euro Truck Simulator 2 manages to survive with free core updates, so does Derail valley and many other games. Perhaps DTG would have a better reputation if TSW4's features (the ones that aren't route features marketed as game features) were a free core update with the new routes being released in a Rush-Hour style DLC pack",1699816415,1699816415,False,4,0,0.504741489887237549,0,True,False,False

In my opinion this release has been rushed and very little thought has been put into making it good.
There are some great people out there that are making some scenarios to share which are much better than the very few that the developers have rushed.
This is definitely not an improvement to TSW3 and all it should be classed as is a minor update to TSW3, a very poor update to say the least.

I get how there are many DLCs, as they say it you could see the game as a collection where you only buy the routes and trains you like.
However, whenever they provide a major update to the game, they charge you money as well to upgrade to the new version.
In my opinion it should be one or the other, and I think they should only charge for DLC instead of base game updates.
This also means that some bugfixes are paywalled, some get patched as they should, but a lot of bugs still exist in the game.
Back in the days of Train Sim Classic you'd get the base update for free, and you'd have to buy the new DLC if you wanted to.
I honestly wish they would go back to this model and that TSW4 will be the last paid major update.
But until that isn't the case, it's one of my biggest reasons to not recommend this game.

Back in the day they had a preserved collection team, which fixed up the quality and gameplay of older DLC to whatever was standard at that time.
Currently I rarely see updates to older DLCs being updated, which I find disapointing to say the least.
At this point I doubt they even exist anymore, while in my opinion they should always be rotating older DLCs (both routes and rolling stock) to look for improvements.
When given the proper attention and marketing they could make some extra income from older DLCs.

I also have the feeling that within their teams there are different levels of quality, for example the quality of timetables on routes.
To put it this way; A timetable made by Joe should be it's own selling point, as I enjoy those timetables way more than others.
As of the time of writing I'm really interested in the upcoming reworked timetables for Koln-Aachen.

As my last point, I wish they would choose more interesting routes.
Some routes are too lineair, this is why Dresden-Riesa is one of my favorite routes as it has multiple destinations and multiple paths.
Being dutch, I'm disapointed in how there are never any dutch routes, altho this might have something to do with licensing.
I don't know which routes from other countries would be interesting, but people have made various suggestions on the official forums.",1699693684,1699704002,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This review is about „Train Sim World 4” (“TSW4”) – a railroad simulation game made by Dovetail. In this game you control a train driver and have the ability to drive many different locomotives on various train lines (“routes”) in different countries (EU, US, UK). While a few locos and routes are available with the base package of the game, additional ones can be purchased with DLCs.

As a train driver, you soon realize that “running a train” is not an easy task: There are many things to be done apart from controlling the train’s speed – ranging from operating the passenger doors to obeying signals, coupling to wagon formations and switching shunts.

Let’s start with the facts:
1) ability to control many different locos on many different routes
2) trains can be customized with respect to their appearance and shared with others online
3) various simulation modes are available, ranging from “beginner” to “expert”
4) dynamic weather conditions + night / day circles
5) DLCs / core games of most older TSW releases are compatible with TSW4 and can still be used

Positive aspects (switching to my subjective views)
1) very detailed interior of the locos
2) many aspects are included in the simulation (terrain inclination, weather, train weight, different train breaks, lighting, pantograph, engine startup, etc.)
3) the overall gameplay can be quite relaxing at times

Surprisingly, these are all the positive aspects I can come up with. Let’s switch to the negative ones:
1) Even on “Beginner” difficulty level, the game expects a lot from you. Driving a train isn’t easy (and I am not a train driver in real life). That is generally okay for a simulation game, but the way in which the system (not) guides you, is more than discouraging. You literally get stuck so many times and find yourself wondering how to get the *damned* train moving at all. Granted, there are some tutorials and there is some help here and there, but I would have appreciated much more direct “feedback”: If I try to apply power to the train and it doesn’t move, why does the game not directly indicate what I am doing wrong?

2) Tutorials and help are very sketchy. There is no explanation about signals at all. The concepts of SIFA are not completely explained. Using speed controls (“tempomats”) works differently on many trains and is also not explained for each loco. Additionally, tutorials often tell you to do “something at some point in time”, but they do rarely explain *why* something has to be done and what the background is (e.g. why must I raise the pantograph at the back and not the one at the front of the loco?)

3) The game is literally full of bugs. This especially, but not exclusively applies to older DLCs which haven’t been given proper attention for months, if not years. I am not talking about small glitches, but about game-breaking bugs which prevent you from completing a mission / tutorial. Just a few assorted examples: 
3-1) In the BR442 Talent loco you are forced to do an emergency break test (which succeeds and you stop). The game then tells you to power down, but all controls are locked. There is an option (“I am stuck”) to reset all simulation physics and the train, but ironically, even that doesn’t help. 
3-2) Playing the new Voralberg route, I played around with the tempomat of the loco. All of a sudden, I could not get the loco to apply power any more – even after a full stop and after shutting the tempomat down. Resetting the simulation physics didn’t help and there was no feedback at all – I had to abort the mission.
3-3) The sound system inside / outside the loco is nonsensical. Sometimes you cannot hear anything inside the driver’s seat after switching camera perspectives. Opening / closing the window has no effect, etc.
3-4) Cars are often floating 1 meter above the ground or are sunken into it.
3-5) Some trains (older DLCs) have absurd acceleration values.
3-6) On the Hamburg route, the train repeatedly doesn't accelerate anymore unless I reset the simulation physics. Acceleration / breaking flickers from min to max several times per seconds in the HUD. The control to open passenger doors does not work (only the hotkey on the keyboard does). Breaks didn't work correctly anymore after resetting the sim physics - thus I passed a red signal and failed the tutorial (after 20 minutes of playing).

4) Then there are some points where I am not sure whether they are bugs or just questionable design choices: 
4-1) Some trains – including even newer ones – do not seem to have a dedicated control to open the passenger doors. You have to know / look up the keyboard shortcut to open / close them. Is this on purpose? How does a real train driver do that?
4-2) Although you can customize your avatar’s appearance a little bit, the driver in the locos looks different each and every time. 

5) Even with full details the graphics of the surroundings often look rather stale and certainly not up to par for a game released in 2023. This applies especially to houses and roads even on new routes. Additionally, the graphics do not run very fluently, either. This brings me straight to the next point:

6) It is great that old DLCs / base packs are supported in TSW4, however, please be aware that most of them have not been reworked at all. Neither with respect to bug-fixing, nor with a respect to updated and more beautiful graphics / textures. I have played some time with TSW3 and I am literally shocked about how little the game was improved and how little new content was added for a full-priced release of TSW4. 
Having the audacity to call this “a new game” is almost intolerable for me as a user – other companies would call this a “service update” and give it away for free. Considering the hefty price-policy on DLCs (if you want all of them, you pay way more than 500 bucks for a “complete” game), this doesn’t add up and leaves you feeling being taken for a fool. There are other companies and games which use a completely different approach, e.g. American Truck Simulator: The base game is updated regularly over many years with no additional cost to the users and even DLCs which are many years old regularly receive a free of charge upgrade with respect to updates in the game engine / textures, gameplay, etc.

7) The additional “route tasks” of manually walking around on a map, placing / finding things are utterly boring and add absolutely nothing to the gaming experience. Adding the fact that you cannot even “walk”, let alone jump over a curb that is about 20 centimeters high makes things even worse.

8) Although you can register your character online and the server saves some of your player’s data, there is no “real” cloud saving, meaning that if you switch to a different PC, you have to manually copy your data, or you will lose progress. That is completely unacceptable for a “new game release” in 2023.

9) It is nice that you have the option to play literally thousands of time table “missions” in the game, but since there are rarely any relevant differences between them, this feels too much like the devs wanted to impress the users. Scenarios are much more interesting, but also much less frequent.

The verdict:
Without going too much into detail here, let it be said that TSW4 *does* have a lot potential! However, the devs have demonstrated a serious lack in commitment regarding quality control and have – IMHO – utterly failed to provide a stable simulation concept which properly guides newcomers to the complex, but surely interesting world of driving trains. Sadly, numerous times I have experienced a situation that just when I was about to start enjoying the game, another bug brought me back to square one and I had to abort the mission. Considering pricing and DLC policy plus the superficial changes they made to justify a “new version” of TSW, I cannot recommend this game at all and I requested a refund.",1697834907,1698443354,False,19,0,0.658881902694702148,2,True,False,False

I have put this as a thumbs up as it does look nice and has potential to be great but I repeat only get this if you don't have TSW3 or have a burning desire to spend £30, personally I am still getting a lot of playtime from Train Sim Classic that may not look quite as nice but just seems to run much more smoothly - and I kind of wish I'd just sunk the cash into another route for that.

Hopefully some of the issues will be dealt with during updates ? - but since they seem to have plagued every version of TSW I've tired I am not that optimistic.

So in summary a half hearted thumbs up, but if you are enjoying another train sim, I'd probably say stick to that at least for now.",1698267012,1698267012,True,7,0,0.592858016490936279,0,True,False,False

What to say, Like its predecessor it builds on the foundations that DTG originally laid in TSW2020.
TSW4 expands on the fundamentals we were given in TSW3 etc. After 3 years all the TSW2020 routes have finally been updated to the standards that TSW2 set.
TSW3's new TOD and weather is a game changer, the lighting on the base routes is a massive improvement (Southeastern High speed looks absolutely fantastic)

-Pros
New Improved lighting and weather (Including volumetric clouds and fog)
Improved loading times
Brand new and improved UX experience
All TSW/TSW2 routes upgraded to TSW2 Standards
Vastly improved raildriver support
PC Editor (Haha go cry console newbs)

-Cons
Could have been a core update to TSW3 (Like Rushhour in 2021)
DLC is now £30 for a route

I can definitely recommend this game and I bought the deluxe version that comes with the BR193 Vectron and the Class A3 Flying Scotsman in the BR green livery. This is a UK route that is the ECML Peterborough to Doncaster that comes with a very fast and fun to drive Class 801 in 5 and 9 car consists. Now I like this one because its fun to drive and the route is nicely made as well. Having lived in Peterborough in the past, the station was modernised after I left and its based around 2015 onwards. Most of the timetables are 2019+ and if you own the Midland Mainline add-on and the Class 700, there are added layers and workings that you play with those trains. 

The second route is the Antelope line that is Metrolink and runs from Los Angeles to Lancaster in California (not to be confused with the one near Preston in the UK). The traction included is the EMD F125 passenger locomotive and Rotem Bi-Level cars in the newer Metrolink livery. It is a nice route overall but the max speed you are permitted to do is 79mph in some parts. If you have the Cajon Pass route, there are freight layers added into the route as well. 

The third route included with the game is the Austrian Voralburg route with an OBB electric multiple unit train that comes with it. I don't know much about this route as I have not played it much but I do like the style of the EMU train that comes with it and there are scenarios for the BR193 that comes with the Deluxe Version of TSW4 that I bought. 

There is tools included to add your own mods into the game and there are improved tools coming for the scenario creator and other cool stuff as well. The good news with the release of these vital tools is that there is now the possibility that we can add mods like custom routes and trains into the game not seen before and there is a lot of potential for freeware and payware to come. This was NOT possible in previous versions of this game. I respect DTG for listening to the community and finally allowing the train sim world community to become more involved with the creations side of things. 

So what are the drawbacks? For newcomers coming into the train sim world 4 game for the first time. The add-ons can be high but here is a tip to help those on a budget. Just wishlist the add-ons you want to get and hold out for a steam sale to get them. I do this a lot with my game and I will be able to get more value for my money. 

Overall and despite this. I am very optimistic for the future of Train Sim World 4 and beyond. Because we can all now get involved in taking this promising train game to new heights with an abundance of a lot of potential add-ons and be it freeware or payware. This is likely the start of the most exciting times to come to train sim since the days of MSTS and TSC and look how popular past train simulators were in history.

There again, some mods provided by the community may help you circumvent the issue, but don't expect your bug report or the devs on the forums to help you with it. Just move along.

4) [b]Manuals, tutorials? Let me laugh![/b] Oh don't worry, there are manuals and tutorials. They just cover the absolute basics like going forward, braking, opening the doors. Don't expect the game to tell you how to use the lights, how to acknowledge yellow signals if you dare to activate the warning systems. Here again, the community will explain that to you, and you should definitely activate them, because it's really changes the game. Yeah, you probably will press a button every 45s so that the deadman's switch does not stop the train, but there is so much more to learn. And the warning systems are designed quite accurately, or so I'm told.

5) [b]Scenario planner is a joke.[/b] They tell you you can do amazing scenarii… It's a lie. Just plain lie. It has been updated from TSW3. Now you can plan a scenario where the player may just do more than going from A to B. Now you can do A->B->A->C->A… etc…
That's nice. But you are not designing the route that the player will go. You just specify from where to where, period. Don't expect being able to give a specific instruction to the player, you won't be able to simulate an emergency stop required from a traveler, or simulate a broken down train on the way that you need to avoid by using the second track. No, you will just do scenarii where everything is optimal. But the devs will show you scenarii where there are more things happening. It's just not for you to design them.


That's the most annoying issues that comes to my mind at the moment.
However, there are plenty of things to enjoy, like learning how to use the different warning systems, getting to know how the different loco responds. Learning to go in a steep slope with a mile long american train (another thing the game doesn't tells you : How the brakes are working. Sadly, it's really important to know it, so that you don't do the same mistakes that other rookies does).

So, you know what's coming for you if you still want to buy it. You'll often see the game in a sale, so buy it when it's on sale, and don't buy routes if they are not on sale, too, unless you really want it, but it may be a poorly-designed route. The risk is yours to take, or not.",1697578929,1697579573,False,4,0,0.556650221347808838,0,True,False,False

Maybe forlorn hope, but forlorn hope is probably better than no hope at all. Probably. Just give them your cash and stop complaining.

If you are waiting for fixes to TSW 2 content as promised when TSW 3 launched, or TSW 3 content when TSW 4 launched, then it's now time for you to give up hope. Surprise, surprise, it's not happening.

Just give them your cash and stop complaining. It might be easier to think of your cash as not being your cash at all, which will make it easier for you to hand over to the truly rightful owner, which isn't you. You will then get some broken software that will never be completed.

By the way, the steam engines are all still broken in TSW 4, and have no reasonable simulation model, compared to, say, Railworks, made about twenty years ago. They are expected to continue to be broken in TSW 4, as the DTG team at Focus Entertainment is still thinking about how to simulate a steam boiler.  This might get fixed in TSW 9, or maybe not.

Utterly shocking.   :-O

Avoid.

NB: TSW 2 is probably the best base version of this game (minus Spirit of Steam), as it doesn't suffer from the horrendous lighting in TSW 3 (where red lights appear as yellow, and yellow appear as white), or suffer from TSW 4's newly horrific lack of optimisation.

Should you buy this game, if you enjoy driving trains of an evening after work and do want those trains to look nicer than what you get in Run 8, then yes.  If you are looking for updated graphics and scenery, then no, your not going to find it here.

Update:  I'm so frustrated with DTG.  I've been playing some Train Sim Classic and i've noticed that even though the graphics are old, the amount of detail put into the scenery is so much better than TSW2 and TSW4.  Why DTG, why?

I have spent most of my time  on ECML the more I play the more performance seems to get worse. Even with a fast processor, 24Gb RAM and an 8GB RX7600, I actually saw 5 FPS whilst stationary at a signal in Doncaster, in fact coming into Doncaster was a juddering mess at 13-20 FPS this was after several previous runs which ran better. 

So TSW4 is worse than TSW3 performance wise. If the ini file needs tweaking it would be good to know as it sure needs optimisation rather than playing what feels like a slide show at times. 

The October Roadmap showed nothing around fixing performance on PC, which can make the game unplayable, so avoid if you value your sanity and a game that makes you feel like you are running a 1990's PC! In fact TSW4 could take the Google Chrome award for stealing all your PC's resources. I did wonder at one point if I had  installed malware, possibly crypto mining to generate extra income for DTG.

Seems to be more bugs than an ant farm. Poor sounds, one example is the Class 158 on ECML the sounds get much louder as you pass under a bridge like you have been thrown outside then pulled back inside once out the other side. The Class 47 service on ECML it far too quiet to the point it sounds more like an electric train. Sound levels are basically all over the place.

  The ability to bring forth the previous DLC from TSW2 and TSW3 is an added bonus since one does not lose their previous purchases.  While some experienced a few hiccups in bringing forward this older content on release day, those snags have mostly been corrected.

But wait! It wasn't free! Yeah, it cost a bit. But I can think of other well-made, complex games (some sports simulations, for example) that seem to offer a ""new game"" once per year at a hefty price. And, when you think about it, that makes sense, even if we don't wish to admit it to ourselves.

Why? Because a really complex, beautiful game requires a lot of work to create, maintain and update it, and the people with the skills to do that -- and it requires many of them, I suspect -- need to eat regularly and dependably, not just once every five years or so. And eat more than just porridge.

It might have rubbed me the wrong way if I had lost the use of my previously-purchased DLCs. But it appears to me that I did not. And I was surprised (and a bit confused, at first) by just how EFFORTLESS my transition to TrainSimWorld 4 (from TrainSimWorld 3) turned out to be. It required a substantial download, but it wasn't all that bad.

In fact, in my opinion TrainSimWorld 4 does an ever-better job of on-boarding a player -- and I love its user interface. After just two hours (so far) I am very happy that I bought this. In retrospect, its cost seems to me like a reasonable (and optional, since my purchase was of course voluntary) expenditure to support the ongoing development of a simulation that is getting this good.

Is it perfect? Well, perfection is a tall order. But at the moment I am so happy with this that I am unexpectedly going to overcome my reluctance (due to the current cost) and buy another DLC, just to celebrate. Now I feel I should have broken down and bought TrainSimWorld 4 earlier. And if there's a TrainSimWorld 5 a year or two from now? Especially if it has VR? Well, I'll probably bite the bullet and buy it, too, now.

No, I did NOT receive this game for free (although pre-edit I accidentally clicked the wrong box and had to go back and correct that) and I do NOT work for Dovetail.

Although there are some parts that are a bit unsatisfactory due to the a little bit unrealistic sound and some bugs, the scenery of the routes and the details of the locomotives and trains have improved greatly.

Especially, I would like to recommend one route whose name is Antelope Valley Line. I felt like I was in LA on the Route, and the scenarios included in that route were significantly different from previous ones (in a positive way).

There are certain routes and rolling stock that stand out above the rest and there are some very good things that DTG has done. However, their strategy towards TSW as a series is lackluster and seems very anti consumer. As much as people complained about how they would update TSC, I would rather them pursue that format where the core game gets updated with new features and fixes are regularly rolled out, with new routes and rolling stock being optional. Compared to our current format where core features and fixes are now locked behind new routes and a new game as a whole. Meanwhile other older content is not updated or abandoned due to issues. I have no problem paying for new content, you could release the three new routes as a dlc bundle for TSW3 or a new game as TSW4, its a distinction without a difference. But when you include core features and fixes it becomes a huge difference. 

In regards to the game play itself, there are a few positives and things I enjoy that they added. The minimal HUD is nice and I feel like it's more immersive, pushing you to use the actual instruments more than the HUD. Haven't tried the free roam or scenario planner/editor yet but those are things that myself and others utilized a lot on TSC. Whether that was to build scenarios and routes or just to edit things or replace rolling stock with third party content so thats nice to finally see. Performance seems to be better than TSW3 but still not great, FPS overall seems to have increased but there are bad stutters while playing (Some routes worse than others) and there is a noticeable lack of GPU and CPU utilization while the game is experiencing poor performance. The graphical ""upgrades"" and ""new features"" are nice but are a moot point. Most of these have been in TSC for years and should have been included in the original release. One of the greatest benefits to scenery has been the LIDAR technology that they have been utilizing and it definitely has paid off in most cases. I was looking forward to the suspension improvements, they look great and I always love simulation improvements......but that's not ready at release so we will have to wait and see. 

Some things I would like to see improved/added is the horrible texture/shadow pop in. Depending on your zoom level the scene looks drastically different and can be quite annoying. I think the UI is okay, but work can definitely be done to consolidate the menus to get it to be more efficient. I always feel like there are redundant screens to get to the same or slightly different information. The overall UI for Creators Club could use some work too, not enough filters and no information on custom made scenarios besides what the author chooses to include in the description. An FOV slider would be nice. The washed out lighting and lens flare seems to have gotten worse, on certain routes some signals can be hard to determine their color as well. Its annoying to keep having to recommend features from a game that has been out for so long now but we desperately need labeled platforms, portals, and sidings and trains like TSC has. This goes a long way when learning a route and trying to build scenarios. I just don't get why simple features from the previous series were not brought over. 

I can probably go on but this is already too long. Overall I can only recommend this if its on sale and you have the perception I had. I got the three new routes, Vectron and Scotsman for $52.00. Even though the new routes are better than most of the recent releases for TSW3, I can't recommend them individually at full price and I definitely can't recommend the series as a whole.

Lets start with the new ""features"" they added. 

The new rain effects look very nice and were definitely needed, HOWEVER this is not a global update! It only affects the new locomotives added to the game NOT any of the ""old"" DLC. 

Volumetric fog looks nice as well, again however it is only applicable to the routes updated to the new lighting from TSW3. And all they really did was check a box in URE4 and tried to sell it as a feature. 

Free roam is just essentially a sandbox, nothing to really add.

The editor on Epic Games looks very promising and is perhaps the most important addition but it should've existed from the start. It will take a while for the community to do anything meaningful with it. You will probably see the next release of Train Sim World before any real content comes out from it. 

Some people say the deal is good for the routes you receive. This is just relative to the ludicrous prices of the DLC's. You should NOT have to pay for routes you don't want in order to get some fog and rain. Especially bug fixes for content you already own. However it doesn't seem like much has been fixed anyway.

It runs smoothly at 60 FPS and it's great to be able to play TSW 4 wherever I want.  For Battery life I dropped it to 30 FPS just to test it on the Deck and it still plays great, and I didn't really notice any issues on the small screen. I didn't change any graphics settings on the Deck, except resolution, so I'm playing with the high and medium settings that the game installed with.

'Nuff said.

Copy Paste of a Game with a Full Price Tag on it, runs WOR$E than previous re-releases. Adds absolutely nothing for it's price.

Here's what it adds;

- Removed previous reviews for both Main Game and all DLC [Hiding all honest Negative Feedback].
- Unreal Engine Features being ticked [which could have been enabled for TSW3].
- Higher Prices.
- Updated HUD.
- Couple older Routes with a slight update.
- All other older Routes not updated to T$W4 ""features"" [yet increased in price still].
- Updated Controller Rumble.
- No Bug Fixes.

Here's an example of one of the Route ""updates""

- Southeastern Highspeed - They have updated some signage for Thameslink at the Stations, yet you need to buy TSW4 to receive this? Why can this not be updated for anyone with a previous Version? This example has nothing to do with the Unreal Engine features they ticked, it's literally just some signs added at Stations costing $72.50AU...

DTG once again show that they do not care in the slightest bit about the Quality of their product. They reluctantly avoid fixing bugs that have been reported for years, and instead, just keep re-releasing the Base Game forcing people to buy it if they want to continue to purchase any future DLC as any previous version of TSW [even though it's the same], won't be compatible.

DTG claimed that they ""had"" to create a new Game this time around due to ""when we tried to just update it, ""EVERYTHING just broke for NO REASON"" - famous words of Matt P. Cannot clarify what breaks. This just seems like a piss poor excuse that suckers will believe that they really did need to re-release the same game.

Yet even with this ""new iteration"" of TSW, it still contains ALL of the same problems the previous versions do. So they must have had a once in a lifetime chance of re-creating every single bug identical to previous versions by luck.

At the end of the day, DTG did not have to re-sell the Base Game, as the majority of ""features"" they did add, such as the Volumetric Fog, Route Builder, are all features of Unreal Engine, and had absolutely NOTHING to do with DTG. These features could have just been ticked in TSW3 and updated.

Re-releasing the same game gives them a way to erase all of the Negative Feedback for both the Main Game, as well as all of the DLC which now all have brand new Store Pages as well, again, hiding all previous Negative Feedback.

TSWx franchise has not been as successful as TS20xx has been, and the main reason this is, is because of the way the franchise gets poorly treated. It's purely a farm where all the fanboi's hang out and get milked, as well as trying to constantly bring in new victims [suckers] to buy into this practice as well.

At the end of the day, people can buy it if they want, don't buy it if you don't want, but just as long as people know how they will be treated, and if they enjoy broken Content that will never get fixed, then they will feel right at home.",1695880508,1695965927,False,141,4,0.814779102802276611,0,True,False,False

I really hesitate to write a review with as little play time as I have on this game, but I feel like I've seen enough to come to conclusions. I say that because TSW4 feels a LOT like TSW3, which in itself feels a lot like TSW2. It's not quite the same game, but it's close enough that I feel confident in what I'm about to say.

I get that there's supposedly a fair bit going under the hood, but from where I am, this game feels a lot more like a hefty update to TSW3 than it does a new release. For the most part, I agree with what other people have said. I cannot comment on performance and crashing issues, as I am fortunate enough to have a much heftier computer than what I imagine most people will be playing on.

It isn't bad. It's nice. However, the previous titles in the series are also nice. As other people have noted, the lack of progress is just really hard to ignore. As such, if you've never played TSW before, this is probably the one to get, but if you have TSW3 or even TSW2 and you're thinking of buying this, wait for a sale, or leave it be and enjoy 3 or 2.

Pros
* All three new routes are really good. All are showing the improvements in detail and quality when compared to the older content. 
* The new routes offer a variety of different gameplay, from fast express services on the East Coast Mainline, to slower commuter runs on Vorarlberg.
* The new locomotives included with the routes, along with the Vectron and Flying Scotsman in the Deluxe edition are beautifully modelled, and fun to use. The Vectron especially is clearly a labour of love.
* The new features, primarily the ability to use free roam and spawn whatever you want, wherever you want into the live services is great, TSW4 is worth it for this all on it's own. If they keep building on this going forward it has the potential to become the primary way to play. Photomode is also a wonderful addition.

Cons
* Still has it's fair share of bugs and issues. While most of them are minor and cosmetic in nature, they do detract from the overall experience. It feels like it could have done with an extra few weeks in the over to really iron out these issues. Hopefully these will be fixed in due course.
* Bugs that were present in older content are still present in this. Some of these bugs are years old at this point, and really should be focused down to be fixed. Dovetail seem to drop support for their content outside of truly game breaking bugs after a couple of months. This isn't really acceptable and they need to dedicate more manpower exclusively to bugfixing and polish.
* I really think DTG should move towards a single yearly updated product like Train Sim Classic, and sell the new routes in bundles instead. This would solve a lot of the ill will in the community.

Overall, while it certainly has issues I think what is offered here is fun and enjoyable to use, and worth the price being asked. The overall quality has certainly improved to new heights, but the same lack of polish is present as always. This brings it down, but not to a point that ruins the experience. I really hope Dovetail will put more time and resources towards polishing the game as a whole, and not move on from their content as quick as in the past.",1695916070,1695916070,True,3,0,0.498708546161651611,0,True,False,False

I'm thoroughly frustrated with the incessant recommendations for this ""train simulator"" series which is Train Sim World and the claims that it's a top-notch simulator. In reality, it falls short. Over the past few years, Dovetail Games has transformed it into more of an arcade experience, sacrificing the depth of simulation in each locomotive. Let's be crystal clear about this: it's not a new game; it's merely an update masquerading as something groundbreaking.

Moreover, I'm already grappling with performance issues and persistent stuttering in the game, issues that should have been addressed given the ample development time. This is the fourth instalment in the series, and dealing with such problems is inexcusable given the hefty price tag. Furthermore, the fact that the price isn't reduced upon release day but only when you pre-order feels like a slap in the face to loyal customers who've invested in three prior ""games"" and DLCs – I use the term ""game"" loosely here. Frankly, I feel like I've poured more money down the drain than into a worthwhile experience.

Another glaring issue with this series is the lack of soul. This ""game"" feels like a lifeless husk, devoid of the charm and immersion it should offer. Running a train or navigating through bustling cities on railroads feels empty and inconsequential. Passengers lack any semblance of realism, and while realism is the goal, there's a glaring absence of immersion. There's no sense of the weight or sound associated with these locomotives.

What's more, it's just not up to par as well as the editor – it took six years to deliver a promised editor feature, initially announced in 2017. And the problems don't end there; multiplayer is still conspicuously absent. The absolute slap in the face comes in the form of the exorbitant prices attached to each DLC and ""game"" down the line. Where does this end? Train Sim World 10?

Overall I've been playing this genre of simulator for over 18 years now, counting, and I feel like it has devolved into a lifeless husk. It may excite those just entering the world of train simulation, leading them to believe that this sets the bar for the entire genre. However, I've decided to request a refund and disengage with Dovetail Games entirely.

Secondly, as is usually the case with these new yearly re-releases and 3 route bundles, although the bundles are good value for money routes such as ECML and the 801 feel rushed.

And although I like to see more steam engines, I still feel steam physics are not in the right place to be now introducing named locomotives. Steam will need continual work before I find it at an acceptable level, such as full manual firing features to be able to control the safety valve, alongside further physics improvements.

At Dovetail Games, we offer a unique solution just for you! For only $50 a month, you can find something that holds even less value than you do, thereby improving your self-worth. We introduce to you our latest concoction…

Dovetail Games unveils a fresh update, brandishing it as a novel game. You might be looking for EA, but this isn’t it. Indeed, Dovetail could be deemed a more unfavorable version of EA in the realm of Train Sim World. Unlike EA, where new patches are synonymous with updates to the existing game, here a new update equates to an entirely new game. Want new DLCs or routes? Prepare to upgrade and witness your wallet's vitality being depleted by the substantial price tags. Money matters!

So, what updates prompt the release of a new game? Features like volumetric fog, which, believe it or not, only requires the developers to flick a switch to activate. It's a simple enhancement that could've been applied to TSW3, but alas, the higher-ups had other priorities—pleasing the shareholders.

Another upgrade focuses on the visibility of the Overhead Lines (OHLE), but it falls short of professionalism. The contact wire, which the trains pantograph connects to, are thick as requested, but the supporting wires are so thin that at speeds over 60 km/h, the contact wires appear to float. A consistent thickness would have been preferable over this irregularity.

Purchasing the Deluxe edition during the early access phase proved to be a wise decision, sparing my wallet from total depletion. Still, it's puzzling why a mere update necessitates a new game, and the inflated $50 price tag for the base game, which is essentially a replica of Train Sim World® 2, is equally bewildering. The game bundles, oddly cheaper than the base game alone, seem contradictory to their apparently desperate financial needs.

With Train Sim World® 4 comes the 'Freeroam' feature, a minimal deviation from the timetable mode, where trains are absent from the schedule, and players can select any train and its route. The scenario editor also accomplishes the same feat, rendering this 'new feature' as redundant as a chocolate teapot. Reintroduced features like the PC Editor and a pause function for screenshots don’t justify the creation of an entire new game.

It appears that this release was rushed. Normally, when they release a new game annually, the DLCs you own from previous games are automatically added to your account upon release. However, this time, they seemed to have forgotten to do so and had to upload them at the last minute, attributing the delay to Steam's ""upload"" issues as a cover-up. So, what have we learned? With Dovetail Games, you can at least assert that you're not worthless, but you may also find the company's practices somewhat questionable.",1695861953,1695861953,False,11,2,0.517036259174346924,0,True,False,False

A year later - they announce tsw 4, make a trailer with a Depeche Mode song and update the graphics just a little bit. 
All they did was update the graphics, livery and scripting tools, photo mode, and added the ability to spawn any train at any location, which is a really cool feature. And that's all they've done in a year. Upgrading all the routes to the lighting from TSW 3 is not. Better with each release, we'll update one old route at a time (like we did with Dresden - Riesa). 
What about the new routes. I played only on the Austrian route (I mostly only play on German routes). It's beautiful and there are no bugs. Personally I liked it. What you can't say about the Talent train - the problem with the PZB backlighting and the Sounds WHICH WERE FULLY TAKEN FROM TALENT 2.  Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V. It's a direct shame for DTG (but I guess it's not the first time they've done it).
Also I really liked Vectron - it seems to be the first time in all 4 games when they got a normal locomotive with NORMAL Sounds. It's as if this locomotive was made by another studio, not related to DTG in any way.
If you are a beginner, this is not a bad choice. Even with TSW 3 they have packed the game with all sorts of assistants that will help you get used to it.
I don't want to make any predictions for next year. They will update 3-4 features again and sell it as a complete new game for 60 bucks.",1695856148,1695857976,False,15,0,0.542254090309143066,0,True,False,False

TSW4 is actually exactly what I expected. Three new routes at a good price, plus some technical improvements for the whole game. In particular, I really like the improved HUD. Of course, one can always debate whether an annual re-release of practically the same game really makes sense, but if you enjoy the three routes offered, then you won't be disappointed.

In the future, I would like to see more routes in northern Germany, e.g. Kiel-Lübeck or Hamburg-Hanover, and U-Bahn and S-Bahn services.

TSW4 is a much better game than TSW3. Could this have just been an update? Yes, probably. But the features you get with TSW4 make it worth it. Of course it is not all sunshine and rainbows, my more nuanced thoughts are below. 

I have organized my review in to 
(1) New Features 
(2) Things that are good 
(3) Things that are bad. 
(4) Suggested Changes
(5) Feature Wish List

(1) New Features here or coming soon to TSW4:
1. Free Roam (Here now and wonderful!)
2. Route Editor (Available for free through the epic games store, here now).
3. Better Scenario Planner (Here now but could use improvement, more thoughts below).
4. Better Livery Designer (I will probably never use it but it is here now if you want it).
5. Photo Mode (here now, I may end up using this occasionally, it seems pretty cool).
6. Consist Editor (Coming soon after release, I am very excited for this).

(2) Things that are good, based on what I have used so far.
1. Visually all locos are beautiful
2. DTG seems to be exploring possibilities with making more engaging scenarios (Peak Forrest was a great first step [yes this was 3rd party]).
3. Free roam ads so much fun!
4. Most sounds are good, but some are unfortunately recycled.
5. The soundtrack is beautiful

(3) Things that are bad
1. Scenario planner gives you less freedom to set up a scenario than free roam, but you can save a scenario but not a free roam session. Ugh...
2. The new points system is still slightly buggy. I drove the azuma in timetable mode with full safety systems engaged. I accidentally caused AWS stops twice but that did not show up in the summary and I was not penalized for it in the scoring.
3. Some routes feel very empty because they only shipped with 1 or 2 locos. 
4. There are lots of small bugs. For example the game crashes frequently when setting new paths in free roam.
5. The game sometimes ends unexpectedly. In free roam it is possible to drive off the playable map with no warning.
6. There is no “revert to last checkpoint” after a player passes a signal at danger. This was a good feature that needs to come back especially in freeroam.

(4) Suggested Changes
1. Allow users to set paths and objective lists for AI in free roam, sort of like a live scenario planner.
2. Allow users to set up a scenario in free roam and then save it as a scenario that can be exported to the creators club. It is much more fun to create within free roam than it is to create in the scenario planner menu. 
3. Allow users to initially teleport in free roam to set up locos around the world before starting the session.
4. Add cross-platform global leader boards to scenarios and timetables. There is currently no competitive element to the game.

(5) Feature Wish List
1. Free Roam Multiplayer with voice chat
2. Please add the features to free roam that I suggested in my suggested changes section
3. Hard mode badge available on all scenarios and timetables, forces all HUDs off for the entire drive and scores differently, syncs to a global leader board.
3. VR support.
4. Weekly/daily challenge. Bespoke scenario that all users can try again and again hoping to advance up the leaderboard. They could be silly like (Drive the flying Scotsman as fast as you can from Arosa to Chur without derailing. Or Shunting puzzles that are timed or scored in some way.

Overall I love this game. This update is a massive improvement!

Firstly, the US route - Antelope Valley Line - has some glaring scenery issues. Between Downtown Burbank and Burbank Airport North, the line runs alongside a motorway and a main road. The motorway has incorrect markings near junctions as well as what appears to be a raised pavement on one junction, and the cars on the main road alternate between flying and clipping through the road! This wouldn't be a major issue if it weren't for the fact that this is so clearly visible from the raised cab of the train.
Also on the same route, there's sections of the pedestrian level crossing missing at Downtown Burbank. Further on in the route, the desert region suffers from floating scenery, which isn't just limited to bushes and cacti, but also an entire mountain about 5 miles out of Viencent Grade/Acton!

The Training Centre also has issues, with gaps in the overhead wire.

For the only other new route that I have tried, East Coast Mainline, the pantograph on the Class 801/2 EMU doesn't move up and down along the wire, as it would in real life, and as pantographs on other routes do. This route is also fairly short - it would've been nice to have seen more of the ECML, especially going in to King's Cross. Like a lot of the UK routes, it also feels a bit quiet, as the real ECML has multiple operators running along it, which are not represented in game (presumably due to licensing issues).

All in all, it looks like this could've done with a lot more polishing before release. Perhaps releasing it in early access for a month or two rather than five days would've given DTG enough time to get feedback and fix the bugs, as it seems that their testers missed quite a few things!

I don't like these issues Train Sim World does have after playing about 3 hours:
- Meddling call to register into their rating system.
- Confrontation with multiple data policies, which need to be accepted (""read"") to play the game.
- Scaling of the user interface is wrong and overlapping (language: German).
- The resolution of the monitor is not recognized and has to be set manually.
- You can't set the field of view. The default field of view feels stretched.
- By default, the max. frame rate and vertical synchronization is 62 and disabled.
- Pre-selection to accept live commercials in the game. This is not fine!
- In the tutorials, you aren't guided on a step-by-step basis. It's more a junk of tutorials than guides.
- In the tutorials selection, vehicles with no tutorials are listed (like the DB double-decker control unit).
- Either I missed tutorials on how to interpret signals and behavior on train networks, or they don't exist.

As a train driver, I miss basic 101 topics like brake function tests and correct instructions on how to work with the machines. I did register some malfunctions with the script. For example, the DB BR 146 emergency brake doesn't apply to the train brake lever, the game requires you to do it manually. You have to reset it, next to put down the pantograph and then to put it on, next to set the reverser to null position, and then back to the requested direction. The tutorials teach several times how to operate machines without the top of the travel direction occupied: I could do this once in my job... it would be my last day at work. This is unprofessional behavior, dangerous, and people learn it wrong on the first day. I will not go into any further matters.  That's enough to talk about the simulation part.

The graphics and quality of the game is okay for the price. The quality of the train and scenery models is good, but LOD popping is still visible and the shadow quality and self-shadowing is a graphics standard like mid-2010's. That really pulls all the great stuff down.

You'll see the usual negative reviews from people who still keep buying the game despite professing how terrible it is, how awful DTG are etc etc blah blah blah. This time the groundwork has been done to provide some fundamentals that may not be revolutionary, but do provide the means for things to improve in future (regardless of whether you think certain features should have been there from the first game, or object to paying for them in this one). 

Highlights:
- The photo mode can get quite addictive once you get the hang of it, the depth of field options do allow for some really stunning images, I would almost say that becomes a core part of the gameplay now, you can quite literally just railfan and take nice pictures and nothing else.
- The free roam mode, and its functionality within timetable mode, may need some work, but there is something there. Just being able to spawn in anything you want is quite something considering it's far and away from anything we have had (officially supported) until now in TSW, it's also well implemented and easy to use.
- Scenario Planner functionality is greatly improved, just on a whole it seems much more logical, and being able to add multiple paths for trains is a bit of a gamechanger for creating scenarios, similarly the inclusion of portals to send trains off-map and out of precious platforms (for new routes to TSW4 only though I believe) makes a big difference. And not forgetting actual weather support is a long awaited addition that now makes it much more straightforward to play the scenarios how you want.
- East Coast Mainline. Yes, not exactly the stretch many would have thought of, but it is undeniably fun to drive the Azuma at high speeds up and down, and the flashing greens on this section give a tantalizing glimpse into the scenarios that might be possible if a class 91 is ever added to the game, or made via the editor. It's also very lively once the layers are in.
- Updated New York-Trenton. If you already owned this route from TSW3 then I recommend diving back in to try the new timetable in TSW4, it is definitely worth checking out, the New York Penn end has been transformed with more traffic, and the rest of the line is feeling a bit livelier too.  

The areas for improvements:
- As always, performance seems sketchy, there's the usual stuff that irons out once you've run through the route and built up the cache, frame rate dips etc, but they are much more noticeable this time around. Loading screens also generally seem to be a lot slower. All this said, I've not had any random unreal crashes, which is somewhat miraculous for a new TSW game or big update.
- Scenario planner timings. I had believed I saw somewhere that you could now schedule trains earlier than the player start time, and they would actually be running when you started the scenario, I have not managed to make this happened on ECML yet, so if I am mistaken, it's definitely something they should look to add, or it's a bug that should be fixed.
- Creator's Club. The improvements made are good, but it's still a bit convoluted, I am somehow at my limit of liveries and scenarios and couldn't get rid of them during early access because you cannot unsubscribe from content related to routes not installed. I also still see random liveries showing up in game from CC, which is not great.

Overall it is still just evolution rather than revolution, but undeniably this time they have expanded the features in a way that makes the future more promising, I've yet to use or experience any user-made content from the editor, but considering how much noise people have made about it for the past 3 years, I certainly expect some of them to be able to create some decent mods. Timetable mode remains the jewel in the crown and the main reason this is one of the rest rail sims going.",1695815386,1695815386,True,3,2,0.467865854501724243,0,True,False,False

I'll edit some more to add something closer to my full thoughts: I don't mean to disparage DTG's efforts, or the fact that they need to turn a profit to keep offering games, but... Perhaps it'd be better to put that effort into making incremental additions to a product than to ""hey, we're re-releasing the entire game and increasing the number"". Many things in the tutorials are kept so stale that they still say ""Welcome to Train Sim World 2"", a complaint inherited from TSW3. Things are pretty broken, it's easy to fall from the scenario thru the ground, or go out of bounds (hey, true free roam mode!), the locos could be more immersive (seriously, give us interactive engine compartments and fewer dummy switches), yadda yadda. These are not new complaints. Unreal Engine keeps wetting the bed, same as it ever did. I see the crash reporter more often than I can finish playing a scenario. Some things are pretty interesting, did you know the cars have a ""realistic"" car underbody texture applied to their bottom sides? Guess how I found that out. It sometimes feels like little QA testing was done, so easy it is to break the game.

It looks good, and it seems nice when it works. Unfortunately it crashes about as much as TSW3 did when I first got it. I wish I could say I'm having a good time playing it. When it stops eating 3x the amount of CPU TSW3 did, and no longer overheats my computer or crashes every 20 minutes I'll heartily recommend it.",1695788819,1695796907,False,65,1,0.747045338153839111,0,True,False,False

To be frank if it was not for the suspension(not released yet.........) and free roam in timetable additions i would have skipped this release.

With that out of the way what does it still do wrong. 

- Lighting - overall the TOD4 system is an improvement however eye adaptation still requires tuning. 
- Lighting - The loco Cabs still do not occlude area/global light sources meaning there constantly over exposed. 
- Weather - no real time weather options and the dynamic function is anything but with a constant 99% chance that it will rain.. for me its 100% never once have i had a run where it does not go from clear sky to thunderstorms... stupid
- Sounds - still a mixed bag and still no train announcements from PIS or CIS

What it does well: 

- suspension physics update, while only playable in training centre on one unit right now this improvement is long overdue and will go along way to improve immersion and i for one am looking forward to its further roll-out ... assuming it makes it into TSW4....
- Free-roam in timetable mode is worth the price of TSW4 on its own, it really is a blast to be able to just spawn what you want drive it where you want and still have AI traffic rolling around the lines this feature is undersold big time and is one of the best and biggest gameplay additions DTG have given the franchise since introducing service mode with the original release. 
- using LIDAR data in routes is a massive leap forward and i hope in time they use more accurate data and also use it for more than just distant scenery, Its a solid step in the right direction and lifts the production value and immersion of the routes. 
- new minihud is another step in the right direction, with some tweaks such as a distance to objective option it would be perfection.

Very Disappointing. Do NOT buy (Details below):

Positives:
+Does have a couple of extra routes and trains (basically a small DLCs)
+Has re-introduced the free-roam feature that was removed when Train Simulator was re-branded to ""Train Sim World""

Negatives:
-Otherwise Identical to the previous TSW games, some minor UI changes but nothing significant. Seems like the same engine, same graphics, same bugs, same code, same everything.
-This is priced like a ""new"" Game. In reality it is a small patch + a piece of DLC.
-The ""new"" free roam feature is still less configurable than the original free roam they left behind in ""classic""

Dovetail games:
-Poor interaction with the community in my experience. Certainly don't seem to respect the consumer.
-Advertised TSW2 (2020) like it would be the definitive version to build up DLC. Then did the same thing with TSW3 which released barely over a year ago. Wouldnt surprise me if they announce another ""new"" game called Train Sim World 5 in 6 months.

Train Simulator (Now Trainsim Classic) was a great game but since Train Sim World this has increasingly begun to feel like a con, dovetail keep releasing these ""new"" games so that any new DLC has to essentially be paid for twice.

TSW4 is NOT a new game, it is almost Identical to TSW3. If this were the price of a DLC...maybe worth it but it is certainly not worth £39.99.

Conclusion:
I'm going to be looking to get this refunded and removed from my library.

Too many people don't read the FAQ's or the support pages when they buy the game. Next if you have poor performance, Try turning your settings down.

Florida now has Bright line, another high speed rail that's welcome to the U.S. Lets see some more routes, such as Waycross, Kansas city, or FEC.

Despite using the same game engine as its predecessors TSW2 and TSW3, TSW4 still manages to deliver a captivating and fun experience that will surely appeal to both newcomers and seasoned gamers.

One of the winning aspects of TSW4 has to be the newly introduced free roam mode. This feature allows for unparalleled exploration and flexibility, providing endless hours of discovery and enjoyment. I've spent countless hours simply exploring the intricately detailed environments, each journey offering a unique experience that keeps me coming back for more.

TSW4 continues to tick every box with its diverse selection of trains, routes, and challenges, all rendered with meticulous attention to detail. The immersive gameplay is further enhanced by the dynamic weather system and realistic sound effects, which make each trip feel like a genuine railway journey.

However, the game isn't without its shortcomings. The decision to reuse the same graphics engine means that visually, TSW4 isn't a significant leap forward from its predecessors. While the graphics are still decent, the lack of noticeable improvements may be disappointing to some players who were hoping for a more dramatic visual upgrade.

In the same vein, TSW4 doesn't radically diverge from the gameplay formula of the previous Train Sim World games, which might be a drawback for those seeking a fresh experience. However, I believe that the core gameplay, which the series has perfected over time, remains engaging and enjoyable.

In conclusion, Train Sim World 4 offers a delightful and immersive train simulation experience. Despite its graphical limitations and the familiar gameplay, the addition of new features like the free roam mode ensures that the game remains fresh and engaging. If you are a fan of the series or a train enthusiast looking for a virtual platform to indulge in your passion, Train Sim World 4 is a worthy addition to your collection.",1695748828,1695757518,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The updates that come with this are very mediocre and DTG oversells as they normally do.

Example the fog is a simple switch here apply this you can ask any unreal technician. Yet over sells it , it looks good but not a major update.

Freeroam , editor which will be very basic was promised years ago so again not a major thing.

The overselling of the pausing of the game to take screenshots should of been in the original tsw.

That's just a few but it's all comes down to the updates are basic and not game changing.

The fps seem to be better and more stable and the mountains on the Austrian route look very good so that's a plus so credit to that .

So the three new routes are ok , the Austrian route definitely the more detailed, the UK route is high speed so in some place it does look bleack and the same goes for the American route which they never seem to get right.

At least the Austrian and UK new routes will have layers to come once the DLCs u own are out as I have the early access deluxe version .

The textures in some of the new trains look very unpolished and low resolution especially the American trains which is now the norm now .

So one of the reasons it's a new game is the fact they can't bring the minor updates over to tsw 3 DLCs yet they have updated a tsw 2 Dresden route that came with rush hour...they say it's for the  train that's a DLC vectron .

This simply shows u they could technically bring these updates to tsw 2 /3 routes ...might take time but they could.

Lucky for me tsw is cheap in my country and affordable hence why I got it but the updates really don't justify a new game and this is simply another cash grab as remember they have not changed the game engine it's still the same as TSW3.

DTG will defend this push to tsw 4 as justified but really it's not the updates are really mediocre and it is a cash grab to get new players back in. 

the routes are either very nice in areas or bare and barren and seems like they rushed it in areas , also passengers are still broken in the moment and spawning 

So overall it's pretty much the same as tsw 3 and I would not recommend u buy at full price but wait for at least 50 percent off , I keep playing as I love trains and as I mentioned before it's cheap in my country.

The main reason for my dislike is first no neutral reviews on steam and second DTG over selling of updates that they could bring to all tsw 3 routes.

There are a few bugs with the new routes and rolling stock which i would expect to be patched asap (incorrect coach letters on the 801 along with diesel engines running with AI trains on electric etc, etc).

That was my main criticism for the last two releases and it is for this as well. It aggravates a lot of people and there is no need for it. I really don't know why they invite this annoyance each year but it could be to do with the first x amount of money from a new Unreal Engine release being royalty free.

Its a bit of a lottery if you are interested in the routes you are forced to buy to continue to get updates for the game and although I have no real interest in the ones here they are good from what I have played so far.

There are the usual lack of graphical settings leading to extremely late loading of shadows and assets even on a powerful machine and the occasional stuttering where I assume assets are streaming in sub optimally. I always find this strange given you are literally on rails and the next things to load are very much known.

A throwback to the TSW3 launch is that all previously purchased content is still missing from 4 at this point. 

By far the biggest seller of this release for me though is the free roam mode where you can place trains and set routes in real time. Its basically the one thing I have always wanted. Before it felt like you had all this potential but were horribly restricted in what you can do.

That update alone is what made me push the button and it adds a lot of gameplay value for me.

The Flying Scotsman is also a great addition.",1695749609,1695750336,True,47,11,0.593148946762084961,0,True,False,False

The Flying Scotsman more than makes up for the SoCal route. They could add needles, opened Amazon packages and random homeless flipping switches to derail trains. On a serious note though, I haven't had any crashes and runs good on my old machine if I don't get too greedy.

First, let's give credit where it's due. The attention to detail in Train Sim World 4 is so impressive it'll make your mustache curl like a classic villain. The trains are so meticulously designed; they practically scream, ""I'm a locomotive, and I'm fabulous!"" And the sounds? Oh, they're music to my (train) ears! It's like Tchaikovsky conducting a symphony of railway noises.

But wait, there's more! The announcements at the train station are a hoot. You'd think the station announcer is secretly auditioning for an Oscar with their dramatic flair. And that clunky noise between the wagons on the old trains? Well, it's like the train's way of saying, ""We're not getting any younger, folks!""

Now, let's address the big question. Is Train Sim World 4 the crème de la crème of train simulators? Well, I hate to break it to you, but it's not the king of the rail. SimRail - The Railway Simulator is like the train simulator version of James Bond – sleek, sophisticated, and it nails the train details and sounds. Those train sounds are so good; they could give a rock concert a run for its money.
So, Train Sim World 4 doesn't have live traffic dispatchers and online multiplayer? Well, that's like ordering a locomotive with no wheels – it just won't chug along as expected. Meanwhile, SimRail - The Railway Simulator pulls a ""surprise party"" move by offering these exciting features.
So, should you throw your hard-earned money at Train Sim World 4? If you're a train aficionado like me, the answer is a resounding YES! The graphics are so sharp; you could cut your ticket with them. The train details are spot-on, and those sounds? They're more satisfying than a perfectly toasted marshmallow.

But here's a thought for 2023 – why can't we have a full route from Edinburgh to London? I mean, in the flight simulator, they can soar across the globe! Is it because they expect us to mortgage our houses for a full train route? I'm not mad; I'm just ""wandering."" (See what I did there?)

In the end, fear not, my fellow railroaders, for Train Sim World 5 is likely on the horizon. Just like the conductor who never misses a stop, you'll be buying it faster than you can say, ""All aboard!""
