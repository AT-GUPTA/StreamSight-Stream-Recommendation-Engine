I like that they've added Malroth to help with fighting monsters and removed starving to death as a mechanic, I don't enjoy that level of tension in my building games -might have been nice to have those things as toggleable options for people who'd enjoy more of that sort of a challenge, but it suits me as it is.

My only real criticism is sometimes the dialogue goes on forever and you have to page through each line, you can't skip the whole conversation, and a lot of it is stuff i'd rather have skipped.

I played the demo, bought the game the second I hit the end of it (something like 14 hours in), and never looked back. 

There are many annoying little things in the game, particularly with the placement of items like blocks that need to be oriented in a certain direction and sometimes having trouble getting a room to register to complete a quest, but none of that dampens the joy from building something and having villagers come rushing over to clap and cheer and shower me with hearts. The game is so cute, and so satisfying. If you like being able to build on your own and concoct your own creations, you can do that (though it can be a bit restricted during the story line parts of the game). If you're like me and you like the idea of creating your own designs but then realize you have zero architectural skills, then you can still get the enormous satisfaction of completing a big blueprint that is laid out for you by the story. 

You get to build grand structures, go on grand adventures, and build up a grand community on your island. The game has enough town building mechanics that you really feel like what you're doing and building makes a difference and you feel like you are truly effecting the world around you and also benefiting in a reciprocal nature for being engaged with it. And the writing is really good for a game like this! I found myself laughing many, many times at some goofy NPC dialogue that was actually meant to be funny, and there is a late-game interpersonal conflict and little mystery that I found myself genuinely emotionally invested in. Usually in games like these I'm just trying to get past dialogue to get to the next thing but I read every word of this game. There are scenes that are WAY too long, where you can't speed up the dialogue, and those SUCKED, but even then the writing wasn't bad it was just the fact that you had no control over the timing. 

My biggest complaint is the tedious combat and the seemingly endless aggro range the enemies have. The combat does not feel dynamic or satisfying at all, there's no strategy, just a bunch of sword swinging. This would be ok if you weren't constantly mobbed by enemies while you're just trying to explore or have some fun fishing. It is a big complaint, but at the same time wasn't enough to ruin my overall enjoyment of the game. 

Late game is really fun. The world opens up and this is where you can really go nuts building your own designs all over your island as you wish, even terraforming the land to your liking. There's loads of optional targets to hit if you are goal/achievement driven, like me. There's even a few small extra islands to explore! Just doing the story line took me about 60 hours, so the fact that I have AT LEAST another 10 hours of fun, optional game play left is incredible. This game is 1000% worth your money.

Khrumbul Dun is the absolute best level, imo. It is the crowning jewel of the game.

Enjoyable if you have a Minecraft itch but also want a storyline and quests (without the need for mods), or want a world that feels more interactive and alive. I love the ability to assign crop specific fields, or assign rooms, or build functioning rooms/buildings. The storage/carry limit is almost a non-issue, which is a lot of fun when you just want to do some building (although it can get a bit cluttered). The aesthetics are pleasing without being overly realistic or too blocky.  

There are a few minor things that keep me from playing this over Minecraft 9 times out of 10: You can't just jump in and play, you have to follow the story and even when you're free to explore, you don't have the ability to acquire all building tools/items as they are locked behind the story progression; while there are various different locations, it's always the same world, there are no different world seeds to try; there is no crop regeneration, meaning that when you harvest a crop it will never drop a seed, and aside from quests/exploration, the only way to obtain more seeds is by killing mobs, which can sometimes be tedious, and brings me to my last minor point; you cannot do a pacifist playthrough.

Building upon the success of its predecessor, this sequel not only retains the core mechanics that made the first game beloved but also introduces a plethora of enhancements and new features. This review evaluates Dragon Quest Builders 2 across key aspects including gameplay mechanics, world and level design, replayability, community and multiplayer aspects, and the balance between building and RPG elements.

1. Gameplay Mechanics
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
The gameplay mechanics of Dragon Quest Builders 2 are refined and intuitive, offering a seamless blend of construction, exploration, and combat. Players are given the freedom to craft vast structures and towns, which directly influence the game's world and how non-player characters (NPCs) interact with the environment. The addition of new building tools and materials enriches the creative process, making building both accessible for newcomers and deeply satisfying for veterans. Combat is straightforward yet engaging, with a variety of weapons and enemies that keep encounters interesting.

2. World and Level Design
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
Dragon Quest Builders 2 features a beautifully crafted world that's a joy to explore. Each island offers unique biomes, resources, and challenges, encouraging exploration and experimentation. The level design smartly integrates building tasks with the storyline, ensuring that construction feels purposeful and directly tied to the game's progression. Environmental puzzles and hidden secrets add depth to the world, rewarding players for venturing off the beaten path.

3. Replayability
Rating: 8/10 - High
With its open-ended gameplay, Dragon Quest Builders 2 boasts high replayability. The main storyline, side quests, and the freedom to build anything imaginable provide ample content to keep players engaged for dozens of hours. The addition of a multiplayer mode further enhances the game's longevity, allowing players to collaborate or share their creations with others. While the main narrative has a definitive end, the sandbox mode offers endless possibilities for creativity.

4. Community and Multiplayer Aspects
Rating: 7/10 - Good
The multiplayer component of Dragon Quest Builders 2 is a welcome addition, allowing up to four players to build and explore together. This fosters a sense of community and collaboration, with players sharing ideas, resources, and building tips. However, the multiplayer experience can sometimes be hampered by connection issues and a lack of more in-depth cooperative features. Despite these drawbacks, the community is active and supportive, with numerous online forums and platforms where players share their magnificent creations.

5. Balance Between Building and RPG Elements
Rating: 8/10 - High
Dragon Quest Builders 2 strikes an impressive balance between its building mechanics and RPG elements. The game ensures that building is not just a side activity but a core part of the gameplay that affects the world and story. Quests often require players to construct specific buildings or items, seamlessly integrating the RPG and building aspects. While the combat system may not be as deep as traditional RPGs, it complements the building experience without overshadowing it.

Overall Rating: 8.8/10 - A must-play for those who enjoy creative freedom coupled with a charming story.

I played this on switch. I played through it three times. I loved it I wish there was a dragon Quest builders 3. I decided to buy this on PC so I can put it on my steam deck and try it and it works fantastically.
It is a more friendly Minecraft with NPCs you can work with. It doesn't feel lonely like Minecraft. But Minecraft is much more expandable. This game should have stayed on the market with DLCs and skins etc they missed their chance to have a huge market share with this game.  it's kind of cute, very relaxing, and the multiplayer is a nice bonus. Survival is very light . You'll have a lot of fun designing specific rooms and watching the NPCs do tasks . The story is incredibly long . If you play the jumbo demo for some reason it does not transfer your save data over on PC . On all the platforms it did .The only complaint I have is that when you are in multiplayer mode you cannot see any of the lesser monsters that your other players see. So you can fight the same boss but you can't see the enemies on the ground. Other than that it's a pretty fantastic game. It is one that I will never forget. It works no problem on steam deck with an Xbox controller. I hope that steam changes the information.

I ended up finding a game that actually combined RPG and sandbox mechanics pretty well. I'd recommend if you're in the mood for a rare spin on the sandbox game formula.

The story looked pretty basic from the start, but it does end up getting interesting towards the middle of the game. It even connects this spin off back to the main DQ franchise, which is pretty funny.
Characters where well written most of the time. The last story island is the worst one, since there's an incredibly forced conflict between you and the other protagonist. 
What I didn't expect was caring so much about the monsters in this game. The monster characters are far and few between (except for the last chapter) but they all where really endearing.

Gameplay side is basic, but solid. There's a hunger system, an HP system. You can put on armor to reduce damage taken and equip sword to take down monsters easily.
The fighting mechanics are a bit weak though. There's special attacks you can do but it really doesn't do anything. You're just better off doing the basic combo over and over again. T least there's a reason to fight monsters, as the miniboss monsters drop special furnitures and even crafting recipes.
When it comes to building, its really just what you expect. However since this game is meant with a controller, there's some nice QoL that allow you to place blocks above, below or in a straight line in front of you at the press of a button. There's also a TON of block variety and furniture.

Having so many blocks is great cause it allows you to build plenty of different rooms. The story will always have you help different villagers by having you build rooms for them. These rooms are defined by their size, how luxurious they are and what must be in them.
The NPCs will change their routine based on what rooms are aviable in their village and if it fits their needs or jobs. They can even help by cooking food, making smelting ores faster and even defend themselves.

Unfortunately, the room system is also really annoying. You can never define what room is what, if it has multiple uses and if the rooms next to it are part of the same building. For example, you can make a bedroom with bathroom attached and either EVERYBODY uses it or nobdy, not even the bedrooms owner will. You also can't combine things like a armory and a training area together, you have to put differenciate them.
You also be careful what furniture you use in the rooms too, since they all rely on certain furniture combos. A lounge can suddenly turn into a library if you put too many bookshelves. Also known as like 5 bookshelves.

And the biggest offender in this whole game... Is the village system. Every story island has a village. NPC lives within a village. They will only use rooms that are inside the villages limits. Where are the village limits you say? No clue! The game never tells you. The only way to tell is if the overworld music starts
This means that sometimes, you'll just end up with a room that is perfect but the villagers refuse to use because its oustide their area by one block. It's infuriating, but at least it doesn't happen on your own island.

Despite all of that, I would still recommend this game. It's a rare take on sandbox games and while its got its annoying moments, its a really interesting playthrough that I didn't expect enjoying so much",1699910178,1699910178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It will cover most of the 1st story island and will end right before the boss fight.

I'm sharing my 1st impressions after completing the tutorial + 2 story Islands.

This game is long, slow paced and relaxing. It might be off putting to some people, while others will have a blast. The main story is 50-70hrs long. Plus a lot of endgame building. 

This is a building game with jrpg elements. It is story driven, and it will constantly give you tasks to complete. You will gain more freedom and building options the more you progress. Max building height is 76 blocks, you can build roofs (Unlike in Dinkum) . The game also has farming, cooking, mining elements, fights. It is quite grindy, and can provide you with tonsss of hours of potential gameplay. 

It's probably the best building game available on steam. Just look at the community screenshots. You can also share screenshots ingame and visit worlds of other players.

I reccomend this game for creative players.

One of the worst thing about this game that I found is the ability to softlock yourself. You can destroy/take items that will be needed for a quest later. I advise to be a bit careful on story Islands.",1699202510,1699456358,True,6,1,0.556614100933074951,0,True,False,False

+The main mechanic of building progression is fun
+The characters for the most part have interesting dialogue
+Figuring out how to make different types of rooms in an interesting kind of puzzle
+Combat is smooth and fulfilling
+Background arcs of certain characters are very interesting instead of just being filler

now for the bad

-The game is missing many mechanics that would make this a proper voxel BUILDING game
-Building many of the large ""main story"" structures is very tedious
-Having all the maps constricted in the way they are makes the game feel very limited sometimes

Essentially i feel like this is more of a RPG with building in it, making the title very misleading,

[b]TL;DR: the post-game is the best bit.[/b] there are likely to be parts of the story you enjoy, and parts you don't, but the real goal of the game is to finish the story entirely, get to the post-game, and play in the sandbox that dbq2 should have been.

if you don't want to read this entire review, scroll down to CHESTS (at the bottom) because that's something you will want to be warned of before you discover it.

the actual gameplay (minecraft-esque building, but with better tools than minecraft gives you; and with real furniture that NPCs will use; and with real NPCs that have a routine) is fun.

there are plenty of reviews that mention the frustrations the story. instead, i'm going to focus on what the game is like when the story is out of the way.

TOOLS and such:

tools don't break and have infinite uses.

your HAMMER has an upgrade to ""ultimallet"", which you have to craft with orichalcum (look in the purple poison water, i mean IN the water, on the appropriate explorer's shore). it has permanent silktouch.

you can break just the block you're targeting, or charge up a 3x3x3 cube smash, or charge up a 5x5x5 cube smash, according to your needs. cube smashes smash UP from your feet: they do not smash the level of the block you are standing on. they smash FORWARDs from you: they do not smash behind you.

a POT which functions the same way as a minecraft bucket in creative mode. you just keep placing or picking up water infinitely. however, ""place"" and ""pick up"" use the same button. ""place"" is hold and ""pick up"" is one click. and it's very easy to accidentally pick up water when you intended to pour more out. never have your pot out if you're not actively pouring or taking water; switch to something else.

the TROWEL has a ""place"" option that will put down a 5-block wide wall that is, for some reason, only 2 blocks high. i have so far never used it, because you can't adjust the size of what it places. i have often wished to use it for ceilings and floors, but it doesn't do those. i keep my trowel in ""swap"" mode always because i find ""place"" useless.

the trowel's main use, ""swap"", allows you to swap blocks in the selected area (no you can't change the size or shape of the selected area) for the selected block in your hotbar. this is 1:1 and requires the block you're swapping to to actually exist. this works on floors or walls, but not both at the same time.

the GLOVES allow you to ""pick up"" an item without putting it in your inventory, like putting a basket on a shopkeeper's head in skyrim. holding something with the glove is the ONLY time you can use r to rotate. this is the only way i use it, for rotating furniture that i can't seem to place as desired.

the CHISEL allows you to alter a block's appearance in one of the following ways:

1) give a block a perfect slope from its top to its bottom, or top-to-bottom around one corner. and ONLY from top to bottom. ceilings, underneath of stairways, cave overhangs etc, you can't slope those. it only slopes the top of the block. which is greatly frustrating, because you also can't place stair or roof blocks upside-down, so the underside of things will always look jagged and out of place compared to the smoother top. for this reason, i haven't found anywhere i actually want to use this slope feature.

2) turn it into a slab. either upper slab or lower slab. vertical slabs aren't an option.

3) add a concave slope across two corners. i haven't found a use for this yet but if you put four blocks in a flat square, then give them all the concave corner treatment, it looks like a tiny roof.

ROOMS:

a fairly vital part of building is creating ""rooms"", which are a core game mechanic. a room has all of the following features:

walls that are a minimum of 2 blocks high, with filled-in corners. (nether portal-style empty diagonals won't count as a finished wall). what the game considers a ""block"" goes above just blocks, and includes most things you might choose to use as a window or fence. sadly, it does not include stairs.

a minimum of 1 door (which must be a specific thing the game considers a door; this is explicit on the item's description)

a floor that may go up from where the game considers the bottom of the room to be (look at the block the door is standing on), but may NOT go down from there.

mobs won't spawn inside rooms, though if a door is currently open they can walk in.

MECHANICAL LIMITATIONS:
in which i complain about stuff that still annoys me

NPCs will use furniture and suchlike whether it is in a room or not. this can be both a good thing and a bad thing, depending on what you're trying to do.

a room is only 2 blocks high. this is a source of much frustration because specific types of rooms have certain requirements, and anything placed above the door doesn't fulfill those requirements. there's nothing to stop you putting stuff above this height for decorative purposes, and NPCs will still use them, but the game won't count them towards the room's contents.

rooms have a maximum size that is, frankly, small. this is another source of frustration.

islands have a maximum number of rooms. that's 100. 100 rooms may exist, as registered by the game, total. after that, you can build what should be a room, and the game just won't count it. i am not yet near this limit, and i'm not sure how likely i am to reach it, but if you want to build an entire city or something, it's going to cause problems.

for creating a certain type of room, sometimes the game will need one very specific variety of a certain class of furniture, sometimes it will take anything in that class. unfortunately, this means some rooms you can't be as creative with as you'd like to.

and now for a fun new limitation i've just discovered, which finally spurred me to write this review:

CHESTS

i just put a chest down and was told ""storage items will no longer function""

and sure enough i can't open it! i can't put anything in this! it's useless!

turns out the game has a (very, very, VERY f u c k i n g small) limit on how many chests you can have.

most room types need chests.

there's no simple in-game option to just place a ""non-functional"" chest purely for meeting a room type requirement.

NPCs need chests in order to do things like farming, which is really annoying to do yourself at a large scale. it's also not really something you can ignore because it's your biggest source of a lot of things.

NPCs need chests to do cooking, and yes you can cook for yourself but NPCs will spend all day cooking and make enough food to feed the entire town for a month. the difference between you cooking for yourself, and nipping into town to take a stack of food out of a chest every so often is insane.

you will rack up a TON of random junk. your inventory is pretty big, but not infinite, and i like to keep mine basically empty because it's absolute hell to navigate. you will put down chests to keep your junk in because you literally cannot do anything else with it.

and you will very easily put down too many chests and the game will just say no more.

so??????

i guess i'm taking all my junk to explorer's shores and abandoning it or something???? i don't even know.

this is just such a huge obstacle and such a huge frustration i don't even know how i'm going to be able to continue playing. and i was having so much fun. i'll figure it out but. what a colossally idiotic thing to put a limit on. what a terrible way to enforce that limit. what a stupid item to require every room to have and then limit how many the player can make use of.",1692654097,1692659485,True,11,1,0.596310853958129883,0,True,False,False

To summarize gameplay, I would call an ""Soft RPG meets Minecraft"". The characters are very likable and easy to get attached to, you can get hundreds upon hundreds of hours of gameplay. For example, I'm nearly at 500 (600 if you could my time in-game on PS4). I've played through the story more than a handful of times, as each playthrough you can build things differently (despite the story being the same). There's a very grand amount of control over the way you play your saves. The achievements have a lot of variation. A chunk you will get playing through the story, some require various levels of completion, and some are grindy as hell. The steam version includes all the DLC too which is very nice.

The battle portions are relatively easy and limited (think Minecraft but with more story), but they are there and there are some very difficult optional ones. 

The game does only give you three save slots. However, if you're tech-savy you can just move the saves out of the folder (at least on windows) allowing you to have more than three. 

It is relatively bug-free. The NPC AI pathing can be shitty though on muti-layer builds. A while back there was a major game-breaking bug but they have since patched that. 

I can't speak much for the online mode. I do believe that you can only play online with others who are at the same story progression as you, but that's pretty much all I know. Feel free to correct.

Overall, if you like to: build stuff, have story based gameplay and goals, and meet a cast of amazing characters, I'd recommend a million times over. Maybe even a billion.

Side note:
Malroth is freaking amazing, quite literally the best video game character. :)",1617031209,1688095989,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It all started on my trusty Nintendo Switch, but then I just had to take it up a notch and jump into the Steam version, especially with the Steam Deck on the horizon. Let me tell you, it's been one heck of a delightful ride, no matter which platform I'm on!

When I first picked up Dragon Quest Builders 2 on my Switch, it was like magic in my hands. I could build, explore, and create wherever I pleased. It was perfect for those moments when I wanted to craft magnificent structures during a long train ride or get lost in captivating landscapes while chilling at home. The portability of the Switch gave me the freedom to immerse myself in this charming universe whenever and wherever the mood struck.

But you know how it goes, right? The allure of the Steam Deck was too strong to resist. So, I decided to continue my building adventure on the Steam version of Dragon Quest Builders 2. And boy, was it a smooth transition! The game performed like a champ on the Steam Deck, and I couldn't be happier. The graphics looked even more stunning, the gameplay was super smooth, and the convenience of the Steam platform made everything feel right at home.

Playing Dragon Quest Builders 2 on the Steam Deck just felt natural. The bigger screen brought the vibrant world to life in all its glory, and the Steam Deck's beefed-up power ensured a seamless and immersive experience. Plus, let's not forget how comfy it was to hold and play for extended building sessions. My creativity knew no bounds with those ergonomic controls!

No matter the platform, one thing remained consistent throughout my adventure: the game's ability to unleash my creative spirit. Whether I was crafting epic gardens, designing towering masterpieces, or reshaping the world to match my wildest imaginings, the freedom to express myself and see the tangible results of my creativity was an absolute blast.

Dragon Quest Builders 2's captivating story, lovable characters, and vibrant world continued to shine brightly on the Steam Deck. The transition between platforms didn't dull the game's enchantment; if anything, it breathed new life into my adventures, solidifying its lasting appeal.

So, whether you're building on the go with your Nintendo Switch or getting fully immersed in the Steam version, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is a whimsical journey that invites you to let loose your imagination, construct amazing structures, and lose yourself in a world of creative wonder.

I don't mean to say the first games of the series are terrible by any stretch, but there are certain mechanics in DQB I that would not make the game shine as brightly as DQB II, especially when it comes to one unsettling theme behind the game's cute and cheerful exterior: existential horror.

I do not want to spoil the game outright, but for veterans of the series who have played the original Erdrick Trilogy, Malroth was the last boss of DQ II, and suddenly you're teamed up with a brawler named Malroth. You both travel from Island to Island, visiting the Isle of Awakening (central hub), Furrowfield, Krumble-Dun, and Moonbroke, rebuilding the splendor of the Isles and driving back the Children of Hargon along the way. Someone seems to have a vested interest in Malroth, who hears ""voices"" that torment him from time to time, which leads to the thrilling conclusion of the game, complete with post-game content.

Think of Minecraft meeting Dragon Quest, complete with Explorer's Isles where you can not only survey the islands for infinite resources of various materials (wood, stone, oil, minerals, etc), but also tame various monsters, INCLUDING GOLEMS! As a man who has played Dragon Quest since 1989 (back when it was Dragon Warrior), being able to tame a Golem, and use it to SMASH THE ENVIRONMENT APART is absolutely amazing, and I love the premise. Should you smash the environment apart though...

Visually the game is fine on its own with decent graphics, and fans of the overall series will likely feel a dopamine burst of hearing various musical motifs from the main series. The controls are superb and well-mapped, regardless of whichever control scheme you use, there's really only one complaint I have: sifting through the different categories when it comes to building on the Isle of Awakening. Worse, while crafting at a station, the game is not paused, so enemies will have a chance to take a whack at you and disrupt your crafting process, and the categories will grow enormous. I do wish there was a means of making the categories easier to sift through (and remember, but my short-term memory is admittedly terrible), so in that sole regard alone, I strike off one point from the overall score, giving this a solid 9/10. Does it make the game any less fun though?

Absolutely not. Gamers who enjoy crafting and building things will appreciate the game, and while the difficulty is certainly not sky-high, it does get nail-bitingly frustrating at just the right times (especially in Moonbroke at first, jeez), and the game will leave you coming back for more.

[i]Dragon Quest Builders 2[/i] is a (sort of) sandbox game set in the world of the Dragon Quest RPG franchise.  You may have to like both the RPG and sandbox/builder genres fairly well in order to enjoy the game.

Come at it from the RPG side, and you may find all the quests for resource harvesting and building get in the way of a moving, twisty storyline.  Come for the building, and you could find that said story is 100+ hours of tutorial before fully releasing you to build.


You start with a prologue that serves as a tutorial showing you the basics of harvesting resources, crafting, and placing items.  In the process, it also gives you a hammer to smash stuff up, gloves to more delicately pick up items, and a melee weapon for fighting.

Past the title credits, you find yourself on the Isle of Awakening.  As you explore, you encounter a young man who will become your constant companion.  I am not naming him because, once you meet him, you will have all you need to guess his character arc.

You new friend's strength is, well, his strength.  He will become something of a bodyguard helping to fend off the monsters while you go build or gather items, and will level up alongside you.

Lulu, another new friend, teaches you some more basic concepts, such as how to set up a room that the game will recognize, sleeping (which you don't need other than to heal a bit faster), and cooking.

The game has a mild and forgiving hunger mechanic.  If your fullness rating gets down to 0%, the only penalties are a lack of natural HP healing and the inability to perform special moves, such as sprinting or some big bashes with your trusty hammer.

All food helps you regain both a little fullness and some HP.  Cooking food makes it tastier  and more effective.  Some cooked food also give a buff.

You are then beckoned over to a nearby mountaintop temple, where a ghostly hermit introduces one final major mechanic, the blueprint.

At key moments in the game, you are asked to come up with a blueprint, almost always in a fixed location.  This blueprint, once placed, will have a handy list of what's needed and a nifty 3D view with missing pieces flagged in red.  You can even scroll down, item by item, to see all the places a certain item needs to be.


You then engage in a broad rhythm.  Three major story chapters are set on each of three large islands.  As you solve the residents' problems, you will gain new resources and recipes, win their hearts, and at the end, be able to recruit most of them for the Isle of Awakening.

As you do stuff for the residents, they drop gratitude points in the form of hearts.  A Builder's Bell remains in each community.  Once you have enough gratitude points, you can ring the bell to upgrade the base.  This gets the residents to become more enthused in their work and attracts new residents.  You also gain new recipes.

Subchapters of these island stories are cast as missions with large tasks listed.  These missions will frustrate those who like to concentrate on one thing at a time, as you will be sent back and forth between quest chains.  Some of this is designed to buy time for residents to do stuff for you.  But some resources and especially recipes to finish something are often tied to another quest chain.

The mining community has this BAD.  Builds require different metals, but you have to help the miners find a good dig site for the metal ore, and haven't found all the ores you need when you first are given a build.  And the game keeps you from getting one final key crafting recipe for the mining build until you finish the other quest lines.


Occasionally, a mob of monsters might attack the base.  At first, they're not much worse than the ones you may find on the island.  But later, your friend will feel an attack is imminent, allowing you to prepare for an assault of several waves of minibosses.

Some residents will gain a fighting spirit and join in.  You can craft weapons for them, too.

Near the end of an island chapter, you will have a megaproject to build.  Fortunately, this is broken down into three or four stages, and by this time, your residents are inspired to help you build and even provide most of the materials.

The finished megaproject inevitably brings on a boss battle, of course.  Your new friends will fight decently well, but you will be asked to do something in battle to make the boss more vulnerable.

If you fall in battle during any other time than these waves, you simply wake up back at base.  But if you fall in battle during the miniboss waves or boss battles, the game reverts to before the battle started, allowing you a chance to prepare better.


There is still a bit to do even after you slay the boss and recruit folks to the Isle of Awakening.

Scattered over the quest islands are ten puzzle shrines per island.  These puzzles ask you to place or swap out blocks/items, mostly to match a pattern on one side.  The puzzles reward you with mini medals.  You can redeem them at the hermit for cosmetic things, such as accessories to dress up your avatar or music to play.


Once you end a quest island chapter, you take your new recruits back to the Isle of Awakening.  Only after you help them with a few quests on the Isle will you be sent back to the next quest island.

Each of the three story islands gets a corresponding section on the Isle of Awakening.  These sections have a tablet that will lay out the broad mission to build up the section.  Completing these mission targets as well as optional ones earn you more medals and a couple useful items.


Quests and the stuff you build on the Isle of Awakening earn gratitude points, but instead of leveling up a base, these points can be spent to unlock recipes or routes to Explorer's Shores islands.

The Explorer's Shores are procedurally generated islands with different sets of resources to find.  Anything you can harvest on the quest islands, as well as some new resources, can be found here.  Each time you visit, a new island is generated, but the resources found stay consistent.  Thus, you have essentially an infinite supply of whatever you desire.


Dragon Quest Builders 2 is HEAVY with two annoyances common to RPGs.  The first is that it is very talky with lots of dialogue.  However, it is often difficult to skim or speed-read through the text because about the vast majority of the NPCs have some sort of accent or speech impediment rendered in text.

The other annoyance is that it Does. Not. Want. To. End.

The third story island is bad enough, as you are assaulted by several official, named bosses and their respective armies.  But, once you finish that island's section of the Isle of Awakening and do one more little build task for the hermit, you are thrust into ... a fourth story chapter.

Yeah, far too much RPG gets in the way of the building.  It's not nearly so bad if you've come for the RPG, as quests are intimately tied to the building.

On the building side, a major annoyance is that the game considers only a tiny swath of land to be part of the ""town.""  Residents won't use anything outside this swath, although they can congratulate you for buildings nearby.  This doesn't matter too much, except for a few key items that HAVE to be in the swath.  Fortunately, you can build up or down.


Graphics are if Dragon Quest and Minecraft had a baby, with the kid strongly favoring the far more handsome Dragon Quest.  The only boxy graphics are the wall and stone blocks you can place.  No natural slopes, although stairs function as ramps you can run up without the need to jump.


Once you finally finish the main story, you're either going to immediately lose interest, attempt to finish the tablet targets and achievements, or seriously dive into to the real building you've been dying to do.  Even if you quickly drop the game then, you still had over 100 hours of adventure and building.",1682296965,1682296965,True,2,0,0.527919232845306396,1,True,False,False

I haven't written a review before so bare with me 
I started gaming when i was a young boy ( im in my 30s now)
throughout the years, many titles, and genres have come and go through the trends.
I actually have closer to 1000 hours between playing Dragon Quest 2 originally on Xbox. 
That being said, i had to get this game for PC as well. It is just that good.

I was never much into Minecraft, nor did i ever really see an appeal to minecraft. Don't ask me why, i've always enjoyed games with a indepth crafting system, and flexibility to ""do as you want"" so to speak. 
That being said, this game hooked me, I found it at first as a monthly free game from Xbox Gold  i enjoyed it so much, i had to make the actual purchase.  

If you have an innovative and creative mind, and love to create your own masterpieces. 
Weather it be your own town, a sculpture, a giant pirate ship, or even pixel art. This game has got you covered, and surprisingly well graphics to go with it. With many styles to choose from, weather you're looking for a rustic western theme to follow, a medieval castle style, or even a modern style villa, theres much to work with. 

I admit, the story, which is more like a giant tutorial (as you travel between the main 3 islands, leaning about building, crafting, and combat, and can be pretty lengthy to reach a point where you have entire flexibility to create everything you want.  That being said the story is charming, cute, and humorous. You'll find yourself chuckling at a lot of the witty banter they have among the characters. 

The immersion is nice, it isn't difficult for me to connect to my character, however i feel i connect on a different level than the average game would. I connect to my character more on an original character of my own design. Since i mostly create citites and towns, it's like being my own mayor and running things, versus connecting with any character building through the story. I honestly felt more connection with Malroth and other Characters than the ""Hero Builder"" you play. Even between the story sections, when you have opportunites to build and relax, you have tasks you can complete for ""Mini Medals"" within the game to unlock cool accessories and tools!

The soundtrack is simple and sweet, with musical cues to clue you in to battles, or leaving town borders. It helps adjust the mood when shifting from building mode to combat mode. The overall soundtrack when simply building is peaceful, and relaxing. If youre the kind of person who likes to listen to chill background music while you read, write. craft etc. It adds a nice touch. That being said, its not some musical masterpiece, so if you rather just mute the BGM and jam to your own tunes while throwing down blocks, you;re not missing anything crazy. 

Tools,  the tool system in the game is actually pretty amazing, A hammer, magic lifting gloves, a trowel, bottomless pot of water,  a magic pencil, and other items, all with their own unique functions. Offering simplified approached to bigger projects. For example, the trowel makes it easy to replace a large section of blocks with another type of block instantly, or throw down multiple blocks at a time even!

The online community i can't tell you to much about, other than inbetween load screens, you can view entrances of other peoples creations, and they host contests for themes you can compete in. I don't know much about it, if there are prizes, or not.  I do know you can visit other peoples islands, and help them build and explore together. So there is a way to show off all you creations among your friends!

Overall, i give this game a solid 9/10
Everyone has their own quirks when it comes to video games, and I give it this rating due to  the games replayability, its charming art style, its witty dialogue, large crafting system, very small game file size, and a very reasonable price.

The game feels like somewhere midway Animal Crossing and Minecraft in its structure. There's a story mode that is inspired by Dragon Quest II, but that can be understood without having played any mainline Dragon Quest game. The game focuses on building architecture/interiors. There's some farming but that is minimal, especially towards late game. Speaking of late game, building becomes easier once the buildnoculars are obtained and in combination with the blueprints, it's more powerful to create than Minecraft's vanilla creative mode.

I definitely recommend this game for people who like building games, but want a simplified experience compared to Minecraft. I also recommend it to people who like just doing quests, reaching targets and such.

A few minor flaws:
* Some unskippable text.
* A large choice of music, but still somewhat repetitive. And especially only recycled music from mainline DQ games, i.e. no original titles.
* Sometimes missions are not well explained. There's little clues to what constitutes a correct room/set. Getting minor details wrong can have you scratching your head for hours as to what's amiss.

[u]Pros:[/u]
-Tutorial was amusing and actually fun
-Lots of choices in materials and items for building, more unlocking as you progress through the story
-Items can be dyed
-You can glamour over your gear with a mirror
-Interesting/amusing characters
-Grid placement makes it easy to see where you're building, pick up & move pieces, and rotate them
-The story consists of unlocking new things as you go between the Island of Awakening and other islands for either mini-plot/supplies or more for the story
-First island does a great job of teaching you how things work and what certain items are, via villager requests, without feeling too hand-holdy or tutorial-like
-You can put all quests on an almost infinite pause if you want to just do some building
-As things progress, you can smash/move more and more types of blocks
-Character customization is pretty good, though you're pretty much stuck with one hairstyle (plus any wigs)
-The sky's the limit on what you can make...that, and needing to unlock building blocks
-The puzzles for the coins scattered around the story island are super easy (though the ones in the desert are a bit more challenging, they're still fun)

[u]Cons:[/u]
-Malroth, I'm not trying to talk to you, I'm trying to use the crafting table you're standing on top of!
Unfortunately, you can't tell him to stay put somewhere, which makes early game building a bit frustrating since he's always following you.

-Monsters are attacking the base!  
I really wish you could turn this off, because if you try to do any work around your town (on a story island or even on your main island), this will happen at least twice per in-game day.  Every time it happens, I groan because I have to stop what I'm doing and rush over to help these hapless NPCs kill the monsters before they do too much damage...especially if you can only craft wooden items to keep them out.  You then have to spend time repairing any damage the monsters do.

-Early game building can get tedious
There's apparently a ""bird's eye"" function or something like that much later on in the game which makes crafting large buildings easier, but until then you have to jump around to the top of your structures to build a roof.

-Midway railroading
This is more of a warning to undo any glamours you're using when you get to the point in the game where there is a large fight brewing on the Island of Awakening (happens a couple progressions on the island after you complete the desert region).  The game railroads you for a little while, and it doesn't remove your glams; this WILL break your immersion.

-Music
It can get very repetitive, very quickly.  Feels like there are only two or three soundtracks in the game due to that, and I tend to wind up lowering the volume of the music to almost nothing.

-Figuring out Rooms
Post game, you'll be working on tablet targets and free building since the story is done.  Talking to some of the NPCs will tell you how to build certain rooms, but many of the rooms are still unknown in-game and you'll have to look it up out of the game...same with many cooking recipes.
--The game is also very picky about recognizing known rooms (for example, when I was making a more complex kitchen and tried to use the chest of drawers instead of a community chest so it'd look nicer...nope, had to use the community chest for it to register the room as a kitchen).

-Malroth's little ""voice in his head"" text
...stays on the screen for an obscenely long time.  
During the story, a strange voice will speak to Malroth shown as text on the screen in a cutscene-like way (rather than the usual dialogue boxes).  This text cannot be fast-forwarded through by pressing a button (unlike dialogue boxes) and stays on the screen so long that I started to call out each individual alphabet letter in the words when I was done reading it...and I'd typically get to the end.
For people who read at fast speeds, or tend to skim that sort of stuff, you might want to get up and get a drink of water or something during those segments.

--

All in all, this is a fun and amazing game which has caused me to lose track of time almost every time I play it due to getting so focused on a goal; whether it's a villager quest or a build I want to do.  I'd even go so far as to say that this game is worth it even at full price...and I rarely said that about any game which has come out recently.",1679783906,1680887883,True,4,0,0.544827580451965332,0,True,False,False

Everything a sequel should be : the original but better. Better and more pointful sandbox map, better building with more tools, story raids no longer leave your base with permanent damage. As well, more blocks and recipes and better building thanks to tools and abilities! 
I can even mention everything they changed from the first game. Protagonist leveling up independently from the base, removing durability from tools, and having colonists participate in projects.

The problems that I had with the original DQ Builders on the PS4 were tweaked and fixed.  I can easily sit back and build to my heart's content and the story mode is really good and a nice nod to the original DQ2 game.

If I had to voice a few complaints about the game:

1.  Combat is kind of mindless.  For the most part, you just slash the enemy and have your companion, Malroth, beat the enemy down, heal when you need to, and rinse and repeat.  It makes sense though, you're a builder, not a fighter.  But unlike the original game, I feel like I have more control of fights and I can hold my own if I have to.  Also, having a companion that is meant to fight is a great addition.  

2.  Too many mountains on the island hub.  It's just a personal preference for me.  This can be easily fixed though by knocking most of it down, but it can be time consuming.  Hint:  Go grab a Golem as soon as you can.

3.  To get the full experience, you really have to like this type of game and have knowledge of the DQ series to really appreciate it.  Even if you're not familiar with DQ2, there's so many references to the series in general that someone unfamiliar with the series will not understand.  While I did not play DQ2 myself, I did play others in the series and knew the overall plot to the game, but I'm sure there were references to DQ2 besides the big plot points that I missed.

4.  There's no Dragon Quest Builders 3.  :(

All in all, can't recommend this game enough.  You can easily sink hundreds of hours into it and let your creative mind flow.  If you're still not sure, there's a demo on Steam that I believe covers the entire first chapter.  Try it out, you won't be disappointed!",1677127159,1677535884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A. Stop reading the reviews and go get the demo. It's the entire first chapter of the game, up until right before the final boss fight, and it can easily be played for hours. You can sink easily over 30 into it if you're a creative person. It also lets you start from where you left off in the demo when you buy the full game.

B. The multiplayer doesn't unlock until after you complete the first chapter of the game, so for anyone buying it to build with friends, consider this. 

C. Ignore the reviews saying it breaks if you don't get the demo first- this was patched I believe. (if I find out it wasn't I'll edit this out)

D. The main story can last a long time and may get in the way of your creativity until you reach the end (the town limits are agonizingly small, and make it difficult to build nice-looking things)

E. You don't need to play the first Dragon Quest Builders- or even be a Dragon Quest fan in general- to enjoy this game. 

F. Be sure to explore a lot, especially on the 2nd chapter's island and the final area. There's plenty of hidden loot that, specifically in the final area, you will not be able to get after you complete it. (Edit: I'll try to make this as spoiler-free as possible. The biggest item you can miss in the final area is a weapon. It'll be inside a pot in the skeleton boat captain's crashed ship. You'll know the area when you see it, as the story leads you there. Be sure to explore the entire ship.)

G. After you play the game for a while, there's a tool you can get to make a blueprint of creations that other people made on their own islands, allowing you to put them on your own island, so don't shy away if you don't think you can build much beyond a two wall high box.

H. The full game comes with all the DLCs included, so you'll have access to even more things than you would on other platforms.

In conclusion, play the demo of this game to see if you'll like it. It's one of my favorites, and I'm sure you will enjoy it too. (Also, don't write it off as a Minecraft clone. It's not.)",1675531748,1675801572,True,3,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The game is very enjoyable for a lot of the same reasons as Minecraft. The main draw of this game besides the ability to build anything you want is the story. It easily has one of the more memorable stories I've played in a game like this. Combat is perhaps oversimplified, but decent.

If you'd like to play this game just for the building and creativity of it, you'll really have to work to earn it. Though there will be plenty of opportunities to flex your creative muscles, you'll mostly be dealing with the plot, fighting off enemies, doing quests, and exploring. You won't get many real chances to build freestyle until after you complete the main story, especially if you want to play in multiplayer. However, that can take quite some time, so that's something to consider.

Overall, I can definitely recommend this game, even if you never player either Dragon Quest or Minecraft before this.

Like animal crossing with combat. You help villagers to build which unlocks items and blocks then fend off enemies that attack. There is light exploring, dungeon crawling ect. Really fun.

The only Dragon Quest game that I finished is 8 and 3 (in that order I know it's weird). It's totally different from that main franchise. But if you like characters that look like they came out of Dragon Quest, then you'll like this. Also most of the items and monsters are just like from the Dragon Quest series. But that's about it, I think. And maybe some parts of the story? I can't say for sure since I only played 8 and 3.

Great story for me. Easy to follow, nothing too fancy but I loved it. It's your typical fantasy story with a touch of goofiness. It can get serious despite the goofy graphics...but very light-hearted for most parts(?).

I like the graphics and the attention to detail on some items. It felt weird since everything is so blocky! I wasn't used to it. But it didn't look cheaply made. It's weird. Weirdly good.

The characters are hit and miss. I believe I don't remember any of the NPCs except for the monsters that befriends you and your buddy that always follow you around and is the main character of the over-arching story. If you like him on the get go, you're gonna like all aspects of this game. I did.

Now I never played Minecraft. I'm sorry. So I can't speak about if this is something similar to that game. I didn't play their first game of the series either so I can't speak about that either.

I enjoyed the building aspects of the game. The part where you have to place certain furniture to have it considered a certain room was kind of mind boggling for me though. I was like ""Why can't this be a bathroom!?"" lol. It does feel linear in that aspect, since they do force you to create it how they like to progress the story, but you can mess with it afterwards! Creative freedom! I would spend hours and hours, it was so much fun....! Just building and building...gotta....stop....

The battling aspect is what I was worried initially cause I suck at action rpgs, I don't know if this is considered something like it. But whenever I finish something like this I can safely say ""If you suck at action RPGs and if you're worried, it's ok! Have no fear! Cause I finished it..!"" If you wanna know how much I suck, I struggled finishing Devil May Cry on Easy difficulty. I couldn't even get through the first level playing on Normal even now. So use that as a scale of the difficulty?

this game is far better than the first, with a backpack to save you from emptying your pockets into chests (and then forgetting whats where). multiple worlds and a main hub you can completely teraform. the villagers are great NPCS! you can have them cook, harvest, sell and even help you build whatever you dream up. do you like what you did in one town and want to bring it over? awesome well grab a blueprint,copy it over and have your villagers build it for you while you focus on a different task. 

i cannot stress how peaceful and tranquil this game can become. i keep coming back to it again and again, always with new ideas on what to build. i personally had no issues, but some people absolutely despise moonbrooke but it became my favorite after i made a spike trap to kill the nonstop enemies.

I had just finished playing Dragon Quest Builders - an impulse buy that turned into a 3-day gaming binge that got me through the whole game. For that first game, I had niggles and annoyances but ultimately enjoyed my time in it. It was okay for a once-through playing spree. 

But it was clear in the DEMO that the sequel blew it straight out of the water. Better in every single way - better art, better combat mechanics, smoother delivery, a plot on a whole different lovable and heart-wrenching level....I am struggling to articulate how incredible it is. It is a hybrid of Dragon Quest nostalgia (including its weird and cheeky humour) and the cathartic building of Minecraft. I cannot stress enough how cute, heart-warming, and big-feeling-filled the story is. 

I have played it start to finish MULTIPLE times, since discovering it. I keep searching in vain for a sequel that will likely never come. I know how massively better it got from 1 to 2, and just imagining how incredible a 3rd would be... I could cry, I want it so bad. Sadly, looking like the Builder games have been shelved by the publishers. So I will play the second one on repeat, spend dozens of hours just building stuff and hunting for treasure and fighting minibosses.

I enjoyed the first Dragon Quest Builders, but this sequel outshines it in every way. It starts off deceptively basic and with characters that may seem more annoying than endearing, but they really start to grow on you, and the story and steady sense of progression kept me intrigued and looking forward to what was next. Each of the story islands is unique and plays out very differently, and the central hub you return to between story islands really helps tie it all together. The best part is how everything manages to feel so alive. Characters will eat, sleep, work, chitchat, etc. If you  build a field, they'll farm. If you build a kitchen, they'll cook. If you build a bathroom, they'll... use it. No, this is not a game for people who hate building in games, but that should hopefully be obvious from the title. If you do enjoy building, though, even just a little, this game has so much to offer. (I would say the building requirements to progress through the story are fairly light, though you are also offered an incredible amount of creative freedom if desired.) Memorable characters, interesting story, loads of crafting recipes to learn, randomized islands to explore and harvest, citizens to gather, rooms that actually serve a functional purpose, farming, fishing, pets, tamable monsters, optional goals that reward increasingly useful building tools... there is SO much content in this game. It took me 65 hours to roll credits, and there are still so many optional goals left for me to complete, islands to unlock, recipes to learn, and building tools to earn and use.

If I had to complain, the combat is very simplistic and a bit clunky (no dodging or blocking), and for whatever reason, there is a certain type of dialog that pops up and pauses the game for an extremely long time, though luckily this does not happen often. Also, there is QUITE A lot of dialog to click through, which may annoy some people. 

Overall, I greatly enjoyed my time with this game, and I'm definitely not done with it yet. Hope to see a Dragon Quest Builders 3 in the future!

Edit: I wrote my original review after rolling credits 65 hours into the game. At 123 hours now, I just completed all the achievements, and there are STILL things left for me to do, not even counting the pure creativity of building all the things I'd like to build now.

My favorite part is the one where if you set up blueprints for the villagers, they actually can build them without you, and seeing it for the first time, especially as it is put before you right as you are showed the biggest blueprint you have seen so far... is certainly something. It has some staying power in your own islands to make building easier after you have done it the first time, especially if for you it is a tremendous task and the townies are a bit more capable at it.

You build stuff out of Minecraft-type blocks. The game recognizes the idea of a ""room,"" which is a space surrounded by walls including a door. Rooms can have purpose, like ""bedroom,"" ""kitchen,"" or ""barn,"" if the room fits the requirements. I.e. a bed, a light, a chair, and a sign gives you ""private bedroom"" belonging to specific villager.

The problem is the rooms aren't really important enough. Yes,  you can make eating and sanitary facilities for your villagers, and your villagers will use them, but they don't really need them. This isn't the Sims. The villagers are perfectly content to starve, sleep in the open, and wallow in their own filth, and it doesn't matter. The only real benefit of proper rooms is you get Gratitude income, which you need to progress the story, but that's about it.

The story requires that you build specific rooms to advance, but you needn't do that again in later villages, or in the post game. It also occasionally requires that you build something according to a blueprint, with every block in a specific space. Blueprinted structures often look nice, but they're less satisfying to build because you must do exactly what the game wants you to build.

Some parts of the game require that you build huge structures, but then the game takes away all the challenge by having the villagers build it for you, and usually supply the materials. Your participation in mega-projects is often just clicking ""OK"" to accept the quest.

There's combat in the game, but it's extremely rudimentary. Mostly it's a matter of wading in and swinging your sword until the enemy is dead. As the game progresses and you get more combat-capable followers, your participation in combat becomes minimal to completely optional.

Still, there's a lot of story stuff to get through. You have four major areas you have to complete, each of which focuses on something different. The first island is all about farming, for example, and the second one is about mining. 

Farming is something that persists through the entire game, since you personally need food now and then even if your villagers don't. Mining, unfortunately, ends with the 2nd island. After that, the game gives you a way of obtaining infinite coal, iron, and silver without exerting any effort or employing any miners.

The post-game is pretty close to being Creative Mode. By that time you've unlocked infinite sources of most materials, so you're just building stuff to look pretty. There are optional goals like ""build this room combination,"" but few reasons to build those combos other than getting the achievements.

I love games about building, but I want the buildings to have a purpose, and be part of a more complex system, where you end up setting yourself all sorts of intermediate goals using the ""village builder"" system to accomplish long term goals. Dragon Quest Builders 2 lacks any of that.",1664397391,1664397391,True,12,0,0.653684258460998535,0,True,False,False

Sometimes you're told exactly what and where to build via a blueprint, but usually a few NPCs ask for particular rooms and it's up to you how to lay them out.  In a couple of instances you have to gather/craft materials and the NPCs do the building, and also sometimes the NPCs supply the materials too (so you just wait, or build what you want).  Between story segments, you return to a hub island divided into three zones, where NPCs walk you through a couple of goals and tablets will suggest other optional targets.  Completing tablet targets unlocks more building tools, though none of them are necessary to complete the story.

NPCs generate gratitude (hearts) as they perform most actions.  In the story sections gratitude levels up your base, unlocking crafting recipes, bringing more residents, and allowing residents to take new actions.  One of the tablet target unlocks is the ability to purchase (most) items you've previously possessed with gratitude.  Essentially, you can choose between gathering resources yourself on the procedurally generated islands, or building stuff the NPCs like on the hub island and purchasing the resources with the generated gratitude.

Midway through the first story segment, your inventory expands to seven pages of sixty items each, practically unlimited for each story segment and quite a lot for the hub island.  Your weapons and tools have unlimited durability.  The only meters you have to manage are your health, which gradually regenerates (and you can rest in a bed anywhere to regenerate quickly), and hunger, which is never a real problem if you don't completely ignore cooking.  It's a low-stress game.

Combat in this game is pretty basic.  You basically slash with your sword while avoiding enemy attacks.  You can charge up for a spin attack, but aside from a couple of swords that specifically boost it, it's too slow to be useful.  Most normal enemies have melee attacks, but a few attack at range or cast spells that do line or area damage.  Minibosses (huge, visible from a distance, and announced as ""super strong enemies"" when encountered) have more interesting, telegraphed attacks.  During one story segment towards the end of the game, NPCs will fight for you, and you get a banner ""weapon"" with a small area buff.  You can take a party of three residents to the procedurally generated islands to fight their minibosses.  Notably, NPCs are generally smart enough to avoid minibosses' telegraphed attacks.  Overall, while combat is a weak point of the game, it's good enough.

There is a lot of text in this game.  It's as verbose as Golden Sun was, complete with pauses to emote.  The writing is... fine.

The game technically runs fine under Proton with shadows turned down.  Vsync is oddly missing from the graphics options, but the tearing is tolerable (or you can force vsync in graphics drivers).  The cap of 60 residents makes the hub island feel very empty if you don't put all the residents in the same zone, but there are sometimes frame drops at mealtimes when the game calculates paths for all residents at once.  The crop and storage limits are low enough that you'll probably hit them if you build out your hub island, but also high enough for what you actually need; you can grow many more crops than your residents can cook and eat, and you don't need to keep all those stacks of 999 blocks.  This is a building game, not an automation game, so accepting low limits to guarantee performance is reasonable.

P.S. If you're going for 100% item completion, get the Thunderbolt Blade in the last story segment, because grinding for it in the post-game is very tedious.  If you're completing all the tablet targets, set up the item shop right away.

[h1]THE GOOD[/h1]
[list]
[*]Overall, the game is significantly better looking than MC, with expertly designed models, less blockiness, and hand-crafted environments.
[*]There's much more of everything ‚Äî more blocks, more enemies, more building tools, more food, more liquids. Every building block has a 45 degree sloped variant, so smooth ramps are possible.
[*]One of Minecraft's greatest flaws, the real-time loading of chunks as they come into view, is conspicuously absent. Even when you're flying at the highest possible speed, terrain smoothly fades into view. NPC behavior is simulated even while you're out of town.
[*]Dropped items are never deleted.
[*]The game revolves around building towns for the NPCs, so the villagers have a greater variety of interactions with the things you build. There are bedrooms, dining halls, chapels, baths, toilets, weightlifting rooms, massage parlors ‚Äî more than 100 types of rooms in all.
[*]DQB2 is much more of a plot-driven game than the open sandbox of MC. In many ways it feels like a mainline Dragon Quest JRPG. This is both a good and bad thing, as we will see...
[/list]

[h1]THE BAD[/h1]
[list]
[*]This is not a game for experienced players ‚Äî there is no challenge whatsoever. Combat involves mashing the attack button until it's time to back off a bit while the enemy spends several seconds telegraphing their upcoming attack. The NPCs do most of the fighting, including an ally who inflicts several times the damage you do. Dying means waking up in town with no penalty. If you get the sidequest armor, it's possible to beat the final boss without moving or healing.
[*]DQB2 holds your hand from the beginning all the way to the end ‚Äî the narrative treats the player like a mentally deficient child playing their very first video game. For instance, a NPC want you to put some beds in a room. They'll tell you to go out and bash cotton plants until you have 10 tufts of cotton. You come back, the NPC lavishes you with praise, and then tells you to take your 10 tufts of cotton to a crafting table and make 3 beds. Once the beds are made, the NPC speaks at length about what a genius you are for making them, then tells you to put the beds down in the room. Completing this last task causes the entire village to come rushing in to admire your handiwork with a shower of hearts and endless dialogue. This pattern goes on for 50+ hours.
[*]A certain character has an internal monologue during every major cutscene. Unlike all other dialogue, the monologue has a unskippable delay of 15 seconds per line of text. It...drags...on...for...so...long...you...will...absolutely...hate...cutscenes...by...the...third...time...it...happens.
[*]For a game about building, the player is given remarkably little freedom. It teases you at the start with an island that's ""your very own to do with as you wish"", but you lack the tools to do anything with it, there's a limited food supply, and most of the island is write-protected until you've completed the story chapters. So, off to complete the lengthy JRPG. The story villages are small...so small you will quickly run out of space if you build anything other than what the NPCs demand in order to move the story along. Also waves of monsters spawn at random and will absolutely demolish everything you've built unless the entire town is encased in a shell of the hardest material you have access to. Building what you want to and without fear of monster grief isn't going to happen until you've finished the story, 50+ hours later.
[*]The dungeons look absolutely gorgeous. However, the gameplay is lacking. More often than not, completing one means running up a staircase, maybe dealing with a simple obstacle or puzzle, and then opening a treasure chest to get the fetch quest item. You'll probably spend more time looting rare blocks than overcoming challenges. Even the final dungeon suffers from this ‚Äî I accidentally fell from the starting point and discovered a shortcut that went straight to the final boss, bypassing all of the floors and hazards in between.
[*]Framerate issues crop up from time to time, typically during sunrise/sunset, weather changes and in areas packed with detailed models.
[*]There are three camera settings: third-person, zoomed-in third-person, and first-person. This is a game best played in third-person, but the camera has an obnoxious habit of automatically switching to the zoomed-in view whenever it bumps into terrain. The first-person view is better suited for building things, but doesn't feel right ‚Äî the controls are significantly stiffer than MC.
[/list]

[h1]THE UGLY[/h1]
[list]
[*]DQB2 does not have anything equivalent to MC's creative mode. Even after suffering through the mediocre JRPG, even after completing lengthy scavenger hunts to unlock a few types of infinite materials, the game is still locked into the equivalent of survival mode. You will always have to deal with hunger and fall damage. You will always have to grind for certain types of materials. You will never be able to simultaneously fly and place blocks.
[*]DQB2 does not have an equivalent to MC's redstone, nor hoppers. Logic and automation are out of the question.
[*]No mod support, nor modding community. What you see is what you get.
[*]Unlike MC, the world is finite. There is one hub island, three story islands that can be revisited, two story islands you are permanently locked out of upon completion, a tiny DLC quest island, and three ""free build"" islands unlocked upon completing the story. Each of these islands has a single climate, and is bordered by an abyssal ocean that spawns an insta-kill enemy if you try swimming in it. Other procedurally generated islands exist, but reset each time you visit them.
[*]The vertical build limit is a mere 99 blocks from bedrock to the highest point.
[*]Each region has hard limits on the number of things it can hold: 60 NPCs, 100 rooms, ~100 containers, 50 fish, etc. Since the hub island is partitioned into three residential areas, this means an average of 20 NPCs (including livestock and pets) per area. It's guaranteed you are going to hit all of these limits before you want to.
[*]Containers and item management sucks. No matter how much physical space a container takes up, it will only hold a maximum of 30 item stacks. The player can paradoxically carry 15 stacks in their hotbar and 420 stacks in their bag. Worst of all, the container limit for each island includes things like plates in dining halls, item stands in shops, toilets in bathrooms and cooking stations in kitchens, meaning you'll run into it long before you would expect to.
[*]The game was designed as a console JRPG, so you can forget about any kind of search feature for finding specific blocks/items in your bag or crafting stations.
[*]A significant number of players have reported save file deletion and other game-breaking bugs. Playing through, I saw a number of scenarios that could have easily softlocked the game if certain actions were taken. Definitely not something you want happening in a linear game of this length. Backup your saves.
[/list]

Overall, Dragon Quest Builders 2 offers a lengthy checklist of mandatory and optional tasks spanning over a hundred hours of gameplay, but lacks anything resembling depth or a genuinely fun experience. Young children might enjoy it, but for everyone else, I would suggest sticking with the original block builder game, Minecraft.

I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes games where you can build and explore. The story is fun and each island has it's own. Then after the game you get to build (almost) to your hearts content. The few downsides this game does have though are the tiny limitations compared to what you think you can do. You get limits on how many rooms you can build, how many of certain items you can place, and the worst limitation is the amount of residents on your main island (Isle Of Awakening), You only get 60 max residents on this island but after you finish the story you get extra islands called Buildertopias, The resident limit might not seem so bad until you take into account the residents you get from each story island and with DLCs that's 2 extra residents which means you could already have half of your limit without even going to the explorer shores and getting more resident and monsters. You also have the animals which you would want to get two of each to breed, And then you have to worry about them breeding on their own further increasing the population (Dogs and cats don't breed on their own). The second downside I have is the speed of the monologue that Malroth goes through, Its super slow and can get quite annoying to wait for it to finish since you can't even skip it. But luckily it does not happen all that often so it is not a major deal. Over all despite the two downsides I see the game is really fun and the story is super easy (When I really dedicated to finishing the story it took me a little over two days). And its super easy to get hooked into the game.

Things like hunger is real, so farming is well-represented, important, and useful. Villages, shrines, and mines need to be rebuilt, soil repurposed for farming, animals to tame, NPC's to recruit, tons of quests and requests to handle...

If your interest in this is due to wanting to play a Minecraft clone. Go play Minecraft.
If your interest in this is due to wanting an action, it basic hack and slash. +1
If your interest in this is due to wanting to play a co-op game. The co-op sux, isn't available until way later in the game, and it is very gimped. Again, go play Minecraft. You need to play the story to unlock all materials. 
If your interest in this is due to the story, ... it's a standard Dragon Quest story. It's not going to be a deep, psychological drama about Builder's compulsion to hit every object with their hammer along with their sociopathic best friend. The story itself constantly remarks on how Builder is a bit of a smiling twit. Some of the NPC's makes you wish this was the Sims and you go leave them in a pool with no ladder, but overall it's grade school level cute.

as you may expected, more things to build, more biomes, larger variety in turns of building choice, and prettier.

the combat is less tedious and annoying as now you have a strong companion. if you dont like combat,
you can craft the highest tier weapons and give them away and you will probably fine

but for cons, 
1.the progression is very linear
2. the selling point, the coop is pretty much doesnt exist, whats more, you you have to play for around 10 hrs solo(for both players) in order to play the (nearly)pointless multiplayer
3. same as DQB1, the handhelding is just ridiculous. the instruction/checkpoint of missions are so clear that sometimes it like you are doing a kindergarten  homework.

There is a huge variety of blocks and items to decorate with, and a few ways to modify the blocks that adds even more possibilities. In particular, I really enjoyed landscaping in this game more than in other building games I've played before - there's so many kinds of plants and rocks to collect and decorate with.

I did enjoy the story, and working with the villagers and their towns wasn't a pain. The only glitch I remembered encountering with the villagers was more silly than anything, and I was eventually able to resolve it. Beyond this, they are pretty stable and self-sufficient. This is the first Dragon Quest game I've played, and though I was unfamiliar with the lore, I didn't feel as if I was missing a ton of context. This is a spin-off game though, so it might depart somewhat from the main series. I originally got the demo version of the game and I was amazed at just how much content you could play on the demo alone. The entirety of the first chapter (Furrowfield) had a lot more than I expected, and because part of the game is managing villages, you can go at your own pace and aren't rushed into advancing the story. In fact, you aren't really on any sort of time limits, and even ""imminent battles"" can be delayed for you to craft loads of things and get fully prepared first.

Just a note with as few spoilers as possible: keep playing past Moonbrooke! Stuff will start to look bad but I promise it gets better in the end. Depending on how the game ended, I wasn't sure if I was going to finish it at first because of being so invested in one of the characters, so I did look up the ending first (and of course finished the main story).",1652893413,1652893413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought the game right after it released back then, and fell in love with the first part, which I think I have played 100 hours+. Dragon Quest Builders 2, as mentioned is a great sequel, and you don't even have to have played the first part to understand the storyline. So far I have been playing this game close to 6 hours and I am planning to get everything this game has to offer for me, which should be taking me about 120+ hours. 

Now the game might look like a minecraft clone at first glance, but it absolutely is not! In Dragon Quest Builders you have a story line and requests from your people to follow, which is what makes the game more appealing as if you were just thrown into the world, like in minecraft. The more you progress into the game, the more ideas for items or building blocks your character gets, which can be crafted with the right materials. 

Very early on in the story you learn, that the whole world has forgotten how to build things. So it is your task as an 'apprentice builder' to save the world from attacking monsters, while building up a friendship with the god of destruction fighting by your side. 

The money has been worth it! I have enjoyed all 6 hours of me playing yet, I just cant play actively right now as I have to learn much for upcoming school tests.

I would recommend that if a third Dragon Quest Builders is made , they should add much more to the game including the building capabilities and the Co-op mode should definitely feel like an open world experience for all players to enjoy the story with their friends and family wherever they are on their journey not so limited , it just ruins the game purpose of enjoying it with others when you're only limited to one island together and not able to really help someone if they would like that.",1652411749,1652411749,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The game holds your hand the entire time, and you're really not going to be challenged by the enemies. However the building portion is absolutely wonderful. You can create quite a lot and the game will continually give you new items and blocks to flesh out your world(s). Other than that... I still haven't beat the game.

This game is set around the time of Dragon quest II. It‚Äôs after the Scions of Erfrick dispel the illusion made by Hargon. In this game you play as a builder. A person who can create things. In this world builders are despised so you have to deal with hostility at the beginning of each island‚Äôs story, but eventually everyone there likes you.

Each island has acts. About three to four acts. Each one having you build something on the island. From a farm, to a bar, to even castle.  In this game you can built almost anything, this game is how I imagined a story mode for Minecraft would be.",1646241026,1646241026,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

100% achievements isn't hard to get other than an annoying one involving cataloging a large number of items. Mostly you'll get them all just by having fun with the game.
The story isn't groundbreaking, but I think it was very well done with a great twist to it, however the ending is pretty generic and feels rushed. However keep in mind, the story is fleshed out enough for it to be a massive improvement from games like Minecraft, giving the world a lot more vitality and a lived-in feeling.

The movement and combat are as basic as you could possibly get and it really needed more work to feel well done. Even though a large part of the story involves combat, it essentially is just left clicking and jumping around.
The building is exactly as you'd expect from a Minecraft-like game, but has more variety in terms of block shapes, textures, etc. At first, building large structures will be very tedious and frankly not fun, so stick to smaller structures if you are impatient (though later in the game, you get a tool to help you build more efficiently, which completely defeats it's purpose since it will be end-game). There are many quality-of-life improvements compared to other games, or even the previous DQB game. 

This game is not without flaws though, and the most irritating will be the limits you encounter. Height is limited, amount of rooms you can build are limited, certain block types are limited, farms you can make are limited, etc. Also, the ""rooms"" you build only register as such if it is within a 2 block height, meaning you cannot make a large room without it registering as 2 different rooms. 
Thankfully though, the devs received feedback from their first game and ACTUALLY listened and incorporated it into DQB2, so there is a good chance if Square Enix ever decides to do another entry, these issues may be fixed.

Once you've cleared the tutorial re-enable your PC firewall. 
You do not need to download and install anything extra to make this game work. If you see anything saying download this to make the game work, ignore it.
After that, make a copy of your save with tutorial cleared and when and if you want to start a new game, copy it into a new slot, but never play on that data. Afterwards you'll never have to disable your firewall unless you delete all of your saves. 
They really need to fix this issue. Because it's the only real problem this game has.
The other issues is it's short and not really worth full price. So I'd advise getting it on one of the many Square Enix sales or waiting for the next Steam sale.

I do not, however, love this game. Before playing it, I had never played a 'builder' type game before (keep this in mind as you read the review and consider my ideas/feelings). It turns out that not even the DQ universe can make me a fan of the genre. I found the experience, ultimately, to be quite boring. 

A majority of the tasks simply amounted, to me, anyway, to chores. ""Build me a kitchen!"" one little girl demands. So I did but I found almost zero enjoyment in doing so. I often times found constructing things somewhat frustrating.

I found searching through my inventory to be quite cumbersome at times. ""Where is the 'Wood floor block?'"" or ""Where did that egg I picked up go?"" I would ask myself, having to peruse through everything like a sort of 'Where's Waldo?' situation. Maybe there is a way to organize things alphabetically. If so, I did not see it. There is a way, of course, to organize your inventory, but I still had a hard time finding things sometimes.

The game also annoyed me at times with its simplicity. For instance, I needed to construct a river. So, the NPCs would say, ""Pour water here!"" So I would. Then, I would have go walk 10 yards to another NPC saying the same thing; ""Pour water here!"" Then, I had to do it two or three more times to fulfill this job's requirements. 

Combat is also quite simplistic. It basically constitutes clicking madly and then moving away when you see your opponent winding back to swing or cast a spell. Given the nature of the game, I do not expect combat to be elaborate, but a defend button to block (you do eventually get a shield) or some sort of spell-system could have added a bit of variety.

Another thing that annoyed me quite a bit was when some faceless 'outside voice' would speak. The line of text would be short; ""Hello, Malroth..."" it would say. However, the text would not advance for 15-20 seconds. I just had to sit there and stare at the text and wait. Then, the next line would come. ""You are growing more powerful..."" and then have to wait another 15-20 seconds. I pressed, I think, all of the buttons, but found not way to advance through the dialogue quickly. 

If you like builder games, then I am sure you will enjoy this game. I never liked Legos as a child and am not particularly creative. I do not enjoy building things for fun (virtually or in the real world), it seems.

The Jumbo Demo is quite long (as the name suggests), so if you are in the fence about buying this game, be sure to play through all of it first before making your decision. I only bought this game because it was on sale and a life-long friend of mine (who also loves the DQ series assured me it was a great game).

The problems so far with the game:
[list]
[*]The poor use of the mouse as your camera control is a small concern. The camera is relatively slow compared to how the DQB1 camera worked using a controller for both the PS4 and the PS Vita. No improvements were made controlling the camera's ability to zoom in/out.
[*]Cinematic dialog has no known way to advance to the next dialog, which is a massive let down. So you could be sitting and reading the dialog 10 times over before it advances to the next dialog. There needs to be an advance to next dialog option, skip dialog option, or provide what key/button advances/skips said dialog. Anyone playing this game can read way faster than the cinematic dialog is moving.
[*]Cooking has no ""queue"" that let's you stack raw food so you don't have to keep coming back to a campfire so many times while you're attempting to build/improve things. This is a let down compared to DQB1's ability to just ""max craft.""
[*]Feeding villagers got more complicated. Minor annoyance to remember to put food on the table. Would have been better to just put it in the chest and let them choose what to eat. (Edit: This might have been fixed, or improvements were made to villagers being able to cook AND check chests for food, or maybe they started looking for food in more than just the kitchen chest for food to eat/cook).
[/list]

Other than the above gripes, the game has improved on many of the mechanics of DQB1.
Some improvements that I've noticed thus far:
[list]
[*]You can now specify how many times you want to build something. This has been a much needed basic function.
[*]Items no longer stack a maximum of 99. They now support triple digit number in one stack. Bags and inventory no longer fill up quickly.
[*]Building and moving objects has been improved. You can now lift objects and move them early in the game when you receive your builders ""Gloves"". This means you can move grassy blocks without them reverting to their ""dirt"" block, without using the ""Hammer of the Builder"" legendary item like DQB1 required or move that fence post that was placed in the wrong spot, without grabbing your hammer to remove it. It does have it's limits so far. Some blocks are ""too heavy"" to move. But it fits well.
[*]You now have a ""tool"" function separate from your weapon function. Making it easy to whack an object, then slash an enemy that decided to pick a fight with you all without swapping your equipment.
[*]Durability seems non-existent. Perhaps it's too early in the game or they removed the durability function completely. Really need a merchant or ""destroy for partial resource return"" for crafted equipment...
[*]Farming has been improved. Irrigation comes from rain or farmers watering crops. Rain will irrigate tilled blocks with no crops planted.
[*]Battle improved. Gain EXP to increase your level, learn new recipes (such as a stone sword at level 4). Your levels increase your HP (maybe a +1 per level? Seeds of Life still greatly useful). Stamina gets increased as well the more you level up (first boost was level 7). They say ""breathing"" get's increased, it's basically your stamina.
[*]Water is no longer as much of an issue, where flooding is concerned. Difficult to master water irrigation techniques early in the game for Sugar Cane farming if you attempt to farm sugar cane before the game has given you the quest and instructions to do so.
[/list]

In the end, I'd still recommend the game for anyone that really loves Dragon Quest Builders or sandbox games in general. If speed playing is your thing and/or you're impatient, don't get this game.

This is a really special game. Kind of like a lovechild of Minecraft and a JRPG.
Obivously, as in a game of this kind, building is the core part of the game. As you go trough the story and the table targets, you unlock special tools, recipies that helps you build incredible stuff.
The kind of stuff it has, is pretty different from Minecraft. There are significantly less mechanical blocks,  but there is much more variety in decorations and types of blocks. So you can really enjoy your creativity.
As you go trough the story, you will build some special buildings, trough the blueprint system, which is a pretty fun thing. 
In multiplayer, you can even copy other players buildings as blueprints to build them yourself, with the help of the NPC-s. Because they help building blueprints, after a certain point in the story.
The combat, well that is just hack and slash with some gimmicks. Nothing extra here. You will have some followers trough the game, NPC-s, monsters, animals both with some special abilities.
The NPC-s will populate your islands, making them feel alive. They will live there, famr, cook, fish and use the buildings you build for them.
The exploration part is fun, though at one point it becomes repetitive. But at that point, you are just building stuff anyway.
[b]10/9[/b]

[b]-- GRAPHICS --[/b]
The game looks nice. And that's all. Nothing extra here. The style it has, pefectly matches the ambience the game, so that is a good point for it.
[b]10/7[/b]

[b]-- SOUNDS --[/b]
Sounds and music are just there. They are not bad, but not extremly good either. Though they match the game perfectly.
[b]10/7[/b]

[b]-- STORY --[/b]
The story of the game is pretty fun. It really worthm it to play it trough.
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- CHARACTERS --[/b]
Characters are good and bad at the same time. They have fun dialogues and personalities, but after their role is over, they do not contribute too much. But still, it is a really great expreience to get to know and love them.
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- WORLD && WORLDBUILDING --[/b]
It is a Dragon Quest game, so it builds on the lore of the franchise. But it gives you enough exposition, to understand the world of the game, even if you never played a Dragon Quest game before.
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- REPLAYABILITY --[/b]
To be honest, the game is not that strong on this front. It can be fun to replay the story, for the unique boss fights, and to interact with the characters (because post-game the do not say anything interesting), but that is it. The real core of the game is the infinite post-game building anyway.
[b]10/2[/b]

[b]-- Is it better than Minecraft? --[/b]
Yes and no. Depends. Depends on what kind of game you want to play.
Thje core is the same, but unlike Minecraft it is very story heavy, it has good village building mechanics, but the game world is limited and there are a lot less mechanical parts. And the multiplayer is a completly different feeling too.

[b]--TL;DR--[/b]
Dragon Quest builders is a pretty great game. I'm pretty sure i will play regularly, because there is always some new idea to build. It really worth a buy.

Dragon Quest Builders 2 came out earlier on consoles back in July 2019 (for the English speaking audience), I purchased it then on the PS4 as it is one of the few Square Enix franchises I still enjoy (dating back to the SNES). Dragon Quest Builders 1 was amazing when it came out, a fresh take on the builder genre and while this is more of the same, it brings with it a lot of quality of life improvements. I rarely double dip for games but I got the Steam version once it was on sale just a few months after release. Since it's now on sale again, I feel compelled to share my experiences with the game.

Is this like Minecraft? Yes and no, it is a sandbox building game and like Minecraft, you craft items at various workbenches. You can place/destroy items and there is a hunger system, it is much more limited in what you can do within the game and there are several constraints in place such as number of chests or rooms you can have in the main building area.  However, DQB2 excels at storytelling with some sprinkle of lite RPG elements such as levelling up and unlocking new gear.

If you are familiar with the story of Dragon Quest II, a lot of parallels run here with Hargon being the main villain but if you are new to the story, the writers have kept this in mind and provided a lot of comprehensive dialogue and backdrop - maybe a bit too much at times but I would expect nothing else from a Dragon Quest game. 

The story lasts around 50 hours going at a leisurely pace, some of that may be attributed to the long pauses for a certain character‚Äôs internal monologue pauses. Not sure why it was never fixed as it takes you out of the game on numerous occasions.

The good thing about the Steam version is that it has all three original DLC included, namely fishing which you can do in any body of liquid for different types of fish.

[b]No Additional PC Features[/b]

Unfortunately, there is no official mod support and the only unofficial one that exists is an ultra-wide mod as of writing. I have not seen any public projects to suggest this will change anytime soon.

As the game is a console port the FPS can be capped at 30 or 60. I know some players have had stuttering issues but on my PC (i5 6600/16GB RAM/GTX 1070), I have had no stutters or crashes on my own islands as of writing this review. Nonetheless, there were some FPS drops on very busy areas with large buildings with complex interiors upon visiting other player islands.

Denuvo DRM was quietly removed recently which will be pleasing to those that avoid it like the plague. I have not mentioned any measurable improvements but perhaps the game loads a little bit faster now.

Keyboard controls are fine however the mouse cursor seems to move really slowly on a Logitech G203 unless I put the DPI down to about 800. Your mileage may vary there. I stick to using a Xbox controller majority of the time and find it far more comfortable.

[b]Online Features[/b]

If you need inspiration or lack a creative mind, the game has a Builder‚Äôs Gallery where you can check out what other players have built and even visit some of them provided you unlocked a specific tool, take a blueprint back to your own island and use that to build your very own copy.

There are bi-weekly themed contests which you can enter and win in-game trophies but the competition is tough and even puzzling when you see off-topic entries or even stolen ones at times.

The multiplayer element of the game is really not on par with similar games. There is no story co-op or split-screen but you can host your island for friends to visit (up to three). They cannot take anything back to their own island including no item trading. It exists in a way where it is only to the benefit of the host but it feels like it was tacked on for the sake of having some form of multiplayer. If you are solely after the online experience, unfortunately this will be a disappointment.

There is a very generously long demo with no time limit which ends just before fighting the first major boss in the game.

Dragon Quest Builders 2 will most likely not have any additional DLC, you are buying the finished product which still represents excellent value for money. Highly recommended.",1593174619,1637778536,True,2,0,0.440392673015594482,0,True,False,False

i thought the art style and charm of the game was pretty cool. i think the building mechanics are super fun and interesting. it's pretty satisfying to make some cool looking cities, forts, homes, etc.
but...
the story is so long...really long. and to be honest super boring. it's so generic and pointless. 
i was hoping it'd be like 20-30 hrs and then i could just have fun using the mechanics i've learned to build what ever i want. like in some sort of end game. or ""do what ever you want mode"" gets unlocked.  
but it never ends. they'll let you loose for a little bit to have fun building stuff, then it drags you back into a bunch of slow unvoiced dialogue that i dont care about. and then it forces you do some boring, long, tedious quest. JUST LET ME MAKE COOL THINGS! i started using cheats like 20 hrs in when it started dragging on. i just wanted to cheat to get through the story faster. im 60 hrs in and i dont know when this story will ever end.

I did encounter a few bugs at first, but either my pc was acting up, or they patched them out. (mostly with NPC pathing issues, especially for cutscenes-they'd just be flash stepping everywhere lmao.)

I will say one thing that's a little disappointing is the lack of inclusion of the DQ2 items, considering this version includes all the DLC. Not game breaking, just sad.

The nature of the writing of games in the Dragon Quest series will definitely be a turn off for some, but if you like puns and accents, perfect game for you! The game also has a decently strong story and great supporting characters, and though it does falter a bit towards the end, I personally don't think it's.... atrocious. 

If you're a DQ fan and you're coming into this expecting the grand JRPG element and turn based combat with different types of moves and spells, you will be disappointed. But if you like this kind of game-survival/crafting/building, I definitely think that's enough to offset  the initial disappointment. 

Another important consideration here is that you really don't NEED to play DQB1 to play this! DQB1 is by no means a bad game, but to me, I'd always recommend this one before that one, for the QOL updates, mechanics, and characters. (and also it isn't [i] officially [/i] on pc so that too ig)

However, the most important part of the game? [b] Malroth [/b]. 100/10 for him alone, I would, [i] and will [/i], literally die for him.

- Lulu (I know, right? This won't say anything to you if you just got the game or are about to get it, but be warned that she's a rather particular character lol)
- A resident limit of overall 60 at Post-Game (Console Restriction afaik)
- 100 Rooms limit (Same)
- Rooms register depending on the door height so maximum 5 height with an Castle Grate not suitable for finer or general rooms except the entrance through a wall. Substracting that the next big thing if I remember correctly is 3 blocks high. So bear that in mind. That means if you have throne room and the throne is elevated it will be 3 blocks high and still register as a throne room as long as the throne and other necessary decoration that make it a throne room are somehow inside this 3 block height parameter. Sounds more complicated than it has to be, but I'm not that good at explaining things :D
- Rooms have a maximum size. If you build a room too big, it won't register. So if your room is overall 2 blocks high and has a door but it still doesn't register, the size is probably the problem. 
- The game has a weird problem with mouses. Can't really explain it but it can be a tad frustrating.
- There's unskippable ""Dialogue"" that can get frustrating because it just annihilates the flow of the game at the time. I have no idea why they did that but I hope they won't do it again :D
- Multiplayer isn't what you think it would be. It unlocks after the first Island. 

I'd say none of the issues are glaring but very inconvenient. If you can look past that, like you should, then get the game and enjoy the heck out of it. It's very well worth the full price and is one - if not the - best building game next to Empyrion.

So, as you can see I have sunk in a little under 170hrs into this game at the time of reviewing. so let's just get this out of the way...

[h1] THIS GAME IS NOT MINECRAFT [/h1]

Now with that out of the way let's plunge into this. Buckle up kiddos, I usually write sorta lengthy reviews. Some with a grain of salt, and some with knowledge as a graduate game developer, and I try to spin some humor into it so it's not about as boring as sitting through AP Calculus with Ben Stein as your teacher. 

[h1] What is DQB2?? Since it's not MINECRAFT??? [/h1]

DQB2 is a Dragon Quest game at it's very core. Dragon Quest is a JRPG series that has existed since the classic Nintendo Entertainment System (Phew, old I know), and it is in some regards just as good as the Final Fantasy series (It's almost like Square makes both those titles...) except Dragon Quest tends to be a bit more on the mature side-- don't get it twisted, this isn't an Adult game series, but the series as a whole does have rather suggestive themes and jokes thrown in. 

So what is DQB2? It's a series based on Dragon Quest's world and lore that revolves around a young builder lost in time so to speak (TRYING NOT TO SPOIL PLOTS... I'M SORRY). The principle plot is that the evil High Priest Hargon has emerged again and has conquered the world, using his servants, ""The Children of Hargon"" to enslave the good townspeople and to brainwash them into thinking that building and creativity is the worst sin possible. You as the young apprentice builder must rise above those lies and remind the townies around the world that building isn't nearly as bad as Hargon's teachings say by showing them through example. In terms of plot and lore, play Dragon Quest 2, this game happens a bit after that time period. 

[h1] So, what makes this game GREAT?? (aka not Minecraft) [/h1]

[list]
    [*] If you are a true DQ fan, you'll love the references and the iconic equipment, spells, and monsters to slay from the main series. 
    [*] True to an RPG, your builder does level up and progress as the game goes on (mostly by killing enemies), leading to more advanced equipment crafting, combat abilities, and ways of breaking blocks. 
    [*] You can in a way gain unlimited materials to build with by doing the Explorer's Islands; basically do a scavenger hunt that won't take but about 10-15 minutes (less if you have a good monster friend) so that you can build truly massive projects. 
    [*] For the graphical art style chosen (cell shading), it looks fantastic. 
    [*] About a dozen UNIQUE monster types to tame (Unique meaning non-reskins or similar in ability), each able to do different jobs you give them. Don't worry about taming monsters in the beginning. You unlock that later (around mid-game). 
    [*] It has NPC's that you will eventually learn to either love with a passion or hate with all your guts. (Looking at you Lulu). The NPC's eventually start to DO something when you show them the true power of building instead of laying around and making Squidward noises. 
[/list]
So those are the good things (pretty much all of them anyway) that don't make this a clone of MInecraft. Now let's go to the Bad Side... and also some on how DQB1 did SOME things better.
[list]
    [*] DQB1 had a better equipment functionality. With more options to customize your character. Granted DQB2 has TONS of stuff to keep up with, DQB1 was more focused as an RPG than a sandbox builder game.
    [*] DQB2 while has a great story, it's really, REALLY straightforward. You'll realize a LOT of the game within about 30 minutes to an hour of playing. DQB1's story is sorta similar but it takes you a second to figure things out.
    [*] For an RPG, you are super limited in customization. There's no particular skill trees to specialize in, and combat, outside of a few bonus abilities you learn from your buddy Malroth, is VERY tame because you don't have the ability to specialize into anything.
    [*] Eventually the mobs start to become complete bullet sponges and the base raids spawn really quickly-- sometimes so quickly you barely have time to build. Even when you have the best equipment for that particular area (Including from elite monster rewards) they still take WAAAY too long to take down. Late into Moonbrooke is where it REALLY starts to get tedious. 
[/list]
That's most of the common negative tripe of the game. Here's some of my personal nitpicks:
[list]
    [*] Post-game feels incredibly empty. No more quests, no more side quests, no more monster attacks on the base, nothing else to really liven it up outside of a few more Explorer's Islands to collect from.
    [*] Your main island can only hold so many NPCs. It's really quite a small population considering you get 3 zones to build in. I wanted to make a giant city, but it would feel so empty without enough life inside.
    [*] The NPC pathing can get really dumb. I remember making a 3 stories tall main castle building for the Cerulean Steppes and the NPC's couldn't quite work out how to get out of the dinning hall I built on the 3rd floor. So they just gathered in one spot and slept in one giant clump on the floor. (This is where I just broke down the prefab and made my own... I implore you to do the same once you reach post-game)
[/list]
So after about a 5-6 minute read, you now know basically everything there is to know about this game. I will probably make a general guide on this game soon so you don't have to scour the internet on very small bits of information. 

[h1] I give this game 8.2/10. It's very good, but not perfect. If you like Minecraft but wished there was a plot, here it is [/h1]",1632859955,1632860097,True,22,3,0.645859658718109131,6,True,False,False

The controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.

Truly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).

My only advices:

- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)

- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!

- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:
When loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.

I am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me.

No one needs to hear how to complete the same task from multiple npcs practically every time you are given a task.

The best part about this game is the building when it actually lets you build without interruption, you are able to start getting really creative and build some fantastic buildings once you get through a bit of the campaign.

If you enjoyed the first game, you'll probably overlook the lack of polish in this edition, but it doesn't advance the formula enough to recommend it to new audiences.
Pros:
+Building is as fun as it was in the first game.
+It's very easy to ignore all of the photo features the game keeps touting to increase its longevity
Cons/Issues:
-On PC, the controls are definitely a miss (the camera zoom is especially problematic). Having to go into first person mode to create blocks under yourself is annoying. You need two button presses to access the map.
-Having 1 save slot per character (+ autosave) that is cleared out whenever you travel between islands smells of console limitations/lazy development.
-There's no quest log, no way to make markers on the map. Maybe the builder will invent a pencil at some point to take notes.
-You still can't bring up room recipes quickly, so if you forget, you'll be scrolling through an unsorted list of rooms to find the one you want. Then there's no way to pin this information to the main screen. This makes building (the good thing) far more annoying than it should be.
-I honestly haven't enjoyed any of the banter/dialogue, and there's SO MUCH of it. All I want to do is explore the island and build stuff, but no, I have to do boring quests for characters, who are often explaining something I figured out two hours ago. As an example, character A asked me to give them 5 of something. The game can't comprehend that you may have picked up 5 of this without another quest from a different character B. So when I return to character A with 73 copies of the thing they way, I can't complete the quest. Other examples include completing quests immediately after receiving them (because even basic exploration will often give you whatever a later quest asks for). It would be nice if they said something like ""well look at that, you've already collected what we needed"", but there's no such payoff.",1623194312,1630117939,False,6,0,0.542824268341064453,0,True,False,False

Sounds strange right? Terraia is 2D minecraft more or less with magic and Minecraft is well Minecraft. But somehow the game reminds me for of Terraria than Minecraft. It wasnt until i went into FPS mode that i felt minecrafts presence at all.

That being said, on its own, this game deserves all its own credit as it is both original and still pays homage and borrows from its own franchise (The main Dragon Quest games, specifically the second one) as well as from a few other sources to make a complete and fun game.

I read the negative reviews and most were from people not being able to get passed the tutorial due to an issue where the game cannot create a save file. After googling many things to try to get it fixed (and trying all of them) nothing worked. I had to request a refund as I am not okay with spending $36 on a game that is quite literally unplayable. Hopefully the developers decide to fix this issue at some point, and then I will give it another go.


Edit: I decided to give it another go. Before re-purchasing the game, I downloaded the Demo this time. I changed the settings in the game to be windowed mode and lowered the resolution from what my previous attempts were. Surprisingly the game finally got passed the tutorial save bug! I am going to re-purchase the game and continue my save, hopefully it has no more issues.

Edit 2: After finally getting to play this game, I am happy to give it a positive review overall. The game itself is extremely fun to play, though it has a very slow build up to being able to do much yourself. It is very story driven, meaning you are limited until you continue the main story. After you ""beat the game"" you are now able to play freely. The story and slow pace is to try and help make sure you learn and know all the mechanics (very hand-holdy). The multiplayer does not unlock for a long time, and, when it does it is very limited. You can go to a friends island or they come to yours, it is limited to YOUR island. None of the other ones you have access to.

I was hoping for a game that would give more purpose and reason behind the building, but the story mode is more like being given a set of strict instructions by the game and the actual space you can build within the towns is quite small, leaving very little room for creativity.

While the Isle of Awakening seems to be the more sandbox-y portion of the game where you could build an expansive town for your villagers, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point to it other than building for the sake of building. I was honestly hoping that the big home base you build would be more relevant. 

It's a real struggle trying to find RPGs that have meaningful town building elements, and this one is honestly close for me, but unfortunately it's just a bit lackluster.

If your a fan of the Dragon Quest games you will love this.  It has a typical Dragon Quest story (which was very entertaining) and you just want to keep playing it more and more.  The building and crafting are amazing for this game and once you beat the game it becomes more of a sandbox style game with building whatever you can think of (i think of the story as more of a very long tutorial to learn everything the game has to offer).

In general, it is pretty fun and time really flies when you are playing it.
However, there are a great many annoyances that I feel do not fit a game meant for building.

(1) NPC keeps following you around and blocking your way
(2) If you try to change the jump key to A (the bottom one if you are not using Xbox Controller) then you cannot sleep on the mat. What gives....I am forced to use the default button so I can sleep. Luckily, it is not a must to sleep in this game.
(3) No cutaway views or roof off view when you are indoors or in a tight area. If you build a 2nd storey, you cannot see what is going on in the 1st storey. This should take example from the Sims.
(4) What is up with the stupid mountains everywhere? Default jump height is only 1 square and it is supremely annoying to have to climb all the mountains.
(5) That shitty camera needs to improve and stop zooming in when I never ask it to.
(6) Needs to support multi saves a bit better so that people can restart the island if they screw up.
(7) Whoever put the Prison island and stealth mission in the middle of the game to stop you from building needs to die. I am stuck there and the goddamn camera zoom is giving me a headache.
(8) I don't want NPCs to force build giant structures on IoA that I need to tear down later. I hate you giant ugly pyramid.

It has a great story with fun levels and a bunch of characters you will fall in love with. The art style is amazing and something I wish I saw more of in games similar.

I have played this on both PS4 and PC and fall in love with it every time. You will spend a lot of time working through the story and your adventure ahead but it's fulfilling.

Now here is my drawback on the game, I was hoping to see a significant improvement from the first installments Multiplayer and I was very let down, not only is it worse but it feels restricting in so many ways to the point it feels like they might as well not have put multiplayer in there. I was hoping for the option to open my own world that had access to all biomes and resources kind of like minecraft, being able to host so your friends could join and create a new world with you, this was not the case!
You must sail with that friend to a new ""Island Biome"" of your choice otherwise you are stuck playing on your story Island with that friend, this is not effective or fun as you have to travel back and forth from your newly created island (being very small in size and only one type of biome) to other islands to collect things from that biome to craft with. This becomes messy and takes a lot of time loading back and forth, then if you have unlocked unlimited resources through the achievements or crafting recipes of any kind regardless of it being on your game your friends do not have the same type of access if the have not unlocked it on their end of the game, this also makes it hard for you to play alongside your friends and build a new world.

Overall the single player portion of the game is amazing and I have had so much fun creating and building, I just wish they had put half as much effort into the multiplayer as they did with the single player for longevity. This would do well as a standalone multiplayer game like minecraft and other similar open world survival games if given the chance, hopefully one day they decide to give it a try.",1611626026,1624306981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd say the worst part is its combat, while its best part is creating stuff/building things for villagers.

It might not be charming to you, but I haven't personally played a dragon quest game in my life I think?(unsure since I may have picked up one when I was pretty young maybe idk)

Character design in general is pretty round and kind of goofy, the trailers probably show that.

In general, the main issue is how long sections go on for. Huge sections of the games where you don't feel like much is happening because the scenery isn't changing, besides having a new place for your townies to appreciate. The fights are a slog, they take a long time. Objectives can't really be completed in any order, causing me to feel like its a really bad grind at times.

At the opposite its satisfying to meet villager demands due to how happy they seem as well as the claps. The  high fiving with malroth is pretty wholesome and the dialogue is good, its just for me personally I was trying to catch up to where someone was most of the time and missed most via mashing. It does have great dialogue and charming side cast/main cast of characters.

The game runs really smooth for me too, and I haven't really had too many bugs actually. The autosave is kind of bad though.

In general, I'd say give it a go. Its a pretty good game with some bad parts. I don't know if I'd recommend playing through ALL of it, although the dialogue was really good for 1/3 of the game or so.(don't know about the rest sadly)",1622867666,1622867666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't know why this is but if you have this problem buy borderless gaming on steam and launch in windowed, force fullscreen in BG, and it fixed for me and ran perfectly otherwise. I also recommend this if you have games with vsync issues. 

I think this is a really neat game.

Technically this is the first Dragon Quest I completed and I really enjoyed it. To the degree I bought all the other games on steam (which is only two spinoffs and one other game, but good start. I think this has really quality to writing despite being Dragon Quest Minecraft. It is very guided through the story mode but I found the story mode enjoyable enough so this wasn't obnoxious. I read the credits and it seems like the creator of Dragon Quest was in a Supervision position for this game and I think based on the writing I can really tell a lot of time was put into the story. It isn't a life changing earth upending plot but it's better than a lot of jrpgs I've played. I think the translation has a lot to do with that, it's very dry British humour and I think it contrasts the tropey jrpg archetypes and setting perfectly. 

Combat isn't great but it does have good forward progression. You're almost always unlocking something or other while working towards goals, be it better equipment for terraforming or new blocks and accessories. Progression feels satisfying and yet, if you don't feel like progressing, there's always something else you can do. I also found the different parts of the story mode added a good amount of gameplay variety and gave me Little King's Story vibes at some points. 

There's basic survival, farming mechanics, town building mechanics, army/trap management and all kinds of little bits and bobs. The building itself is also very satisfying. Outside of linked blocks being obnoxious to make look exactly as you want, you can build a basic room in less than a minute with really intuitive block laying mechanics in first person mode. I think that's one of the strengths but it takes awhile to get a decent amount of things to build and this game doesn't have a ""creative mode"" when you launch it.

Also I think this game is really pretty, and I'm sure assets and designs are shared between this and the main Dragon Quest games but you do end up with a surprising amount of character and enemy variety for what is basically a town builder. 

Some things that bother me: The combat is terribly simplistic. Like actually one button. You can't even really block attacks despite shields being an equippable, so you have to scurry away when an enemy winds up. Even still, there is a decent variety of enemies and a few bosses dotting maps that drop extra goodies so there's enough forward momentum to keep it interesting.

The camera isn't very good. I think it has all of the aspects of a good camera but it can't go through blocks so it will randomly zoom in or out depending on how it gets caught on scenery. Also some advice: If you insist on putting roofing on houses, make the ceilings high so the camera can deal with it. Also the field of view is really bad in first person and ruined a few of my snapshots. Speaking of, the snapshot camera also can't clip, it makes getting many many shots much more difficult than it needs to be, usually my in game screenshots wind up better.

If you want a game that is a bit more structured than minecraft but offers a decent amount of block variety and building freedom I'd pick this up.",1622519851,1622519851,True,12,1,0.63895946741104126,1,True,False,False

It's certainly a standard JRPG model. When they started fawning over a character, I knew immediately what was going to happen. Such an eyeroller for me, but I guess most people wouldn't get the reference nowadays so they treat it as a fresh and new storyline? 

Haven't finished yet but the companion plot shoved down your throat at every turn.... just ugh. Yeah, I get it. Can we get this over with already or are you going to ""impending doom"" me for every chapter? Or maybe it's meant for a really, really young audience who needs this kind of plot device.

I wish there was a way to turn voices off. The times where your character does a fist pump and just goes ""Ahha! Ahyay! Ahha! Ahyay! Ahha! Ahyay!"" I want to stab my eardrums out. I was going to be female but the voice is seriously the most grating in the world.

And you hear it every single moment.

I wish I could say it gets better but the mechanics are awful.

First off, I had to use a community save to get around the game braking load after tutorial bug so my character has been named something dumb for the past 30 hours.

It takes 15-20 hours to unlock multiplayer and I can't wait for when I can get back to the Isle of Awakening to actually ""play"" the building part of the game. 

I like the questing part, I just wish there was more building in between where it wasn't so gatekeepery, making you want to get back to questing to unlock more blocks. If I were making the game, I would have chapters of building in between. It takes so many hours just to get to the game, it's not worth it. I don't regret my purchase, I just wish there were a few things fixed.
The insanely slow talking speed. I have to go make myself a coffee whenever these get triggered. Seriously.
The fact that ""talk to person"" and ""open door"" is the same button makes just trying to walk around and collect your affection painful because your follower stands in the doorway and won't move.

The ""campaign"" which is pretty long until you go fully into ""free mode"" where oyu build whatever is enjoyable and rather easy to do with absic instructions and guides to build stuff.

Also... Check the Daily or weekly pannel whatever it was to see how much better people are than you at building stuff and cry yourself to sleep in your shabby little straw cabin.

There was some negative comments to this review.  Seems some folks didn't understand that this review was not to ""cancel"" this game, but to force the devs to fix the game breaking glitch so that more people could enjoy this fantastic game.  I own this game on console and PC.  I've actually bought this game for myself and a few friends.  I would definitely recommend buying this game!  It is not a typical ""Minecraft clone"" and has all the charm of the main series.  If you enjoy cheeky humor and want a sandbox Minecraft style game, this is a great game and worth even the full price.

Original: I think we should tank this review so that the developers will fix the game breaking glitches this game has.  If you go to the steam discussion boards you'll see tons of people having an issue where the black save screen after the tutorial just keeps cycling, never allowing you access to the full game.  This should not be an issue for a $60 game that almost never goes on sale.

I love building games, I love colony management, and this fills a weird gap between Minecraft and Rimworld for me, minus the questionable ethics of the latter.

However, there is something that people have run across, and I did as well - the Island of Awakening Infinite Loading bug. This is, unfortunately, caused by Steam's cloud-saving feature. For every other game I own, it works fantastically, but for some reason, when it comes to DQB2, it simply stops working as soon as that loading screen pops up.

I've been happily smashing my way through islands since disabling the cloud-saving feature (That plus a couple of other features - Motion Blur is like me with a headache and blurred vision, not fun to look at in my case) so here's my little tips to see if it works for you:

1) Disable cloud-saving. You've got to go into the properties of the game to disable this, so make sure of that.
2) When naming your character, do not, and I QUOTE, DO NOT go above 4 characters. Apparently there's some weird issue with the game refusing to understand longer than 4 character names, so that can coincide with the Infinite Loading too.

Hopefully people can come to enjoy this as much as I have.",1619881851,1619881851,True,5,0,0.589041054248809814,0,True,False,False

This game is kind of hard to recommend. It's very slow, it treats you like a 4-year-old with Downs, and for a franchise with such an established JRPG history the writing is absolutely dreadful. Do I still enjoy it?

[i]Yeah...[/i]

The building part in this is actually fun. There's a ton of different blocks and decoration types, furniture items, yadda yadda. The game [i]looks[/i] gorgeous and the addition of story goals, optional objectives and the fact that your residents have ""needs"" (That's generous. They'll complain about certain fixtures not being there, but there's no consequence to it) really helps to keep you motivated and put all of your building into context. It's like if you modded Minecraft with a big ol' furniture pack and added a story mode.

Gameplay-wise it's got a pretty simple but engaging loop - You've got your big main island that's all yours to do with as you please. Unfortunately, that island doesn't have much going on in terms of resources, and even if it did, you don't have any recipes for making interesting things anyway. So you set off to other giant islands where you follow a more objective-based story arc, helping the people out and such, during which you gradually collect more and more resources and tools, and learn tons of new recipes, which you can then bring back to sculpt your main island to your liking. Additionally there's a Gratitude mechanic where building rooms and fixtures your residents need or want, such as toilets, bathrooms, dining sets, etc. awards you points which you can use to unlock even more new recipes. It's fun, it kinda makes you earn all the different blocks and bits you'll later plop down, and I can't deny the sense of progression here feels great.

There are 3 things that ultimately led me to not to recommend this to my friends. 

1. Price. Even with a discount, this game is pricey. ""There is so much content"" you might say. Reading other reviews I got the idea that you can finish the story in about 40 hours, which is not great, not terrible. Sandbox mode? OK, I see people with ~100 hours, rarely reaching 200+ hours. Maybe I'm just too picky and spoiled, but there doesn't seem to be *THAT* much content for this price point.

2. Combat. There is so much missed potential here. At least add dodge. There could be skill trees, more varied items. You could be a sneaking ninja, jumping and dodging. There is so much fun to be had here. Yet the gameplay & review videos I watched is poking the enemy till it dies, that's it. It's a shame.

3. The competition. Having in mind the first 2 points above, the PC platform has so many good games that compete with this, ultimately it's a game beaten by the competition. Now I know this game is a kind of a niche one and unique, but let's face it, there are similar games like this that feel the same - you craft and shape your world while fighting monsters. A few come to mind:

My Time in Portia (My Time in Bedrock come to early access soon)
Craftopia (very early access but the combat alone makes it more fun for me)
Valheim
Stardew Valley
Minecraft ofc
Many others I didn't mention...

Having said that, I understand why people like this game. It's cute, polished (if you don't experience the bug that hasn't been fixed for 2 years, lol), but ultimately a soft pass for me.

Let me review this properly by doing what we all inevitably do and compare it to what it's clearly trying to be.

DQB2 does the whole ""Minecraft"" thing in an entirely different light, instead of throwing you into a world where you're given no real indication of what to do this gives you the very classic JRPG setting, background, characterisation and progression you'd come to expect, everything is tutorialised in a manner which isn't too boring/text heavy, whilst still helping you enough you shouldn't find yourself lost. At first you will feel like this game is being very linear with you but even I can tell that, soon enough, I will be let loose to find my own path. I am currently on the island with the farming and I find myself ignoring the quests just to make the farm look neat, tidy and presentable rather than just purely functional which I could've done in about 1/4 of the time. The game sucked me into actually caring about how these NPCs live which is kind of impressive.
This game does look miles better played in third-person over the first person, as first just reminds me of playing those rip-off Minecraft $3 games on the Xbox Arcade back in the day, I use it ONLY to build and play the game in third person, this is a personal thing but one I imagine people would be feeling. Combat is very much ""click and slash"" with your companion doing the heavy lifting for you, on that subject it finally feels good to play a gathering game where a companion does some bloody work for once! I hit a tree so immediately the companion will do the same and will gather a load of materials for you while you do so, you hit a plant, he does the same, it makes the usually ""boring"" gathering work actually less of a pain and makes some sense that if you were travelling with someone to build stuff they'd muck in to help you gather materials (especially as it's shown he can't build, at all). 

Characters in the game are bogstandard to any JRPG, nothing to really write home about or touch upon at this point in great detail. Customisation *at the beginning* is extremely barebones from what I've seen, just ""male or female?"" the swap out a few color palettes, I haven't a clue if this expands later but I imagine it does and one hopes it does.",1617001125,1617001125,True,1,0,0.426713675260543823,0,True,False,False

It did give me pause on hitting the buy button, but my love of the game and hours spent in the demo made me go ahead and hit it. I prefer PC gaming to console, so I really wanted it on PC.

The DOWNSIDE:
The game will not SAVE in ""Fullscreen."" Yes, SAVE. By the computer gods why, or why, does this happen? No clue. You need to open up the files of this game upon purchase, run the Config.exe and switch to ""Simulated Fullscreen"" for it to SAVE PROPERLY,  which is utterly ridiculous, and not something I would have thought of in a hundred years. (If this does not work for you, try searching ""DragonQuest Builders 2 Demo will not Save"" it got me here.)

In Conclusion:
Honestly, the gameplay is like a fun and quest oriented minecraft pack with a LOT of polish (RLcraft or CraftToExile comes to mine) but with this weird F***ing bug, the gameplay doesn't matter. They haven't fixed it SINCE THE FIRST GAME, GRANDFATHERED IT IN FROM THERE, like they breathe stove cleaner for a living. It needs to be fixed yesterday. Still recommended since once you fix this bug it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the game.",1616871023,1616871023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1072420,89173564,76561198168196210,0,3,6363,0,6363,1616839380,"To those who are coming here thinking ""how is this different from Minecraft"": start with a Minecraft base, add the best mods you can think of (some of which may not actually exist), give yourself a great story-driven map, and you'll get close to DQB2.

The most significant difference between the games is in the names. Minecraft is fundamentally a game about resource *gathering*: mining for stuff and crafting stuff. By contrast, mining in DQB2 doesn't play a significant role, and more broadly speaking ""resource gathering"" isn't a core part in the same way. Instead, the game focuses on the building aspects, giving you both far better tools to build at scale than Minecraft does, at least without mods. Moreover, because the NPCs use the rooms you build, they become more interesting than they are in Minecraft, even from a purely mechanical perspective (neglecting their plot aspects).

The other aspect of DQB2 - the questing, i.e., the plot - is also solid. It's both long (60-70 hours) and decently engaging. A few hiccups here and there from a pacing perspective, but enjoyable for the most part. The world is carefully designed, and finding all the interesting bits (like the bonus bosses) is worth doing.

That said, while the game itself is great, the PC version has a large bug with saving that makes it (at least, for many users) unplayable without a little effort. It's not all that difficult (download an existing savefile, copy-paste into the relevant save folder, load that, save & quit, start new game), but it's more than it should be. Moreover, the game is really optimized for controller, and mouse/keyboard feels clunky by comparison (at least to me). Between those flaws in the PC version and the fact that the PC version doesn't raise any of the limitations over the console version (to allow cross-play, I presume), while I recommend the game overall, I'd say pick it up on console if you can.

I really hesitate to give a positive review to a borked game (referencing the save bug), but it's really good (at least to my taste) - good enough that on the balance I still have to give it a (barely) positive review on Steam (with an overwhelmingly positive review on other consoles).",1616840632,1616840632,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The only real con I have with this is that you don't have all that much say in AI behavior. 2 examples of this come to mind as I type this:
1)  I was in the middle of a fight with a boss-type enemy, and there were some brambles (thorn objects) somewhat nearby. I was low on hp and running away from the boss a bit to get enough distance to safely use a consumable, but slashed the bramble in my way. Doing this completely switched the AI from ""fight this enemy"" to ""go collect more brambles for me"" and my NPC partner just buggered off mid-fight. 
2) I was building a small park, but realized that I had too many trees built close together. I thought ""I'll just get rid of one or two of the trees so I can spread them out more"" and started chopping one down. Doing so put my ally into ""harvest more wood"" mode and he proceeded to chop down all the surrounding trees as I looked on in horror.

+ It has more of the dragon quest story telling and art style we all love.   
+ Building is fun and fairly easy to do.
+ Recruiting and giving good gear to NPC's feels worthwhile, since almost all of them contribute in some way.
= In fact, NPC's who fight are almost always better at it than the player.  If you don't mind playing more of a support role where you focus more on gearing your allies and staying alive, then it's pretty fun.  Don't expect to be the best fighter in this game who can take down a boss solo in a reasonable amount of time.
+ NPC's use the rooms you build, helping your constructions feel more alive.

= It's kind of a sandbox.  The campaign will hold your hand and give blueprints for larger constructions.  You'll be able to build rooms wherever/however you want, but only within range of the ""home"" area.  The true sandbox building experience doesn't show up until after the main story is finished.

- Kind of sort of multiplayer.  The best parts of the game, the main story, can only be played in singleplayer.  The sandbox and explorer's shores are multiplayer, but they're not nearly as fun.  It's nice if you like building megaprojects with friends.
- Character customization is awful at first.  It gets a little better as the player finds more outfits, accessories, and hairstyles/hats as the game progresses.

It gets harder and harder to see how as new games come out that improve on its designs, and Dragon Quest Builders 2 makes one of the strongest cases for an alternative. There are so many things I can do in this game that I will miss dearly if I try to return to Minecraft, enough that it really just makes more sense to remain in this colorful, adorable world. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll be done with the story or the building anytime soon, and the more time I spend on both, the more enraptured I become with them.

Years ago, a legendary builder roamed the world and taught people the joys of creation. Since those halcyon days, though, the Children of Hargon have swept the land and undone nearly all of the work that lost hero did. Preaching destruction and subservience, the Children allow no building to stand and no spark of creativity to flourish in their presence. But you don‚Äôt care about that, because you‚Äôre a bright-eyed builder with the world at their fingertips! Left shipwrecked after a strange storm with the mysterious Malroth and the impetuous Lulu, it‚Äôs up to you to build shelters and services, brainstorm crafty solutions to problems, and befriend the forlorn people of the world to restore their long-lost hope. The Children of Hargon won‚Äôt just let you ply your trade without question, of course, but you may find yourself surprised where some of them fall on your works.

The story of Dragon Quest Builders 2 is built out of the framework of the original Dragon Quest 2, imagining a world where the original three heroes never came together and Hargon‚Äôs minions were able to run amok. While the monsters and music will be immediately recognizable to fans of the classic RPG, the story is very much its own thing and offers plenty of surprises, especially if you recognize the name Malroth. Story is also one of the biggest strengths this game has over its peers in the free-form building and survival genres, because it is very much full JRPG fare across five huge plot-driven islands. You‚Äôll meet all manner of eclectic characters, brought to life with charming animations and top-notch localization, and complete quests that are mostly focused on building things and finding resources, rather than battling. The main story is easily a 60-80-hour engagement even if you focus solely on progression, with plenty of heartwarming moments and cute twists.

Cute is absolutely the keyword for this one, and one glance at the screenshots should show you that much. The modern Dragon Quest style of round, colorful Toriyama art gives the entire game a friendly, inviting feel, and the writing absolutely follows this lead. You‚Äôll still have moments of drama, but the tone is always quick to bounce back with some snappy lines. This dovetails nicely with the pace of the gameplay as well, which is loaded with clear directions for simple tasks that have really no time constraints whatsoever. You‚Äôll always know exactly what you need to do for a quest, with absolutely no pressure to do it until you feel like it. And that fact that you‚Äôre raising barns and growing crops for these quests grant them an entirely wholesome feel that never fades.

The constructing is the cornerstone of the gameplay, and is another place where DQB2 outshines many of its peers. At the core of the experience are hundreds of blocks, decorations, and tools to make convincing fantasy towns and castles, all easily sortable in your massive, massive inventory. Placement and interaction distances are generous, especially in first-person mode. Your tools are incredibly powerful for constructing and demolishing, including a hammer that can clear up to five-by-five cubes of space and a trowel that can swap blocks in a flash. On the plot islands you‚Äôll need to harvest the resources you need but back at your hub island, you can embark on scavenger hunts to randomly-generated islands to unlock unlimited basic resources like wood and stone. This above all else really streamlines the creative process as you progress, and encourages massive amounts of creativity when customizing your home island.

Questing and building provide rock-solid pillars for this whole game to stand on, leaving little to really complain about. Probably the biggest limitation to note, especially for folks coming in from Minecraft, is that you‚Äôre not building in a limitless world. Your hub island is where you‚Äôll really do all of your free building, and even that comes with quests to guide you. You can certainly build on the plot islands but you‚Äôll be even more constrained by plot concerns and limited resources. Building specific room and structure types, defined by size and decor, can also be difficult because they requirements are often obscured until you stumble across them. Some require unlocks from later in the story as well, and considering you‚Äôll be unlocking new blocks, decoration, and even abilities across the entire game, it can be hard to tell when it‚Äôs safe to buckle down and build the city of your dreams.

Really these are gripes borne from how massive and robust an adventure this is. It‚Äôs an ideal marriage of building, survival, and RPG elements, and comes with important evolutions of each aspect. The building has so many options and conveniences I don‚Äôt know how I could ever go back to Minecraft, honestly. And whenever I get tired of building bars and aqueducts, there‚Äôs always more charming story to sink back into. Everything is so cute and inviting that I‚Äôll never grow frustrated with any of it, and there are few games that I feel so relaxed with. Fans of Dragon Quest and building games alike will not be disappointed with Dragon Quest Builders 2, and it‚Äôs polished enough that newcomers to either will surely be pleased here.

You wake up to monsters harboring you on a prison ship, the lands made it illegal to build, and the antagonists hence being the children of hargon pray tell the fate of pure destruction.

- Quality of life story and character developement with a few twists on the way.

I found myself compelled to keep playing during the storyline and to keep building and unlocking the new rooms/recipes etc. 

However, the sandbox area of the game... maybe some people like to just build for the sake of building. But for me without that drive to unlock the next part of the story, defend from monsters like in minecraft, or make crazy machinery (also minecraft), i found myself uninstalling this game and never playing it again.

This isn't BAD though. And plenty of games I only play once. My warning would be if you enjoy a 3rd person action/adventure with elements of rpg and base building. Then this is maybe the game for you. If you want a game with really indepth base building mechanics and a sense of purpose to the building, beyond completing it and progressing the story... then maybe not the game for you.",1606521574,1606521574,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

First and foremost is that in Builders 2 you are *never* alone (aside from a few story-based moments). Whether it's your best-buddy Malroth, one of the villagers, or monsters like Golems and Great Sabrecats, the protagonist has someone to watch their back. Constantly being attacked while exploring or working was such a hassle in the original game that this is a huge improvement. You can actually have several companions at once, think it was three (been a while), and the monsters have unique skills. Golems are great for gathering resources and can smash just about anything within reach. Slimes have a high jump which lets you climb mountains easily. Meanwhile, the Chimera actually lets you fly around which is handy for getting a, pun intended, bird's eye view.

For me, as a fan of stories in video games and of Dragon Quest in general, the fact that the story is so prevalent throughout the game and even incorporates the free-build area - which was boring as hell in DQB1 - is a massive step up. Previously, you would have maybe a couple flashbacks to vaguely tie the story together, but here it plays out constantly as you progress. It's also got loads of callbacks and references to Dragon Quest 2, which made me incredibly happy. In a similar vein to the original's loose connection to Dragon Quest 1, Builders 2 plays like a straight-up sequel of sorts to DQ2. Anyone who had played that would immediately see similarities even before they name-drop Hargon during the prologue.

Getting back to the gameplay, though.. I mentioned villagers. Unlike the first game, villagers play a huge role in your different chapters. A variety of them can wield weapons, which you'll later be able to make, and this helps in defending your town. In the original Dragon Quest Builders, town attacks were common and could easily see huge setbacks as your villagers did little to defend themselves. During the scripted attacks, any destruction done within the town is immediately repaired, this includes boss battles, which villagers will *also* help you with.

A certain points in chapters, villagers will also help you build blueprints. In fact, the game will slowly give you a plethora of really handy tools, like an endless water jug or a brick-swapping trowel. Oh, that reminds me! In the original game, much like it's inspiration of Minecraft, all your tools had annoying durability. In DQB2, that's done away with so you can focus on your tasks and exploration. The only things to truly keep in mind are food (for stamina) and health. You can hammer until the end-times and that puppy'll never let you down!

It's also a surprisingly long game, if you take the time to do all the various tasks and side-goals that are given to you. I clocked in at over 250 hours by the time I cleared the whole game, and I never did get to the post-game content. There's different islands to explore and, unlike before, you can return to previous locations and fiddle about or talk to people and see if anything's changed. There's also resource-islands which are randomly regenerated every time you there; the layouts change but their materials are the same so you don't have to worry about not having access to specific blocks or monsters.

There is, however, one downside I do want to mention... and it's a bit spoilerly: [spoiler]Roughly halfway through the game you are taken to a prison island, and are trapped there until the segment is over.[/spoiler] There is very limited food, so if you went exploring like I did prepare to move slowly a lot. There's also a forced stealth section, which nobody likes. Thankfully, on both accounts it's relatively brief compared to the normal chapters. It's also quite lore-heavy, which I appreciated.

Think of a 3rd person Minecraft with a cool guided story mode based in the DQ universe, with good graphics that take the blocky gameplay and kick things up a notch, cute character designs and a great story that can go as long as 80 hours and more with a TON of end game content. 

My recommendation is to play the jumbo demo, it's got about 10-15 hours worth of content and will give you a solid idea of what to expect from the game. The first couple hours are tutorial'y, but after that it gets really fun, and if it scratches your itch, there's SOOOOO MUCH MORE in the full game. 

PC Performance: It's MUCH better than the Switch version, running on pc at 60fps, but is locked to 60 so no unlocked fps, and some weird stuff happens with the GPU Usage if you use the Windowed or Borderless mode, so stick to full screen till they fix the other modes. There's a lot of customisation on the keyboard and mouse settings, which are pretty good but I still like playing with a controller.



EDIT: After finishing the story the second time, and also 100%ing the game on steam, my love for this game grows even further! Now I'm in withdrawal as no other game scratches the build/explore/mash itch like this game does! Till DQB3 I guess...!

This game stops with a saving message after the tutorial and the opening movie. I tested 3 times and gave up to play this game. Tutorial could not be skipped then I wasted 1 hour and half.

I found the workaround for this issue. This issue does not occur when a movie is disabled in Configuration which you can find when running this game from Steam. The opening movie is skipped and shifted to a playable field after the tutorial. I also changed refresh rate of display to 60 Hz from 120 Hz but not sure if it effected.

Oof had an awful time trying to get the game to get past the tutorial, I could not get past the ""Saving..."" screen. I tried so many things but nothing was working. After almost 2 hours of TS my BF gave me a work-around that another user mentioned, it absolutely FIXED IT.  

Step 1: Find someone that can get past the saving screen OR download the game on a different PC (make sure that others have loaded past the ""Saving"" screen on that computer).

Step 2: Make sure to have your Steam Cloud on your PC turned ON.

Step 3: On their (or your alternate PC) login to Steam (double check that your Steam Cloud is ON), open the game through steam and play past the tutorial until you end up washed up on the beach; ""Save"" then ""Quit"". 

NOTE: To verify that the game's ""Save"" file has been created, you can log back into the game and make sure the account you just create has the ""Continue"" option on this second PC.

Step 4: Logout of the second PC and go back to the one with the issue, login to steam and open the game (through steam) again, it should now have the option to ""Continue"".

Hope this helps, game has been working great for me since!

The game has a lot of mechanics and it tries to teach you different things throughout. However, each new area feels like a giant tutorial and you repeat this over and over. The second reason is that each area feels padded. Every time you think you have done what you set out to do it adds more missions. Some may welcome this, but for me it just felt tedious after this happened over and over again.

That being said the core concepts in the game were very fun. The building and combat mechanics felt good. Making specific buildings was fun and some of the blueprints you need to complete were enjoyable to build. I think the game would have benefited from a tighter campaign that was 20 - 25 hours long. The cut content could be used as optional quests for those who wanted to do it.

On here I will explain in short the positive things of the games I enjoy to share with you.
+QUESTS!!
I like the way they added quests. It's something new to this game branch just like a lot of things you will find there you never seen before in any type of game. I'ts a very unique and enjoyable game I could play for days long.
+ REALISTIC!
it looked more realistic then any games of this branch I have played for so far. Examples: Trees, Water, Graphics it's all just made so well and most things aren't even block pixels that's a big+ for me.
+ YOUR OWN VILLAGE!
You play in different Town zone with villagers on each story lines zones. Some zones have unique roles for villagers. I really love that!
+ MONSTER INVASIONS!
It happens randomly, whenever you're away from your town or creating your next new idea for a building then outta nowhere you get a message on your screen that your village is in danger. Making a good base is important and you will realize that the longer you play.
+ Friendly game environment!
I like that my villagers don't die and instead they will lay down wounded on the ground. It gives me a happy feeling that the people in my village are still alive. (Giving them a health herb will make them survive worser situations longer.)
+ Always a friend with you!
Having a follower as companion that follows you everywhere is always nice on explorering, Alone can be boring and having help is always useful. You're able to recruit animals/monsters aswell ain't that nice?

What I do enjoy from this game the most is that you get a lot of freedom. You can do whatever pleases you. When you're on a quest there is no need for hurry!

I've played through the main story twice (and I'm itching to start it a third time) because, as strange as it sounds, I just found that more fun than the game's actual selling point of the freedom to build whatever I want.

A good part of it is the characters. In the main story, you're building things [i]for[/i] people. They display their gratitude both narratively and mechanically ('gratitude' is the game's currency). After the story is over, the characters have no further narrative function to perform, and become less like people and more like paper dolls.

I can't recommend this game enough. It has everything I could want in a game, all rolled into one, and it was exciting, relaxing, and satisfying at every stage.

Proceed through the fun-for-all-ages storyline to unlock more and more crafting materials, rooms, tools, and characters. Upgrade your island to unlock even more things. Change the world as you see fit. Do you want a desert? A mountain? A valley? A river? Make it!

There will be many times during the story that you have to follow a massive blueprint to create a structure that may seem daunting. At first I expected a lot of tedium BUT THE GAME WILL HELP! At times, your fellow villagers will gather materials for you or build the blueprints on your behalf. You may need to simply get the ball rolling.

Very few points of the game left me without a clear path forward or alternate goals to focus on. The combat is simplistic but it felt good knowing that your teammate was the heavy hitter, not you, so that you're just leading and guiding the NPCs.

Most aspects of this game are done in the form of a checklist, from story mode to the individual Tablet Targets and the item checklist on individual Explorer Islands as you pursue an infinite supply of particular resources. This type of gameplay allows for a player to learn what the game is capable of without being forced along a linear line in this otherwise sandbox-y game.

Pros:
- Quirky characters in a quirky world
- Story gets more interesting and engaging the longer you go on with it
- Amazing creations and simple ones can both serve similar functions, meaning it's all in your hands
- Over a hundred different rooms you can create with many different jobs your villagers can perform within them
- Recruitable monsters that serve different functions than standard villagers
- Online functionality allows you to visit offline versions of other people's creations and even create blueprints of various works to put on your own island if you see something you really like!
- Collecting resources is easy and won't require an entire day out of your life to do so; the game even allows you to get an infinite supply of particular resources. Post-game even allows you to acquire items you've collected before but may not have enough of.
- Incredible variety of decorations and blocks to place
- Fun story-mode boss fights that offer a departure from the standard combat

Cons:
- The story can drag on, especially with large amounts of repetitive dialogue
- Action buttons on the controller conflict with each other, meaning you'll likely talk to someone when you mean to place something
- Occasionally in the story there is unskippable dialogue that remains on screen for far too long
- What is considered a ""room"" has requirements that may minimally limit your imagination
- Multiplayer isn't fleshed out enough despite the trailer advertising cooperation with friends. This is a singleplayer game overall.
- Combat is simple and not very fun outside of story-mode boss fights. It's not terrible, just boring.

Overall, DQB2 allows you to create a world uniquely your own after you've overcome some fairly minor or even enjoyable hurdles. All of the things I've mentioned in the cons are really minor compared to the overall experience and if none of those were deal breakers for you, you're going to have a fun time exploring your imagination in this game.

Characters that have tasks for you to complete, reasons to construct specific rooms. The NPCs have life, and build, and create things alongside you. It is very much a game that you can get lost in for hours just creating your world the way you want it to look.

The concept seems like it'd be good for a laugh for a few minutes, but the game is honestly far better than you'd expect at first glance. If you are a fan of the Dragon Quest RPG series, or even just crafting games of this nature I cannot recommend this game enough. There is a lot to love here from both a gameplay perspective, and a downright charm level.

The only complaint I really have about the game is there are bits where one of the characters has a mysterious voice speaking to him, and strangely these are the only bits where you can't press A to continue the dialog.

If you're even remotely interested in trying this out, the demo is free and has an extremely generous amount of content. It's absolutely worth a look.

Things I like
-Building is smooth and works well
-The world rewards for exploration
-Combat is okay, not the best but its very workable
-The blueprints and building types are rewarding in experimenting with how you build
-You can play in third or first person perspective

Things I don't like
-No resolution for UHD
-Controls on paddle need some reworking.
-Buildings should require a roof to be completed but this is minor
-The dialog is way to much at points and you spend 5-10 minutes in your base talking before you get the next quest

Overall a great crafting/adventure game. Haven't tried the multi yet so can't review of that.

End of Game

Pro's
-After 60 hours I still want to play to see the game finished

Con's
-The character never shut up. There is WAY too much dialog!!
-Can't deviate in your path you have to follow exactly what the game tells you. Its Linear open world. In world 3 I rebuilt the castle before I progressed the story and low and behold what I built didn't matter
-Digging is useless, you will never find random veins of ore or random dungeons
-Combat is BORING
-The blueprints you learn on the way are useless as you can only use a few to actually build.
-When you finally unlock unlimited supplies its too late as you're near the end of the game
-Having team constantly follow you around is annoying, trust me I never want to open dialog between me and malroth

It easily has 5+ hours of content and data will also carry over if you purchase Dragon Quest Builders 2. Try it out if you're on the border about buying in as you'll be more than able to get a feel for the game this way.

With that said, DQB2 is pretty solid. I've seen and heard it compared to Minecraft quite a bit but, I don't think this is a good comparison. Minecraft is a big sandbox with few limits and very open gameplay. DQB2 is more linear and structured. You won't unlock all the bells and whistles for building until you're 50-60 hours deep into the story. There are many restrictions placed on creative freedom in order to further plot too. Well, until the story is over that is.

There are a few annoyances such as dialogues which can't be skipped or the story which can drag at times. Wonky camera angles and interaction with the environment take a lot of getting used to as well. Story islands can be a bit hit and miss and some things aren't explained or presented well such as ""town"" boundaries. Little things in the bigger picture really.

To wrap this up, I've put about 70 hours into this in two weeks and plan to add a few more hours on top of that.

Best Bits:
Top Tier Story
Top Tier Attention to the Lore of Dragon Quest
Great Character's I can Remember Every Character
Good Graphics It Looks Like I'd Imagine
Good Variety In Materials and the Underlying Crafting Meta is Good

Average:
UI is fully usable but far from perfect
Controls at stock are not perfect fortunately you can change them (Buggy Buggy Controls)
Fighting is To Easy even when you don't have Lord of Bash to Help, But this is a Building Game
Boss Battles are To Easy and you can Plan for them

Meh:
Death Should Be a Punishment (Come on we should lose everything but our Equipment)
Infinite Materials (Come On Seriously... Granted I get it you don't want a Grind Fest)

Bad:
Some Glitches (Especially During the Big Builds)
Moderate Hand Holding (I don't need you to tell me everything)
Special Buildings are not Custom (However the Story is the Reason)
Item Limits (Why can I only have 34 Chests)
Room Limits (Why only 100 Rooms)
Population Limits (Why only 60 People)
Slow Dialog in Cut Scenes (We can Read more than a Broken Sentence in Five Minutes)
Save Limits Come on it's 2020 we have the Technology to Store More than 9 Saves
Why do I have to Travel Back to the Island to go to another? (Weird)

Really BAD:
The Only Thing that Truely Holds this Game Back is the Limits! I can't Build a Megapolis

Overall despite the Building Limits I give this game my Blessing. I can only hope the Developer Realizes that with Modern Consoles and PC's we have lots of Storage and can Handle way more Bulk in our Save's as SSD's Pretty Much Remove Loading Issues... We got the Technology!

The most annoying part of this game is the voice that will sometimes speak to your friend or yourself. Short sentences stay on the screen for what feels like forever and a day.

The whole dragon quest theme is neither good nor bad, I mean that the game doesn't constantly reference itself unless you are looking for such references in the first place.
It is using the monster and overall asthetic so there is no problem with it being completely disconnected bits and pieces, that much is a plus since many games of this genre just throw whatever content they have together with little regard to the overall look and feel.

The combat is forgettable at best, you repetedly swing your sword and try to avoid getting hit.
Thankfully the main story rarely asks you to fight on your own, in story fights you often have a few people helping out as well so you get through them relatively easily and you can just avoid monsters in most non-story fights if you want to (there is still a level up that gives you some slight benefits so you might not want to avoid fighting completely).

Where the game shines is with the ability to build ""rooms"" in the villages you stay at, each with its purpose.
It doesn't massively change all that much but when NPCs do things in your various rooms they drop small hearts that are the main currency in this game.
In the story island, they are used to unlock recipes you will need to progress through the story as well as give the village more people, on your main island you use them to unlock islands specifically for material collection and recipes, later on you can directly buy items/blocks with them as well.


When a village has its rooms set up, the NPCs start to do things on their own based on their profession, making the village feel a lot more alive as you progress though.
For example having a place to sleep at night, harvesting crops, cooking, eating, fighting nearby monsters...


The story is nothing superb as you might expect from a J-RPG (dragon quest spin-offs can't shake off the whole ""save the world"") but it's serviceable and it even has a portion that is specifically designed to make you feel bad about your ""choices"" (even if in reality you have no real choice in the progression of the story) to even make your own character have some personal growth.

The whole point is the village-building things, both on story islands and on your own, so if that doesn't appeal to you then you can safely avoid this game but if you like those building games and wanted one where NPCs use what you make for them this might be what you want.",1594850129,1594850129,True,2,0,0.532557845115661621,0,True,False,False

This is a game you can expect to get lost in for over 100 hours (and really many more if you are really into it).
Based on the story events around Dragon Quest 2 for the NES, this game has taken the formula established by this genre and polished it until is gleams!

Here is what I love about this game:

--The graphics, while simple due to the style of game, are amazing.  This is what I always hoped Minecraft would look like.  Square Enix has taken the classic ""Dragon Quest"" look from the main series, and transported it to this game in a perfect fashion. There is charm oozing out of pretty much all aspects of the game.  My one gripe here is I do not like the main characters (you choose boy or girl) graphics, and yes you look at them the whole game, but it's a minor nitpick)

--The music is classic Dragon Quest.  Again, charming is the best word for it.  The mood is perfectly set with the music - being both exciting and calming and beautiful depending on the situation.

--Building can be done in 1st OR 3rd person.  This is a huge change from the first game. Now when you are building epic multi-story buildings, simply go 1st person and it's easy as pie.  Also there are TONS of different block types, decorative items, crafting equipment etc to use.

--You have a ""home base"" island that you build up from scratch throughout the game.  Going out and exploring will let you come back with new materials that further expands your options.  The story will help you as you set up your island, and give you quests to build things, but you can also mold it however you see fit to a huge degree.

--There are 3 other main islands in the game where the 3 main arcs of the story take place. Each one will last dozens of hours. There is a fertile forest/grassland, a desert, an a snowy world.  All of them are unique, and fun, and have a lot to do.  You will be helping to rebuild a town in each island, which is how the story progresses. There are also several smaller islands you can travel to that are randomly generated each time you go, that are chock full of resources and monsters for you to collect and take back to your home base!

--Battles are fun and simple but get the job done. You do get a couple special abilities, and you will have a partner with you most of the game who controls himself. You can also capture monsters and have them back at your home base to provide various benefits, as well as taking them with you into battle and exploring.

--The lands are MASSIVE!  There is just so much to see and do!  

--The game is always throwing new things at you.  You will think...dang I wish I could do *this* - and lo and behold you will get the option to do it.  There are lots of surprises you get to, that make exploring the world more fun, and hugely expand your building opportunities.  The serotonin hit the game constantly gives you with rewards and fun new tools is VERY ADDICTIVE!!!

--There are blueprints in the game so you can lay one down, and then all the ingredients needed are shown to you, as well as where to place the blocks.  Later, you can create your OWN blueprints from whatever crazy creation you have come up with.  Also, eventually, your townspeople can help you build things as well, as long as you put a blueprint out and a chest with the materials needed - very convenient!

I could go on and on for days about this game but know this:  If you want both an incredible RPG and the best ""Minecraft"" game ever made, then look no further than Dragon Quest Builders 2.  The breadth and depth of options and content on display here is staggering.  The game is firing on all cylinders and then some, and you will likely be swept up into this obsession for over a hundred hours, wondering where the heck then night went when you see the sun coming up in the real world lol.  Anyways, BUY THIS GAME!!!

For one, it's a classic Dragon Quest RPG, in that your character levels ups, can swap equipment and uses recovery items like food and medicinal herbs. Secondly, it's Minecraft; or rather a clone of Minecraft. The world is blocks with features made of ACTUAL polygonal entities but the majority of the world is all blocks.
Now the real reason I don't care for the game is that there is no world to explore and finish. It's an open world full of resources to be utilized. If it weren't for the story (which you have to complete in order to build the full array of materials and fixtures) I may enjoy the game. If it weren't for the open world (which isn't bad, on it's own) I would be free to explore an HD and 3D Dragon's Quest world. 
The division of production is really apparent. The story and combat isn't great. You just run away from enemies until you can run back to them and spam attacks. The stories are always a yes/no option that lead to the same thing, but it is a Dragon Quest game so whatever. The world lacks depth in the traditional sense, as the real pull is meant to be the mad dash you make for materials to build your own personal island.

Anyways, I think it's a good builder game but the story is really long and drawn out. The option to bypass it would make this game well worth the price tag.",1594534221,1594534221,False,1,0,0.364358633756637573,0,True,False,False

While it is similar to the first game, it's also completely different. They took all the great things from the first game, and left out all the bad ones. 
After you beat the main story you can continue building, and there is actually more to do and more tools to get. 

I do have one bad thing to say about it though, after the first few times you play through the story some of the quests do get extremely tedious. But for people who like this kind of game, your first play though will be a blast!

So... How about Dragon Quest XI and Final Fantasy XV now?


Very well done game, loses a little something of the charm DQB1 had, but makes up for it in its own way.

The only down side is that, needing to wait for them to patch out the obnoxious DRM, I don't have access to the pre-order items since I bought it something like six months after launch when they removed the problematic code and delivered a fully functional product.

As to the game itself...

It plays well, though I will get the occasional lag spike out of nowhere that seems to have no legitimate cause since I'm way above spec and normally everything plays buttery smooth, my whole system stays cool without so much as a fan kicking on playing this for more than ten hours straight.

The gameplay is nice, though some basic building features are locked away behind story content that comes fairly slowly, and the only really frustrating thing are monsters who destroy walls when a mob attacks. One of those hits a major project and I'll kill the game and reload a save because of how much time it takes to fix what they tore down in seconds.

The only thing that could make this better now that they've patched it?

Letting us buy the pre-order DLC, it's not much but a few of those items would look very nice in my workshop, and providing options for auto-repair outside of story missions so I don't have to force quit the game and re-load whenever a horde of skeletons descend on my base.

The former may well happen, Squeenix has been known to sell pre-order bonuses in the past, the latter is probably a futile hope though.",1594148648,1594148648,True,1,1,0.500632405281066895,0,True,False,False

Like:
o Lengthy campaign - I enjoyed every moment. The game keeps introducing something new which kept the journey always fresh for me
o Great Customization - How you want to build depends on your creativity. With the exception of some build missions which are locked on a specific location, I'm impressed on the way I can design everything
o Intelligent AI - I mostly play RTS and I appreciate that the AI has great pathfinding and building mechanics incorporated
o Charming visuals - I didn't play Minecraft cause the graphics turned me off. Something about this game's art just appeals to me
o What You Build Matters - This is probably my favorite part of the game. I was grinning when I realized that different kind of residents react to different kind of rooms. They use them and appreciate what you built for them. Built a Kitchen? People will cook on it and serve it on a dining table. Built a farm? People will plant and harvest on it. This is just so satisfying to watch especially when you have made a layout which creates a beautiful cycle of daily life for your residents.

Neutral
o Story is simple and nothing too memorable
o Combat is simple - Reminds me of old-school Zelda games as others have already pointed out. I didn't mind it at all as I was too focused on the building side of things

Dislike
o There are times where building a specific room will not register even with the correct build (It seems this also happened to some based on googling)
o I wish there was a way to delete multiple items. I wanted to organize my stuff the way I want it. While the game can do it for you, I just felt that the inventory management could have been better. 
o Dialogue - I just didn't like the direction that they went for the dialogue. I get that it adds flavor and variety (making characters speak mispelled English words, ala Pirates) but it gets annoying fast.

Overall, I enjoyed most of my time playing this game. Even at 60 hours of playtime, I am still looking forward to do a lot of creative stuff. Bought this game at 40% off. Honestly, I'd say it's worth the full price for what it offers.

It starts off rudimentary or basic, and you'll find yourself in repetitive modes of operation in defending towns, but ironically the call-backs to things that happen early on are very well done. Even assuming they were call back upon witnessing them, I was still touched when the reference played out late in the game. This game isn't perfect or near perfect. There are still odd things happening with AI. And whenever there is text that displays without a box, you can't skip it and have to wait 10 seconds before it moves to another dialog box, and another, and another. Ultimately though, the game effectively is a better Minecraft minus the free servers. The main storyline acts as a very long tutorial to unleash the full power of the game. And I'm not upset about it not being super public like minecraft. I think most Minecraft servers are garbage because they're run by 10 year olds or 40 year olds who have their kids playing in their server.

After playing several types of these games I usually get bored about 30 hours in but this isn't the case here. Unlike games like Ark or Conan this game doesn't have or need the PvP aspect to it, especially Conan heavily relies on PvP. Even though I don't think this is better than Ark it's just as good. The Lego craftig game in comparison severly lacked interesting things to build and had too small worlds which made the beginning a real drag to play. This game also improves on the idea of Blueprints by giving you NPC's that will build those Blueprints. While Colony Survival lacks for example the animations and interactivity that this game has, colony Survival gives you NPC's that just stand in one spot increasing whatever it is they are supposed to do. DQB2 does this alot better by giving you actual stories and quests for both what you're building aswell as who you're meeting. The only thing Scrap mechanic does better are the buildable objects that game really gives you the possibilty of building crazy things from cars to planes. That would really be the only thing I'm missing here but no other game does a good job at that either and SM is also vastly inferior to DQB2.

-The visuals are cute and polished
-I experienced no technical issues so far
-I've recently finished Dragon quest 11 and having the same music here makes me feel like i never left!
-There's a shit ton of content. After 15ish hours when i finished a specific storyline and Island, i was surprised to find out that was all still part of the tutorial!
-The building is smooth and interactive by the way you can make different sort of rooms depending on objects you use.
-Non of the mechanics feel particullary grindy.
-I'm a person that needs structure and gets lost and bored in games that are too Sandboxy. Luckly this game has a long story that guides you on and gives you visible goals.

Cons:
-Don't get the game for the purpose of COOP play, as it's only a small portion of the game.
-Maybe there's a bit too much pointless dialogue at times.
-There's 0 voice acting which is a shame in a game with so much talking.
-Although having combat is great, it's very very very bare bonds. Just left click spamming to swing your sword and walking away to avoid hits(There's no dodge/roll either).",1593841473,1593841551,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played through the entire game on Switch and it was a blast to go through, just.. very slow. The slowest things in the game is the text speed and the amount of time you have to wait until the popups accept your button press. The characters aren't really good, other than Malroth. Most characters are either very forgettable or unlikeable. An example of an unlikeable character is Lulu, she is the most arrogant, selfish and bossy character I've seen in this game, Bananzo being second. Like, I wanted to kick that nuisance off the island so damn bad. lol

(Not to mention, she and Malroth both decide to name the island without your consent even though the hermit gave the island to you, which annoyed me a bit even though it didn't change the name of the island, at least Malroth's island name was 1000x more creative than Lulu's. ""Lulutopia"", what are you, two?)

The story itself is nothing really special, but still fun to go through, it's simple and straightforward. Going through it is a total slog as mentioned, certain things are super slow and feels they slowed it down just to pad out the game. You go through a few islands like Furrowfield, Khrumbul Dun, Moonbrooke.. etc., solving various problems with building and such, slowly gaining allies along the way like Babs and Anessa until you reach the end, which you can do whatever you want after that, just the biggest downside is that there's no creative mode after the end of the game, so building will be a bit more of a pain in the ass.

Environments are bland, exploration is tedious and unrewarding, and the building is simplistic. But worst of all: there is no challenge. Enemies pose no threat. Bosses are just two special move dummies. 

The only difficulty I've had so far is skipping past superfluous and repetitive dialogue as the developers have you speak to five characters and have a fifteen second high five animation for the smallest, most insignificant unlocks. Worse if you unlock something 'useful'. 

Maybe excess dialogue would've been cool if the characters were likeable, but they're not. Everyone is one dimensional entity who had their shtick-like trope personalities cranked up to eleven to appease an immature audience (6-12 years old). There is no depth. All they do is spew a monologue every time you discover another thing you won't need anymore 30 minutes later.

While everyone is yapping away some bullshit, you're also listening to the most uninspired and monotonous music in video gaming. I never muted a game's music as fast as this one's. It's terrible. The same three notes drone on and on and on as you walk through repetitive environments without purpose, wandering where you went wrong in life that you stooped low enough to play this... abomination. An abomination that has all the complexity of minecraft removed, all the skill of real time combat siphoned, and all the open world exploration of Zelda eviscerated.

There's just the right amount of exploration, freedom of expression via building, customization, interacting with villagers, the list goes on. Give this game a shot - get through the first island before you decide that it's some knock-off.

It is absolutely bubbling with charm and the story, which is full of life and mystery and adventure, gives all of the crafting and building some context and purpose.

The characters are cute and the dialog rich, although at times it can be tedious and lengthy. Two examples in particular of this criticism: One character has some specific kinds of self-dialog throughout the storyline where the dialog is completely set by the in-game timer. It leaves each line of text on the screen for an exorbitant amount of time, far more gratuitous than necessary. What this means is that, unlike most dialog where you can tap the ""X"" or ""A"" button to skip through, you have to just wait. I literally was pulling out my phone to kill what felt like full minutes at a time with one sentence of text on the screen. The rest of the text can be advanced using a controller button. Second example is in the last ""sequence"" of the main story. While the finale of this story is wonderful and rewarding, the sequence leading up to it is filled with more dialog than is probably necessary and I found myself just wanting to skip it entirely so I could finish the next task.

I have finished the story and still cannot stop playing. I still feel as if there is a lot to do just in terms of rewarding little side-quests while getting to build in the sandbox of my home island. This is before even undertaking a massive project that we see in the gargantuan and stunning photos of custom created monuments and villages that so many players have beautifully created.

While the combat is a bit one-dimensional, it doesn't need to be more complex, because it's not the focus of the game *at ALL.* Again, the combat simply provides some cute context to some of the building and crafting. If you like RPGs and JRPGs and you like the relaxing creation of games like Minecraft and Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, then you should give this game a try.

Note: If you played Dragon Quest Builders (the first version) and enjoyed it, then you will LOVE this one. It is nearly identical in gameplay, but far more fleshed out in the story. There is so much more to do in the main storyline, and the ""sandbox"" island isn't some disjointed place you need to go visit separate from the main story. The world is self-contained and continuous, and between the breaks of the main story you get to go back to your main island, which is your sandbox, where there are also many, many sidequests.

You can build small, you can build large, and you can build forever. I've spent most of my hours in this game building even beyond what's required by the story.
If you want a game where you can build to your heart's content, customise building material colour and appearance, as well as character appearance (shortly after starting the second island in the story), and a sappy feel-good friendship story line that will have you smiling, this is the game for you.
I've seen comments that the combat can be a little repetitive and this is true. It can be. However, if you take breaks between fighting enemies and doing other things it gets less annoying. Plus, late game introduces (SPOILERS) traps which you can use to spice up a good fight. Or keep monsters away from your builds, which means you don't have to fight at all! Genius.

from the building mechanics too the npc a.i actually using the rooms you build too the story that isn't the best compared too other dragon quest games but still solid non the less then add in community features such as being able to visit peoples houses and islands not to mention the sheer size of the game post game content tablet challenges collectibles
and overall exploration there is so much to do in this game people where complaining about the price but 60 dollars/euros
for a game with over 50 hours of story alone is worth the asking price(or at least it is for me)

there are some flaws mostly because of the port mouses just don't work(or at least mine doesn't) so i would advice playing this with a controller  my other gripe is the game might be a bit on the tutorial heavy side(too put it mildly) and the blueprints during the story doesn't exactly leave much room for creativity

[list]
    [*]Feels like Minecraft but way more fun and npcs chat and give quests
    [*]You have a goal
    [*]The game reminds me of Harvest Moon
    [*]Relaxing game to play
    [*]Graphics are not over the top but suit this game just great
    [*]Crafting
    [*]NPC follows you and helps
    [*]Can get creative

[h1] This game is worth every penny and at least just try the demo i mean some games are actually worth $60 or wait until it drops to $30 but you are missing out. [/h1]

HIGHLY RECOMMEND
plus listen to some relaxing music while you play and you will just not remember when you started playing the game.

EDIT:
~11.9 hrs last two weeks / 85.6 hrs on record (3.0 hrs at review time)
This game is still holding my interest and i am mainly holding my progress after i escaped from the skull island level. I finished my Temple in the sand area and i am building my town up in the grass area, (still can't find grass seeds any where) but i am still having a blast on this game. i can now confirm this game can run on a GT650M v2 Laptop GPU though only at 30fps. I still highly recommend this game.

EDIT 2:
I now have 100 Hours on this game i can say one thing if a game can hold my interest for 100 Hours it is worth the money in my opinion.

Once at launch on Switch. Twice for my brother on PS4. And thrice on PC as a visual upgrade to the Switch version, and in hope of eventual mods.

CORE FEATURES:
- Expansive building with extrinsic incentives (unlockables)
- A long JRPG-like quest
- Lite civilization sim and farming
- Share creations or screenshots, or have other players visit your islands.

PROS:
- Many useful tools for easier building.
- Many, many unlockables make an enjoyable progression system without being overwhelmed with options.
- A nice story with some dark turns. Malroth is a favorite.
- Casual gameplay with lots of creative options to play with.
- Multiple locations including The Isle of Awakening and three Buildertopias with selectable biomes.
- Share islands and screenshots between consoles.
- PC version includes all console DLC for free; multiplayer does not require a paid service.
- Graphics are cute and timeless. (Thank you Akira Toriyama!)
- Controls are fantastic and intuitive-- on a controller. #GameFeel
- Customizable character; equippable armors and cosmetic armor replacers.
- A narrative sequel to DRAGON QUEST 2. (Canonicity debatable, but who cares?)
- Fishing! (Now it's a real game.)
- You can pet the dog. (And the cat, and the chicken, and the cow...)


CONS:
- A 'Creative Mode' takes too long to open up. The Isle of Awakening cannot be built freely upon until post-game.
- The story is very, very long with a lot of fluff dialogue. (Some takes unnecessarily long to scroll!)
- The dialogue is heavily accented in all three major levels of the game which is difficult to read over long periods of time.
- Combat often involves hoards of monsters and lots of hit-stun making it boring and frustrating.
- Synthetic music. A DRAGON QUEST staple issue, but still disappointing, especially with such good compositions!
- KB+M is awkward but doable.
- Blueprints are mandatory and cannot be placed by the player. NPC builds are be automatically placed, sourced, and built while the player watches.
- Limited space makes organization for large builds difficult.
- Recognized room sizes are too small for more intricate builds.
- No cross-play between systems outside of sharing builds and screenshots.
- No Steam Workshop or unofficial mod support yet.

It's easy to compare DRAGON QUEST BUILDERS 2 with the leading block-building game Minecraft... so let's do that.
While Minecraft has a focus on the crafting (and mining, wouldn't ya know) where the game revolves around gathering items that allow further gathering of rarer items, DQB2 doles out new tools and materials to players who complete the story-based objectives, find secrets, or defeat optional bosses.

The ethos of Minecraft is to survive and craft into efficiency.
The ethos of DQB2 is to build, and to do so as painlessly and stylishly as possible!

This isn't comparable to Minecraft's 'Creative Mode' either. 3rd person building (and a toggle-able 1st person), unlockable tools like the Transform-o-Trowel which swaps blocks in a wide radius or just builds walls in one stroke, or the essential Buildnoculars which allows placing and breaking blocks so long as you can see and click on them for those massive endgame builds.

The story is very good but I do have problems with it. Unlike DQB1, the story isn't as well integrated into the concept of sandbox building. The mostly focuses on the relationship between you, the Builder, and Malroth, who definitely isn't the human incarnation of the final boss of DRAGON QUEST 2! I won't talk details, but suffice to say I, one who is loath to skip dialogue, ended up mashing through text boxes a lot more than I would have liked, yet by the end I was thrilled with the ending and specific set pieces.

The story often presents an objective: Regrow the Deitree (for example). If you're like me and want to spend tons of time building and not progressing through the story, then you'll be dismayed when the Deitree finally grows so large it clips through and requires the demolition of your hard work. The story is built around the idea of objective hunting and progression, rather than putting time into creative building, which is a shame as DQB1 incentivized putting time into your base so when the final battle arrived, the better prepared you were, the less damage your base would suffer. Contrariwise, DQB2 always 'save-states' your base before a battle and will always be fixed afterwards (which also stutters the narrative pacing).

Battle is also very stiff. DQB1's combat wasn't a focus. ""You are not a hero."" In fact, it was emphasized that combat isn't the goal and the only means of leveling was building better tools, weapons, and armor as well as building better walls and defenses. BUILDING. DQB2, on the other hand, brings in the classic leveling system that brings you up to the +10 level cap each level just from mandatory battles making the mechanic pointless. Besides, when it comes to defenses, you are told how and when you get to make them...

My most grievous complaint is in the form of the entire story, good on it's own, going directly against free-building. If you decide to build houses for everyone in a story base too early, you may end up demolishing them for a required build that you weren't allowed to place the blueprints. On the third island, I made an underground sleeping chambers in an area discovered early in the level only to have to place a prison there by force, disrupting my entire design. 

Therefore, the game say, DO NOT BE CREATIVE YET, we are still showing you our examples (40 hours in).

But I've complained enough. It's easy to find the faults in things you love.
When you do finish the game and you *do* get to be creative...! Ah, it's magic. It's not perfect, but there is no other game I would like to be lost in more than free-building in DQB2.

If Minecraft is like being stranded in the wilderness, trying to survive-- washed ashore on Gilligan's Island, trying not to starve or being eaten by the natives...

DRAGON QUEST BUILDERS 2 is the digital version of having a tub of all the LEGOs from every set you've ever owned and building a giant anything and the hardest part of the process is finding that piece you were looking for, while simulating the experience of begging your mom for those expensive sets but she tells you to wait for your birthday and all you can do is keep mashing 'X'.

SUGGESTIONS FOR DRAGON QUEST BUILDERS 3
- Actually make it, Square-Enix. I don't care who does it, just make it happen.
- Mods.
- Placeable story-related blueprints.
- Final area bosses need to make lasting damage on your base or else I won't care to defend it. (Difficulty option?)
- 'Leveling Up' should come from building and exploration, not combat.
- Creative ares need to be able to be built upon from the beginning and not held for the post-game 60 hours later.
- Multiplayer servers for ""Realms"" and the like. PvP, mini-games, that good stuff.
- Improved magnet and Red Stone-like mechanics and circuitry.
- No, seriously. Mods.
- Don't let me jump out-of-bounds at Skellkatraz while riding a Slime and have a Merman knock me out, but not deal enough damage to kill me and spawn me back at base, all while I'm regenerating health too fast to make killing myself a viable option.
- Optimize. Optimize. Optimize. Keep that code clean!
- Bring back equipment. Meteor Bracers, the Talaria, and Gourmet's Girdle are essential!
- Can we mod the game yet?

If you read all this crap and feeling okay about it, just buy the game. Or, get the JUMBO DEMO. I sunk about 25 hours into just that alone. Just be careful you don't build into the Deitree's area...",1589319552,1590117378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They looked at every interactive aspect of dig/craft/build games and asked themselves if it was fun. If it wasn't, they seem to have added something to make it fun.

[EDIT] A minor note before I continue. There is one major thing that holds this game back. One of the primary mechanics of the game is building rooms with a purpose for your Sims/Minions/Meeples. they use them depending on what they have in them, like kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms. You get the idea. Well, there is a hard upper limit that you won't really care about until later in the game, and it's a 100 rooms. Not an issue on the story islands, but when you get to building stuff on your personal island, you will hit that really quick, which is both unfortunate and a bad design, because it guarantees you either have to ignore the quest builds for the island if you want to build as you play the game, or do them and then tear down at least the doors {lynchpin to designating a room} after the game is done so you can build as you wish to a certain extent. There is also a 60 NPC limit, including your animals, so, good luck with that. I don't think fish count, thankfully.  Frankly they should have either bumped all these limits up, or set that to each section of the island {Beach/Coast, Tundra, Temple, Desert, Greenlands}, since they all have invisible border regions anyway.

At the very least this is a major oversight, even if it is to stopgap a technical issue the game would have otherwise. I still recommend the game, but keep this in mind
 
[Original review continues]

Hate digging one block at a time? dozens of different ways to remove, destroy, or mine huge volumes of blocks at a time. Building blocks has been very well thought out in the same way. Its a Toriyama/Chronotrigger?DBZ flavored game in the vein of Minecraft, but with a fun story structure that keeps giving you new ways to craft and build your way to whatever you want to do, NPC's just needy enough to give you some direction in the creative areas of the game.

Your personal island will start to feel like a private kingdom once you can finally go to and from it freely, get materials, and recruit more denizens. I like placing usable decorations to define what the room does, though it could be a little more free form.

Some of the tools need either a better tutorial or better controls. The Trowel would be a great tool but I can't figure out if or how you can change the area of space it affects. Maybe that's later in the game. But the base functionality (it lets you swap out blocks without having to break them down, and can eventually make whole large flat surfaces)

I haven't noticed any glaring design issues. Entity pathing works mostly nicely and people usually can figure out how to get places. They don't yell out when they get stuck, though, so you might be going on a minion hunt on your island to see what hole they fell in to and are just standing there in. 

Somehow this game works well as both a first and third person game, and the character and feel changes on the fly when you do. One moment you can be in first person and it feels like a nicely reskinned Minecraft, the next it feels like you've dropped into Windwaker (There is some obvious inspiration from the Zelda series in this DQ game, and I'm okay with that). 

For the sort of game, DQB2 is gorgeous. I recommend playing it on an SSD if you have one, though. Playing it off of a 7000rpm drive hampered the game speed a lot with a weird undulating slowdown as it unloads and loads chunks behind the fog in the distance. Putting it on an MDME M2 SSD was the lynchpin to getting it run buttery smooth.

Not surprisingly, for a Japanese port to PC, remapping controls is sort of a pain. there are lots of contextual actions you can hotkey, which by standard layout usually get thrown at the (Xinput) X button, but if you try to switch all of those to another button the game isn't happy about it and they don't trigger correctly, if at all.

It takes some playing with it, but if you don't like the standard controller button layout it can be reconfigured, it just takes some doing.

Overall, it just feels good when you build something and then every single one of your townspeople drop what they're doing and rushes over and is all ""F*** YES. We needed a toilet. THANK YOU"" And then they all line up and actually use the damn thing.

It reminds me a lot of Minecraft, if someone decided it did not have enough DBZ aesthetic. It also has a plot.
I like the fact that all the named characters seem to have individual personalities, but dialogue seems so excessively wordy, coupled with trying to transcribe accents phonetically while only having 4 looping reaction noises instead of voices. 
Towards the end of the storyline, they try their best to add new elements to avoid repetition, but it's still enough that objectives feel tedious, and you don't exactly have full freedom of your island until the end.

All that said, the game is good, I like the steps in order to learn new recipes, and progression overall makes sense.

And Dragon Quest Builders 2 doesn't disappoint when it comes to a minecraft experience with classic and thrilling RPG mechanics of from the Dragon Quest series, to my understanding this takes place during Dragon Quest 2 for the narrative and there is a TON of fun stuff I've seen so far in it, and I feel this will have roughly 600 hours before I take a good rest from it, as it's that strong of a single player experience!

That being said I've seen there is multiplayer and I need to say that I have NO opinion on it as I have not experienced multiplayer and I do not wish to sway that experience mallet until I get some time into it, so please check back on this review when I get the chance to update this part of it.

Ultimately given that my experience thus far has been single player I really enjoy it, it runs solid  I did see a few lag spikes for the first real boss of the game when I took a screenshot it crashed the engine which I feel was the engine and not my PC.

The download is really small for such a large game scale only a little over four gigs of data makes downloading this easy for most users on the internet.

It's a bit handholding on the tutorials which I feel only ends once you beat the main campaign but reason for that is the TON of stuff to learn and build and remember!

So verdict is that I love building minecraft games and I love the dragon quest series, game game so far gets a solid 9 out of 10.  It'll be one of my major side games I'll be putting time into this year between game dev and life once the topical topic is done this year.

The game invites you, as a Builder, to bring a community together while also creating lush, homey environments for your people to live in. Farm, craft, construct, smash cartoonishly cute monsters -- there's a lot here to love, people -- especially if you're coming from games like My Time at Portia or Minecraft. I'd say this is more laid-back than the one, more linear and attractive than the other, but there are also some twists. 

Malroth -- DUN DUN DUN -- does most of the smashing of monsters for you. You're just not going to be that much of a killing machine in this game, no matter how kitted out you get. Additionally, any number of monsters either start out as your friends, or become your friends over time. There's a real feel-good atmosphere here that's been missing from a lot of games of my acquaintance. On top of that, there are a *lot* of time-saving tweaks in this game that make playing it much less unwieldy/grindy than it might've otherwise been. 

As an example, it's remarkably easy to get your villagers planting and watering your crops for you, and further quests have them feeding themselves and all sorts of other business. There are also numerous way-points on the islands, making it easy to teleport from place-to-place. Best of all, you don't have to be *at* a way-point if you want to teleport *to* a way-point -- excellent if you find yourself stuck on a cliff. 

I haven't even gotten into the look of the game, but trust me that it's both lovely *and* adorable. I wasn't even *into* the Dragonball Z look until I started playing the Dragon Quest games, but now I'm completely hooked. It just works so *well*.

I been playing this non stop since i got it, it is so interesting BUT..... there is a big one here:

The main story is a HUGE fiasco, it is boring and very very predictable, even tho it is used to teach you how to build i find this was the of the most predictable and linear story ever.. the fact that everything is written is awful, seriously SE  cast some voice actors?.

Cinematics are non existent, which again makes things boring storywise.
lack of a fighting post endgame. (just a cuple of mini boses on islands, but tey are just a few and 1 per island)
fighting itself its a tap 1 button kinda thing, no interesting fights endgame.

This game would b epic when they allow builders to order the monster spawn places, or to be able to create dungeons.

Dont get me wrong, i love this game but i do think it has to get major changes to b more enjoyable.

also online features seem not to work?

pls make the islands visitable by more than 4 players.

For a very expensive game you get tons of hrs of play, but its almost frustrating to read that awful and boooooring story comming from a dragon quest game, I was expecting more...

If you want a relaxing, non-complex experience, and to just while away a few hours without getting stressed then this is a good game for you. However, the main thing that stuck out is the store page touting the high praise reviews... I feel like I see this often enough but if every game is a 9/10 then something is vastly wrong with how games are being evaluated. Those kind of scores imply to me a mostly flawless experience, which this isn't.

Game issues:

Camera is right up your ass a lot. It makes it difficult to see what's going on at many times. Changing the FOV seemed to improve this a little, but the camera should not be right behind you when you are exactly 1 block in height.

Targeting is pretty bad with a mouse... really should allow you to mouselook to aim where to place a block.

Dialogue - there's a LOT of it. If you don't like reading you won't enjoy this. A lot of it is slow, rambling, and unskippable. Sometimes it feels like I've spent more time in dialogue windows than actually being allowed to play the game. Also for some reason the dialogue windows look really unpolished, it stands out pretty badly to be honest to just have a black box with a super ugly font. No portraits to liven it up given there's no voice acting.

Combat is a bit too basic, either you'll like it or you'll feel like it just needed another couple of buttons to press. Even having a dodge button would've made the experience feel nicer.

The art direction is really nice, as to be expected from a Dragon Quest game.

dragon quest builders 2 still has the plagued clipping of characters in buildings or in case of one character he is literally in mid air in the buildings and the ever so annoying of random characters climbing up the side of a building if theres access to the roof via blocks the characters will climb it. this causes some rather annoying issues .

technically issues
it is also doesnt play nice with anything going on the background it can cause a crash or stutter effect still trying to figuire out why . 
the lack of voice acting does hurt this game as some of the scenes can take a while to go from one sentence to the next. it would have been a welcome edition to the series as the characters in this game were intresting.

at 50.00 though i cant recomend this if it was 35 i would have but the same bugs from dragon quest builders 1 and the lack of voice acting are my reasons why i wouldnt i just feel it would make the game a bit more lively even if it had the ability to turn the voice acting on or off as im sure some prefer it with none. 

on a final note this game isnt cpu intensive on a ryzen 1600 or the 1060 and plays fine however i would strongly recomend having at least 16gb of ddr4 as my ram usage was 9.6 gb

I says surprise because i haven't seen any new updates other than the Dec. 20th update or any info on the issue i was having from the dev's.   When the Dec. 20th update rolled out i reinstalled the game to see if that had fixed the game despite the fact that the patch notes didn't say anything about the issue being fixed.  I clicked play.......  it didn't work it crashed the same way as before, i uninstalled and tried again same result.  Now back to today.  I installed the game then clicked play,  i seen a black screen for about 7 to 8 sec about to lose all hope i see the loading indicator at the bottom right of the screen!  The game loads up and i see the main menu i hit continue and the saved file loads and i'm in game.  I then run my toon around for a few seconds and then save the game and back out to the main menu then hit quit.  I try to load the game again...  I click the play button and in 2 to 3 seconds i see the main menu.  I want to play this game again i love dragon quest games and i like Minecraft for me it was a match made in heaven.  But its almost the 10th of April and the new hotness is upon us.  After the new hotness i might try this game again but who knows when that might be.  I cannot change my recommendation for this game because as far as i know the issue has not been fixed.  The game works now but for how long?

This part of the edit has nothing to do with the issue i was having or about the game specifically its more about my history.  The original Dragon Quest that came out in 1989 was the game that cemented me in the gaming world.  I had tried other games before but they just didn't have the same impact on me that this game did.  I played this game for years ""well as much as i could after school and homework"", and i never beat it.  Years later ""maybe 17 to 18"" i pick it up again and destroy it!  I said to my self after i completed the game.  ""What was so hard about this game"".  I could go on about this game and other games like Final Fantasy 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 part 1 and 2, but i think i got my point out.  To say the lest seeing this game come out in the state it did was very disappointing to me.",1579847894,1586150562,False,5,2,0.499096155166625977,0,True,False,False

Only complaints I would have is:

- NPCs will throw items in random chest

I'll be making a lot of comparisons to Minecraft, because that is obviously DQB2s closest competition. I would wait for this one to go on sale, but there is more good than bad to be had.

Pros-
*Well optimized. I rarely have any frame rate drop and only crashed once.
* Art Design. Compared to Minecraft, the 3d models look great. Most of the landscape looks colorful and interesting.
* World Design. I have enjoyed the Dragon Quest world ever since it was dragon warrior. I like the quirks of that world that go back to the nintendo days. I like exploring all the little nooks and crannies for Life Seeds, Mini Medals, or other goodies.
* I like that you level up.  By the end of the game you feel like a minecraft builder, but with 30 more levels. You can lay down whole rows of blocks and once, glide, scoop up whole ponds, get flying and very fast mounts, make classic dragon warrior gear, etc.
* Building to Solve.  This game could be called Minecraft: Story Mode. Rather than skill with magic or martial arts, you solve your problems by building. Builder is you in game class and people treat the ability to hold 20 tons of dirt in your pockets and build a house in 2 minutes as magic the equal to that of a mage or priest. I really enjoyed building the towns, villages, and castles that you might find in other DQ games.
* Monster Pals. You can recruit monsters, starting in the middle of the game. It's nice to get some sweet allies and mounts, but the selection that can be recruited is pretty small, and often without rime or reason. You can get slimes and metal babbles, but not regular babbles or metal slimes. You can get zombies, but not skeletons. Some monsters are also great, while others are near worthless.
* Village Details. I like that your villagers have the needs of real people. Each needs food, a bed, a toilet, and a bathroom. Unlike Minecraft, you cant just lock them in a 2x2 room with a bed and have them live happily. Each also has a profession. Some are very good, like nuns that cook and heal in combat, while others are worthless.  

Cons-
* Story. They had a few plot points that I thought were clever, but for the most part, the story is quite dumb. In the very beginning of the game they tell you that your buddy is Malroth reborn, but then drop hints of that being the case throughout most of the game. Why bother? We already know because we were already told. I do like the he is basically Vegeta and you are basically Bulma, not Goku.
* Illusion of Choice. In some cases you have some loose instructions to complete the next quest, such as make bedrooms of your villagers. So long as it has walls, a door, a light, and a bed, you can do whatever you want. I made a two story inn with a kitchen and dining room too. I like these, but many times you have to build VERY SPECIFIC buildings. Every single block must be exactly right. While sometimes I see the need, most times I don't. This sucks. Even worst, you have 0 story choices to make. You must accept every quest, do exactly what you are told to do, and even when given a yes/no option, must pick the correct one or re-choose until you do. You cannot even tell a minor character that you don't like that they can't come and move in with you. The realization that I had to make some really bad choices made me quit for a couple weeks.
* Nothing really matters. The game is too easy. Death has no penalties at all. In one major island I became disgusted with the residents and refused to help defend the town. Doesn't matter, they'll win eventually, even if I spent the whole time fishing. Then they'll fix the town to its previous state. Even minor characters that are supposed to die cant be saved and all the others can't be killed. Even against major boss fights, your mob of villagers will eventually win without you.
* No replay. Due to the no choice thing, replaying the game would make no difference. Other than how you went about building some of the buildings, not a thing would change.
* Meh End Game. Granted, they do give you a few new islands to quickly explore and loot, but the end game feels really hollow. No big dungeons, no super bosses, only 100 rooms on your island with 3 different settlements, and only 20 occupants per settlement. This includes every single human (obviously) as well as every sheep, chicken, and monster. And you need 10 monsters and 5 pets (cats or dogs), so thats 1/4 of your max population right there.

There is actual story here but it's ridiculously mundane and predictable. It's so predictable that you literally can't believe what the ending is because it would have been the first naive conclusion you would have come up with.

There's hundreds of items in this game. That's really cool! What's not cool is not having a way to fucking search through them. Need one particular item? You can sort but good luck figuring out how it sorts things. You need pretty good eyes for it.

The default keybinds are hell. The same key is used to interact people as it is to switch between your tools. Your party is basically dry-humping your leg the whole time so good luck not accidentally interacting with them. You can change this so not that big of a deal.

The NPCs are horrendously dumb. You rely on the NPCs to build, to till soil (which you can't do yourself), to create Earthy blocks, and so on. There are an infinite number of ways you can accidentally confuse the NPCs. One thing the game doesn't clarify is that there are boundaries to where you can build. If you build even one block outside of that boundary, your room will create but your NPCs will act like it doesn't exist. The game doesn't provide explicit boundaries for what's ""in"" and what's not. You have to figure that out yourself. There are times where you can't figure out why the NPC isn't doing its job and it ends up being a bug rather than something you're doing. Sometimes, you'll find your NPC sprinting up and down stares infinitely, going without sleep. This *will* happen. 

There's a whole aspect of the game, traps and ARPG elements, that become *entirely* useless at end-game. I have no idea why they did that. You're not rewarded for upgrading your gear after a certain point, and there's nothing to really do combat wise.

The recipes often have ridiculous arbitrary rules. Like if you want a throne room, it has to have a *stone* brazier, not a gold one! These rules are often confusing and it's pretty frustrating having to look up recipe specifics. You're given a book in game but each time you close it, you then have to find it again if you don't remember all of the specifics.

The UI in this game isn't that intuitive. Not much else to say. You're going to get lost in the UI a couple times or at least struggle to figure out how to get to a particular screen.

The story is... basic. I won't say it's horrible but it's too predictable. One thing that kills you is the dialog in this game. It's not that the dialog is bad, it's just the game doesn't give you a proper way to skip the dialog if you want to. Certain dialog is *not skippable* altogether and takes literally minutes for a paragraph of text go by. I've literally gotten up from my chair, gotten a drink, came back, and the same dialogue is still on the screen as when I left which you can't control. I don't understand how that passed any QC or QA.

This game lacks polish more than anything. I was expecting to have more control and a bit more fun in the end-game, which took me something like 50 hours to get to because I explore too much. The game was rewarding for exploration but not quite as much as I would have like.

The game doesn't track how to get resources or build things. If you look up the item in your Builderpedia, it will tell you where it can be built, it won't tell you with what ingredients. If you look up ""Strawberry"", it won't tell you where you can find them. At the least, it should track where you've found them in the past. It's absolutely impossible to remember how to get every resource in the game, they should have provided tools to help you. 

Combat really needed more. They try to make it this semi-important aspect but it's really half-assed. They could have done *so* much more with magic, weapons, gear, and so on. That said, given how dumb the AI is in this game, I'm not totally surprised they didn't want that to stand out more. When enemies fight your allies, they basically just run at each other without a care in the world.

This game has performance issues somehow. In particular, if you're exploring a new area, it hitches to the point of not being playable. If you're in an already explored area, it actually runs pretty well. Parts of the cutscenes dip down to ~10 FPS. I run a GTX 1080, not the newest but should more than handle things like that.

I didn't play the first one. I like the characters in this one... but I didn't really like the gameplay as much as I thought I should have. It was pretty much the hope that the end-game would be more than it was that kept me going or that I would find something amazing which never happened. After everything, there wasn't actually that much variation in things like flooring or roofing. They actually don't provide roofing like you would think. I'm fairly certain they didn't expect players to build multi-story buildings which makes my brain hurt.",1584872320,1584872320,False,23,5,0.52050250768661499,0,True,False,False

Only thing i would like added in would be voices for the characters and some more tips like what I am finding on BenXC's channel. For example you can set hay on fire and burn the tree down. When i went to build the world tree on the first island this would have been nice to know since i built a scaffold in order to hammer the tree down for parts. Would have saved me hours easily.

I'd never played a Dragon Quest game before this one, and even without 'getting it' I still
became completely addicted... my current 72hr playtime is from just over a single week!
I'm now most certainly a new convert to DQ, but Builders 2 ticks all of my boxes.

Almost every aspect of it is polished, well thought-out and rewarding or fun.
Building is fun, exploring is interesting, the story is predictable but full of charm.
I laughed out loud at some of the subtle jokes clearly intended for older audiences,
and could feel the huge love that the developers have for their craft throughout.

It feels like the best of Zelda, Minecraft and a far less complex Rimworld combined.
If you're a fan of building or have any minute interest in JRPGs, try the enormous demo!

Sure it cools to make houses for them, its cool to let them use certain buildings, but they all feel robotic. Every last one of the npcs. A builder/adventure game with city building elements is worth a lot less in my opinion if the npcs you work for and move in just use things in an A then B then C fashion. The sims series doesn't even do it right in my opinion. The closest I'd ever seen any game with a meaningful impact was back in the mysims series as a kid. This game has all the marks almost, lots of buildings, funny writing, some TD elements, upgrades for a lot of things, etc, the only hangup and for me it is a huge one, is the AI. One day I dream of a proper builder game with an openness like Dragons Quest Builders 2 but this isn't one of those games.

If you like games like Minecraft or collecting games, then this is for you. If you want a social city builder esque game I highly recommend you pass this one up. 

I have 35 hours in this game and I am leaving a negative review most people would call me idiotic but this is the conclusion I have come too. I enjoyed the first couple hours and then it started to hit me in the face with the real problem this game has for me at least. I seriously stuck out another 20 hours of slightly above boring gameplay in hopes of a more fleshed out system.",1584394380,1584394380,False,3,0,0.455811053514480591,0,True,False,False

Putting it simply, this is like Minecraft combined with an action RPG using the iconic Dragon Quest character and monster designs. Expanding on that, the RPG storyline is in a cute, humorous style, but still fully realised with multiple locations and scenarios designed to lead into the main building sections of the game unlocking new parts along the way, be they building blocks, weapons or armour.

Within reason you can freely build and craft for much of the story as you explore the World's multiple islands, with a big incentive to complete the story to unlock all the building parts, etc. From that point you can build to your heart's content and provide a good setup for the many NPCs living with you that will also help you in various tasks like farming and even assist in building.

Graphically it's a lot nicer than Minecraft with the ability to make some very detailed and varied environments, with very smooth and stable gameplay, there are also many other surprises that will not disappoint fans of building games.

All in all, if you like action RPGs and enjoy building games like Terraria, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, Planet Explorers, etc, you'll likely really like Dragon Quest Builders 2. Even if you're a fan of city building/sim games like The Sims or Cities Skylines; or farm games like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, there's also a lot you'll like about this game. 

There's a very generous free demo available on Steam that gives you a lot to play through and plenty of time for some of the more basic building and crafting. Though it's only a small faction of the overall game, I was happy to pay the full price long before reaching the end of the demo, that to be fair does leave you on a cliffhanger.

Overall it's extremely addictive with a great action RPG driving the core building gameplay. If you try the demo there's a high chance you'll end up buying the game, it really is that good for what it is.

My biggest issue is the weird pauses in conversations, there are points in the game that feels like the game just randomly pauses but you can still move the camera around (personal thought on this issue, I think when this happens its a hidden loading screen) these pauses can last from 10 seconds to 1 minute and 12 seconds (longest one i counted). so ya, good game but it has these issues.

Even those wouldn't be so bad if they were not full of almost indecipherable dialog that populates slowly and can't be skipped, and scenes where you lose character control for way too long for your toon to pose or perform a high-five. or listen to one of the other characters griping about something in a dialect where you can maybe make out every fifth word.  

I get trying to give characters odd slang and dialects, but they went so overboard that the story isn't even fun.  Seriously, anytime a dialog starts, I just set a paperweight down on my space bar and come back in about 5 minutes.  Same thing with loss of player control.  It's just a bad player experience when you fill up the game with mandatory pauses that serve absolutely no friggin' purpose whatsoever.  Finish doing something cool?  Stand by for about 10 seconds for a mandatory high-five.  Getting a lot of experience?  Stand by for another 10 seconds while your character poses with his builder-book.  Discover something new or get your quest item?  Prepare to wait 15 seconds before the dialog box decides to allow you to continue.  Adding new villagers to your town?  Hang tight for about 30 seconds.  When you hit the point where you think the game might be frozen, it'll finally let you click past that dialog and get back to playing.  For about a minute.  Until you do something else that makes it snatch control away from you.

The intro missions are only supposed to take a few hours if you play them straight through, but they are just so terrible that you'll find yourself wasting time doing anything BUT those missions.  Not that there's really anything you can do, because your abilities are locked until you decide to suffer through them.  

Whoever designed the game....never actually play-tested the game.

I think the building part will be a lot of fun...if I'm able to stomach enough of these awful missions.

I recommend the game, because I'm positive it will eventually, at some point, hopefully, maybe be fun to play if you ever make it past the @#$% intro missions.

Even when the plot does progress it is predictable and the same things get repeated over and over. If you don't explore then you miss out on stuff but if you explore too much then you straight up spoil the game for yourself because most areas aren't gated off and you can just wander into some place that you aren't meant to be for another 5 hours and the NPC's will just talk to you as though you had done those 5 hours, but it doesn't let you sequence break or skip things, even little things.

i adored this game so much on the switch that i happily picked it up again for pc when it went on sale. if this is your first time buying the game though, 100% recommend it, even at full price. especially since this is unquestionably the best version of the game-- it comes with all dlc and, as far as i know, all pre-order exclusive items included, which means compared to the $110 CAD price of the switch ver + season pass, it's a steal.

compared to the switch version (i can't speak to the ps4 one) this one really shines with how crisp it looks, as well as the lack of lag when lots of characters are in the area. setup is a little finnicky-- the resolution was weird on startup, and you have to restart the game for it to take effect-- but once it's going it's really all smooth sailing. i appreciate that controls are fully customizable as well, it's a basic thing that a lot of games fail to implement. 

as a general game, it's just really engaging! the plot is simple, but fun. the free building section is the bulk of the game for a lot of people though, with it's sandbox openness, and it's really enjoyable to sink into a large project while listening to an audiobook or podcast. if building and light material grinding are your sort if thing, i highly recommend. the dragon quest charm just adds to it.

There is leveling, equipment, boss fights, hilarity in the story, and it has a charm of being adorable. It has many hours of gameplay too. I have been focused on the story and I am not even halfway through the story for the hours I played.

I was mostly impressed that villagers have as much depth as they do in their mechanics. They sow seeds and harvest them, eat, and they even get in line to use the chamber pot! Some can be equipped to fight monsters if they aren't cowards. And monsters love to attack your base to wreck up the place like they are Richard Nixxon on Futurama.

The maps aren't infinite like minecraft, at least not in story mode. I'm not certain if another mode exists that can be played or unlocked.

I don't like how Japanese games tend to pile on tons of needless dialogue in their games. Just let me play! How new designer's haven't figured out that American's like Mario because those games don't open with 2 hours of reading is somewhat of a mystery. 

The thing I liked about the first DQB was there wasn't a lot of dialogue before you got into the game proper. I played it on Nintendo Switch. The thing I didn't like was the controls. I've just come to accept I'm not really a fan of controllers. I like my K&M! 

So when I saw DQB2 was on PC I was very excited! I wasn't as excited by the $60 price tag though; so I waited for a sale and got it just over $40, which I feel is reasonable. I would not recommend this game at full price.

The K&M controls are... lacking a bit of polish. I guess in Japan they just don't have PC's. They must program their games using controllers and write their code with a A to Z selection screen. There's like 20 buttons! How can a game that's made for a controller end up using triple that amount?! However, it's not terrible and the main buttons you'll need are right where you can press. One thing that's a bummer for me is I have a smaller keyboard without a number pad and they have some of the controls linked to the number pad....

The graphics are great! You can tell they put a lot of effort into making this game feel like you're playing a cartoon. Everything is 3D modeled, except maybe the vines. The game is colorful and fun to explore.

Then the one big downer for me is the game starts out with needless dialogue. Unlike the first installment, this game will have you spending the first 45 minutes or so just reading and not really playing the game. You start out on a pirate ship where they make you sit through a drawn out tutorial. One that the first game didn't really have. Then you find yourself on an island where... you do less playing and more reading for the tutorial. What the heck!?! Just give me the game! 

However, once you've pushed through the lengthy tutorial dialogue phase the game starts to open up and you can finally play the game you payed for and installed. It's the same goodness from the first game, but a little more streamlined. You have a sidekick that helps you with fights and gathering, which is very nice. 

OHhh, one more thing about the controls. I found it really difficult to break and place blocks until I found out you can switch to FPP. My recommendation is, if your using K&M, is to switch between 3rd and 1st person.",1583157495,1583157676,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The worst part of this game is the dialogue. Way too much and often interrupts your building. Some dialogue cannot be clicked through and stays on the screen long enough for you to read it 10-12 times before it disappears. Wouldn't be so bad if they had a voice reading it or something...
Also i think the island is a little too big. 3 different areas but your only allowed so many NPCs. Personally instead of 3 different areas it should have been 1 area and as you bring on newbies they all congregate together. When you finish a section of the main story then the tablet targets grow and you expand your town more.
Also there is still quite a bit of restriction on building designs, you can't always get a block the way you want it or turned certain ways and some blocks like steps do not have a corner block.

It's mystifying to me that this game isn't more widely-known and popular, because it is so good. It's easy to look at it and dismiss it as some Dragon Quest-skinned Minecraft clone, but it's so much more than that. 

For me, the core appeal of this game is the town-building aspect, which I felt they greatly improved in this one (vs. DQB1). It scratches the colony sim itch for me, but in a way that's more relaxed and less punishing. Your game isn't ruined if you don't build a specific lineup of facilities, but your gameplay is vastly enhanced if you DO build them. With new QOL additions like the magic pencil, which let's you create custom blueprints, it's even easier to set up multiple towns. The interaction with citizens and monsters is almost Animal Crossing-esque, too. They will regularly say and do things that make me laugh out loud, even after 100+ hours of playtime.

The weakest part of this game for me is the main campaign, which you must complete in order to access a TON of unlocks. It's incredibly dialogue heavy in a majorly ""quantity vs. quality"" sort of way, and by the end of the campaign I was beyond ready to be finished with it. I'm saying this as a long time Dragon Quest fan--the story is cute enough, but it's given much more screen time than it's due. Still, the main campaign isn't a BAD experience; it's just frustrating, as it eventually begins to feel like a heavily-padded obstacle between you and the real meat of the game. 

All that being said, the full package is well worth the frustrations. There is a staggering amount of unlocks/collectibles that lend a crazy amount of longevity to the game.

Pros:
‚Ä¢	Story mode provides probably 40-70 hours of play.  
Wide range estimate is dependent on whether you like side quest puzzles and whether you rely on spoilers when getting stuck (or if you accidently skip over directions and get stuck).

‚Ä¢	Lots of different building material variety and items/rooms to construct.

‚Ä¢	Appealing graphics (imo compared to my limited experience with other voxel games).

‚Ä¢	Fun ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù to discover and build.

‚Ä¢	Some depth to building different room types with the system of room ambience and townsfolk preferences.


Cons:
‚Ä¢	Combat is simplistic and not challenging.

‚Ä¢	Not much meaningful variety in crafting gear (which doesn‚Äôt matter much anyway due to the prior point).

‚Ä¢	Could be more clues on how to fill out missing recipes ‚Äì seems like townsfolk will randomly give you the recipes, but other than that only if it was involved in the story

‚Ä¢	More could be done with features such as the shop and robust number of food recipes.

You'll be introduced to the ""core loop"" of the game in the demo, so you do not have to rely on reviews alone. That said, the full game successfully builds on itself with unique tools, engaging NPCs, and a compelling story. It took me a little over 100 hours to acquire all Steam achievements, though that was at a bit of a leisurely pace.

Cons? No voices, and there are several points where you'll get frustrated by the ""slow dialogue"" prompts that are unskippable. The building mechanics and tools can get a little goofy, so you'll have to get used to the controls a little more than you might expect. Unlike other games where I would classify these issues as oversight by the designers, in this game I almost view it as a ""I wish they had worked on these more because it would make a great game even better.""

Pro-tips (or at least Platinum tips) to maximize your enjoyment: Let the story prompt you to build things as you progress. There are moments where large portions of the map are re-purposed for the story, and it will forcibly remove any prior work you've done in those areas. Build to your heart's content after that chapter wraps up when there are no more surprises to worry about.

For achievement hunters, the most time-intensive achievement involves the pet breeding. Start that early because there is an in-game time requirement that you can passively work through while doing other things if you plan appropriately.

Finally, do not hesitate to pop open the Wiki and look up room requirements and the like. There are a lot of undiscovered room designs even after completing the story, and if the game was meant to hint at those outside of the direct story quests, I never discovered them. Popping open one of the many helpful lists online just makes life a lot easier.",1581301274,1581301274,True,13,0,0.679345428943634033,0,True,False,False

The game is casual difficulty, but it's a change of pace if you're looking for something different and like block builders.  

I didn't run into any bugs, nor did I run into any performance/optimization issues.  

I give the game an 8/10.  

I'd say it's worth $60 if you like creating and building your own stuff in block builders, because that's added replay value.  If you're one of those people who doesn't care about that, and only wants to build the bare minimum for progression, and nothing more, then you should wait on the game to go on sale for $20-$30.",1580123668,1580124016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I still managed to beat the game, but had to abandon it afterwards. Then I saw it on Steam. Soooo I bought it again. Yes. I like this game so much, I bought it twice. And since it's on my PC, I don't have to share!

This game is good for people who don't necessarily like Minecraft or Terraria. You can build what you want, yes, but there is discoveries to be made for hours and hours. What rooms need what requirements, cooking recipes to discover, small islands to explore, and none of that counts the story or story islands. It's all sandbox at the end, but still has achievements you can go after as well as personal goals. You can also continue to build up previous islands. I like following blueprints so I know what to make. I don't have a creative bone in my body. Having recipes to tell me what to  put in what room is good for me. You won't see any grand pyramids in my game, but I can have fun all the same.

It has cons. For a minor one, I saw a typo. A typo in a $60 game, for real?? The most annoying part is in the storyline. There are portions of the story where there is text that is kind of narrative like, but not really. This is VERY annoying. Each small sentence stays on the screen forever and there's no way to speed it up, despite nothing happening other than reading. It takes so long, you can say every single letter in the sentences out loud and STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO GO AWAY. It drives me bonkers. The screenshot feature is also lacking. For example, you can take yourself out of the photo or everyone altogether. You can't take everyone out and leave you. The text for speech also remains and I don't want those. Also, you can have blocks just hanging in the sky. There's no physics when it comes to that and it is visually annoying.

It's charming as hell. A bright and beautiful world with memorable characters. There's LOTS of writing that while fluffy is wonderfully written. Characters have unique dialects that make them feel diverse in tone. The game is also brimming with content, with dozens upon dozens of hours of adventuring.

My adventure with Dragon Quest Builders has been started from first one, released on PS3 and PS Vita. Unfortunately I had Japanese version on my PS3 and with limited understanding I really enjoyed playing it.
I was wondering if it's possible a second game (DQB2) could be really better... but, once it was released, I decided to buy it and never regretted.

I don't want to repeat the same, as many of you wrote already and I don't want to spoil anything, so I will try to focus on my own experience.

First of all, if anyone just considering to buy this game DO NOT compare to Minecraft, as it's not better / worse game, it's different. I was amused how beautiful game could be created just based on brick, building, mining and fighting... but it was possible! 

I had a chance to test this game (for several hours) on quite old computer (Intel Dual Core E5200, GT 710 and 7GB of RAM (game has been installed on SSD drive). I was surprised - game was playable. I'm not trying to say it's best performance I ever seen, no it wasn't but it's still playable with reasonably good graphics quality. I just don't understand why strange resolution has been implemented, such as 1360x768 (instead of 1366x768).

If you are keyboard and mouse player, please consider to buy / use game pad, as this game is giving much more on game pad.

Is there anything I dislike? Yes, actually it is. I don't really like water mechanics, it's clearly visible when you will try to make some waterfall. Filing big hole with water, creating some sort of lake could be challenging and requires some of invention, but it's achievable.

I finish this game already... but can't say I completed. It's many places I haven't visited yet, many things has to be explored and I spend already more than 200 hours in this game. As the story is already known, I will be starting new game anytime soon and then, slowly I will carefully explore everything, patiently and once I achieve it, I will be playing game, once the game will be beaten (again) and see what else I can accomplish and what most important I hope I will be able to create whatever I want without being focus on actual goals.",1579856905,1579856905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While Minecraft is certainly deeper in its ability to create things, this has some nice mechanics of its own that are pretty fun to play with.

My main annoyance comes with the dialog for two reasons.  First, it holds your hand way too much.  Far too many times it would tell me to do something multiple times (in a row) or tell me to do something that I've obviously done multiple times.  It also has a mechanic where you can ask a quest giver to remind you of what you are supposed to do if you forget what you are doing, which is great.  But why didn't they use that mechanic for help instead of spoon feeding you at every turn?  

Second, there are some pauses during dialog that are really bizarre.  Much of the dialog you can press a key to continue, but sometimes it decides that you need to look at dialog for a lot longer than it would take anyone to read.  

In my second playthrough, I'm not paying any attention to the dialog, and so these aren't nearly as irritating, since I'm usually reading something else while I mindless press a key waiting for my character to regain control.  But you'd think they'd want you to enjoy the dialog if you are paying attention to it.  Just annoyances, but they were certainly present during my first playthough.

I experienced it through various YouTube creators, but seeing as it never came to PC, I was never able to experience it myself. When I heard about a sequel, I was pleasantly surprised that there would be a PC port, albeit a while after the console releases. In time, I forgot about the game once again, until it appeared in my Steam recommendations. Alongside this was a demo. I spent an impressive amount of hours playing this demo (at least 15+). Without regret, I purchased the game, and continued where I left off, and I regret absolutely nothing. 

I have no prior experience with Dragon Quest or it's story. It is generic, but fleshed out. It does have a lot of filler though. In the long run, it is building focused, but not as intuitive as Minecraft. If you research enough, you will be able to find a playstyle that is enough for you. 

There is no creative mode, but there are tools that allow you to get there. But I still think that true creative freedom can only be acquired through cheat engine and persistence.

I've never played Dragon Quest Builders 1, but I've seen an entire playthrough of it, and I loved the concept of it. I was planning to buy Builders 2 whenever I got a Switch, and was completely blown away by the fact they were releasing a PC port. Fingers crossed they release the the first Builders game on here too.
I started playing the demo, was completely hooked, and bought it day one. If you like 3D creative block building games like Minecraft, and like townbuilding action games like Terraria, this might be right up your alley.
Just bear in mind that this is a primarily singleplayer game. There are multiplayer options for the main island and the ability to share screenshots and constructions, but you won't be going through the main storyline coop.

If you're on the fence about buying this game, try out the jumbo demo. It lasts until near the end of chapter one, and that is plenty of time to decide if you like this game or not.",1578684818,1578684818,True,3,1,0.559272110462188721,0,True,False,False

First you should definitely pick up the demo, it's a reasonably sized download and has about 15 hours of play content in it even without building that much.  If you're enjoying that you'll obviously enjoy the full game, and your save loads right from the demo game so you continue exactly where you left off in it.

I usually am not that into certain kinds of JRPGs because the main characters so often act like grade school children.  In this story the characters were actually fun and interesting, still quirky and silly yet serious enough to feel like what you're doing matters and have the world be enjoyable overall.

The story isn't perfect or anything, most of the time it looks like we're being offered a choice as far as the story goes it's a false choice, you can't actually say no in places where you are expected to say yes.  You have freedom of choice when it comes to building and later on where it goes to where NPCs and monsters live, but the story is linear without choices even though it pops up choice screens quite often.  I don't really mind that much but I don't get why they give us the illusion of choice if we aren't really going to get one.

Still the overall story did intrigue me right from the very start.  It was hilariously different and didn't take itself that serious while still feeling serious.  The builder is a great main character even though they don't get much story (it's *you* in the story so I guess they didn't want to take that feeling away from us).  We get to do minor character choice designs including gender and a few things which is really nice.

I really wanted to play a building type game and saw the demo for this one and figured I would lose nothing trying it out.  I'm so glad I did.  I haven't enjoyed a game this much in years, especially a single player game (the single player story mode is approximately 80-90 hours long without even doing extra building and without counting going into multiplayer).

Your building options will keep growing as you progress through the story and there is a lot of interesting and cool stuff you can do there.

I'm not driven by single player games often, I don't ever get through games that take this long to play through their stories.  I give up after a few hours.  The fun of the story and building etc kept me stuck to this game all the way through.  I normally am hoping games end after 10-15 hours so I can get through the story and actually finish the game.  This one I would have been fine for probably a few hundred hours.

Not to sound too much like a broken record, but definitely get the demo if you are interested in the game.  It has a huge amount of content and as mentioned carries over into the full game if you buy it.  There really is no better way to see if the game is for you than to get their huge generous demo.

Some people seem to have an issue with the price.  This is a new PC game with 80-90 hours of story to play through before even getting into building for fun or multiplayer stuff.  It's detailed and beautiful and each island presents a new different way of doing what would otherwise sort of seem like the same kind of thing.  They did a great job of giving you quite different stuff to do along the way so that you switch things up a lot and don't get bored.

It also comes with all the DLC you had to buy separate on the console versions.  The fun and huge long story really make the game worth the money.  I've zero regrets and no issues about the price at all after playing the game.  It's just pure fun in a way I haven't got to experience a while in a game.

I don't normally do pro and con lists, and 98% of the game is really pros.  I did have a few issues I wanted to bring up however:

1 - You can carry so very much stuff in your inventory soon into the story that it can get hard to find stuff you are looking for (even though when you click to sort it they get put in a kind of order).  They could and should have added a search box for your inventory.

2 - The few times you can't move the text forward yourself, it goes painfully slow.  I don't know why they gave it that much time.  It's like they wanted to make sure people who were just learning to read and had to read very slow could read it over to themselves about 30 times to really get what it was saying.  It's a big irritation that I hope they will change up in the next ones if the game continues to get sequels in the future.

Those few cons don't take away much about the game.  I am full of things I'd like to see in sequels including getting to play the main quest co-op and not just do the building co-op, but overall this was one of the most enjoyable games I've played in my entire life.

I normally like more ""realistic"" RPGs but this one was a great mix of the quirky stuff and just being outright fun to play.  I was actually able to get lost in the story a bit.  They did a great job developing a lot of the characters and giving them their own personalities.  You grow attached to some, you hate others, but they all helped to make a really great world.",1578560160,1578560160,True,9,0,0.641625165939331055,0,True,False,False

I wanted to explore, I wanted to create, I wanted to build - but this game doesn't actually let you do any of that. It's a theme park ride, a tour - you will not so much as take a step outside of the carefully laid boundaries of your ""building"" experience, or be swiftly reprimanded and refused permission to progress. I've never played a game that keeps such a firm grasp on your hand for so long, to the point I was anticipating and expecting the next thing they would tell me to do before I even got there.
The writing is a complete joke, as I expect from Dragon Quest, but the peak of it is the game's incessant teasing of your partner's ""true nature"" and how he must awaken to it, in the form of unskippable floating text which hovers for an eternity per line before automatically advancing (no other dialogue in the game auto advances and there is no toggle to allow it to). This tedious ""god voice"" dialogue only gets more frequent and longer as the game goes on. It wouldn't feel so wasteful if they didn't thoroughly explain to you at the very start of the game that your buddy Malroth is in fact the Master of Destruction, but since he has amnesia they keep pushing it on him until, I suspect, he becomes the final boss or something after you're done building.
Eventually they drop all pretenses and rip away all control from you as your character is captured and thrown in a prison, enforcing slow, menial repeated tasks and identical dialogue for days while exposition is passingly thrown at you. This entire sequence ends up having no bearing on the rest of the game once you escape, which was really my final breaking point.
I don't want to play it anymore. I'd rather pretend I never played it. But since that's not an option, and I got the game to build with friends, I'll probably end up trudging through it and see if it gets better by the time it hits free build mode.

Edit: So yeah, that's exactly what I did. Verdict: no, the main progression of the game never gets any better. The third leg of the game introduces a base defense aspect with traps and chokepoints, but again, this is all done for you, and half the monsters aren't stopped by your defenses anyway, so it feels flaccid. Due to plot contrivances you also lose access to your destructo-buddy for the rest of the game so the molasses-paced god voice can convince him he's evil, making the already tedious combat take even longer as you lose both his raw power and your huge aoe team attack, which they eventually compensate for by giving you command of a squad of NPC soldiers to literally play the game for you.
And once you get home and prepare for the finale of the game as you're warned of a point-of-no-return trigger? Grab something to eat, because it takes exactly as long to get through as the last leg did, marred continuously by odd side-jobs and fetch quests. It's not like there's anything you have to be worried about leaving behind anyway, since the game has strict level caps per area and you literally invent alchemy to forge the tools you need to build the final project, with superior weapons and armor simply dropping from scripted enemies.
In the end, [spoiler]it's one of those games that puts you in a spaceship and makes an on-rails shooter of the final boss, like Kirby or Devil May Cry, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't effectively a playable cutscene as your attacks are frequently rendered null so you can magically add new powers to your ship, while each time you take lethal damage you're automatically repaired. [/spoiler] You save the world, credits roll, you get your buddy back, and bam, you're now free to build whatever you want. Your clear reward is a recipe for an ultimate hammer, the ingredients of which including materials you've never seen up to this point.
Good luck. See if you can complete all the remaining build objectives like ""make 300 farmland tiles on these rolling desert hills"" and ""build 25 room types that nobody will tell you the composition requirements of unless you look up a google doc in the steam community section, which is also slightly incomplete and might catch you off guard that a Reception Room specifically requires an unlocked furnishing called a Wall Hanging, as opposed to any other item in the 'Wall Hangings' section."" You might even get rewarded once in a while with a hat or a completely useless copy-paste tool that physically places the bounding box on the ground and counts from the inside corner rather than the outside, making it impossible to copy rooms without knocking out the walls. But hey, these extra-curricular activities on your island are the only thing you're able to do with friends, so you might as well make the most of that.

I'll be honest, I'm not the kind of guy who can slap-bang together a beautiful mansion in Minecraft. I just go with the flow and hope I'm making something good. So maybe me and this game were never going to be a good match. But the constant vice grip on my wrist combined with the miserably plodding pace that it pulled me forward really dulled any hope I had that I was going to enjoy this game about dragons, questing, and building. I've been enjoying embellishing my castle that the NPCs intentionally did a very poor job of constructing before the game ended, but I wish it didn't take fifty hours to unlock it all. Only stuck to it because I had friends around to keep me company as I spiraled into this abyss, but it would have been nice if they could actually play through it with me, and not simply parallel to me for us to meet on the build island at the end of it all.

DQB series is based on building up communities of NPCs.  Your job is to gain favor from them by building different kinds of rooms and buildings for them, providing them with materials needed to utilize those buildings, and performing quests.  You do this in a block-based world similar to Minecraft where the world is mostly destructable, and where you can place blocks down to get to high places.  The freedom and variation given to you in how to build structures is unparalleled in any other kind of game and is the biggest selling point.  For example:  An NPC might ask for a room with a stool, bed, and torch.  Where you put that room and how big it is will impact how happy they are with you, but nothing stops you from cramming them in the smallest space possible either.  

You are also rewarded for creating different types of rooms, of which there's over 100 types to choose from.  

This goes beyond simple Minecraft AI as well.  You aren't just creating a static town.  NPCs have their own schedules based on the NPC and time of day.  They have work times, meal times, and bed times, and each NPC has their own unique job and fits well with their character development in game.  Think of it like RimWorld if you've ever played that, but with well developed characters that you know in advance and which are very expressive and unique in personality.

Two things to realize about this game:
#1 -- The story and much of the gameplay is geared toward the younger side.  Because of this, expect some simplistic, toned-down themes, and a lot of the game is easy, although things can get difficult if you aren't paying attention or get cocky and fight something much stronger than you.  Not the easiest game in the world but it's still on the easier side (at least what I've played).

#2 -- The game is very story heavy.  There's a lot of dialogue in this game.  This isn't just a reskinned Minecraft with a light story slapped on top of it.  The story is a major part of the game as much or more than the building.  If you're put off by no voice acting, or long dialogue chains, you might want to rethink purchasing this.  

#3 -- I saw an IGN review that basically trashed the game's rating because of its combat.  If you have to have a rolling dodge batman-style X button masher of a combat game then this game might not be for you.  This game is similar to Minecraft regarding actual gameplay, and combat is no exception.  Most of the nuance in combat relies less on quick timing and more on watching animation patterns.  It feels good to get out of range of huge attacks in the nick of time while unleashing a fury of attacks as a counterattack, so it's not horrible, but it is simplistic.

Basically you have a main base island, and the story revolves around you sailing to other islands to get new citizens/materials/designs to build up your island. You build rooms and fill them with different items to create specific kinds of rooms and the citizens then live in and craft in the towns you end up making. theres a ton to explore and build and collect and generally speaking its pretty engaging.  I just found myself collecting everything I could find and experimenting with my ever growing kit of building tools to make bigger and better things.

Pros-

fun building

lots to collect including outfits, mounts, monster buddies, villagers, and various building materials

has more of a story than other games in this genre

as a soft kind of village sim to it where your citizens will go about their day and interact with whatever you built.

cons

combat is super barebones. They could have at least included a dodge roll. Instead its just really clunky and I prefered to have companions do it for me.

annoying hunger bar. I get lost in my building and don't like to sit on the cooking fires  all the time so I ran out of food quite often. When you go hungry your character starts to gasp for air and gets a little stun after each action. It gets really annoying and it really didn't add anything to the game. I am not a fan of hunger systems in most games and this was felt very out of place. I think I would have prefered it if food just gave buffs and fed villagers. 

annoying bug where my tool key bind and my weapon key bind would swap, especially after using the Buggy, forcing me to reset to default controls a lot through the menu.

dialogue is done through text but they leave the lines hanging on the screen with no way to push the script meaning short cutscenes where only a sentence or two of dialogue will hang on the screen for like 15-20 seconds or something. Just felt like a lot of downtime where I was left staring at a screen waiting for the next line to scrawl by.

Overall though I came for the building and that part I very much enjoy and it was a nice pitstop on the long wait for Hytale.",1578090113,1578090113,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's easy to assume on the surface that is is a Dragon Quest skin of Minecraft but it's very unfair to compare the two, as both games excel in different ways. Dragon Quest Builders 2 is first and fore-most a narrative driven experience that's about characters. It gives you a huge amount of freedom over your world but in the end, it is narrative focused, and succeeds brilliantly at it.

Taking on the hallmarks of classic JRPGs from which it was inspired, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is full of characters with personality, dreams, goals, and unique flair. While it uses a classic style of conveying story through text boxes, you will still feel yourself connecting to the concerns and interests of most of the major NPCs you encounter. Above all, their presence helps to solve one of the worse problems of playing single-player sandbox builders: loneliness. You won't have to worry about there not being a purpose to your building. If you decide to build a big town or a huge castle, there's actually people to live and occupy that space. They aren't just set dressing either, as NPCs can take on jobs of their own and help do farming, cooking, drink mixing, crafting, fighting, even building.

It's here I'd like to address perhaps the most common criticism against this game: The limitations. Many players, particularly early on will notice that the game seems to railroad you into the plot right away and not give you much early access to a true sandbox world to do as you please. The game gates new recipes and content behind story checkpoints and quests to ensure you stay on your path. The gameworlds, while quite enormous in their own right, are also hand-crafted and pre-made rather than procedurally generated, which also makes them finite. To deal with this issue the game does have some randomly created islands you can visit frequently to acquire resources. The other limitations are often associated with the range in which your NPCs will operate. Every town has a strict border and only buildings within that town are considered part of it. This only really affects whether or not citizens of that town can interact with those buildings, as you are actually not restricted from building anywhere you please except in a very few spots (most noted by story objectives). It may seem easy to dismiss these limitations as indications that the game is inferior to other voxel-based builders but I would argue it is actually what makes the game shine and be unique. The story adds purpose to your building and allows you to design as you wish while still having a guiding hand, you are not restricted from building how you want, but you are also encouraged to play your part in the world's narrative. From a purely mechanical standpoint, these limitations also give a much more interesting world to navigate. While the randomly generated islands are great for resource gathering, you can easily see they would be poor replacement for the carefully hand-crafted main islands that the game takes place on, which is often full of incredible locations to visit including huge mountain ranges, dense swamps, ruined towns, castles, mines, even dungeons. This world is full of life too, as countless NPCs will be encountered and even seek to join your town that you take from a ruined landscape into a bustling village where people run everywhere intent on their daily lives all thanks to your efforts.

The game brilliantly also mixes in it's open-ended sandbox island into the main narrative as a hub of sorts from which you launch your quest into each chapter island. The Isle of Awakening where you start and will ultimately spend most of the game at is your home island which gives you total freedom to build and design as you wish with a much larger town radius to allow NPCs to interact with the world. After each story chapter you will return here to further develop the island and it's up to you how long you decide to stick around and freeform build as you wish before heading to the next area. The game also has an incredible amount of progression, consistently unlocking new content as the game goes on so that even late into the game you still feel like you are gaining access to new features, recipes, and skills. 

The game has a few shortcomings, but none I would consider to be deal-breakers. Water physics are notoriously bad and it makes building anything using water or underwater a dubious affair. There is a bug with some of the floating text for story moments that causes it to linger for an insufferably long time on-screen, but these are thankfully few and far between. Combat, while present, is incredibly simple with your main tactics being to simply run in and smash the attack button, and run away when their attack animation stats. It can be entertaining but is rarely challenging by any measure. All in all the game is well crafted and is an excellent story-based open world sandbox base builder.

I have played the original Dragon Quest Builders on Vita to completion, and most of Dragon Quest Builders 2 on Nintendo Switch prior to it's PC release. My playtime on Steam does not reflect my time spent with this game in total. It is well worth playing and the PC version is thankfully one of Square Enix's better ports with no glaring issues.

BUT here are a few things you should know about:
- mouse and keyboard is viable but the camera and selection can be a little rough at time, especially if people get in the way while following you
- there is very little control over what your followers do (i.e. Wait Here command)
- combat is a little simple.  it makes sense but I wish there was a little more depth in line with typical JRPGs from the era this represents.  I get combat isn't the focus, but it would be nice for a little extra depth as there is a fair bit of combat in the game
- the monster designs are beautifully classic, I never played a DQ game, but have seen the images of the monsters and these are fantastic models of them.
- I wish it was a little more RPG like at times, or at least hope it ends that way (I know it doesn't from what I read) but it would be fun and interesting to travel to other islands (designed by people) and explore dungeons they have built.

Although there are a lot of small itty bitty things that can gnaw at you, it doesn't take away from the incredible journey you will get from this game itself. If you like to build things in the world of Dragon Quest while getting to live through a wonderful Dragon Quest story, this is the game for you!

To start the setting of the story, it takes place after the original Dragon Quest II, yes that exact same game from 1987. Now any more into this would actually be cutting into spoilers alert so I won't go further on this point. Like I said, this is 100% a Dragon Quest game story that will keep you involved through and through although the immersion can be broken multiple times as you farm, take care of your farm animals, and build many kinds of structures. Is this Minecraft/Harvest Moon? I dunno. 

It's quite similar to its predecessor, Dragon Quest Builders, but vastly improved across, well, pretty much everything. Although the inventory system is still ass, I can spend about 2-3 minutes trying to look for one specific item... Couldn't have killed them to add a 'Search' feature. Unless it does have it and I don't see it. Stacked with so much blocks, it's really hard to look for things and this is probably my biggest gripe for the entire game.

Dragon Quest Builders 1 got me so bored after a few hours I didn't bother finishing the game. Won't go into too much but it felt massively redundant to do anything considering you just lose most of it progressing to the next bit. Dragon Quest Builders 2 got this covered up. Anything you collect, build, and whatever you do, can be bought back home with you to your main hub and once you complete the story islands, you can revisit with all the materials you have. If you feel like you want to spend more time on those story islands instead of your main one, feel free to do so.

This game does hold your hand for a very long time because a lot of building blocks and materials don't get unlocked until you progress through the main story so if you want to build a castle early on? Well you'll have to build a wooden one until you can replace it with castle materials.

There's so much that could be said about this game and it's honestly better if you just jump into it instead. I think this is my most half-assed review but the issue is that the good things about this game can be very spoiler alert-ly and I've pretty much addressed all the things one can expect diving into the game.",1576991091,1576991091,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is really really incredible.

The lore is amazing, i loved every single step of the storytelling, it made me push forward and continue the building as long as possible.

There is a lot to do even after the game main story end, so i will stay playing it for more and more hours.

Every single npc has it own personality and it make the game more and more enjoyable.

I don't need even mention the soundtrack because it's dragon quest it's always amazing!

Dragon Quest Builders 2 is an RPG that goes all in on the building mechanics of the game. There is an entire story that revolves around the very act of building.  Your main story, side-quests, puzzles, and even some combat encounters rely on the act of building.  While the characters can be a bit cheezy, DQB2 knows what it is and knows what it wants to do.

The building mechanics in the game are amazing and improve on the already impressive first game.  There are a variety of tools that assist you in making builds that you want.  There are several networking features that allow you to share your creations with other players as well.  There are literally hundreds of building pieces waiting to be unlocked, and as far as I can tell, this can lead to some beautiful creations.

The only real drawback to this game is it's limited co-op.  You can play with other players, but are limited on what you can do together.  Either way, it's still fun to build towns or even cities together, so co-op is still welcome.  There's a lot more I can say, but I'll leave you with this:  Go download the free jumbo-demo, and if that doesn't suck you in, then this game isn't for you.

You dont get a lot of space to build on the multiplayer island, especially if you don't finish the whole questline, which means you have to go through dozens of hours of gameplay to get a bit more space to build.

I am only upset that I will have to wait for another installment to get more out of the game, because the DLC currently in play is pretty paltry compared to the scope the game gives you with each island.  They did such a good job of breaking each island out and making you almost start over, that I really thought that the DLC was going to be more islands, what with the formula for each story island not being too impacted by the Hub island's progression.

A fantastic relaxing Building Rpg with all the goodness from dragon quest combined with the sandbox/building aspects from games like minecraft.

The game is fantastic, the world and lore are all from the amazing franchise dragon quest. 
The combat is fun, the soundtrack is awesome and the amount of content here will keep you bussy for hours and hours.

If you are a dragon quest fan then don't even hesitate, the game IS dragon quest in every shape and form.
If you like RPG's then this should be on your list of games to buy.
If you want a relaxing adventure with tons and tons of things to do, then don't wait.

No its not minecraft and it shouldn't be. Its not supposed to be a minecraft clone so don't come in expecting it to be minecraft. With that said the game is fantastic. For me it feels like a cross between The Sims, Dragon Quest (Obviously) and a little minecraft since it does have building mechanics, although also way different. The game runs perfect with just my Gtx 970 and 60 fps at 1080 with almost everything maxed. I do however have the game on an ssd so that could make a difference.

I'm about 13 hours in and I feel like I have just began. The farming in this game is really addictive and so is the building also interacting and doing quests. Reason I said it feels like the sims is because you have all these guys who live with you on the base/land and they do things for you like, cook, farm, etc which is really cool. Though also way different to the sims haha, I just didn't know what else to really compare it to to be honest.

Pro's:
- Building game
- Farming
- RPG Elements
- Quests
- Exploration
- Funny
- Cute
- Inspiring
- Fun
- Highly Addictive

Cons:
- Some weird bugs - for example during the furrowfield festival event I was supposed to speak to Pastor Al but somehow he got spawned on top of a big tree.
- The pacing seems a little off at times, though could have just all been in my own head.
- Sometimes the npc's/quest givers will go on and on for too long talking way too much and going way off topic to the point I will just skip a few dialog boxes here and there. Does my brain in a little

Quality of the port is good. Mouse+keyboard control works perfectly for this game, I didn't have to remap anything as I usually do in other ports because control in them feels unusable. Buttons in hints, help articles and dialogues were translated for mouse+keyboard setup instead of A, B, X, Y as on controller (not many developers care to address this thing and just leave controller buttons displayed everywhere). Performance is great even on my 7 years old PC (you can test it with demo before buying the game). There was small problem that camera was moving too slow with mouse but it was easily solved by changing Mouse sensitivity (don't mistake it with Camera Rotation Speed) setting.

The gameplay is interesting. You are collecting materials, crafting items on workstation, anvil, fireplace or something else. You sometimes have to craft predefined blueprints by preparing required items and positioning them according to provided scheme. But you are also free to create different buildings in settlement to set up it however you want. People sleep and work in rooms, so you need to craft different types of rooms so that they can do some basic things, like cooking. People who do things that they like reward you with hearts that can be used to develop the town on story islands or to buy new recipes on a special island. There are several hundreds of different room types, recipes for some of which are given during the story and some of which you should discover by yourself.

Story progresses on several islands which provide a lot of places to explore. You are usually free to build anything, climb everywhere, but some tools (like better hammer which can break more items) are slowly discovered during the story.

I absolutely recommend DQB2 to anyone who likes games like Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and Minecraft. Each of these are really different in their own ways, but DQB2 has a little bit of all of them (and also improves upon what DQB1 had to offer): it has characters and a story that are charming, silly, and dare I say even heartwarming; the world feels lived in because NPCs use the stuff you build; the world feels fleshed out thanks to drawing from DQ lore; you can get really creative and build some incredible things (check out the noticeboard for some inspiration!). There's farming, building, cooking, and some RPG elements. Sadly there is no dating/marriage like in Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley/Rune Factory, which would actually be pretty cool. 

There are some negatives to this otherwise awesome game, though, that could be deal breakers for some and are worth mentioning:
- During the main story, there are limits to what and where you can build; you have to beat the story to build completely freely
- Your tasks during the main story can become repetitive and tedious (formulaic); at times the story seems to progress slowly and/or is railroaded ([i] looking at you, [spoiler] Moonbrooke [/spoiler] [/i]). 
- Related to the above point, there is some hand holding/tutorialness throughout the story
- There isn't a lot of customization options for your character (hair, eye, and skin color only in the beginning, hair and accessory options opening up later)

The negatives above were pretty minor for me. If you want a better idea/aren't sure, give the demo a try! It lets you play through the entire first chapter.",1576209114,1576209538,True,5,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Fans of the DQ series will find lots of familiar faces, sounds, and humor to enjoy.  Fans of building games will enjoy the huge amount of building freedom you have after you finish the first story island.  

The difficulty is low, so don't expect this to challenge you like some survival games such as Conan Exiles or ARK.  You have to eat, and farming/cooking are definitely an important part of the game, but the difficulty leans more towards ""Stardew Valley"" than anything difficult.  But the quests and the desire to build up your main base become engrossing enough that the simplistic combat doesn't matter so much.

In addition, this is a game you can play with your kids, without worrying about gore or overtly adult situations.  It's a great way to get the kids in your life interested in the bigger Square/Enix world, but deep enough to make grizzled old veterans smile and marvel when a new set of blueprints or 'room plans' becomes available.

Speaking of rooms, building rooms is actually important.  Need nightsoil for fertilizer?  You had better build a bathroom.  Build a bath house, and your villagers will line up to take a bath in the evening, (and complain that the line is too long.)  Throw a swing under a tree?  Everyone in the village gives you happiness points when they go for a leisurely swing after a hard day toiling in the fields.

Monsters spawn periodically and raid your base, so there is a small element of tower defense, though it is not very deep or difficult.  However, neglect your base for too long, and you might come back to broken fences and ruined fields.  

The storyline is fairly linear and basic... (oh no! The land is despoiled!  We need to bring nature and beauty back!)  but this is Dragon Quest... simple, goofy fun is one of the hallmarks of the series, after all.

All in all, this is a great game.  I am truly enjoying my time with it, and I'm a middle aged grizzled old gamer.

First and foremost, do not just read these these reviews, go play the Jumbo Demo! It has like 15% of the game in it. It is huge. You can easily sink 50+ hours into if you are the creative type. I think I had just about 40 hours and it is technically my second playthrough. 

The game play area is divided into primarily 4 islands. 1, the Isle of Awakening is kind of your ""base of operations"". You get full access to everything you have unlocked in the story there to do whatever you want with. The other 3 main islands are story islands. Each one has a unique story behind why you have to restore the island to its former glory with your magic builder skills. After you complete each story island, you come back to the Isle of Awakening and have a series of quests to integrate what you unlocked/learn mechanics wise into your main island. The demo has the full first story island up until the very last quest so it has a significant chunk of the game in it. 

[b] The Good[/b]

The game is a great creative sandbox/town builder and it has a halfway decent story. I have never really played the other Dragon Quest games, but it feels like a classic questing ARPG where you are given a series of quests you have to do to progress mixed with a sandbox builder like Minecraft. There is also a ton of town building aspects. You can create blueprints and have your villagers build them, make farms, set up shops and other things for your villagers to do to keep themselves happy while also making some useful stuff for you. 

The game also runs way better than it did on the Nintendo Switch. It is so nice to be able to way around with more than 20 FPS. I also flew through so many things on the first island I remember being painful or taking forever because of the higher frame rate. 

The game is also made by the same guy that did Dragon Ball, so if you are a fan, you will love all of the references. 

[b]The Bad[/b]

This game is a console port. That is clear in some places. Locked FPS cap of 30 or 60. Some of the controls are bit weird (not nearly as bad as Dark Souls, but still kind of janky). Some of the textures are also pixelated as it looks like they were never scaled up for higher resolutions (I am only playing on 1080p, but the Switch version was 720p, I believe). 

The game also used Denuvo according to Steam. I know that is a hard nope for some people. I am not sure if have just not played a bunch of games with it or not, but Denuvo has not really affected my performance at all. My CPU (i7-6700k) runs at < 15% pretty much consistently and I am not noticing any horrible FPS drops. 

The ""multiplayer"" is also pretty bad as well.  The full game and story itself is not multiplayer. Only a very limited subsection of the game is. You can open your main Isle of Awakening for others to join and play with you, but you cannot do your story or go to any of the 3 main story islands while ""online"". There are some other things on the island that just do not work either when online. Like the Isle of Awakening ""achivements"".",1576005539,1576006333,True,133,2,0.888657569885253906,0,True,False,False
