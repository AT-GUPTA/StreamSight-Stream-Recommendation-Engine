HISTORY

Age of Empires II is the greatest Real Time Strategy game ever made. It was releases in 1999 and I've played it ever since. In 2013 we finally got the HD edition - a modern version of the game to be played through Steam. In 2015 and 2016 we got more expansion packs and finally in 2019 we got a total remake of the entire game in this glorious Definitive Edition. Every year since we've received 1-2 DLCs/year, and the first for 2024 has just been announced - it's insane!

The love for this game from both community and developers is one of a kind and I've never seen such massive dedication before, maybe with the exception of Remedy Entertainment. Playing AoE 2 DE in 2024 is the best it has ever been, 25 years later. How is this possible?!

All the DLCs have something to offer and there's none that I wouldn't recommend.

GAMEPLAY

The game is simple. Crush your enemies by any means necessary. Sometimes the campaigns have other goals as well and the 300+ scenarios are deeply varied. This is most likely the longest RTS game ever made, but since the scenarios are all self contained it never feels boring.

You mix your tactics with both economy where you build a city and fortresses as well as gathering the 4 resources of food, gold, stone and wood. Everything you do will cost resources from one or more of these 4 basic ingredients. The rest is up to you.

This game gives you total freedom like no other game for infinite replay value. You can also challenge yourself by increasing the difficulty level or hunt for any of the Steam Achievements.

This game is absolutely amazing and stands the test of time after 25 years. It's the best strategy game ever made and can be enjoyed by young and old alike.",1575475162,1708780418,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

[h2]The good points[/h2]
[list]
[*]The graphics are good without requiring a powerful machine and are still faithful to the original game.
[*]All the original campaigns are here, with some modifications to try to balance them.
[*]3+ years after the release, we can say that this version is the most responsive we ever had, there are still pathing issues and such but the game does feel good to play.
[*]The game has a ranked system for the ones who want to go competitive. It is not the best ranked system of all times, but it does work. There is also a OK lobby system to organize games with your friends.
[/list]
[h2]The bad points[/h2]
[list]
[*]The settings page of the game is horrible, the keybindings reset for no reason and you need external websites to set them up correctly.
[*]Each official update is a mess and introduces a lot of bugs. Be prepared to be unable to play the game for 1 week each time.
[*]DLC contents are... questionable?

The good:
- it's a very deep RTS with lots of interesting viable strategies and randomly generated maps keeping every game fresh
- many QoL improvements over the original AoE2: you can shift-click to queue multiple commands for a unit, you can attack-move, there's control groups (aka unit bookmarks), there's a global production queue, etc
- there's matchmaking! with a big community so you can usually get matched in about 2 minutes. with someone of the same skill.
- you can spectate live matches in-game, which is a nice way to enjoy the game without the stress or commitment of actually playing.
- balance improvements over the original, such as much-needed buffs to melee infantry
- very strong AI opponents. in most RTS games (including original AoE2) the hardest AI setting is just the second-hardest with a massive artificial advantage, but in this game it plays fair. it plays like a human in so many ways you wouldn't expect. it's very tough, and rewarding to beat.

the YMMV:
- music. i'll always miss the original music from my childhood. thankfully, most of the definitive edition's music is remixes and new tracks rather than removed tracks, but I wold still rather the originals, especially the main menu music.

the bad:
- horrible unit pathfinding. it is so common and so frustrating to lose games because your units just go the fucking opposite direction as you order them, or they just get stuck and can't attack anything. villagers take the long way around obstacles for no reason, and get stuck on each other, or just stuck on thin air, and forget their task and go idle.
- lots of other in-game bugs. town bell (tells your villagers to hide from attackers) not working properly. villagers ordered to build a wall sometimes skip a tile for some reason, letting the enemy in. etc.
- lots of out-of-game bugs too. lobbies bug out. menus bug out. and when the menus aren't bugging out, they're the laggiest thing in the known universe for some reason (the game itself does not lag).
- they removed LAN multiplayer :(
- questionable monetization. they're selling DLC civs, so you can face people in ranked games who are playing civs you can't. it's not necessarily pay to win because the DLC civs aren't blatantly stronger than the base ones, but up to you how annoying that is. they're also hella overpriced for a game that already costs money.",1704689753,1708646582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After AoE3, the series sort of went dormant for a long time, so I was surprised to find out about the HD Edition and then the Definitive Edition releasing within the past decade. There has been a lot of content and QoL improvements added to AoE2 since it's original release, and the franchise has experienced a much-deserved revival as of late.

All the core RTS elements are present, but the rock/paper/scissor gameplay is unmatched. Without a doubt the core DE game and Return of Rome are the best value if you can't afford every DLC.  That provides you with the majority of the game's civilizations as well as access to the updated and most playable version of the original Age of Empires. The depth to this game is endless, with each civilization feeling a little bit different and allowing the player to tackle scenarios in distinct ways.  Perhaps the only downside is the sheer breadth of the game for those starting out.  The original release of Age of Empires II had 13 civilizations, but now, if you purchase every DLC, there are 45! This is great for people who have kept up with the game, but may seem overwhelming trying to discover every civ bonus and identity if you are new to the series.  Too much content is rarely an issue, but for anyone considering the competitive scene it may be tough to get your feet under you.  All in all, however, this is one of those rare near perfect games.

And not only is it still around, its doing better than ever. Very rarely do we see a company, especially as big as Microsoft, take good care of their IPs. But that's exactly what they did with AOE2. And the care shows. The community is still around. Not only has AOE2 endured, but it's thriving. It makes me so happy to see this. Not only because AOE2 is my childhood, but happy to see a company treat such a legendary game with respect. This is the result - a thriving, engaged community, and a budding e-sport. I see the community on youtube. I see them engaged, I see them excited. It's incredible to watch.

Contrast this to Blizzard, who mishandled and destroyed Warcraft, completely disrespecting and looting the small Warcraft 3 playerbase with their botched release of Reforged. No apology, nothing. Just greed and disrespect. Warcraft, the IP that put Blizzard on the map. 

It makes me so happy to see AOE2 thriving. This is a proper update to the game, modernizing the engine, updating the graphics but keeping the aesthetic true to the original, and expanding the game just enough for new content and for new players. Well done Microsoft, well done. People can hate on Microsoft all they want, but whoever is handling AOE2 knows exactly what they are doing, and more importantly, they respect AOE2 for the venerable, legendary game that it is, and recognizes the potential it has for being a little bit of an e-sport of it's own.

The good:
The population increase allows incredible huge battles even in 1v1 games. Turbo features which i have not use much as i prefer the classical gameplay can make for intense fast battles and more engaging stalemate periods. The new ai play smarter somewhat and multible ai options make it good for multible play styles. All of the new nations i have played so far are astonishingly balanced and fit right in.

The bad:
Elephants everywhere if you play full-tech like i personally do. Lag but that is to be expected though out of battle the game runs extremely well the only mayor issue for me being corpses instead of living units idk why. Games are a lot shorter which is not a true negative but i do miss old school games that went up to 30 hours and spanned weeks of play. Cloud storage for game saves might get frustrating but i do not fully understand if its a backup or a main way of saving. Map sizes feel a lot smaller or it might just be faster units. The standard ai is overly agressive and the surplus of relics fules the endless high tier unit spam. Defensive ai(CD) dose not wall up as good as it used to in the 1999. version which i do sorely miss. 

I do love this game both me and my dad which are long time original players are well supprised and we both love our time ingame so far. I am yet to finish a campaign or play multiplayer but neither of us ever did do either. Game is still as brilliantly balanced and unique among rts games as it ever was if not more so and i will happily be playing it for 10 years more and longer.",1707413834,1707413834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All the civilizations seem to balance each other out from my experience, and the many customization options allow for complete balancing where all nations have the same upgrades regardless.

It has aged beautifully (with the help of some refreshes) and stands as the steadfast bastion for modern day RTS games to emulate. 

9.5/10 as no game is flawless there are some minor bugs, but everything gets fixed in a timely manner

Edit: This game is worth every cent and the developers care about balance and the community

This game needs to be in everyone's library, period.


Update: With the addition of Lords of the West, it is an amazing expansion. I have always wanted an Edward Longshanks campaign given that he is your enemy in the tutorial campaign. After literal decades it finally happened and it's an amazing campaign!!! Balance changes for multiplayer are being worked for the Burgundians and Sicilians, but overall the expansion is worth the money if you love this franchise or if you just want to add two solid factions to your mix.

Update: Dynasties of India was added, all 3 campaigns were extremely fun and presented some of their own challenges. I can say as of writing that I have completed every single campaign that the game has to offer and quite a few of them I'd play again. Highly recommend all the DLCs, if you don't have the money for it upfront just wait for a sale. They are all worth the full asking price though. 

Update: Completed the Return of Rome campaign. I believe it is well worth the money despite some disliking because it is basically an excuse to port over AoE1DE. You basically get both games rolled into the same, but it does add 3 new campaigns with the AoE2 storytelling style and after beating the original AoE1 campaigns again you realize just how much better AoE2's take on storytelling is. With the completion of this DLC, I have completed all DLC currently available as of 01/31/2024. Every DLC outside of the cosmetic DLC is very worth it imo, it adds hours upon hours of campaign gameplay and new civs/refreshes.

This game continues to receive love and support from the developers and they do listen to community input. Of any RTS I have ever played it is absolutely insane how well balanced each of the civilizations are with just how many there are. Some are stronger against certain civs than others, but player skill is the biggest defining factor in whether or not you will lose your matches. There really aren't any civs that ""hard"" counter another civ, they can all be played and as long as you understand your civs strengths and weaknesses it truly does come down to player skill. This game is and will continue to be a staple in the RTS genre of what every RTS game should aspire to be like. In my opinion there is no other RTS game that even comes close to the overall experience AoE2 gives you both in the single player aspect and multiplayer. The community is also pretty awesome as well!

DLC ranking imho (best to worst):
Lords of the West
Dynasties of India
Dawn of the Dukes
The Mountain Royals
Return of Rome

Awesome job with all of the actual campaign related DLC. Couldn't care for the cosmetic DLC, but if you play a lot of community games/PvP it might be worth getting just to have some cool avatars and other useless cosmetics. Neat, but by no means necessary and there are challenges, events, etc that come around that offer stuff just as cool.",1573868481,1706764490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This isn't just a remaster; it's a nostalgia-packed time machine that catapults you back to the days when MSN gaming zone was the battleground of kings!

If you were a fan of the original Age of Empires II, prepare to have your mind blown and your inner warrior unleashed. The Definitive Edition doesn't just polish the graphics; it's like taking your favorite medieval battle simulator and injecting it with a hefty dose of steroids. The graphics are sharper than a knight's sword, and the attention to detail is so meticulous it's almost obsessive ‚Äì and I love it.

But let's talk about the nostalgia ‚Äì it's like a warm, comforting hug from an old friend who just happens to be wielding a trebuchet. The soundtrack, oh, the glorious soundtrack! Every familiar note sends shivers down your spine as memories of epic skirmishes and castle sieges flood back. It's not just a game; it's a journey back to the good old days when the lobby of MSN gaming zone was our sacred arena, and alliances were forged or shattered with a single click.

The gameplay is as intense as ever, and the addition of new civilizations and campaigns is like a banquet for strategy enthusiasts. The balance is so finely tuned that you can almost taste the blood, sweat, and tears that went into making this masterpiece. Again, it's not just a game; it's a battleground where you'll forge alliances, betray friends, and send waves of armies to crush your enemies.

The multiplayer experience is a thing of beauty. It's not just about skill; it's about cunning, strategy, and the satisfaction of outsmarting your opponents. The thrill of a well-executed rush or the sweet taste of revenge as you wipe out an enemy's economy ‚Äì it's pure gaming ecstasy. And of course there's ELO hell, but that's another matter.

In conclusion, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition isn't just a trip down memory lane; it's a full-blown warpath of nostalgia. It's aggressive in its assault on your emotions, dragging you back to the glory days of gaming. It's not for the faint-hearted ‚Äì it's for those who crave the rush of a perfectly executed boom or the sweet taste of victory after an epic comeback. Get ready to relive the old glory days, because Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition is here to conquer your heart all over again. Awww yeaaahhhh.

_____________________________________________________________


Oof, why did i waste 700+ hours on this game? It actively becomes less fun the more you play because it starts to actively be about learning a couple of strategies and build orders to perfection and then executing it better than the opponent. It was a lot more fun at an elo where people just played the game. Now im in that weird transition elo where games can get onesided stomps super fast because one guy for example learned fast Imp Turks on Arena. Or you're playing against a premade stack that goes for the boring meta strat.
Simply not enjoyable for me, wish i kept my childhood memories instead of destroying them playing ladder :(

June 2023 Update: Was about to give a thumbs up as the game had felt reasonably stable before the Rome DLC but now it's worse than it's ever been for me. Can just hope that their pormised stability patches help.
Plus doesn't seem to be just me, i'm experiencing an even higher number of leavers or non-loading players in ranked matches... i'd guess more than half my games are won/lost that way or never even happen.

____________________________________________

TLDR: The game has the potential to be very enjoyable and is nostalgic bliss but also still plagued with lots of bugs and connection issues in the current patch. Come back to this later once it's more stable (again?).

Enjoyed the game when i picked it back up last year, mostly due to childhood nostalgia and having been starved of a good RTS for a long time.

At the moment it's a bit of a love hate relationship for me. Why?

The unit movement/behaviour feels quite dated and clunky to me which sometimes can lead to the game overall feeling more like I'm wrestling the pathfinding and inputs than conveying orders and commanding a civilization.
On the other hand IF I get into a game which is reasonably well balanced on a map I enjoy it can be great fun... even if it's a bit stressful during the late-game with so much going on, especially when playing 3v3/4v4 without coms lol.

In the end what makes me not recommend the game at this point is the amount of bugs I'm experiencing lately. I highlighted the ""if"" earlier because quite often I don't even get into the game but instead get booted to the main menu with an ""unexpected error"" message. Which leads to increasing multiplayer timebans because the engine judges the crash as you abandoning a matchmaking game. Great.
On top of that the game creation process just decides to fuck up sometimes. For example scrambling civs in my team - not random civs but players getting matched the wrong civs within the team. E.g I pick Spanish and get Huns while my teammate picked Huns and got Spanish.
I even ended up in a 2v4 ranked match where i had queued for 3v3 and we were three players on our team in the lobby. But once we hit loading screen one of our teammates was put into the opponent team.
And even if i get into a game and all the settings are indeed correct, noone is lagging heavily and teams are somewhat balanced there's still a good chance that AoE2 decides to completely hardlock my PC. Like sound keeps playing but everything else stops responing to any kind of input. Literally no other game i have installed does that. From competitive multiplayer games to single player adventures. And it's not because so much is going on and my PC runs out of juice, it can happen during dark age witch 2 players on a tiny map.

Last but not least it's quite irritating to me that I only get a single map ban when queuing for team games, but three for solo ladder. With the map pool being relatively deep at least two bans for team ladder would be such a quality of life improvement... I just don't enjoy playing what feels like half my games on either Arena or Black Forest.

Final verdict - there's a reason the game is still popular this long after its initial release and why so many of us remember the childhood days fondly where we noobed around against the AI or had LAN nights with aoe and wc3. But in its current state for the amount of development time there could have been I won't recommend it. There are enough other games to enjoy first, come back to this later when it gets more stable.",1678095309,1706386818,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

[x] Potato-PC friendly (with an ""Enhanced Graphics Pack"" option for better computers).

I particularly enjoy offline skirmishes, which offer these options, for example:
game speed, max population, map type and size, number of AI players and teams, AI difficulty and handicaps.  Also, you get to pick a civilization-type for yourself, as well as for each AI player.  I find these options very handy in setting up game play that is liking to my style.

I've played this game since my childhood - long before the HD or now the DE Edition and even before it was on Steam. If I would write down everything I know and value about this game, this textbox would cover the whole review area. So I'll keep it to some personal opinions about this game, rather than a full explanation of the game's details.
To me, there isn't any better strategy game with such an amount of possibilities. No game is alike the game before and you always discover something new. Whether you play alone or with friends - it's always fun. 
And never have I experienced a game with such a friendly and long lasting fanbase, that achieves two remakes, and the steady addition of new content over decades.
Also, aside from the gameplay itself, for the historian I became, this game has always offered so much to discover in terms of historical events and diverse cultures.
I'm thankful for that the game has accompanied me for so long in my life and shaped who I become and that it also will in the future!",1706278426,1706278426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, going into 2020 Age of Empires made has made a fierce comeback into mainstream gaming when the franchise pinnacle stormed onto XBOX and Game Pass - Ladies & Gentlemen, that is THIS GAME!
Age of Empires II: Age of Kings originally launched on Windows 98 (for most people, otherwise Windows 2000), followed by it's expansion AoE2: Age of Conquerors introducing The American tribes to West vs East Eurasian Medieval slugfest.  I was one of those was introduced to AoE when buying AoE2 Gold Edition (Base + Expansion).  The original campaigns were alright, but I honestly found the real meat of Age of Empires lie in the skirmish and multiplayer action.  Age of Empires II is set in the medieval period and players progress across four R&D stages (as with any AoE game).  Players build up their bases, managing their population pool between villagers, military and support units to eventually eliminating opponents.  In addition to the traditional conquest skirmish match, you have additional modes with their own strategies.
Between the original and current resurgent releases, Age of Empires II has maintained a strong player and modding community.  AoE2 has remained the preferred entry for Age of Empires' competitive scene - Competitive AoE sounds a lot like the ""Rugby"" of RTS with Empire Wars (short form action-heavy format) and traditional full-length games both having their respective E-Sports presence.
AoE2HD got peoples' attention on Steam, Definitive Edition debuted the franchise on XBOX made became a household name for Game Pass users.  If you're wondering how this game fairs on a gamepad...  Surprisingly well, actually - Gamepad vs Keyboard/Mouse is like comparing Automatic vs Manual: Each have their strengths and weakness, but ultimately come down to personal preferences given how intuitively AoE plays on an XBOX controller.  If you prefer automation, you're going to warm very quickly to controller.  Purists however will naturally consider that blasphemy and play as they always have.  Any which way you play, AoE2 Definitive has Cross-Platform multiplayer for players new and old to enjoy!

Would I recommend Age of Empires II Definitive Edition?

If you consider yourself a self-respecting real-time strategy connoisseur...  Absolutely!

I've tried:
uninstalling and reinstalling the game
Disabling overlays
Disabling all mods
reducing fps and graphic quality
Running game as administrator
Disconnecting internet and starting game offline
Increase virtual memory size to 32GB
Updating windows drivers
Updating Nvidia drivers
Disabling any antivirus programs before running the game
Opening the game in windowed mode

A combination of 90% of games desyncing between my wife and i in the same house on the same network, unit pathing getting worse every patch, and decisions changing that make no sense, the game gets more and more frustrating to continue playing. Who in the world decided that the new default top priority target for trebuchets needed to be farms? We have a big rock to throw and do damage to an enemy civilisation. How best to use our rock? Throw it into that big open field with no one in it, that'll show em.

Grumping aside, you can see the decisions are not being thought through. Decisions come from big corporate, the game sits in a ""meh, good enough, everyone"" state, and there is little to no feedback given to the community that enjoys the game.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1656698483,1705148496,True,0,0,0.433041542768478394,0,True,False,False

I made the mistake of playing thru 1 of 3 games I ordered instead of playing them all to see if there was any problems. The add on game I bought had bad illegible graphics that transferred back to the original game. The second mistake I made was to spend time trying to fix the graphics probably exceeding the 2 hour play limit. Now I'm stuck with a game and extension that are both messed up.

Agree on some rules for maximum fun for everyone (or don't), and just have at it. AoE2 is also a very nostalgic game with great visual- and mechanical design, that I certainly think can offer at least some entertainment.

However, going into online multiplayer, and even playing against the AI, can quickly get ridiculous. To me, Age of Empires II feels designed to be a rather demanding game. Being competitive, having good APM, and being great at hyper-efficiency and multi-tasking, all seem required here. I'm a bit more of a casual player, and thus I often feel like I stand little chance, even against the AI.

Speaking of AI, the differences between difficulties are insane. Play on Easiest or Standard, and the AI barely does anything. At most, all it does against me is send a few infantry/archers every couple minutes, with some occasional rams if they're feeling spicy. However, anything beyond Standard suddenly has this huge difficulty spike that expects you to be great at the game.

Playing against Moderate, I often get destroyed. Whereas the AI was a pushover before, now they're juggling multiple things at once: bringing villagers to repair their 10+ siege weapons mid-combat, have monks dip in and out of combat to convert my units, dodging siege projectiles with their units, and more... And all that's just on Moderate! I can't imagine the insanity of what Hard, Hardest and Extreme would be like. There just seems to be many steps missing in-between difficulties.

On top of all that, this game has [b]horrendous[/b] pathing. For example, when giving a group of units an attack/move order, they'll often take a longer and nonsensical route to avoid a single tree or something. Or they'll zigzag and slow down and rotate around eachother just for a single straggler to get back into their precious formation. There's more to this, but let's just say that you're often left fighting your own units as much as you're fighting the enemy.

While Age of Empires can admittedly be an enjoyable game in certain aspects, I still recommend you only play it if you're very competent and competitive at strategy games like these, or if you plan to play primarily with friends. I'll probably keep playing the game every now and then to see how far I'll get, but I certainly would've liked this game a lot more if it had been more welcoming.",1697921289,1705013433,False,2,1,0.482352942228317261,3,True,False,False

[h3]Let's start with the positives:[/h3]
[list]
[*]The game balance is about at its best it has ever been civilization wise.
[*]There are updates being released that address balance
[*]Many Quality of Life features that are exclusive to DE - like the queue of farms (from AoC) expanded to ""auto farm reseed""
[*]There is a queue system for ranked play
[*]New textures & 4k textures available
[*]New campaigns. Although most of them are behind separate DLCs, the content is there
[/list]

[h3]Now to the negatives[/h3]
[list]
[*]Although Public Update Preview (PUP) is usually available before a new patch, it's not uncommon for game breaking bugs to make it past the phase. This includes games crashing as well as ""infinite relic multiplication""
[*]Pathing. One of the core systems to an RTS game, updates claiming ""pathing improvements"" or ""fixes"" usually made it worse.
[/list]

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
You, the person reading this, is probably asking right now: Why is the review negative with the positives list being so much longer?
In one word: pathing.
In longer explanation:
As I have mentioned I've been playing the game on and off for about 20 years. And I want to cry now that I uninstalled the game since it is one of the games I love. 
The game breaking bugs usually got patched quickly after being found. I could see past some of the non-trivial ones. Though, it still happened more often than not, it is not the end of the world as it got fixed and I could continue playing the game.
The point when it started to go downhill is when pathing, a core system, was started being altered. It was slowly getting worse, occasionally getting better. However the current state is very bad. 
If you're interested how bad, take a look at the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apKc3Q1xQyE
In game it feels like units are not listening to the command. Units will shuffle around instead of walking, villagers randomly stop and walking 8 tiles around the building rather than going around the building from the other side which is about 3 tiles.

[h3]Do I recommend this game?[/h3]
If you want to play only single player and you don't play multiplayer, possibly. You might not notice the pathing. Still, be warned
For anyone wanting to play multiplayer/ranked games: Big No. Units seemingly not listening to commands should be an immediate turn off.",1704828226,1704828226,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Is quite easy and for all ages. Although you may spend quite a bit of time before you manage to win, it is quite fun and not tiring at all. The admins pays attention to the comments and reports of the players and tries to solve every problem that exists in the game. 

The DLC market needs some attention. Because DLC Return of Rome is completely different from simple AoE2 Definitive Edition. ( I hadn't read it so I just bought it and found difficulties in it. )
(Some basic things you should know is that it doesn't have Relics to automatically get money like in AoE2 Definitive Edition with monks. It also doesn't have a trap farming option if you want to collect food by Sea. It has other tricks separately, so before you buy any DLC check out video someone who has already played it.

Also, there are still frequent tournaments amongst the top players from around the world. The updated graphics is really gorgeous to look at as well. 

100% will recommend to anyone who hasn't tried any RTS before and wants to try their hand at it for the first time.

‚úÖ[list]

[*] Lot of campaigns and scenarios, with voiced intro and outro. All of them are based on history and achievements of greatest kings, leaders etc.

[*] Massive and quite active modding scene.

[*] Content for every player. SP, skirmishes against other players/AI, amateur and professional MP league.

[*] Introduction to MP mode in form of scenarios.

[*] In-game events and challenges.

[*] Graphic and QoL upgrades. 

[/list]
üòê
I know, it's mostly due to multiplayer readability and clearness. But all basic units have same skin, no matter which civs they represents - archer looks similar for Chinese, Aztec and Spanish. I would appreciate some regional/cultural differences to basic model.

‚ùå
[list]

[*] Basic game (original AoE II) civs, need reworks and upgrades. New ones, added with DLCs seems to be better though in terms of strong/weak points and uniqueness.

[*] It's old-style RTS so unit training times can be quite long.

[*] Despite graphical rework, game age is quite obvious.

But now I actually do recommend this game. I have upgraded my rig since then and I can finally play it without the fps drop. Even with a high end rig if you play a map with max players and tons of characters are running around everywhere carelessly, then still expect to see a fps drop. I believe it's just how the game is coded. I don't think they will ever fix that problem unless they re-code from the ground up.

With that issue out of the way, the game play and campaigns are all still the same, but with a little bit more added, and that's not including DLC campaigns. 

The resolution and graphics are beautiful to glance at on a 4K screen. Hard to believe I ran this on windows 98 back in the day at 1024x768. My how times have changed. Even though they feel the same.

The DE version is only for Steam on modern PC's, do not run this on your 10 year old rig. Just play the HD version instead. You'll understand why.

This is the best RTS game, I would stretch to general game on the whole of steam, maybe ever created. This game has kept me interested for over 6k+ hours including the HD edition, and I still feel like I could play it for the rest of my life. No matter what, get this game. For a relatively historically accurate PVP-based RTS game, it absolutely excels. 25 years after it was created originally, AoE2 is still going strong, and the community all feels the same way about this game. In over 10 years of playing this, I have never met a single hacker, and only 3 toxic players.

The map editor I have probably spent over 1000h on, you can pretty much edit the game in any way you wish. The UI in the editor and across the whole game is easy to navigate, tooltips are shown for newer players and everything is specified clearly.

I would again, repeat my point on the community. I have almost never had a bad time playing this game, thanks to all the wonderful community members.

I have gotten 5 friends to get this game, and 3 have loved it and the other two haven't really tried it enough to know yet. This game is absolutely timeless. Scroll up right now, and download the game. This game is educational, fun, strategic, and will be absolutely playable in 5 years time. I would buy it for 5x the price and it would still be worth my money.

I cannot emphasise with words how worth it this game is. Different to every other game on the market.

When you first start the game you immediately find out that everything your cursor touches is read out. That‚Äôs a great accessibility feature. What‚Äôs not great is that the voice is unbearably robotic and fails to even pronounce the game‚Äôs title correctly. It also makes awkward pauses while reading. I wonder if this is really useful to visually impaired players.

What‚Äôs bad about this is: How do you turn it off? The toggles are not clearly labeled, so I had to google to find them. Side note: There are three toggles, one controls the voiceover in the menu, one ingame and the third I forgot. Only the one for the menu is enabled by default. What‚Äôs the point of that? Once you‚Äôre in your first game, accessibility is toggled of by default.

I launched the tutorial to see if anything meaningful changed. The visuals did, but not much more. Oh, and the beautiful Scottish voice from the William Wallace campaign got replaced by someone who didn‚Äôt even try to sound Scottish. What a shame!

Playing the first ‚Äúhow to get good‚Äù campaign (which I find a nice addition), I tried to change the hotkeys, since I like to scroll using WASD, which isn‚Äôt possible by default. Guess what? There as a whole menu for changing the hotkeys, which is [url=""https://forums.ageofempires.com/t/changing-hotkey-defaults-does-not-work-stuck-in-classic-hotkeys-and-cant-switch-to-definitive-hotkeys/184738/35""]broken at least since January 2021[/url]! This is so infuriating. You made the effort to make the game accessible to visually impaired gamers, but fail to make hotkeys work for 3 years‚Åâ

Further into the campaign I noticed that clicking buttons doesn‚Äôt work about half the time. No, I‚Äôm not too dumb to read my resource stocks. I have more than 50 food, enough housing, click the button to create a pawn, and nothing happens. Only after I move the cursor, I can click it. This occurs so often that I wonder if the devs even played their game once during ‚Äòtesting‚Äô.

While aiming for gold in the resource gathering challenge, I repeatedly found that pawns would stand idly for a few seconds before remembering that they‚Äôre shepherds and killing the next sheep. That‚Äôs infuriating when you‚Äôre always a few seconds short of obtaining the gold medal. I thought with 2023 technology fetching the next task for a pawn should be instant, but well‚Ä¶

I still have my old copy of AoK, but it doesn‚Äôt work on new Windows versions because Microsoft decided not to bundle a codec the game needs. With a game this shitty (that used to be great), I really wonder what Microsoft‚Äôs cut in the sales is.

I got the game for ‚Ç¨5, and I‚Äôm still pondering whether I should return it.",1703900922,1703900922,False,0,2,0,1,True,False,False

Despite all my hours, I only play to a fairly mediocre level and find doing all the campaigns on Hard is taking me a while (no point in doing on any other mode!)

I‚Äôve been playing since I was 9 or 10. I used to think Monks were shepherds somehow.

I would love to see more female units though. I know war history is dominated by men, but some civilisations had women in their ranks, or Queens instead of kings. And YES, I know the female plumed archer is hidden in there.

Still, I will never stop playing and I hope they never stop giving.

In AOE 2, your choice on build, town, villagers, upgrades, and units make a very significant impact on how your game will progress. Winning or losing will depend solely on you and your opponent even if you have a better economy and larger army. Massing as a strategy does not work in this game. 

This game truly embodies the core of what makes AOE series great and probably one of the most tactical RTS games out there. The difference between players is large depending on who is playing and the skill ceiling is very high. Unlike most RTS games, microing is far more hectic and unorthodox. The difference in the skill of players is truly seen in this game, if this was a really popular competitive esport today, I have no doubt it would be one of the most enjoyable to watch. 

Even for single player campaigns, the slide show cinematics and art work although minimal really encapsulate each of the nations and is also historically accurate as you play each of the main characters. You get to learn about the history of various civilizations while playing as the heros of them from every nation and continent around the world in a game. Even if you aren't a fan of RTS or playing competitively/multiplayer, this is well worth your dollar just to play for the story.",1703727879,1703728843,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for the old classic experience however, you will need to download userpatches for the old age of kings/conquerors cd versions.

The game however is still riddled with issues that never seem to get fixed and if they do, they return or worsen after a patch or two.

- Pathfinding
- Odd behavior from units that I've never seen before in other versions of the game
- Unsolicited ahistorical civ inclusions to sell increasingly overpriced DLCs with waning quality of campaigns
- Playing Ludikris sized maps still cause the game to freeze up and stutter occasionally
- FOMO ""balance"" patches which does nothing to fix core issues with the game or overpowered civs included beyond the classic experience, but only serve to upset the meta for little to no payoff in the end
- No steamworkshop which means having to login to a microsoft account, and is infinitely more frustrating to navigate and search for specific mod/map content.

Is the definitive edition a direct upgrade over previous versions? I would describe it as more of a sidegrade than anything. Make no mistake this is not the classic experience of age of empires, but a modern remake with all the bells and whistles of a newer engine and QoL improvements. Along with the improvements come the negative sides of being a modern remake, the live service, the seasonal updates (gotta have those player interaction metrics) and the massive creep of scope to monetize DLC.",1573751870,1703585642,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Q for house/barracks, W for mill/archery range, E for mining camp/stables, R for lumber camp/siege workshop.

Games stuttering, crashing, and freezing and online lobbies crash when starting. I am not the only one experiences these, please pull your heads out of your asses and realize a playable game is more important then your stupid events and retarded icons. 

4/16/2021 - game still crashes regularly. Fix your game. Focus on stabability not stupid events and art. 

2/1/2020 - Seriously, get your shit together and fix the bugs causing crashes. My game just freezes for 2 secs then crashes to home screen without any error report. That was my first game in 2 weeks, play for 10 minutes and crashes. Since your newest patches, 50% of the time, games end in crashes. This is BS. It crashes, you fix it, NOW it breaks again. Seriously TEST your shit before releasing.

3/21/2020 - Your game is still shit. Crashes constantly. 3 games in a row crashing within the first 1 minute. F your game.

4/26/2020 - Game is still crashing constantly. Its unplayable. F your game. Fix it.

8/31/20 - Your game is still shit. Still crashes and losing connection to servers. Try fixing all your crashing bugs and shitty coding before doing your events.

8/15/2021 - EVERY dlc and patch you guys give is a Disaster! Balance broken, games crash, servers malfunctioning to the point that ghost lobbies take up all the lobbies. Get your shit together.

12/25/23 - 
Game still has to crash before you can play multiplayer. Pathing is absolute shit. Get rid of grouping everytime I move my units, rock throwers are broken especially mongols, can shoot and move so they do not get counter hit, since units group and pathing is so bad, rock throwers wreck all units not matter what. So idiots that program for your game, why do you own units not take full damage from your own rock throwers?

CONs
- performance poor on i5-8350U with Intel HD 620 iGPU (22FPS)
- graphics cannot be dialled down low enough
- if 1 player lags, everyone's game experience suffers as everyone's game slows to the weakest player's experience
- no improvement to unit path finding which is still atrocious 24 years after OG AoE2's release
- zoom out contents directly linked to monitor resolution: 2.5k on 27"" or 4k on 32"" recommended
- English voice acting is worse than OG AoE2, and everyone sounds generically American without any effort of putting on an accent
- Ranged units don't have a melee attack like in Battle Realms or Metal Fatigue (really underrated)
- the game snowballs very quickly as many inefficiencies add up later on

Issue with multiplayer:
- 20% of matches are smurfs ruining everyone's experience
- waiting to find 4v4 matches takes 10-15min
- you are forced to play maps you don't like
- you can only ban 4 cards on 4v4, but we only want to play Black Forest, Amazon Tunnel and Arena...
- you need to commit to at least 45min time investment per game incl. waiting time
- can be really stressful when you haven't played in a many months, and you need to constantly multi task",1703412180,1703412506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tons of quality-of-life features that you rarely see in other games, it's satisfying, it runs well (unless your opponent in multiplayer is producing lag). It allows for a lot of creativity in your approach. There are also tons of campaigns that take a long time to play through, in the good sense.

There are issues with the game (currently, unit pathing is in a pretty bad state), but it still receives active updates and the issues are tolerable, unlike in many other games. 

Learning to play well requires a lot of practice, but you can just play single player, with friends, or simply let the ranked matchmaker place you in the lower brackets. Low-skill ranked is probably more fun anyway. Playing skirmish games against the AI is fine, but the AI gets rather predictable.

You don't need any of the DLCs to have a full experience. The DLCs add new campaigns and new civilizations (with the exception of ""Return of Rome"", which adds some other things as well, but that's not that relevant). There are plenty of civilizations in the base game to play as, so I would recommend getting a feel for the game and then deciding which of the DLC civilizations you're interested in.",1703352457,1703352519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would not recommend playing anything other than 1v1 due to the amount of trolls that plague team play. 

I am downgrading from a 4/10 to a 2/10 now to a 1/10. I just played a game as I try to come back to this game periodically to see if they have improved it. I created 3 horse units in the beginning of the game, I was able to get into the area where they were chopping wood, I put my units onto aggressive attack stance and then patrolled the area so they would attack and instead they just stood there and died. This game is such a joke. 

I am downgrading to a 1/10 because of how slow this game is. The villagers walk exceedingly slow and the trees in the game are so far away. It can take up to 12 minutes to 15 minutes to even get units built and everything is just so slow. 

The economy in this game is also very slow. It cost a lot of money to upgrade your economy and if you decide to go with melee units you will have a tremendously hard time fighting off arrows as well as upgrading your economy and the units themselves as there are not enough food options in the beginning of the game.

This game is basically play one or two styles if you want to be competitive and takes away all the fun of trying something to out smart somebody. It just doesn't exist in this game. 

I periodically come back to this game because i've been playing it for so long to see if it gets improved. 

On 12/13/23 I tried to play the new mini game which I thought was a fantastic addition to this game, however, disappointing. 

When you are controlling a group of units in this game (in general not just mini game) instead of clicking for them to run right or left they will regroup and get stuck inside the enemy units. Which gets them killed. In the actual game itself this is already absurdly annoying and in this particular mini game the entire point is to keep the units alive and protect the wonder. A really fun idea and i am thoroughly surprised they added this into the game however the controls of this game again have made it more annoying to play than fun.",1688596290,1702511133,False,0,0,0.472698360681533813,0,True,False,False

If you're already into RTS' then this is a no-brainer, but if your're new to the scene then a word of caution because it can be a little overwhelming at first, but if you muster through the first few hours of confusion and frustration, you'll soon see why this is such a beloved genre. Stick with it and you'll have some of the most fun and gratifying moments in gaming.

The game has a lot to offer, for both single-player lovers with it's extensive campaigns, which can also be played in Co-Op, and for those who are more into multiplayer with both a competitive mode and casual lobbies. Not to mention the endless amount of custom maps, modes and mods on offer from the community in the Steam Workshop.

If you already own the AoK or HD (2013) version, I would still highly recommend this, as it has all of the original DLC included, not to mention the beautiful graphics and art.

This version compared to HD edition (Released in 2013) brings a new graphics engine to the front, and along with community mods compatibility, offers a lot of customization either for fancier players and those who want the most optimized way to play the game (Not only in the visual department, but also in terms of gameplay).

Definitive edition also comes with extra tutorial missions which helps those who want to get into the classic IA Skirmishes and the Multiplayer. These tutorials come with video explanations about what to do in certain steps of the game, and then they throw you right away into the gameplay, qualifying you by either time spent in the mission or units lost, which helps to measure how good you are doing and how much you want to improve those times.

Last but not least, this version of AoE2 already comes with the expansions that were released for the HD edition, so you are getting already a lot of value by purchasing this one.

If you're thinking about grabbing this classic, do it! Whether solo or with pals, it's a blast. Not too pricey, and it's easy for anyone to pick up. Graphics aren't cutting-edge, but the gameplay is where it shines.

Set in the Medieval Era, choose from various factions - European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and even Native American. Similar units, but each has its unique twist. Ignore the dated graphics, and you're in for a seriously fun time.

In a nutshell: Age of Empires II is a must for anyone craving a throwback RTS from '99. Sure, the graphics are old, but the gameplay? Timeless and awesome. Get it and enjoy the medieval mayhem!",1701845166,1701845166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An EPIC version of a famous (old-school) classic game of Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings since 1999.

[June 27, 2023 update]
IMO since the recent update, the 'easy' AI is way too aggressive in the beginning, i did lost all game plays.

I do not mind loosing some battles. I do not have much time to learn myself a new style i evolved over the many years (specially when i was single and did not have kids.)
Unfortunately due to this update I lost interested in my favorite game.
  
I was a big FAN of the game since 1999., specially Age of Empires II: The Conquerors
   
note: I am not the only old-player having this issue!
  
Dear Forgotten Empires & Xbox Game Studios: 
I do wish that Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition had more difficulty levels (not just 3 but let's say 10)
and/or multiple options to tweak the AI aggression settings per difficulty levels so i can tweak the game a bit (e.g. less aggression).

Desde su lanzamiento inicial hasta sus versiones remasterizadas, este juego ha mantenido su encanto y ha ganado un lugar especial en el coraz√≥n de los fan√°ticos.

Lo primero que destaca en AoE II es su enfoque en la historia y la autenticidad. Con civilizaciones hist√≥ricas, campa√±as detalladas y unidades que reflejan la realidad de la √©poca, el juego logra sumergirte en la experiencia de construir y conquistar a lo largo de diferentes eras.

La variedad de civilizaciones y estrategias disponibles es impresionante. Cada facci√≥n tiene sus propias fortalezas y debilidades, lo que fomenta la experimentaci√≥n y la adaptabilidad en cada partida. Ya sea defendiendo tu ciudad con arqueros brit√°nicos o lanzando un ataque sorpresa con la caballer√≠a mongola, hay infinitas posibilidades estrat√©gicas.

El dise√±o de mapas es otro punto fuerte. Desde exuberantes bosques hasta vastos desiertos, cada escenario presenta desaf√≠os √∫nicos que mantienen el juego fresco y emocionante. La mec√°nica de construcci√≥n de imperios, la gesti√≥n de recursos y la diplomacia son fundamentales para el √©xito, agregando capas de complejidad estrat√©gica.

La comunidad de AoE II es activa y apasionada. Ya sea participando en partidas multijugador en l√≠nea o creando escenarios personalizados, siempre hay algo nuevo que explorar. Adem√°s, la posibilidad de jugar en modo cooperativo o enfrentarse en √©picas batallas uno contra uno agrega un componente social y competitivo.

En el lado negativo, la curva de aprendizaje puede ser empinada para los reci√©n llegados, y algunas t√°cticas avanzadas pueden resultar abrumadoras al principio. Sin embargo, con paciencia y pr√°ctica, estos desaf√≠os se vuelven parte integral de la experiencia enriquecedora de AoE II.

En resumen, Age of Empires II es un cl√°sico que ha envejecido maravillosamente. Con su enfoque en la autenticidad hist√≥rica, la variedad estrat√©gica y una comunidad activa, es un juego que sigue siendo tan cautivador hoy como lo fue en su lanzamiento inicial. ¬°Una joya para los amantes de la estrategia!",1701314567,1701314567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AGE II DE is a RTS strategy game, put in the 5th century, till the end of the 1500s, and the beginning of the renaissance. The game has 45 civilizations (at time of review), as is one of, the best AoE game. The graphics have been made much better, so much better than HD. And Yes, it sometimes crashes, but it happens mostly when people click the cut-scene when opening the game. How I get past the issue, is just by not skipping, and waiting until it ends. If that's not good for you, just wait a second and then skip.

The game, is highly enjoyable, I love to be the Lithuanians (As I am from the country too) due to their good strategy, which is good if mastered. Every civilization is good for itself, and when mastered, is perfect. The pathing, is the only terrible issue, which is annoying to play with. In HD, pathing is great. In DE, not so much.

I've easily had more fun with this game than either the original, or HD versions of AoE 2. 

Another major plus side to this game (imo) is that the AI doesn't cheat in any way, and instead is effectively programmed to use strategies that experienced human players would use, which does a much better job of preparing you to face real opponents than most other games would.

Edit: I felt the need to add that AI teammates in this game are some of the most self sufficient and helpful AI from any game game that I can think of. There have been many times when an enemy AI is attacking me early on in the game at a point where I am not quite prepared for it, and then my AI teammate sends some military units to help me out out of it's own volition. That help allows me to fend off the early initial attacks from AI sometimes, and provides me with the space needed to age up and boom so that we, as a team, can make the enemy AI suffer for it's early aggression later in the game. The AI on harder difficulties feels like it actually has a real intention of winning the game. It's a nice change of pace from strategy games where friendly AI feels virtually useless and is incapable of working well with you.

The game gets new civs through paid DLCs, and then receives substantial balance patches around the same time new civs come out, which tend to change up how most civs in the game are played at least a little bit.",1574908764,1701150366,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

A ""remaster"" called Age of Empires II: HD Edition which added a bit more content and upscaled visuals was released in 2013. Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, released in 2019, is a remaster with lots of improvements and content expansions. Namely are the graphical enhancements which have remastered sprite work and sharper visuals (also support 4K). In addition, this version adds a lot of quality of life improvements. One such thing is the automatic farm replenishment which was a sorely needed feature. This version features all the campaigns from the previous versions. In addition, this is the only version of the game to feature co-op campaign content which I personally enjoyed a lot.

One thing to note is that this version has a lot of DLC content. The content adds different civilizations and campaigns. The learning curve is fairly easy to pick up since all the civilizations share many overlapping units and gameplay mechanics. Easy to pick up but hard to master. Unlike Age of Empires III or Age of Mythology that has fundamentally different civilizations, these play similarly allowing a fairly balanced pool of civilizations to play with or against. Granted each civilization has its strong points and bonuses as well as some unique units. There are 35 different civilizations in the base game and 45 in total with the DLC. There are also 27 campaign missions in the base game. Additionally, the DLC entitled Return of Rome adds a lot of legacy content from Age of Empires I including all the civilizations from that title.

Age of Empires II is constantly still receiving updates and new content in the form of DLCs. If you are looking for a fun medieval period RTS, you'll find a lot of enjoyment with this one.",1701129763,1701129763,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After getting 100% achievements, it's time to give a review.

The graphical difference for the DE vs. HD is pretty well done, with all the reskinned that has been done in this game, supports 4K resolution, improved visuals, fewer but new types of achievements, and two games in one (If you buy the DLC...) new buildings and a better overview.

Now I like doing achievements (BUT!) I don't like doing the same over and over again when it comes to converting, I did it on Age of Empires Definitive Edition (1000 times) and Age of Empires II HD (1000 times again...), and now here as well... I'm okay if it's a few... but come on!!! 1000 plus more again on DE! The creators of this game love the word ""Wololo"" for some weird reasons... At least I didn't have to lead each faction one hundred times to victory again. (Just once) 

Now you get achievements on some of the campaigns themselves, some of them were pretty hard to get like the one called ""Rome was destroyed in one day"" where you need to complete the campaign in less than 30 minutes by destroying all the castles in the Roman city. It took me 8-10 tries to do it.

You can also play the Age of Empires Definitive Edition on this called (Return of Rome) with a few changes and new stuff. The Portuguese in this game are way too good with their building called Feitoria. With that building, they can fight forever. Not only that! but if your teammate makes you his enemy for a few seconds, he can convert that building and use it as well. (Only if you don't have LOCKED TEAM on) Sharing is caring, after all.

Now when it comes to multiplayer, I had problems many times when several people tried to join the game which made it very difficult to get the achievement called ""Masterpiece"" where you have to win over 3 human players alone. I tried playing randomly with 3 and almost got it, but some of the players ""rage quit"" before finishing them off which ended up with me not unlocking the achievement. Good thing to have friends for this.

They change how the AI plays itself on maps, but you can change it from CD, HD, or DE the way the AI does things. They started making walls! (Haven't seen that before) The game comes with many new challenges on the campaign if you liked playing on easy, now you have to play on ""hard difficulty"" on some of the campaigns if you want the achievement.

(Overall) Would I recommend this game to you? - Yes
If you want a good strategy, story, build, and fighting game this is the game for you and your friends where you can play several different factions (If you don't mind buying the DLC...)",1701034884,1701034884,True,20,0,0.688382387161254883,0,True,False,False

With the on going support and devs that actually listen and act on the communities requests ,I love the New Church tech ''Devotion.'' . I look forward to see the devs improve the game to get it as close to perfection as possible. With  ongoing dev support and hopefully the addition of Crusader Livanteens, Norman Franks & more African civilisations, AoE2DE could indeed become strategy game perfection. So buy the game (Deus Vult!), let the devs prove themselves and may God aid you to crush your enemies with poise and precision. Wollollo all the way.

* Graphics are what many people expected the HD edition to be; you probably won't like them in the beginning but once you're used to them they're stunningly beautiful plus there are tons of ways to customize it (grid, small trees, mods, ...).

* Audio has been remastered and while I personally don't like some sound effects, they're still really well made.

* Performance has been improved significantly and you can get a smooth 200 frames per second with a decent rig.

* Network performance equally good to Voobly UserPatch from my experience.

* Matchmaking has a rotating map pool (player can vote which maps will be in the next rotation) and you can favourite and ban maps.

* ""Mimimi muh ranked lobbies"". You can only play ranked through matchmaking, lobbies are unranked. I think that's how it should be for multiple reasons but I don't want to go into detail here.

* There are regular balance patches and with the vast civ pool there will always be a counter to a ""strongest"" civ so there is rarely a patch where something feels unbeatable.

* QoL features are great but not over the top (e.g. no AoM style auto queue), as Cysion said: More time fighting the enemy instead of the UI. Hardcore AoC players will disagree.

If you're an AoE fan you're probably gonna buy it anyway and if you aren't you should become one.

Age of Empires 2 will always be my go to recommendation for people who are just starting off with RTS games.  Compared to Starcraft, it is far more forgiving and less stressful. And even if you are not into multiplayer, there are nearly 40 campaigns (each with 5-6 missions) for you to try out. And they're some of the best in the genre.

As for the remake, it adds a ton of Quality of Life improvements and entirely redone graphics that stay true to the original artistic vision. If you have even a remote interest in Strategy games, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot.

And now with a thriving and highly inclusive competitive Scene, if anything, there is even more reason to love it. Yes, I got quite the beating when I first started playing the ladder, but I also found a tournament specifically for beginners and made more and more friends among the other players. 

And even for players who don't like competitive play in tournaments or on the ranked ladder, I've spent countless hours in the campaigns or the editor, so nobody is forced to play competitively.

All with multiple levels in them

AoE II is one of the most important games of my youth. I was seven back then in 1999, and I used to play it a lot. Like really a lot. HD edition from 2013, which is still available on Steam, is excellent, but despite all the new content, the experience was still quite similar to the original version from 1999. At least for me.

This Definitive Edition is something completely different. It‚Äôs this fantastic game from 1999 with entirely new graphics, physics, improved UI, new campaigns, all the additional HD content, and what‚Äôs most important, plenty of quality of life improvements that make gameplay even more enjoyable. It‚Äôs almost like playing AoE II for the first time! Too bad I‚Äôm 20 years older today, and I don‚Äôt have so much time to spend in this game‚Ä¶ 

I won‚Äôt write a huge review, and I won‚Äôt explain what this game is. If you‚Äôre reading this, you know what the Age of Empire is. You‚Äôre just thinking if this DE is worth it or you‚Äôre looking for a reason to buy it. Let me give it to you: it‚Äôs well worth your money, especially with the extra discount for owners of the HD version.

Have fun and [b]wololo[/b]!

[Edit 2022] - They are pushing this game further and further by adding high quality DLCs with amazing content. AoE2 DE is now an ultimate RTS experience with many years of support ahead of us. Keep on keeping on!

By far AoE takes the cake in this approach, not only do you need to build up the right counter to your opponents army but theirs also small things that can ultimately change the course of the battle such as having a hill advantage, how ever small it maybe you still get a tiny boost to your damage and view range. You can also use castles and towers to shoot the opponents army as your units fight keeping them in the range of fire, you may lose units in the process but they end up losing more.

Armour and weapon upgrades are still the most important for your units survival, so is knowing what counters what. Over all.. you are a commander, are you better then the other one?

Also if you're new to RTS games NO your APM is not important that just means you click real fast, it doesn't mean you know how to out smart your opponent.",1700859119,1700859119,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very frustrating. Any team game with an AI ally should automatically build a market, especially if you take the time to tell them to.  The multi-player is TERRIBLE.  The wait time for matches isn't bad, usually 2-4 minutes, but players are often bots I think and on a good day 1 out of 4 games will involve all players actually playing, and on a bad day 6/7 games (yes, six out of seven on average) will be 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 games where players either resign within the first few minutes or never begin playing at all. Very frustrating and these games obviously end in a one-sided and unfair victory.  I think Microsoft uses bots to pose as players sometimes but to be honest I can't be sure... its strange how often players on your team won't communicate with you when you talk to them so I don't know what else to think. All-in-all the experience has been very bad in both Ranked and Un-Ranked play.  I LOVE this game, really, and I wish it worked worth a crud, but it doesn't.  If I could play it offline over LAN with other people, then that might work but I have no friends who play this unfortunately. As it is, trying to get in and play competitively online with random strangers JUST DOES NOT WORK like it does for a lot of other big-title games. I also wish that the online maps that were popular were, well, maps that I like.  I often like big coastal maps with standard play-style (no strange mods or weird rules about how many times your civ can upgrade certain upgrades, etc) but apparently playing the game ""normally"" is an oddity that rarely anyone but me enjoys, I guess.",1619905456,1700765656,False,0,0,0.493827164173126221,0,True,False,False

While I played the French campaign and playing on ""Standard"" I got absolutely crushed by the AI and stopped playing relatively shortly after because I wasn't just very good at adapting my strategy but I primised that I'd return to the game to try again eventually.

Cue 2021 and I tried again but this time I had made myself a promise to try harder, get the basics right and do some achievements as well. The tutorials and ""training missions"" ( like ""Art of War"" ) helped me understand the mistakes I made and play better in the campaigns.

Over the next couple of months, I played through all the campaigns - new and old - and also tried doing it on harder difficulties eventually with some of the missions maybe taking multiple tries to beat but what I got out of the game was a fantastic experience that challenged me but also entertained me for hundreds of hours.

Cue 2023 and I return yet again to play and finish the newly released campaigns from the new DLCs.

I've yet to play a ranked game, but the campaigns in and off themselves are worth every little penny. Missions can range from ""Keep your units safe and win like in a RPG"", ""Build your base and destroy all enemies"" to ""Defend while the enemies assault you"", it has one of the best mission variety out of any RTS game I played in my life.

""Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition"", is an old classic that's dressed in new clothes with a lot of good Quality of life improvements but in its core kept the gameplay tight, just like it was when it originally released. Of course, some changes have been made in terms of balance, with new civilizations being added over the released DLCs and multiple different patch / release versions broadening the amount of choices the player has for both ranked and campaign games. I appreciate a lot that each new civilization gets their own campaign, so you can actually try them out in a scripted setting offline while not putting any pressure on the player either. Skirmish matches against AI do exist if you don't like to play the campaign and rather prepare yourself for online multiplayer - with varying degrees of difficulty to be chosen by you during the creation of said skirmish match.

I cannot recommend this game enough if you love RTS games, as it has so much content and plays so well with the improvements, it's tough to find anything better in this day and age, that not only gets supported constantly but also still has a lively community. 

And, if you don't enjoy playing online yourself, you can find Twitch streams of tournaments for example to watch and root for your favorite player while you can just enjoy the chaos by top players. Additionally there are also players / casters on Twitch that stream related content like lower-skilled players battling each other or even playing themselves.

All in all, a fantastic game with a great base of what makes a RTS game timeless even now.",1700660032,1700758839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't call this a Definitive Edition but fairly good job apart from a few things that grind my gears

Cons
-No LAN play
-No Peer to Peer Play over the internet, if they shutdown the severs for maintenance or shut them down like they did with the original then no more multiplayer + Peer to Peer can make matches more even for some people as both players suffer lag, where when both players connect to a sever one player will have more lag than the other
-In game chat way over censored, should be an option to turn on or off, if not choose what words to turn on or not or just an option to mute a player or something but it's crazy stupid & censors such words even like dock when there is a dock in game
-No Classic game mode
-Exclusive time limited events with in game items, shouldn't be limited, in no way is that good for the consumer
-Would also be nice to see more post match statistics, like vil idle time, TC & Castle construction + destruction etc etc

As of now, the game is in almost an unplayable state. The moron asshole morons that make this game clearly have no idea what they are doing in any capacity whatsoever. Here are the highlights:

1. Pathing: The pathing for units is the worst it has ever been. Morons. Villagers completely stop building queued buildings. And I mean completely; they stop and do nothing. Attack move doesn't work. Patrol doesn't work. Defensive stance doesn't work. Moron idiot assholes. 

2. AI: The AI as a teammate still deletes its market(s) much of the time. Why? Moron idiot asshole developers. And, a new trick is that an AI teammate will only trade with the closest ally, often the player. This severely impedes that AI player's gold intake and effectively disables them. Worthless developers. 

3. Balance: The Georgians have a bad win rate in ranked online 1v1 as of now. That is but one small subset of the game. That civ is an absolute nightmare in death matches and empire wars. Their unique cavalry unit is also bugged. Unreal. 

Do not buy or play this game. 

As of late May 2023, here are the debilitating issues that make the game almost unplayable: 

1. The crashes. They made the anti-cheating software build in to this game so sensitive that it crashes the program many, many times per session. The idiot asshole morons who made the anti-cheat think things like Google Chrome, Windows antivirus, Firefox, and Steam itself are cheat programs that warrant crashing the game. 

2. The AI is still stupid as shit. My allies trade with exclusively me, regardless of my proximity to them. Is my base exactly next to my ally? Doesn't matter! They are trading with me to the exclusion of any other teammate, even if the trade route generates next to no gold. Morons. The AI as a teammate still does super fun and excellent things like delete their market and not build another one. Sometimes, they wholesale stop doing anything. I call it the bozo protocol. That's what the developers are constantly in, apparently; the bozo protocol. 

3. They have broken so many elements of the game that I lost count. Villagers will go full dipshit mode and either take forever to build multiple buildings, or will stop building things during building operations all together. The patrol and attack move functions also are almost completely broken right now, too. If something is patrolling or moving-and-attacking and it catches and kills a unit, it stops its patrol or attack move. This obviates the entire purpose of those commands. Morons. 

Overall, the game somehow manages to have worse stability, functionality, and AI than it did years or even decades ago. How they messed all of this up, and continuously fail to fix it, is beyond me. I wish I could be as stupid as the assholes that make this game. It must be liberating to have no accountability because everyone knows you are too stupid to be held responsible for real things.

It's incredible how a game that's older than some ancient civilizations can still hold its ground and make me feel like a conqueror with a laptop instead of a sword. Here's my two cents on this time-traveling strategy extravaganza.

First of all, let's talk about the graphics. The Definitive Edition has given this classic game a facelift that even Cleopatra would envy. The once-pixelated warriors and buildings now look sharper than my mother-in-law's criticisms, and the landscapes are more vibrant than a medieval tapestry on steroids. I'm telling you, I had to resist the urge to touch the screen and feel the silky smooth textures of my virtual empire.

But the real magic lies in the gameplay. It's like a never-ending chess match where you're not just moving pieces but commanding armies, building castles, and slinging insults at your enemies in the chat. From the humble beginnings of your little town to the booming civilization that spans continents, Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition lets you live out your dreams of world domination without the pesky consequences of actual warfare. Who needs real-life battles when you can send an army of Teutonic Knights to wipe out your friend's puny village?

Speaking of friends, the multiplayer experience is a barrel of laughs and surprises. It's like a medieval-themed reality show where alliances are made and broken, and diplomacy is as reliable as a trebuchet made by a blindfolded engineer. Just when you think you've secured a friendship pact, your so-called ally sends an army of elephants crashing through your defenses. The betrayal stings worse than being hit by an arrow right in the horse's rump.

Now, let's address the AI. Oh boy, the AI. They're like cunning medieval geniuses one moment and complete dimwits the next. It's as if they learned military strategy from a toddler playing with wooden blocks. Sometimes they march into battle with the precision of a synchronized dance routine, and other times they get stuck in a corner of the map, futilely banging their swords against a tree. But hey, it's all part of the charm, right? I mean, who doesn't want to witness a pack of knights galloping headfirst into a forest?

In conclusion, Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition is a timeless gem that combines historical accuracy with comedic chaos. It's the kind of game that can make you feel like Genghis Khan one minute and an overzealous architect the next. So gather your friends, sharpen your wit, and get ready to build an empire that will stand the test of time, or at least until someone accidentally sets the town center on fire. Trust me, it's happened.

P.S. Don't blame me if you start seeing knights and castles in your dreams. That just means you're becoming a true medieval conqueror. Embrace it with force!",1573786727,1700665877,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the ""queue re-seed"" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.
-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.
-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.
-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.
-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.
-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.
-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.
-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.
-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.
-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.
-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.
-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.
-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.
-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.

Singleplayer campaigns have been improved and remade from scratch. There is a lot to learn in multiplayer, it's hard as fuck. Sure, you'll go down a lot but if you're determined, you'll gitgud and start enjoying it in no time.

This edition, particularly, is an exemple of how to remake a game without adulterating it: bringing ""quality of life"" improvements such as the self-reseeding farms, and moderatly and coherently innovating, from the new civilizations and the balancing of old ones, to aesthetic issues such as making full songs out of the very short civilizations' leitmotiven of the original game. Not to mention the Art of War intermediate tutorials which teach players who already know the basics of playing the basics of how to play well.

Original Review Below:

I mostly play online with my friends and, as our time has been limited by adulthood, we usually stick to team games against the AI. In HD, this was usually a matter of whittling them down over time, even against hardest. The new extreme AI erases that advantage and makes us have to think instead of just vomit the same units at them. They rebuild in different areas and employ player-like strategies to counter you. The rest of the game is great, the graphics are gorgeous, but the AI is what really brings me to love this version of AoE2 over all others.

I never thought I'd still be playing this game over 20 years after its original release. It may have taken a while to get to this point, but the Definitive Edition is a perfect example of how to update a game to the modern day. It is packed full of content even for a multiplayer-avoider like me, and it somehow looks gorgeous despite having the same 20-year-old aesthetic. A tangible effort has gone into rebalancing and updating everything, while keeping the changes and new stuff as true to the original design as possible (DLC civs are a small exception as they tend to get some fancy stuff).

As a chronic campaign player, I do wish there was a better indicator of the quality and difficulty of each campaign, especially the ones carried over from HD Edition as most(all?) of them have been redesigned. There is a big difference between a 'good' campaign(interesting objectives/design and an actual AI economy) and a 'bad' one(glorified skirmish battles and/or infinite enemy resources) and it's hard to tell which is which until you're neck deep in them. And there are a LOT of campaigns.

Speaking of that, difficulty settings have sucked for me in both campaign and skirmish vs AI. Standard is often too easy and makes the AI highly passive, while Moderate skyrockets AI aggression and forces me to play in a more urgent, stressful way in order to keep up. I don't want to play harder than is comfortable keeping my APMs up just to stand a chance... if only I could split the difference somehow.",1700463664,1700463664,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have been playing computer/video games for around 30 years now, and this game is the absolute worst game I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. It is not even remotely close. This game is the basement pits of gaming in every regard. The AI is atrocious. Units will completely ignore attacking enemy units in favour of swinging a sword or firing a crossbow at a house or mill, and will not engage the attacker udner any circumstance. Pathing is appaling, the formation system is intended to enable groups of units to move around in a semi realistic manner, but what actually happens is your big long line of pike just wheel in place or reform endlessly while being turned into mulch by firearms. 
	Enemy AI units are ""just better"" because ""reasons"" - the same unit with the same technologies and same upgrades will have roughly double the range of yours, double the power and be virtually unkillable. Watching 60 hand cannon die to one AI hand cannon as they wheel about helplessly or shoot at a farm instead is not particularly fun to watch.
	It's also almost impossible to attack the correct thing, densely built up enemy fortresses cheese the isometric view by making it impossible to attack guard towers, you instead have to kill everything around the guard tower before you can even have your units click on it. All the while the guard tower is just sweeping a giant laser beam of arrows across your army.",1700450257,1700450257,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The classic RTS that came out in 1999 makes a return in its most fantastic iteration yet! When I was in high school we didn't have internet, so all I ever did was play games against the AI and design elaborate custom maps that nobody would ever play except for myself. [i]Which always felt kind of like I was cheating against the AI, since I knew where everything was going to be ahead of time![/i]

Nowadays online play against both single opponents and teams is an option with different queues for ranked and unranked games, in addition to co-op campaigning with a friend or just teaming up on the AI in a custom game room. There's a huge and thriving community around the game with sponsored tournaments and even professional players, streamers with thousands of subscribers on Twitch, and community events for us casual players to enjoy some shenanigans. 

I love that the bulk of the community is over the age of 20, too. Something about the art style and real-time strategic gameplay appeals more to us adults than to the kiddos, and it's nice to know that when I play online my opponent is more likely to be fifty than twelve. I've had enough childish nonsense from players in other games, this community is like a breath of fresh air from that, though you do still get your occasional idiot. The plethora of different civilizations keep the game from ever getting stale, yet the commonalities between them make trying a new one less intimidating than in other, similar games. No matter what ""civ"" you ""random"" into if you elect to choose random, you have some idea what to do if you've played any other.

The game has hundreds of hours of campaigns covering mostly real events in various continents. Campaign missions function almost like free-form puzzles in which you have to apply you knowledge of the game's mechanics to find a appropriate and effective solution to the mission's challenge. If structured campaigns are not your interest, however, the game also offers a skirmish mode where you can fight against 1 or up to 7 AIs using conditions and maps of your choosing. With over 30 civilisations (and counting), each with their own unique units and buildings, skirmish mode battles can be varied and interesting each time and provide a source, at least for me, of infinite entertainment because, much like chess, it just never gets boring to play. In terms of the difficulty of the AI, I would say that it can present a considerable challenge if you play against hard, hardest or extreme. I will say, at first, it can be difficult to even defeat moderate AI because, especially if you're new to RTS games, the game can require lots of macro and micro management of units, particularly in the dark and feudal age where you have to properly and efficiently manage your villagers to the right resources or risk aging up to slowly and being demolished by a castle age or late feudal age opponent. Luckily, you can find build orders online to give you an idea of what to do in the first 10-15 mins of the game. Similar to chess, the game has common 'openings' you can try that set your economy up for a certain type of play. Examples are: fast castle, fast imperial, man-at-arms rush, archer rush, scout rush, dark age rush or tower rush. In terms of visual presentation, I think the game looks amazing. The game is an isometric format and while units and buildings are neither realistic nor cartoony, but they are very clear and have, much like chess pieces, designs that are distinct and easy to identify. This is important because units all have counter units, so it is necessary to be able to quickly identify the unit your up against and respond with the correct counter unit. In terms of support, the game is constantly getting updates, quality of life changes, and even new civilisations and campaigns via DLC. I cannot speak at the moment about multiplayer because I do not play it; however, I know that it has a relatively large multiplayer scene and that its ranked matches mode tries to pair you with players on a similar level to you. I will say that this game is not really one that you can just open up a first time and be good at (unless you are already well versed in RTS games) and even after 250 hrs I'm still not that great at it at all (not that that affects the fun factor too much). The campaigns are much more forgiving, but it terms of skirmish against the AI at hard-extreme difficulty, or real players, be prepared to lose quite often initially...perhaps even in catastrophic fashion. If you keep at it, however, the games mechanics will eventually click and by then you will have a game that can provide endless entertainment whilst stimulating your brain, much like chess.",1699542887,1699542887,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

It's not just a game; it's a magnet that sucks you into an alternate universe where time ceases to exist. You might start playing at 8 pm and suddenly realize it's 4 am, and you're still battling William Wallace in the tutorial.

The depth of this game is like an endless pit‚Äîjust when you think you've mastered it, a new strategy smacks you in the face and humbles you. You'll go from proudly boasting your invincible army of Paladins to shamefully staring at the remnants of your decimated civilization, wondering where it all went wrong. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, from triumph to despair, in the span of a few well-placed trebuchet shots.

The gameplay is as captivating as a car crash. You'll find yourself micromanaging your villagers like a frantic puppeteer, coaxing them to gather resources faster than a squirrel hoarding nuts for winter. But don't get too comfortable. Just when you think you've secured victory, an army of berserkers crashes through your gates, making you reconsider your life choices and your faith in the reliability of stone walls.

The game's unpredictability is like a sneaky thief in the night‚Äîjust when you think you've fortified your defenses, it steals your relics, burns your crops, and insults your mother. It's a constant test of your wits, reflexes, and your ability to come up with excuses for why you missed your friend's birthday party (sorry, my castle got sieged, can't leave now).

In conclusion, Age of Empires 2 isn't just a game; it's a journey through the depths of your own sanity. With its addictive gameplay and unforgiving challenges, it's a surefire way to test your relationships, your patience, and your resolve. Enter at your own risk, and be prepared to emerge as either a triumphant conqueror or a broken shell of your former self.

I don't have any of the nostalgia because I never played this as a kid, but oh man is this is classic. The gameplay is fairly simple, which is why I think it's so appealing and accessible, yet there's a massive skill ceiling and thousands of different ways to play. There's hundreds upon hundreds of hours of gameplay in the singleplayer campaigns, sandbox modes, and custom scenarios alone, PLUS online multiplayer, and you can also question your capabilities in ranked multiplayer like many modern games, or play team ranked if you truly want to destroy your will to live. Side-note: taunting your enemies (or teammates) with voicelines will never not be funny, and SHOULD be done. After 25 years this game is still getting continuous updates and expansions, which somehow still find ways to freshen up the gameplay and maintain balance across a large roster of civilizations (35 in the base game, and currently 10 more in DLC). I should also mention that the ""classic"" civs included in the base game are still extremely competitive, with some being the best in the game, so don't feel like you are at a disadvantage for not purchasing the DLC civs. Overall, 10/10, would get castle rushed on Arena and panic because my defenses aren't set up yet on Arena again.",1698761529,1698761529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Definitive Edition is a large graphics update, but it also includes more civilizations to play as and more campaigns to play; it is much more mod-friendly than prior versions as well.  There is more, but those are most important.  I have been playing this game since the late 90s when I was a wee little tike.

Banned maps sometimes appear and they keep matchmaking UK players with Chinese players who you cannot talk to. Insufficient punishment for early game quitters in 4v4 and those matches become a coin toss. Open maps difficult to play due to the counter system being paper, scissors & rock with not enough time to react.

I have been watching the movement of units and villagers. I am convinced that my time has been largely wasted believing that you can actually get good at this game by moving your units accordingly so they do as they are told... they do not. Villagers constantly get stuck and take horrible long way rounds and can't even walk in a straight line anymore.

Attack move is broken, units manically dance around huge clumps of melee units and then sometimes attack. Aggressive stance is random and luck based and trying to micro each single unit is extremely difficult due to drag boxes being too big.

The pathfinding is getting more noticeable and unforgivable - this gives huge advantages to projectile archers and fast building castles + trebs, and making late game battles extremely messy with melee troops unable to make up their minds in the chaos.

But i'm insulted. Reselling Age of Empires 1 for the THIRD time at such a stupid price plus keep bringing out DLCs every months that are P2W, splitting the player base between those fanboys who will suck up to anything and the casuals who simply want better AOE2.

It's a journey through time where you'll build kingdoms, wage epic battles, and occasionally get a chuckle out of the absurdity of it all.

From the moment you step into the medieval world of Age of Empires II, you'll find yourself in a setting that's as historically accurate as a knight in shining rubber armor. Sure, you've got castles, armies, and epic siege weapons, but you've also got monks that can convert war elephants and trebuchets that can fling cows. It's like a history book, but with a sprinkle of absurdity.

The graphics are like a tapestry that's been run through a time machine set to ""comedy."" The medieval landscapes are filled with jesters, knights in bathrobes, and kings who talk like they've had too much mead. It's like walking through a Renaissance faire where the jesters are the real rulers.

Gameplay is the heart and soul of Age of Empires II's comedy. You'll gather resources faster than a turkey leg disappears at a carnival and send armies into battles that resemble a medieval food fight. It's like running a kingdom with all the strategic prowess of a well-timed pie toss.

The variety of civilizations is like a buffet of caricatures. Whether you lead the Vikings, the Byzantines, or the Teutons, each civilization comes with its unique quirks and units that are as unconventional as a catapult filled with rubber chickens. It's like playing dress-up with a closet full of medieval madness.

The campaigns are like epic tales that don't take themselves too seriously. You'll be part of stories filled with legendary heroes, epic battles, and the occasional twist that makes you wonder if the game's writers were indeed jesters in disguise. It's like being in a medieval sitcom where you're the hero, and the script is full of delightful surprises.

The community is a gathering of history enthusiasts who enjoy adding their own comedic twist. Whether you're sharing tales of your catapulted cows or discussing the absurdity of the in-game voices, Age of Empires II players are like a comedy club audience, ready to share a laugh.

In conclusion, Age of Empires II is not just a game; it's a medieval comedy stage where you can rewrite history with a humorous twist. It's a chance to lead your armies into absurd battles, to build kingdoms with a sprinkle of silliness, and to conquer the ages while sharing a chuckle. So, if you've ever dreamt of leading a parade of jesters into battle or launching flaming sheep at your enemies, Age of Empires II is the medieval mirthquake you've been waiting for. It's time to don your jesters' cap, lead your quirky army, and conquer the ages with laughter. To history and hilarity!",1698253292,1698253531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

New useless graphic, i played this game my whole life, now i don't recognise xbow, husklar, light cav ...
Cav and infantry both cost 1 pop, even worse, some civ has cav costing 0.9 pop
Castle and Tower shot arrow from nothing, and don't cost pop. So at late game, if you spam castle or bombard tower, it is like you have 250 pop instead of 200 pop, very OP. Even worse, an empty building can kill you (castle drop near ennemy town center),  what is this bullshit.
Archer are OP, their arrow ignore building and forest, coz of it, infantry are useless, you can't destroy house in peace
Onager insta shot rocks and are OP, that isn't an onager, it is a little bombard canon in disguise. Nowhere else you can see an onage with no recovery and attack frame.
Villager can continue building house while being attacked, coz of it, going infantry only at feudal age is useless, you can't attack a pro player who will just quick wall, even worse, you can get easily trapped by building.

- Definitive Edition of any game made up until now
- strategy game of all time next to Starcraft 2, which is legendary on its own terms
- sandbox of a strategy game with endless possibilities to play with
- still supported game of this era, still recieving new DLC's, still recieving new patches, always getting better (especially considering that its still run on its original Spaghetti code from 1999 and built upon that)
- and most wide-ranging game of its type ever made (there are about 10 immediately playable gamemodes right out of the box on ""Skirmish"" single player, which of course are also playable in multiplayer
- and (mostly) historically accurate campaign-simulator of all time (and every single of these handcrafted campaigns has its own feel)
- (in my opinion) and most interesting strategy game to be watched live or in VODs (Starcraft has fixed maps so there's less adaptation)

The only thing, AoE2DE is still lacking is more playable Coop-Campaigns. I would even pay for more of them as singular DLCs since they are loads of fun to play with friends.

This game came out in 1999 and look at the attention, love and fanbase it still has. So much of that is new players as well, not just born out of nostalgia. It's a case of hitting it out of the park when it came to the RTS Genre to be balanced, fun, engaging and even historically accurate (all things considering) in a way that any game of any era wishes it could be to hold onto that kind of longevity.

Is it genre defining? I'm not sure that it is, that there's any one thing in particular that makes Age of Empires 2 so amazing in terms of a RTS, but it represents the absolute best that a game can provide overall.

It's name is synonymous with the genre at this point and it's outlived every other horse in the race, including those intended by their own developers to replace it. As they say, lightning doesn't strike twice.",1697702974,1697702974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a game that I grew up playing in Middle School during computer class. We would have LAN Parties where one side of the room would fight against the other.

I don't really remember the story campaign, or whether or not I ever finished it. I only remember the skirmishes that took place even if the details elude me. I bought Age of Empires II Definitive Edition to support the work they put into it. I bought Age of Empires II HD because I had thought it would be a good walk down memory lane.

I'll pass a recommend to the game for bringing back good memories and, perhaps, an agreement that I've moved on from RTS Games. I don't have the reaction time, or the attention span, that I used to have growing up. My ability to focus on multiple things at the same time simply isn't there but Age of Empires II still holds up to current-gen games. 

If your looking for a solid RTS with near infinite replay-ability? Age of Empires II has you covered.
If your looking for a sold RTS with historical campaigns which may, or may not, be stretched in truth while detailing certain events that took place. Age of Empires II has you covered.

Yes, this game was my childhood.  Yes, I miss the RTS genre.  Yes, I appreciate how much effort the developers have put into keeping the game going and coming up with new content.

game , i love age of empire 2 definitive edition, best game ever made, they have little people and you fight each other and its fun to play and make people to beat other people up, you play the game and get stuff to make stuff and then you use the stuff to break the enemy stuff and its very fun to play, it is my favorite game, i love age of empires 2 it makes me have fun i have fun because it is a fun game, i love age of empires 2 definitive edition, they even update the game all the time and that is cool too because it is cool that they update the game because they update the game it is cool because new things come out for the game, and it makes me happy that they update the game, because the game is fun and they add things to the game, so you can play the game and have more fun, it is a fun game and i love this game, it is actually my favorite game, i love this game so much its unreal, you have no idea how much i love this game, it is a cool game and you make stuff and they even update the game all the time still, and it is very cool that they do that, it makes me happy that they update the game :D i love this game so much its unreal, this is the best game ever made, and they even update the game which is cool, and they also have cool looking buildings for different people, which is also cool, because then the buildings look different, and that is cool because not all of the buildings for every civilization looks the same, and that is cool because the buildings look different for different civilizations and stuff, and they also have people who are only for one civilization which is cool because every civilization gets their own cool person they can use to beat other people up, and it is cool, and they are cool because different civilizations get their own cool people to use, they also have different maps and stuff and even different animals, like rhinos and elephants and deer and ibex and pigs and sheep and alligators and jaguars and wolves, i don't know if they have other ones, they also have birds too, which is cool because they have different animals, they have water buffalo too and the animals that they have are cool because they are cool to play with in the game, and that is cool because you can also make buildings and civilizations are actually have their own bonuses making you play in a different way but i always just play with good units no matter what (skirmishers with no armor upgrades to save food) skirmishers are cool because they can kill people at range, but don't die to other ranged people, so they are really broken, also bombard cannons are broken and i recommend this game because it is cool and makes me happy and is fun to play, they also have ranked and that is cool because you can beat people up but they also have 45ish different civilizations in the game or something, which is cool, because you can play a bunch of different people and have fun with them all, and you can also click on a unit and see their hp, which is cool because you can see if your people are healthy and ready for battle, and you can also i want to eat some pizza because pizza is kind of yummy, but i want a good pizza that is made in a brick oven or something that is cool, and is not super greasy like papa johns or pizza hut or dominos or little ceasars, and you can also eat the animals in game, or some of them, for some reason you cant eat wolves or jaguars or alligators or the monitor lizard things, those are scary, and they kill my villager going to wall because i don't have loom, because i don't want loom early game because it makes me delay a villager, but i want extra villager, but then they die because i have no loom and they die and it makes me sad, and i usually will just resign after i lose a villager to a lizard because it makes me want to cry, actually I had one kill a skirmisher i had and it made me want to eat pizza because pizza also makes me happy, but i also like this game because it makes me happy, so i like both and my favorite part of this game is that it is fun to play and gets updates and stuff, and that is cool, because there is new stuff every once and a while, and that is cool, because it will be new stuff that you have not seen before, and then i die to it because roman people are good against my skirmishers and they are too op, but that is ok, because i still play the game, because the game is fun to play :D it is my favorite game to play, it makes me happy to play this game, they also have cool looking trees, and they look nice, but most people turn on a mod that makes the trees small and sad, but im not one of those people, i like the trees, they make me feel happy, you can also have boats, but water combat is just worse than land combat in every way, and i hope they change it one day, i hope they do what that one rome at war mod did or whatever it is called, where you can do more stuff on the water, i think that would be fun, please can you put that in the game, thank you, in a new update, this game is also cool because it gets a lot of updates still, and that is cool for the game, it makes me happy, but they should add better water combat, i think it would make water maps more fun to play, and then you can go to island map and then make cool things that are not in the game now, i think they will add more to the game with updates, because they update the game quite a bit actually, this is my favorite game ever, it makes me happy to play :D and i like this game because it is cool and has a lot of stuff, and they even have hotkey customization and that is cool, because i like to put my delete unit button on a mouse key so i accidentally delete stuff, like my people or break a building, and i like to pretend that its like a natural disaster killed some of my units, or broke one of my buildings, and that makes the game fun too, there is also a dinosaur mod, and you can have t-rexes, and plesiosaurs and ankylosaurs and i think stegosaurs but i dont remember, they also have velociraptors, but i think this game is very fun because of all the different things you can do, there are also cool custom maps, where you have birds explode, and they also have race cars in the game, i think this game is cool, actually it is so cool that it might be my favorite game ever, actually it is my favorite game ever i decided right now, because of all the cool stuff they have in the game, such as different civilizations and maps and mods and animals and trees, but i don't like the water combat, it is not that cool, but other than that, this game is pretty cool, and i like to play this game a lot, it makes me happy they have a lot of units, like camels, horses, armor horses, super armor horses (byzantines) and archers, crossbow people, and super crossbow people, and they also have people with clubs and people with swords and people with swords and shields and people with big two handed swords, and they even have people riding elephants with spears, and people riding elephants with bows, AND EVEN ELEPHANTS WITH SCORPIONS ON THEM, and they have scorpions and other siege units, such as: magonels, onagers, heavy siege onagers, bombard cannons, rams, siege rams, capped siege rams, and trebuchets, but you can only make those from castles for some reason, and there are also, i don't remember what else, actually they also have horses with people on them who shoot arrows from bows, and there are also people with spears, and pikes, and halberds, and there are also people who have a halloween costume on all the time (eagle warriors) and maybe jaguar warriors as well and skirmishers, i didnt mean to leave those out they have monks too, and i lov",1697398626,1697398626,True,2,1,0.541984736919403076,2,True,False,False

It's good.

I have unreasonable nostalgia for this game. Unironically, one of the best tutorials in all of video games, the campaign. I love a good single-player mode in any game, and this one is great. plus there's so much expression of skill, through what gets micromanaged and how well, how robust the economy and positioning is throughout the map - this game has a lot of refinement, is what I'm trying to see. It's a very complex game, and learning the ins and outs, perfecting your craft, all that stuff - it's a challenge to learn it all and implement it into gameplay. It's a challenge to get good at it.

Then again I never played competitively, I'm afraid of interacting with people. so I'm not that good at the game lol.

still. I love the atmosphere, the music is iconic, and I get a fresh hit of dopamine when i hear that melee clanging sound. this is a big comfort game for me, maybe the biggest. all the other ones I know, my old pokemon games, and zelda, and the whole library of super nintendo games my older brother pirated when i was younger, all of those are. just. not in my hands anymore. Nintendo's squeezed pokemon so hard it feels completely different from when i was little, and hell, the new Link and Zelda are their own characters. I even like them, that's the thing. And all the assorted snes games are packaged behind nintendo's own shop. there's this... ugly membrane of choices that all make engaging with them feel... bitter. hollow.

Age of Empires 2 changed a little too. not much. not so dramatically. the meta seems to have shifted? I hear? but at its core, this is still that same game. It feels like a place beyond time, beyond age and death and worry. I'm a nervous lady. change makes me nervous. the whole world feels like it's changing for the worse, all the time, and every little detail that I don't like about new things in those old franchises... feels wrong. Age of Empires, it's always there. still the same solid stone, still telling these old tales and serving the same beer.

That's the feeling i have for this game. A warm welcome from old friends and neighbors, in a cozy inn with a roaring fire. It tastes like mom's cooking, it smells like my childhood room, it feels like being home again.

That said, I really think this isn't a game for everyone. I think that if you don't have the inclination to micromanage things, handle pressure and respond fast in a fight, you might not like this game. If you don't like forgetting what you wanted to do because you got distracted (like i do sometimes), you might not have fun. it's not the most forgiving game in the world, and there's a lot to learn. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, i don't blame you.

but with all that said.

- The same 4 maps for every rotation and the rest that nobody plays/resigns after the match starts
- The pathfinding of a blind turtle
- A report system that doesn't work
- And much more 11

You may give the argument of; ""it's an old game, you should be happy it's still alive"", and to that I say: 
It's a product, and I payed for features like a decent ranked system as well as a report feature that enables me and others to report those that are toxic and/or cheat, and these don't work.

There is still the occasional unit not following orders, but on the whole, this game is in a much better state than it was. Some of the newer content is reused from the original game, which I ended up finding as more of an easter egg than an issue. Plus, with the addition of the original (piecemeal, anyway) I enjoy having the first two games in one place. 

Somehow, this game made the path finding for units worse. They get stuck on each other like the original Age of Empires (I), and they don't follow orders. This has made it almost impossible to effectively do anything, accurately. They attack the closest unit, more often than not, and the formations won't respond, which made some of the challenge missions in Sun Tzu impossible to complete properly. Not only that, but the game has crashed on me multiple times during campaigns, and I usually don't save because I've never needed to. Health bars won't display properly, and most of the ""pretty"" graphics don't even work. AoEII HD is a far superior product, and the addition of new civilizations doesn't nearly make up for it. Furthermore, the AI very clearly cheats, which, if I recall, was something the devs said they got rid of. But I tested it in two separate campaign scenarios, and the AI responds to my movements before it could have seen what I was doing. This was a good game, but DE has turned a good game into a poor game.",1590096120,1696554709,True,0,0,0.549867570400238037,0,True,False,False

The new updated visuals are great and the quality of life changes are much appreciated. The new voice acting for the single player campaigns are pretty hit or miss thought.

You can get it at 20 ‚Ç¨/$, which to be honest, is a fair price, but you could also wait for a sale to get it (it now goes for 5‚Ç¨/$ which is an absolute steal).

I needed to rack up some hours with this game after having more than 300 from the HD edition. If you're looking for someone who knows their way into it, and have been for a while, I can tell you all about it.

[h1]What the hell is an Age of Empires?[/h1]
For starters into the series, let me give you a quick overview. Age of Empires is an RTS series that revolves around you picking certain civilizations to play on certain maps. These civilizations have certain things that make them unique to one another. In the case of Age of Empires 2, there are these differences:
[list]
 [*][h3]Bonuses[/h3] Includes anything that might help you in your game, even includes things that your teammates can use. I say [i]might[/i] because some are trade offs, but just know it's what makes them unique.
 [*][h3]Unique Units[/h3]Basically units only a certain civilization can make. Some are good against certain units, others are good against others. Some need to be massed to be effective, some are fine going solo against a swarm. Of course, you can go the whole game without making them, but it's an option to have.
 [*][h3]Unique Techs[/h3]Things you can throw resources at in-game to give you an advantage over your foes. They usually come much later in the game, but they can make you units not only more powerful, but more [b]uniquely[/b] powerful.
[*][h3]Tech Tree[/h3]The game simply won't allow you to normally make every unit and get every upgrade in the game. If you're looking to make powerful mounted riders [i]and[/i] powerful archers, it's so rare, that I haven't come across an actual example. This makes you prefer certain unit types, and you need a plan to fully utilize your civilization.
[/list]
Now, why did I rattle off a bunch of stuff most fans of this game series already know about? Because this is what makes Age of Empires 2 that much more re-playable and fun. There are about 30 or so civilizations in the game, with arguably a large amount of strategy you can try with each civilization, from early archer rush, to a fast castle into knights, with a similarly variable amount of effectiveness, not to mention the skill of each individual player! It's dizzying to even think about them!
As a fan of strategy games, like the Total War series, and the Paradox grand strategy games, playing just Age of Empires 2 is a pleasure to have, and I look forward to the many hours that will come with it.

[h2]Why Definitive Edition?[/h2]
This is more to those who are either players from the HD edition, or those who are considering buying this over the HD edition, and vice versa. As a fan since playing the Forgotten Empires DLC way back in 2015 (and arguably much earlier if you read my HD review), here are some things that make DE worth every penny, even if you already own the HD edition and its DLCs like I did.
[olist]
[*][h3]Genuine quality-of-life improvements[/h3]My favourite, these are things that make the game either much more accessible, or make the pros be even more pro. They're too long to list, but some game-play ones are queuing up technologies (plural) after units and vice versa, selecting all buildings of a certain type, auto-scouting (though some might disagree), queuing up villager or military actions, and much more! 
This also includes bug fixes which makes the HD edition the equivalent of an unkempt attic.
[*][h3]Regular updates[/h3]I love games which not only fix bugs, but regularly update the game. They don't even have to introduce something new, just regular tweaking and changing is mostly good enough. In fact, the aforementioned civilizations are objectively better compared to HD because of the next point.
[*][h3]Civilization balance[/h3]In the HD edition, players used to really get riled up over certain civilizations because they are just that good, and don't get me started on the Age of Conquerors edition. I never liked Hun wars. With the Definitive Edition, now all the civilizations mostly stand a chance against each other, because of regular balance changes. 
The buffs, nerfs, and even trade offs regularly introduced are very welcome. If you don't believe me, go to aoestats.io and see how many civilizations near 50% in their win rate. If anything, it makes the HD edition's lack of updates just that much sadder.
[*][h3]New content[/h3]Ignoring the paid DLCs, the Definitive Edition itself came with a ""free DLC"" in the form of the Last Khans. This introduces 4 new civilizations and 3 new campaigns. 
While it doesn't explicitly say in the store page, the campaigns from the Forgotten Empires DLC were also reworked, in very major ways, making them more streamlined and fun, and less novelty scenarios. When I mean novelty, I meant turning Age of Empires 2 to a stealth mission in the Sforza campaign. 
I know this because I actually played the Forgotten Empires campaign. [b]I'm serious![/b] Go to my profile and see my achievements for the HD edition. Theoretically, this sets DE further from the HD edition, and is yet more content that comes with the game!
[*][h3]Graphics, sounds, and superficial changes[/h3]The game just looks, sounds, and feels better. This edition is no Warcraft 3: Reforged, and is far more than a graphical remake. Yet, the better graphics, reworked music (which I love quite a bit), and even much better UI make your experience with this much better.
[/olist]
Unless you insist on playing the older versions, like friends exclusively on Voobly, the Definitive Edition really is the superior of them. I did not regret spending every penny on it, and neither should you, so I highly recommend getting it!",1696231300,1696242188,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The devs provide consistent updates for balancing civilizations and addressing bugs, and combined and expanded on all of the HD edition DLCs with new ones as well, on top of including the original campaigns from both Age of Kings and Conquerors back in 1999 and 2000, respectfully, with modern tweaks (to mixed effect).

Or perhaps they already have the 2013 HD edition and ask why should they ""repurchase"" the game as a Definitive Edition.

To say that Age of Empires II Definitive Edition is the same game as Age of Empires II HD edition (that came out in 2013) just with some better graphics doesnt do it justice. Let's talk about the graphics first. If you have a good computer, you can download the HD textures pack which allows you to dynamically zoom in and out by rolling your mouse wheel and truly admire the detail of every single unit and every single building. Even back when I was a kid in the early 2000s, I actually loved playing Age of Empires II at 800x600 resolution than the standard of 1280x1024 5:4 aspect ratio back in the day, because the buildings looked bigger and more zoomed in, even if they got a bit blurrier. I never liked playing Aoe 2 on high resolutions because then, everything became tiny and you'd lose immersion. 2013's HD edition tied the resolution to your monitor's native res with no way of changing it internally in the game menu, so if you wanted a more zoomed in view, you'd have to manually change your desktop resolution before launching the game. Tedious. So Definitive edition's dynamic zoom capability is a big service to all those who appreciate detail. On top of that, you can zoom in quite far before the graphics get blurry, so there's plenty of new detail to admire. Sadly, the game doesn't allow you to play like this as there's a lot of stuff going on and in a real time RTS you have to manage your economy and react quickly to threats elsewhere.

Now let's talk about the 2nd reason why Definitive Edition is an improvement over HD edition. Not only has Definitive Edition revoiced every single campaign (granted, i preferred the old voices to the new ones) and reworked every single campaign slide artwork (for better or for worse, at least the new drawing style remains consistent throughout all campaigns while 2013's HD edition came with Microsoft's 1999 Age of Kings and 2000 The Conqueror's artstyles mixed with a crudely drawn new artstyle for the Forgotten empires, and then a more refined one for African kingdoms + Rise of the rajas) and on top of that, Definitive Edition has also voiced all the Forgotten empires campaigns that only had textslides in the HD edition, gives you 3 new campaigns (Kotyan Khan, Ivaylo, and Tamerlane), 1 new architecture style (steppe / central asian), and finally all paid DLC factions and architecture styles that were released later, are given free to the AI factions encountered in the base game's campaigns, so you also get to see new Bohemian and Polish architecture e.g. when you're fighting the eastern european factions in the Mongol campaign, even if you haven't purchased the DLC that would then allow you to play as or against them in random maps or play their faction specific campaigns.

So for me for example, replaying the Forgotten empires campaigns with narrated slides and in-game voiced dialogue was definitely a treat, although they removed the El Dorado campaign and replaced it with a new one called Pachacuti where you also play as the Incas but with completely different missions. And they also changed some missions that were heavily scripted and felt more like an RPG than an RTS scenario. So yes, the Forgotten campaigns did lose some of their complexity and uniqueness and got more streamlined, but are still fun to play.

The AI is also very good. The 2013 HD edition AI sucked; it built no walls but 20 towers and tried to swarm you with units and resigned the moment you destroyed its TC. It was so unfun to play against that I instead played with the 1999 Age of Kings CD A.I. but on hard difficulty. In Definitive Edition i play with the new AI on moderate and it feels engaging but not overwhelming.

And finally this is obviously the game with the most active multiplayer community, with all the new story driven DLCs from Dawn of the Dukes to Dynasties of India, new factions, new building sets, new units, and even Age of Empires I and Rise of Rome's factions have been ported over in a separate paid expansion pack game mode, so seriously, what are you waiting for?",1695885306,1695886625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now, talking seriously, Age 2 is a must if you're looking to get into the RTS genre. There's so much replayability in this and the balance is tight for you to pick up a civ and try to win the game. Playing this game is an absolute treat, everything from the base building, to the combat system, to the upgrade/age advancement system is a finely tuned machine that Ensemble Studios developed since the OG Age 2.

And if you ever get tired of playing hardcore PVP matches you can always find people running scenarios in MP, things like ""Choose your hero RPG"" or ""Castle Blood Alliance"" or ""Survive the Dinosaurs"".

also, the inclusion of the ""Return of Rome"" with all the original races of the first age of empires and its expansion (along with one new race) truly makes my experience to hit a nostalgia climax...(lol) 
I do recommend the base Definitive medieval part for the people that loved the original cd version some eons ago, but I would also recommended the new RoR dlc for the people that also played the original of AoE some more eons ago, to switch between them at any given time, in-game. The Experience of RoR dlc is rather an Age of Empires 1.5 Definitive Edition, which,  for me, its really fun to play with.
The addition of Rome faction (I guess you could say the western part of it) in the medieval part of the game was something that I could never expect, and it was a nice surprise.
Lastly, also the addition of two new original campaigns and some of the old original campaigns of the 90's AoE and RoR was also a mixed modern/nostalgia fun, if I can say that....
over all, its a 9/10 for me really... so... yeah... enjoy!....

This game is often hailed as one of the greatest ever created, and I wholeheartedly concur with that sentiment. Age of Empires II masterfully combines elements of combat, city construction, defense management, and resource handling, making it a truly enjoyable gaming experience. In this edition, the game has received a visual overhaul, with updated sprites that add to the overall enjoyment. Much like many computer games from the early 2000s, the sprite style evokes a sense of nostalgia and artistic charm.

Age of Empires II offers a rich array of gameplay options, including multiplayer matches, single-player skirmishes, immersive campaigns, and a scenario editor, ensuring that players have the potential to spend countless hours in the game's captivating world. The combat mechanics are straightforward and easy to grasp, involving the creation and enhancement of troops, as well as their placement and garrisoning. Players have the flexibility to adjust unit positioning, aggression levels, and guard duties, which extends to naval combat as well.

Admittedly, combat can become somewhat repetitive over time, and managing city defenses can be a bit bothersome, but this is, after all, a war simulation. Such challenges only serve to enhance the authenticity of the experience, making Age of Empires II a timeless classic in the realm of strategy gaming.

Nostalgia Revived:
The graphics have received a major facelift, but the game's heart and soul remain intact. It's like meeting an old friend who's had an amazing makeover but hasn't lost their essence. Reliving classic scenarios in glorious detail is an absolute blast.

Classic Gameplay, Modern Flair:
Age of Empires II's addictive blend of resource management and strategic warfare is as gripping as ever. The devs have sprinkled some modern magic with improved UI and pathfinding, making it accessible to new players while preserving its legendary gameplay.

A Few Hiccups:
The one downside is the change in voiceovers for the original campaigns. The old voices had character, and their absence is felt. It's a small gripe in an otherwise stellar package.

In summary, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition is a must-have for fans old and new. It's a nostalgic trip that feels fresh and exciting, with just a minor hiccup along the way. If you've ever dreamt of commanding empires through history, this is your chance to do it all over again, and it's better than ever.",1695036991,1695036991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. This game is a blast from the past with a ton of fixes that players have been asking for for years.  

2. The multiplayer maps are a blast, and the new campaigns look gorgeous.  

3. New factions are being added at a relatively frequent pace.


Negatives:

1. Some of the newer campaigns have a very disturbing trend of having the AI cheat so that you will play the game exactly the same way that the game makers want you to, rather than giving you the chance to explore and try new and innovative ways to beat the missions.  I am not talking about the ai having ludicrous amounts of money, troops, or other surmountable perks.  I am referring almost unkillable troops.  These forces heal so fast that they are almost impossible to kill.  They heal fast enough that you need 4-5 powerful units attacking each and every single one at the same time in order to maybe kill it.  Those units are placed en mass on various maps, and it sucks all of the fun out of those missions.  I will never replay those missions unless those ridiculous stats are removed from all units.

2. Lazy campaign making.  Aside from the invulnerable units, a trend has appeared where enemies just spawn en mass in parts of the map rather than ""marching"" from the edge of the map, which is only a gate or two lengths away to their desired formation/location.


Conclusion: If you play this game primarily for the multiplayer purposes, I highly suggest getting this game when it and all of its expansion packs are on sale.  If you are wanting to play for the campaigns, skip it.  This is not worth playing unless they take all of the cheating out of everything.  I see that as being likely as a pet squirrel learning how to play the banjo well.",1596337770,1693914439,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Been playing it throughout my life, used to own the disks.
There's a reason this RTS is still active to this day, this is also the few times I've enjoyed Microsoft's influence to the game, with events, competitive updates, and map pools. 

If online isn't your thing, the single player campaigns add countless hours taking part in historically fictitious but fun stories.

The visuals are a stunning improvement (you figure they better be with 20 years in between titles, and they are)...

The menu options are SO MUCH MORE INTUITIVE from the original...I have been playing this game off and on for 24 years now since it came out...(and playing AOE1 before that - yeah I know that game was not as good)...simple things like a mill that gives you the option to AUTO rebuild farms = a HUGE POSITIVE, that you can see how many troops are in a group with an actual # (so when attacking you can see how you are fairing), it gives you a grid ONLY when building so you can see how much spacing between buildings is another HUGE POSITIVE, the LUDICROUS map option which is SO MUCH BIGGER THAN the largest size on the original AOE2 is great for those who LOVE LARGE MAPS...being able to click on a group to easily find them (as the numbers of your groups are at the bottom of the screen...also helps you identify if a group got taken out...

The visuals are awesome, where you see buildings on fire, how they implode when destroyed...

The game is $5 on steam sale right now...I do not work for the company, I just love video games and this game is SO MUCH BETTER than the original which was awesome...including a NON-NARRATION video of some HIGHLIGHTS of my first play thru on STANDARD 1v1 vs the AI...check it out...I plan to post other videos of the game over the next bit as it is such a great game!  :)

MY 1st HIGHLIGHTS of the game VIDEO IS HERE (with no narration ... I plan to post more on my channel in the coming days/weeks/months...): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQP5RxW9NuY

PS:  Oh yeah, one last thing about the ONLY issue with the game...the narrator of the game SUCKS...a SIMPLE FIX to shut him up...press the GEARS at the top of the screen when it first starts, AUDIO, where is says any narration uncheck...you are welcome.  :)  

Trust me the game is worth it and do not let that tiny annoyance sway you from trying out an amazing upgrade of an amazing game

PPS:  I do NOT have any of the DLCs...I use the Byzantines...so no clue if the DLCs change any aspect of the game as I have not bothered with them yet...

I'm changing my review of this game. I use to love it but the matchmaking is terrible and has ruined this game for me. The pathing has actually gotten worse. And now Xbox players pretty much get to play with AI help so they all the work the rest of us put in to get solid build orders going is basically pointless. They keep adding new civs but dont fix the current issues. I don't get it.

I really want to be excited about this game that I use to play as a kid but really it's just more frustrating than fun. I want to love it, i really do. In theory it's my favorite game but they just refused to make choices that benefit the existing game and keep making choices that hurt it. IMHO.

I was one of the biggest fanbois but they broke me.

Unfortunately, the recent updates are just so awful. The pathing is absolutely terrible. Trying to get your units through gates is a nightmare when it used to be so easy. When you invade an enemy town your units just endlessly chase enemy trade carts which is just stupid. Whenever you command your trebuchets to attack a castle, they unpack and then just sit there and do not attack anything. Your boats will be getting attacked and instead of attacking back, they prioritize killing an enemy house or something. Every update it seems like there is always a small change that just makes the game worse. It's been like this for months, and there are more problems that I did not mention.

I'm so bummed because I love this game, but it really feels like instead of fighting the enemy you are battling your own units. I just played a game on hardest instead of extreme, and it was so difficult due to all of the above mentioned problems. It was so so frustrating.

Too many hotkeys. I think there can be a better setup for the controls. Developers think not.
AI is still very bad, another important aspect of the game that was barely improved.

Annoying fundaments. For example you need to build houses for workers. Five workers per house. You will be building 40 houses to reach 200 population. Genius developers!

Pathing is still terrible, for some reason. You click army to go back, they go forward then back. You click your villagers to get food, they walk away from the food then towards it.

Too many research options, easy to forget something during the battle. Simple setup would be good, and would allow less time thinking about research and more time to guide armies.

One example of research being facepalm, when you need militia late game they need many upgrades before they are relevant, this means barracks and also blacksmith upgrades. 

Unbalanced maps. Mirrored maps would solve this rather easily and give fair balancing.

Too easy to troll with some factions, if you have played ranked before then you know this.

The game did not get better with the time, it stayed where it was while time moved forward.",1676175358,1692465288,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In order to win games, you have to study different aspects of the game. It's not based on skill, but on knowledge about the game's mechanics. 

There are multiple types of not only regular units, but also special units unique to each civ that counter each other. You have to know what each one does, what it's weak against, and what it's strong against. Each civ also has different bonuses. Better make some flashcards. 

Have you ever heard of a build order? In this game, you have to memorize different ways to organize your villagers. If you do one little thing wrong in the early game, it will be bye bye for you every time in the late game. In order to even have a chance at winning, you have to follow this order down to the bone, destroying any wish you had of creativity. 

Not only that, sometimes the map you spawn on will have one crucial resource far away from your town center for the enemy to camp. 

Following this, you must spam all of your resources into one unit type and always have your military buildings working. At this point, it's basically rock paper scissors. If you choose the wrong initial unit to make and finally figure out that the enemy chose your counter, it's already too late. 

Once you figured out that you lost the rock paper scissors match, you can resign or keep playing until you eventually lose. The enemy will type something toxic in the chat 75% of the time after this because the community is horrible.",1668648002,1691958039,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

CAVEAT: Sadly this version is plagued by serious bugs. Be ready for some frustration.

Examples:

* Pathing is a constant issue. Coming from other games you might expect your units to be able to walk in a straight line. Well, let's just say there is a lot of room for improvement on path finding in this game.

* The multiplayer matchmaking tends to just drop your party while you are in pre-game chat. A good chunk of my ""played time"" is me browsing the web on the side while I wait for a working lobby.

Singleplayer seems mostly fine. Check out the campaigns!

I truely like AoE (as you can tell from the many many hours I played). Can't think of any other game in which I would tolerate this many errors.

1) Bug: units just freeze and stop their action randomly. (maybe to much processing)
2) Bigger grouping needed.. just make it 100 units in a group, or more . why stop at 60?
3) combat and pathing in this game still haven't been reworked. Still the frustrating reordering to formation. wish there was no formation. attack move and aggression are strange priorities against non attackers (buildings or villagers, instead of the people with weapons!)
4) need a mass canceling cued production by shift-clicking top left. (only can cancel by left clicking individual cues individual buildings at a time.)
5) shift click on idle workers to select all (at least [shift] + [period] select all)

overall still can be a great RTS, just small annoying things still

This was an absolutely excellent remake of AoE2, and it plays as great as ever and looks glorious. However, the devs have been continuously pushing the game to become a mOdErN gAmInG multiplayer button-smasher and ignoring how godawful and robotic the skirmish AI is (which is either infuriating to play against, or extremely buggy and dumb on most non-default game settings). You will get popups about ranked map voting or whatever even if you never touched the multiplayer button, but whole sections of single player just don't work and don't even seen to be on any roadmap.

Even better? They are adding NEW bugs with new updates. The Return of Rome DLC was not only released in a barely functioning state with broken single player, its bugs actually spilled into the main game. So yes, in 2023 you have AoE2: Definitive Edition which in many ways works worse than on release, or the 1999 version of the game. They also frequently break basic mechanics like pathfinding or now even how hard it is to select units/buildings (seriously) with new updates, as if they never did any basic testing.

This is a brilliant game and a brilliant remake. But its current state is genuinely bad, and the devs are actively and blatantly ignoring >90% of their playerbase. The amazing campaigns *should* still work great, but you never know if they still will after the next update reworks Arabia and Extreme difficulty for the 20th time and introduces 10 new bugs for everyone else.

This is not a good time to play AoE2:DE, and the devs seriously DO NOT deserve your money right now.

EDIT: I'll add more because each time I try to get back into it, the more pissed off I get. It genuinely seems like the devs at some point decided to ruin everything what made this game groundbreaking in the first place (influencing everything from Stronghold to Total War) and make it as caveman as they could.

Units walking in formations? Not the AIs, you're literally fighting a swarm of annoying flies who walk and attack you separately from 23446 directions at once or like an endless stream of diarrhea, like in AoE1 cranked to parody levels. (After playing this, it feels so weird to launch AoE3 and see enemies attack you with ARMIES and not swarms of flies.) Each and every single one of them can dodge projectiles separately, of course! And it's easy to check this was not how it used to be - the game still has the ""CD version AI"" which while clearly very dated and not clever, HAS ARMIES WALK IN FORMATIONS. IN 1999.

More elaborate defences - walls, gates, castles and several types of towers? They've done pretty much everything possible to make defensive play difficult and as unrewarding as possible, when THIS WAS LITERALLY THE RTS GAME which showed that RTS can have real defensive options.

Better pathfinding and units that aren't complete morons? I swear it's getting worse and worse and units require more micromanagement than ever so they don't either idle with a battle raging 2 metres away or go Leeroy Jenkins into a bunch of enemy castles after one archer. Don't even get me started on trying to use mangonels and not get your units killed.

Fuck this. This is embarrassing. The state of this game right now is like seeing the Pyramids or Notre Dame turned into a McDonalds. I can't believe that they've managed to bring this to a point where I HATE playing one of my favourite games of all time.

Very on point that they're merging with Activision, this is exactly the type of murdering a legendary game they specialize in. Warcraft, Diablo and Call of Duty are welcoming a new member to the club, I guess.",1586663044,1691213261,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

6. Has lots of different AIs that each have their own styles of play and difficulty.
7. The AI seems to be actually playing the same game you are. It doesn't seem to cheat much if at all beyond knowing where you are. If this was a Creative Assembly game the AI would always have resources regardless and just spam out units it shouldn't be able to afford.

As of the latest patch, this game is an obnoxious mess. The pathing is totally broken, melee units will not be able to find a fight that is logical, ranged units path as bad as the infantry, Siege will not work out a viable path when they need to go straight. villager shift queues no longer work, their pathing is atrocious. 
Forgotten Empires seem keen on messing with the pathing and continually making it worse, they do not seem to make any clear communication about why it's so temperamental and now it's got to the stage where you struggle to enjoy a match. That's if you're one of th elucky ones who doesn't get BSODs due to this patch and it's recent ""hotfix"".
If you're thinking of getting this game right now, Don't do it. Forgotten Empires need to sort out what the hell is going on over there, stop throwing DLC at the game and actually fix the problems that have been problems since release.
How they got the job is beyond me at this point.

now the game crashes and says tampering detected anti cheat makes the game crash even on single player and its completely random.... utter dog shit this is how you know the talentless fucks at relic made this  for an example their last "" great game "" was dawn of war 3 and they abandoned it because people hates the fact it was a god damn dota clone..... these are people who have no class and care not one bit of their game actually works... if you complain they blame you the consumer and abandon it.

update- not only do they fail to mention the largest issue facing gameplay anti cheat bugs but they  have no intention what so ever of fixing the problem.... all so they cant try and get people to buy more shit and use the mp..... they dont want a windfall so we all get  a big weiner in the butt if we paid for it.

One of the most bang-for-buck games. I only played the single-player campaign and this is my first and only RTS game. I almost never play any 2D game, but this game made me give it an exemption.

In this Real Time Strategy game, we start our journey by building the economy and growing our army. Sometimes we try diplomacy and find allies while we get new enemies. We conquer the city by completing assigned objectives which mostly involve destroying enemy bases. 

The story and voiceover are serviceable but not much worth a story. The gameplay is what people love this game for.

Although inefficient, I find it super fun to just overpower my enemy by building a very huge army and sending all of them at once as a ""surprise"" return gift for all the small attacks they do in my base, meanwhile, I do villain laughs seeing their base being ripped apart by my army and they unable to produce enough soldiers to match mine xD

It's a very fun game, single player content alone is extremely huge, and then multiplayer is another thing.

I am changing my review of the game, multiplayer is basically unplayable unless you're willing to put up with constant disconnections on team games / players whos only goal is to grief the game / lobby gate keeping, you will struggle to find games as an experienced player or a new player, its a dice roll if your game will end up in a disconnect or something else.

I then sent my scout on a series of way points around my base.  Apparently one of the points was in a woodline and he got stuck running back and forth from one side of the woodline to the other unable to get to the way point.

It fixes a lot of quality-of-life issues that help Age of Empires II hold up under modern standards, while not changing anything too core to the game's feel.
-----
For those new to Age of Empires II, this is definitely the version to get.  I'll warn you though, that while it may be refurbished very well, this is still an RTS from the '90s, so it has a lot of obscure mechanics and unintuitive ""jank.""  Long-time players will be used to all that, but it's probably uninviting for newcomers.  If you're just messing around with your friends, or doing singleplayer, that probably won't matter to you as much, but if your eyes are on the ranked ladder, it might feel unapproachable.  The decades worth of expansions, while great, only increase the overwhelming amount of unit interactions you need to be aware of.  However, if you're into nerding out about technicalities and analyzing tracked statistics, this game will offer a lot to sink your teeth into, and there are whole communities dedicated to that.

If you like this game's premise, but the thought of ""deep jank"" sounds unappealing, you might enjoy Age of Empires IV instead: a more modern take on this same series with a greater focus on being approachable.

Age of Empires 2 is a game that beautifully embraces simplicity. It offers an accessible yet deep gaming experience.

The gameplay is straightforward: build your empire, gather resources, train armies, and conquer opponents. This simplicity, combined with strategic depth, strikes a perfect balance.

Attention to detail is remarkable. Each civilization is historically accurate, with unique strengths and playstyles that add depth to the game.

Gameplay is excellent, with intuitive controls and a user-friendly interface. The AI opponents provide challenging matches.

The multiplayer component allows for epic battles and cooperative gameplay, with a vibrant online community.

Despite not having modern graphics, the art style remains visually appealing. The music and sound design enhance immersion.

This game could reach peak perfection if it wasn't because of the performance and crashing issues when there's an overload of units when the game drags out for too long.

You start the game with a small village and workers, and you build your way up the tech tree, while trying to accomplish your goal, whether it's a campaign objective, kill everyone else, maintain a wonder building for a period of time, etc.

I 110% recommend this game, if you're into RTS games (think Warcraft, Starcraft, Command and Conquer, Rise of Nations).

Another note to consider, you might see the same game, marked as HD Edition, which came out in the early 2010s, which is the same game as the original, but updated graphics and other novelties. This remaster, the Definitive Edition, which came out much later, is practically its own game, and gets treated as such, so you know which one to buy.

The problem is devs will rather create countless civilization dlcs, rather than spend some time maintaining the engine that's become obviously broken after countless updates. Basically the only thing these updates do is break the engine and introduce more bugs. Not to mention servers. Every other game works flawlessly, but AoE2 is like a roulette. One match goes fine, one lags like crazy (on ranked), one has unbearable delay, one goes smooth again. It's completely random. Why they don't fix this is beyond me. And if that weren't bad, there are bugs that are dragging for months, sometimes years.

[h1] The Game[/h1]
The Definitive Edition of one of the greatest real-time strategy games of all time. With many campaigns and multiplayer available, updated graphics and a remastered soundtrack this game offers a great experience for the fans of real-time strategy.

The story (or the campaigns for better wording) provide a lot of historical scenarios in different parts of the world. The problem is that it can become quite tedious to play through them all (as is the requirement for the achievements) with only some variation in the objectives. The visuals are quite alright that don't bring a massive and immersive experience but still look decent in 2023. The gameplay is centered around the standard of many RTS games: gather resources, build a base and produce military units. There is some variation between the different civilizations that alter the gameplay in (somewhat) different ways but the concept stays the same. 

[h1] The Achievements [/h1]
There are a lot of achievements and it will take quite some time to get them all. Luckily only a few are considered to be very hard and 1 multiplayer one (there is a discussion thread + a group that are dedicated for this so) with guides available for everything. DLC is required for 100% completion.

[h1] Recommendation [/h1]
I am on the verge of whether to recommend this or not to achievement hunters, unless you are a big fan of RTS games. I am personally a big fan of this game but it can very well take you over 200+ hours to finish all of the achievements. A recommendation is to see it as a longer ""project"" where you can play it more casually whenever you want as you play through all of the campaigns. Despite it become a bit tedious at times due to lack of variety in the different parts of the game I still consider it to be one of the better RTS-games out there (for achievement hunters).",1673949777,1689184227,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Campaigns are somewhat good but not exceptionnal.

Units are still dumb. They love to stack in front of the ennemy and blocking each other. They are unable to move around and attack the ennemies from the side. Sometimes to avoid an onager shot, you moive your units .... the one in front will walk back to the end of the group to make sure the ennemy's onager's shot kills them .....

Menu are hard to navigate
Too many options not related to the gameplay

The ability for host to perma ban you if you are new is ultradumb.

The multiplayer filters do reset if you fail to join a lobby. Making it tedious to play in MP.

CBA mods are bad/ As usual there are 512 versions, 1 is legit 5 are outdated and 9878 are edited to give host a small boost or the option to delete all attackers in his base.


Positive points : 
Graphics are an improvement over AOE2 and AOE2HD that's all.
MP is smoother due to the addition of servers. But it can lag a lot for reasons unknown.
