Grappling hook didn't come out and my cloud in a bottle didn't work. The jump was used up on leaving the vine or, somethin, I don't know. What I do know is, fall damage is too high in this game. It was a medium core and right next to my base, basically no consequence other then losing 6 stars. Nothin, less then nothin, but I would like to play a hardcore character, and I shouldn't because of this bullshit. It's just too damn high. I wasn't even at the top of my houses roof in terms of height and had over 200 hp. It's too damn high. Good news everyone. They added a bunch of items to reduce or eliminate fall damage! I still feel like fall damage itself is a bit overturned though. Also anyone else feel like traps just make the game less fun? They're easy enough to avoid really, but, what's the point exactly? Cause you just get a light(helmet magiluminescence) and hold a dart trap as you dash through the cavern. Easy enough, but it's tedious, and not fun, why are they here exactly? There's also now an item that just lets you see all wires at all times. Traps now essentially just give you vision....well, that's, okay I guess. Makes them feel even more pointless now though.  Also, I like fishing but, doesn't anyone else feel like it's too important and strong? So much good stuff comes from it. Too much even.

[b] This is my experience of this game. Make of that what you will. [/b]

[list] 

[*] There are lot of objectives to complete with an insane amount of items and achievements to collect. 
[*] The combat is enjoyable - not the greatest but not bad in any sense in my opinion.
[*] Character and world progression feels is solid. There are so many different ways to play.
[*] If you somehow manage to do and collect everything in the game you can still get hundreds to thousands of hours out of the building aspect of the game.
[*] There are rare items you can farm for which is enjoyable to me, and it feels very good when the loot you're after finally drops.
[*] The mechanisms of how items work in this game is interesting to me, you can tell a lot of work was put in to make every item feel like it has purpose, which is unbelievable because there are over five thousand items - a lot of variety there. 
[*] The world generation is unpredictable enough, and you never know what you're going to find in it.
[*] You can find and meet interesting characters that will help, and sell items to you by having them live in a house, castle, town or city that you've constructed for them.
[*] I enjoy what atmosphere this game has. Just coming across a little pond with dragonflies hovering over water lilies during the day, or being inside of your home in the evening with fireflies surrounding it as an owl sits on the roof you built can feel like the time you've spent adventuring was worth it. The world feels alive.
[*] The music is iconic. There are a lot of cool tracks, and they're adding more. My favorite track is Underground Jungle.
[*] The boss fights are intimidating and fun accompanied by intense music to fit.
[*] There's a huge variety of enemies as well as a huge variety of ways to fight them.
[*] It has a crafting system with crafting trees that can take time to make useful items for your character, but it's rewarding.
[*] The UI is clean - easy to understand.
[*] The developers are still updating the game free of charge. The game is only $10 and often goes on sale for $5. I bought Terraria on its release, and had no idea just to how great of a purchase that was going to be.
[*] It has a great modding community, and support if you somehow want more out of this game.

Terraria isn't just a game; it's an odyssey into the depths of boundless creativity and exploration. From the moment you step foot into its pixelated world, you're greeted with a sense of wonder and excitement that's rarely matched in the gaming realm.

The beauty of Terraria lies in its sheer diversity of experiences. Whether you're delving into the depths of caverns in search of rare ores, battling colossal bosses that test your skill and strategy, or constructing intricate structures that defy imagination, there's always something new and exhilarating to discover.

One of the most captivating aspects of Terraria is its sandbox nature. The freedom to shape and mold the world to your liking is unparalleled. Want to build a towering castle in the sky? Go for it. Prefer to dig deep underground and create a sprawling underground metropolis? The choice is yours. With a vast array of building materials and tools at your disposal, the only limit is your imagination.

But Terraria isn't just about building and exploration; it's also about the thrill of adventure. The game is filled with an assortment of challenging enemies and formidable bosses that will put your combat skills to the test. Whether you're facing off against the mighty Eye of Cthulhu or Going deep into the catacombs to find treasure. Every encounter is a pulse-pounding adrenaline rush.

What truly sets Terraria apart, however, is its sense of community. Whether you're teaming up with friends to tackle a difficult boss or sharing your latest creations with the world, there's a vibrant and welcoming community of players ready to embrace you with open arms.

In conclusion, Terraria is a masterpiece of gaming innovation. With its limitless creativity, thrilling exploration, and strong sense of community, it's a game that will keep you coming back for more time and time again. So grab your pickaxe, sharpen your sword, and prepare for the adventure of a lifetime. Terraria awaits, and the journey is just beginning.

This is a fantastic game. The final updates brought new life and made this a fantastic time sink! :)  

The Labor of Love Update is THE best update in gaming history. period. this shows the devs understand gaming, their community and what fun means and dont care about money. 

ALL game devs should strive to be like terraria devs! period.


[b] My Suggestion & Wish-List for Terraria [/b]
- Zenith Tier weapons (i.e. a ""zenith"" for each class with a difference in how they work and what their damage focus is (wave vs single target vs crowd control etc). which is better than just a reskin! 
- Being able to favorite (or lock) slots in other inventories (i.e chests, maybe always 1 item will be left, etc)
- a post-moonlord ""moonlord"", maybe even ""barely undefeatable"" and more like a score gauge -> how quick can you kill it. no loot drops, just a relic or trophy. 
- another difficulty -> harder than mastermode, maybe legendary mode? maybe even with sliders to tweak it. 
- you should be able to put the familiar set on womenquins/mannequins and set their things (hair, color etc.) so they are actually more than just ""armor stands""
- more hair styles
- an actually working ""color selection"" on certain things, esp. skin colors are very hard to do and the actually colors are quite jumpy/limited 
- a better alignment of early game ores (the 3 new ones just seem better, esp. platinum vs gold)
- early game ore gate-ing like its with the HM ores. currently you just dig down and get platinum/gold. no real need to get tier 1 or 3. Lead/Iron is useful for rails and for the anvil, if you dont find them. 
- summon count under the icon (or when you mouse over, i.e. 5/7)
- alignment of the permanent buffs. currently summoner is absolute OP (as it is quite early to get pre HM and is a dps boost on all classes). it feels that mage and range are just neglected, as those buff items are HM. 
- rework / rebalancing (maybe?) of the biome chest drops. esp. the non-generic ones feel absolutely underwhelming. rainbow is god-tier and even on moonlord useful. the hydra is a decent sentry (also universally useful). the piranha gun is good, but absolutely underwhelming at this point, esp. compared to other best-in-class items you get around the same time. the vampire blades are a god-send on melee (or maybe useful as a general healing item) but otherwise very underwhelming. the the corruptor is... its good-ish? but again, same with the piranha gun. class items on the same tier are just better. the tiger staff... either its the AI or the damage, but overall it feels like it should be barely after HM start, not post plantera... at least for me it feels weak. 
- rebalancing / improving summon AI. currently there is no need to use all summons or to upgrade. some are S-tier and you can just skip the rest...",1576270886,1708695928,True,1,0,0.509834051132202148,0,True,False,False

The game like you can see in reviews is one of the best games in history and every new platform I start to play on, can't be not there Terraria. 3 times I have bought this game and is completely worth it so I recommend you to test it at least 1 time in your life. Also if you get bored of Vanilla (game without modification) you can always download the big amount of mods made by the community and give you hours and hours of entertainment. 

This game have been a big part of my life and I hope it still getting better. Hopefully the next big step this game gets is the cross platform so I can play with my friends who have ps4/5.

It almost distracts you from the fact that in the real world you will never feel any truly satisfying sense of achievement, never to form any real bonds, and of course one day becoming nothing but teeth and bones, name carved into stone that no one will want to visit or even remember a couple generations later.

Lo and behold she gave birth to this.

Story time: 

So I'm on a mediumcore character with a master (w/e max mode is) setting on a large map with the purple dingy. Anyhoo. So I have this minion trinken and she's a lovely ghost that tickles things to death. Whelp she was a great income sorce for zombies on nights when they'd bang on my door. Good source of coinage for starters cause I do nothing right? Oh no. So see just moments before this comment a random ""blood"" zombie event happened that night. I got finessed thinking I could fend them all off. Nope. Game said ""Hey bubby we see you're struggling but in a good way here's a way to adapt and suffer more."" Before these zombies I was vaguely near the purple dingy area. I heard a background worm.........I have iron armor. I thought ""maybe it's a medium one and we can shrug it off.""

Nope, game said ""here have a biggin for no reason."" ~ Death

100/10 love this game so far and mad at myself for not buying it sooner after all these years. I'm gunna put some good time into this. Toodles :D

If I had 1 thing just ONE thing to complain about in this game is the settings menu.

1. The start is really hard, I almost refunded it because of this.
2. Make a platform grinding area in the sky to kill the eye of Cthulhu.
3. Make houses and use the housing query to see if its valid for NPCs to live in it, After that you can buy stuff from them.
4. To use hooks press E.
5. To get rid of mounting effects right click on them at the top left.
6. Destroy demon altars in the corruption to get blessed with more ores, like Palladium and Chlorophyte.
7. Most worm type creatures can only move in the earth blocks and jump out of the ground.
8. There are cloud looking islands in the sky with loot, Called Floating Islands.
9. Hardmode is forced onto your world after killing the wall of flesh.
10. To summon the wall of flesh you need guide voodoo doll and throw it into the lava at hell located really far into the ground.

             There are few games with such a good cost/content ratio. For the price point it's hard to beat.
The amount of content is ever expanding with new versions that add to the game considerably.
[i]*Many of the new features are/were directly inspired by the community*[/i]
Devs are also actively involved in the community and really do care about their game.
Though sometimes updates take a while they are never disappointing and add a ton to the game.
Not only that there are tons of ways to mod it.

[b]GO BUY IT![/b]
Stop being cheap it's 10 bucks.

[b]Complaints?[/b] [i](I am stretching here, there are no real complaints from me)[/i]    
            Worlds are finite.
            To get certain things in the game, you have to make more than one world.

Terraria is overall an excellent experience and wildly fun to play and explore with lots to do, it will keep you coming back. And back.

I probably come back to it at least once every year. You can build structures, obtain crazy items that rely on a drop-based system, create a build that goes with the class you have chosen and then in an instant swap to different items to change your class. This game has 33 bosses and around 5000+ items to obtain, not including the mods from the community that probably triples the length of the game and all of the items. The only issue this game has is that you'll use the wiki a lot to find how to get some items or how to progress since its a decent sized game but once you have played it you most likely remember it and come back for more.",1708563303,1708563303,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

edit 2/21/24:

Now that I've fully completed the game by myself, I think I can give an actual review now. First things first, and if you haven't played Terraria, you will be hearing this a lot: it's definitely not for everyone. You'll be relying on the wiki and other external sources to get you through because this game does NOT hold your hand. It took me a year and a half to even get back into the game after first buying it because I had literally no idea what to do. But, oh man, when I got back into it... I was just addicted.

Once you get past the initial phase of confusion, this game is amazing. The progression is the star of the show, really, because it's so easy to become enamored with getting to that next big goal. Even then, there's still a lot of creative things you can do with your world, seeing as it IS a sandbox game. But that core gameplay loop is what makes Terraria special. The controls are easy to understand (mostly), and I had no tech issues when playing it (I assume it can run on a potato, but if your PC really sucks then you might have issues).

The objective of the game is varied, allowing players to choose how they want to play the game. The most important ones are kill the final boss Moon Lord, Empress of Light and other top-tier Hardmode bosses.

Gameplay-wise, mouse and keyboard. 

Many things to do in Terraria. The generic loop is survive, kill monsters/bosses, mine, craft, get new weapons and armour rinse and repeat.

Logic Gates. You can even build your own mini-computer within. Not that I actually bothered.

Bosses. If you can kill a boss, the boss loot is stronger, upgrades you and can be used to easily kill the same boss repetitively.

Arenas. They don't exist in game, you have to build them. Before you beat a boss, you are generally significantly weaker than the boss stat-wise. You need to build special arenas that will give you a major terrain advantage and make killing the boss easier. Once you kill the boss, the boss loot will greatly improve your tools.

Crafting. You need a guide for this. The UI for crafting is also horrible. You can't craft from items in your boxes, you have to extract them, stand at a specific crafting station and then the recipe option will appear.

Fishing. Not the best model. You just need a 15*20 pool of water to begin fishing. You can't see the fish and the fish always magically appear if you have bait.

Conclusion, do try Terraria. While the game is annoying at times and extremely beginner unfriendly, Terraria is easily playable with a guide.

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Arena Building
NOT WORLDBUILDING. Instead of the traditional enter a boss' arena, fight and try to win, players have to ""cheese"" the boss by building an arena to beat the boss with. It's like military infrastructure meant to kill a boss.

2. Cheese Tricks
Generally, weapons are picked on the damage that they deal. The greater the damage, the more likely you pick it. However, you can find little ""cheeses"". Like using dynamite to kill the Destroyer.

3. Multiplayer
The ability to play with others and explore a randomly procedurally generated world. It's not that big a plus considering that every world has exactly the same bosses in the exact same order.

4. Interesting Bosses
Wall of Flesh was interesting.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. No Puzzles
No real solving on your own. The Dungeon Guardian wasn't a puzzle. It just blocked you.

2. Constant Spawning of Monsters
It's not actually fun to have to constantly swat bats/mosquitoes.

3. Puddle Fishing
Quest Slave. Not the best part of the game. You can't see the fish in the water and you're just miraculously getting fish from a puddle.

4. Inflation Creep
As the higher level items come to you, the old stuff is either junk or has to be combined to make special items. Items that can't be combined are essentially junk.

5. Disappointing Dungeons
Kind of straightforward paths with traps. No hidden secrets, just a maze with a boss to ""cheese"" at the end.


6. Sky Islands are Dull
Just clouds with 1 house. I was expecting more.

[h1][b]NEUTRAL[/b][/h1]
1. Reliance on Guides
I didn't like the idea of consistently looking for the answer from an online guide. It broke the experience of figuring out what the developer could design for you i.e. Andrew “Redigit“ Spinks. Yet, guides did make things move more smoothly and helped me to realize the Dungeon Guardian couldn't be killed normally.

2. Weapon / Armour Crafting
Fun to figure out that in order to beat the next boss you have to craft stronger stuff for mobility, armour and damage.  Boring because it's the same formula over and over again. Pretty much all the higher level/damage items can be used to kill the boss. Some are just slightly faster.

There isn't a specialty weapon that is the weakness of any boss or has a special utility function in-game.

3. Building a House
Why is it so complicated? Make a Table, Make a chair, Make walling, tile the place, make sure it's surrounded and not corrupted. WTF. No wonder the online guide creates pet boxes.

[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]
1. Fishing With Fish
See the fish. Ensure that the source water has to exceed an even bigger size?

2. Fishing with bait
You have a Meat Grinder and Rotten Meat. I assumed you could grind the Rotten Meat into chum that could be turned into bait. No. The Meat Grinder doesn't do much at all.

3. Ensure everything has a Role
All the food can be turned into some sort of meal/potion with some special unique add-on. Sell it to a trader's market for coin. At the start of the game, you need a sizeable amount of coin to buy all the necessary equipment, wire and tools.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

so if you fuck up a boss fight its a DRAG to grind out the stuff again just to summon them again. you dont learn from your mistakes because the last few hours your mind was AFK grinding out resources. and you HAVE to create a HUGE arena to fight any boss like wow what fun.

and its on hardcore so EVERYTHING is extra annoying. grinding? tons of enemies with AI (on hardcore) designed to be annoying. building an arena? tons of enemies again? fuck up that skeletron fight? well hope you like waiting another 15 minutes for the next night and the 5 minute trek across your world.

And at the moment of typing this we are waiting on the last big update (which it probably won't be the last) so all my progress will be invalidated because ill have to start a new world.

I mean its a great game probably one of the best ever but you need some ADHD meds to slog through it half the time.",1343253895,1708386482,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First time I played I could not figure out how to do anything and was terrified when night came and I was eaten alive by zombies.

Second time I played I figured out how to do stuff and now I live in an underground stone fortified bunker. Very gratifying (and zombie proof). Glad the smoke the from the torches does not cause me any breathing issues. Pretty cozy in here.

I look forward to a long life as a hermit, and someday when I have a better suit of armor I will go out and explore the world.

Maybe tonight I will build a ten story house, who knows?

Building is probably the best part but serves no purpose after some point (when you have several bunkers connected with teleporters all over the world).

Some boss fights are OK (Plantera, Golem). Building arenas for boss fights kind of feels like cheating but most can not be defeated without one. At least not on expert difficulty.

The fishing quest is kind of fun. I greatly suggest journey mode if you plan to do it.

What's bad:
[list]
[*] mining ores is extremely grindy
[*] combat is as basic as it can get
[*] item bloat; every single enemy drops so much crap
[*] art style, especially characters and humanoid enemies (not talking about graphics, I don't mind pixel art)
[*] the soundtrack - it's so annoying it's hard to rationally describe; I especially hate the opening theme (the one you hear immediately after starting a new game)
[*] sound effects
[*] the feeling of discovery and adventure just isn't there (unless you consider digging various colors of dirt an adventure)

From the moment I dug my first block, I was hooked on this sandbox adventure. The sheer diversity of biomes, creatures, and items is mind-boggling, creating a sense of exploration that never gets old.

The freedom to build and shape the world to my liking is empowering. Whether delving into treacherous caverns or summoning otherworldly bosses, Terraria's blend of creativity and action is addictive. The progression is rewarding, with each new discovery opening up a realm of exciting opportunities.

The multiplayer experience adds another layer of enjoyment. Collaborating with friends to conquer challenges or simply explore the vast world together enhances the game's charm. The retro aesthetic, combined with the depth of gameplay, makes Terraria a timeless classic in the sandbox genre.

Look no further than Terraria, an amazing sandbox game that takes you on a journey through different worlds as you explore, build, fight, and craft your way to success.

Terraria is a 2D sandbox survival game that combines elements of open-world exploration, crafting, and monster-fighting. The game is set on a fictional, procedurally generated 2D world that you can customize and craft to your liking. You can explore vast open landscapes, build your own structures, and fight off a vast array of monsters and bosses. The game offers a wide variety of weapons, tools, and armour for you to create, ranging from simple wooden swords and axes to intricate magic staves and powerful ranged weapons.

But what makes Terraria truly special is its creative potential. The game offers a vast array of blocks, from common dirt and stone to rare and unique blocks like ash and marble, and even floating crystals and cloud blocks. These blocks can be used to create almost anything your imagination can fathom. Want to build a grand castle or a majestic temple? Go ahead. Want to build a sprawling city or a peaceful village? You can do that too. The possibilities are truly endless.

But the game is not just about building. It is also about combat and survival. The game is filled with an endless array of dangerous NPCs, monsters, and bosses to face, ranging from simple jellyfish and slime to giant bee queens and giant flying eyes. These enemies can drop rare loot and valuable tools that you can use to progress further in the game. There are also a ton of unique events and challenges to face, such as invasions of zombies and skeletons or blood moons and solar eclipses, all of which offer their own unique rewards and challenges.

Terraria's gameplay loop is also incredibly addictive, thanks to the abundance of loot and tools to craft. Once you start playing, you will find yourself hooked, spending hours exploring, fighting, crafting, and building, all in the pursuit of better loot and more powerful tools. Each time you create a powerful new weapon or piece of armour, you will feel a sense of satisfaction, knowing that your efforts have paid off. And the game is just as much fun alone as it is with friends, offering both single-player and multiplayer modes that are both equally enjoyable.

If you are looking for a game that provides the ultimate creative and challenging experience, then look no further than Terraria. With its vast open world, limitless building possibilities, and vast array of enemies and events, you will find yourself lost in its world for hours on end. It is a game that will keep you coming back for more, time and time again, as you strive to create even more amazing structures, collect even more powerful weapons and tools, and face even more challenging enemies.

In short, Terraria is a game that offers something for everyone, whether you are a seasoned gamer or a beginner. It is easy to learn but hard to master, so you will find yourself constantly learning new tricks and techniques to help you advance further in the game.

I forget how I got this game, but I think I got it from Xbox gold way back when (2012?). At first, like many people who first picked up Terraria, I thought it was 2D Minecraft. I later realized how wrong I was. Sure they share similar aspects like mining and building, but Terraria is more progression based.

I think the best part of Terraria as a kid was that there were so many different items and yet I was able to memorize them all and what they all did because I looked at the wiki and learned what each thing did. Even now I can recall what some of the items do because I loved the game so much I basically studied it.

What I loved about Terraria was that exploration is always unique. From exploring the Crimson to structures underground to other biomes to exploring floating islands, Terraria always had something to offer. There are so many different weapons, tools, and armor so everything always felt fresh and like there was a progression and things to work towards.

But what I loved the most was the fact that you had to fight bosses to progress, and the fact that there are so many bosses amazed me, being a kid that only played Minecraft, which had like two bosses. It was also awesome how NPCs appeared in your world and I was always excited whenever one did, and getting geared to fight bosses and getting magic weapons that do so much cool stuff was awesome.

There is always something to do in Terraria, more than most games. I really wish I could say more but I don't know what to say because Terraria is just that great. Who knows I might come back to this review to add more if I ever think of it.",1708046869,1708046869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pathos, drama, humor, exploration and achievement are a part of the game.  I like the jewel tone pixel art and the whimsical nature of the graphical elements. The character can find allies and develop relationships and there are many game achievements. It's a side scroller that has a great degree of action and some game mechanics built into it that allow a sense of a dimensional world.

Build something cool! Or/and play with friends! 

I don't think I will ever get truly tired of this game, but after probably a combined 2400 hours it has gotten stale to play solo. Not with friends tho, I still have a blast with that. And modding is also a fresh and super fun experience. EVEN better with friends. 

And that's not to mention that the amazing and genuinely kind devs just won't stop adding new content! Last big update my ass, you've said that for like 5 years lmao

. The game is super chill, unless you're doing something dangerous you should be able to just casually play without a care in the world. I would recommend trying to do something interesting every like hour or so. Maybe search for a specific item in a chest, loot the underworld for some risk and reward type action, or just build something beautiful. And you should know it's beautiful, because you made it.

. Boss fights are also pretty relaxing to be quite frank. Unless you are in I'd say...post...Plantera? Maybe? Post-Plantera and up progression starts to get a tad more stressful, as the bosses hit harder, so your weapons need to do the same. (I would recommend trying to get the Possessed Hatchet from Golem. It's actually REALLY good for the Lunatic Cultist and Duke Fishron!)

. Go on little mining expeditions every once in a while. You would not believe how absolutely gorgeous the game's cave systems tend to be. Especially in those glowing moss areas they added recently. You'll find some top-notch pixel art there.

. If you find this whole experience too...chill. Too calm. Play Calamity on Tmodloader, version 2.2. If that still seems too little of a challenge, add a little mod called Infernum. Pre-hardmode progression may seem easy...but the instant you enter hardmode...your life will become a living nightmare. Bosses take hours to beat because you keep dying to 123 damage from the destroyer's lasers, Plantera almost one-shots you on contact. If you manage to not rage quit in time to beat moon lord, you will regret that decision. The quadruplets of destruction and agony, Supreme Calamitas, Devourer of Gods, Jungle Dragon Yharon, and finally...Draedon and his toys of destruction known as the Exo Mechs. These four will be your doom in the end, no matter what you will not defeat them without some kind of outsider help.

That concludes my analysis of this game! To conclude I wish you the best in trying out this game, it will calm your nerves and senses to the most fine of standards. The game provides a nice and peaceful serenity, as long as you keep your world in check.

I've been playing on and off since 2015 when I was quite a young child (i actually met a great friend of mine because of it :3), and I've loved it ever since! Few other games have managed to make me interested in every little detail and inspire me to create things of my own in and outside the game as much as Terraria has.

If you've not seen Terraria before, I'd describe it as a sandbox adventure game with an emphasis on combat, set in a world that evolves as you progress. Although it is often compared to it, Terraria has quite a key difference to Minecraft - Terraria is a lot more progression driven, where as in Minecraft the player often sets their own goals. The player is still allowed to progress as they please, but if you're a Minecraft player who was looking for a similar player-set progression system, Terraria might not be for you.

The freedom for the player to shape the world and build what they choose, diverse combat system, the well-designed boss fights and the diverse and ever-changing world are my favourite elements of Terraria. The only real things that I dislike about Terraria is that you may have to grind a bit at points (especially at higher difficulties) and sometimes the game can start to feel a little tedious, especially near the end of a really long playthrough or if you're doing a few playthroughs in a row.

Despite my minor problems with it, I still see Terraria as an almost completely perfect game! If you've never played Terraria before I would very highly recommend it - it's worth far more than even it's full price!",1568535851,1707778566,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As an olde man who struglez with dysleksia, navigatin the vast wurld of gaming kahn be quite the challange. But wen I stumbuled upon ""Terrawriah,"" I wuz both intriqued and perplexed. The game promissed adventur and kreativity, but wat I encowntered wuz a bewlidering maze of piksels and confyujsion.

Firstly, let me tell yu about the grafiks. Oh, the grafiks! They're like a mishmash of colors and shaypes, swirling around like a tornado in a paint factory. Tryin to make sens of wats happening on the screen is like tryin to reed a book with the pages all out of ordur.

Then there's the gameplay. You're dropped into this wurld with no instrukshuns, no guidans wotsoevur. It's like bein thrown into a river without knowing how to swim. I stumbuled around, swingin my sword at nuthin in particuler, hopin to fend off watevr monsters lurked in the shadows.

And dont evun get me started on the crafting system. I kudn't figure out how to make anythin more complex than a wooden sword. Evry time I tryd to kombin items, it was like tryin to solve a puzzle with missin pieces.

But despite all these frustrashuns, there was sumthin oddly captivating about Terrawriah. Maybe it wuz the sens of explorashun, or the thrill of stumblin upon hidden treasures. Or maybe it wuz just the satisfackshun of finally defeetin a boss after countlus failed attemps.

In the end, Terrawriah may not be the most aksesibul game for sumwon like me, but it sertinly has its charms. So if you're willin to overlook its shortcomins and embrase the kaos, then maybe, just maybe, you'll find sumthin to luv in this quirky littul wurld.",1707690528,1707690528,False,2,2,0.499294787645339966,3,True,False,False

Terraria has been a game to come back to over and over. Originally playing at launch, I found myself lost in a newly created world, to build a home and explore. New enemies in every area, and Zelda-style items to help my spelunking efforts. 

At night time, monsters will come out, and you will need to stay safe, so first you will need to build a shelter. Venturing down into the depths of the world will face you against new enemies, which to survive, you'll need to learn new tactics. you'll come across new weapons from enemy drops, and from loot containers. This was when I first noticed the similarities with old rpg's. I'd found a boomerang! ""Swish"" I thought.

[h1]Now I was a boomerang wielding, sword swinging, base building powerhouse![/h1]

What I felt was a major turning point for me, had allowed me to gather more resources, add extra wings to my manor, and build a 'hook-shot' style grappling hook. Things were going well, so I decided to venture deeper in the world. The enemies were harder, but I had my boomerang, and with some sharp reflexes, I was able to stand my ground. I needed a more powerful weapon to continue.

And there it was... I could hear the chest opening sound from Legend of Zelda in my head as I hovered my mouse over the item, and I read the reassuring words in true old-school RPG format....

[h1]You have found a FLAMARANG![/h1]

Filled with excitement, I threw my boomerang away. It came back. ""I should have expected that"". I equipped my new Flamarang, and travelled downward into the unknown. I found a giant blue glowing mushroom biome, and a lava lake with obsidian towers. Amazed, I ended up building a giant fortress, digging to the bottom of the world, had some NPC's move into my house, and spent almost 90 hours find new things, before eventually, moving onto a new adventure in a different game.

Moving forward 6 years, I found myself in a relationship, with an actual woman. She barely played any games, but I showed her Terraria, and she instantly fell in love with it. Now we play together, and most of my past experience has become redundant. As I understand it, now there are at least over 20 bosses, and I'm fairly confident that there are lots more than that, still for me to find. There’s also quite a large amount of resource tiers, so you’ll always be upgrading, and when you think you’re done…

[h1] BAM… Hardmode. And you get to do it all over again.[/h1]

Over the 6 years that I'd not played Terraria, content has been added almost constantly. Now we're playing what feels like a new game together. The first time I played, I think I found three bosses, and only managed to kill two of them. 

If you want my advice...

This game approaches perfection. There is an extremely satisfying element of progression, tonnes of items, biomes, optional bosses, things to explore, and different ways to play. The replayability is honestly endless and its even better with friends. If I could only play 1 game for the rest of my life, this would be a contender.

Terraria is one of those games you will get addicted to. You will get triggered about losing, close the game, watch YouTube, then think ""Hey, I feel in the mood to play Terraria again!"".

I love the physics this game uses. The community may be a tiny bit toxic, you may get the odd ""Die in a hole!"" comment, but other then that the community is nice and friendly. This game may not be in Early Access, but I'm pretty sure there are alot more major updates to come, today they announced future updates to come, pretty cool, just made a sick world and uploaded it, check it out!

Minecraft mostly, but the ones that really get me is when it gets compared to games that vaguely pretend to follow in the footsteps of the greatness we have here. I've played WAY too many ""Open world survival craft"" games, and every single time, they always leave me bored. The only one I've ever played that retained and deserved the attention it got from me, is this one. This game embraced the format and expounded on it ten fold. So much so that the rest are slop in comparison. Games like Vallheim, The Forest, Green Hell, etc. are fun for a bit, sure, but they always seem to end up at the same exact place. Get x material > make home > get more x material > make x tools > get y material > make y tools so on and so forth. Terraria starts out this way, but after that first hour, instead of becoming the most BORING keyboard rolling grind for the same exact shit, it jumps to being one of the best games I've ever played. You get magic and summoning and crazy swords and super cool bows/arrows and guns/bullets. It becomes a clusterfuck of new enemies and items that you can get from actually fighting mobs while you survive and craft. New and more difficult bosses. New NPCs and new tools to use the INCREDIBLE freedom of expression they give you. Honestly the best part is that every time I stop playing this game, I can come back to it later. It gets huge updates from time to time that add an insane amount of stuff. And on top of that, there's a massive modding community that tosses out some wild stuff. With almost 1k hours, I know there's no way I've experienced everything this game has to offer. If you somehow have gone this long without buying and playing this game, you should.

pros: lots of content (especially with mods, the mods could honestly be their own pro, and the mod loader is why my hours look lower than they really are), fun bosses, good music, great in multiplayer

cons: you almost need a wiki or a friend who knows how to play for your first time, the vanilla game can be grindy at times, and at least for me I got a little too into it and spent maybe a little too much time playing it

now i do have a few complaints about this game, i grew several pimples on my face from being addicted to this game, and not getting off for a prolonged period of time (usually 6-12 hours a day), my 2nd complaint is that my hand eye coordination has NEVER been better, and my taste in games has gotten so ridiculous. this game is SO good, i was a snob to any other game. especially minecraft, but lets be honest; minecraft sucks. terraria, all the way :3",1707448967,1707448967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dig, fight, explore, build- this simple loop is so addicting. It's just fun to venture out into the world, to dig to find ores underground that you use to make weapons, tools, armor, and other life-saving equipment, that turn you from a wimpy little forest dweller— into a big, strong, pull-up-wearing big boy.

This game has its fair share of enemies that the game allows you to pummel with its huge ass selection of weapons. There's consecutively fish as weapons and a book that allows you to literally piss on your foes, many of which you're gonna be using to kill the bosses, the main pillars of progression.

The best part is just constantly finding new shit to do, which I still somehow am. Still I envy whoever the fuck still hasn’t played through this somehow, because the discovery aspect of it all is something I wish I could experience fresh again. You will discover thousands of items, hundreds of enemies, different classes of weapons and armor to choose from, ways to build, and various biomes to explore in, all features that end up leaving games like Minecraft in the dust. There's a little something for everyone, and as with basically every game it's made miles better with friends. Personally it's hard to go back to playing solo with how fun multiplayer can be.

My one complaint about this game is that I wish Master Mode had more 'master' in it. Besides increased enemy health and damage, it would do well with more of an incentive to replay this mode without it being expert mode, but again.

Will check in again at 10,000 hours of playtime when the devs release final update number 10. This game is one of the best out there.

There's a lot of versatility, where you can progress through the game very quickly or pause to do other things, such as purifying the world evil or making NPC towns all across the map(though fishing is one of my favorite aspects). There is also a lot of visual customization(hair styles, vanity, etc.) especially considering how tiny your character is, so that's fun too. :)

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The game has so much flexibility to it, allowing it to be played in many ways of progression from the bosses to the building. It takes quite little to run and have on your PC too
The easter eggs are great and the rare collectibles are fun to get (if you so don't want to get them, since RNG is a thing.)
The main boss progression for the player is great, making you strong just to make you feel oh so small all over again (mainly casuals.)

I played with 2 of my best friends and it was really enjoyable, but i felt that there where times when it was very boring and required lots of research. however one of my friends had over 500 hours and knew what he doing so he helped us get through it . the music and design of the overall game is great and doesn't require high specs, but i would have liked it to be easier to get the boss summons as i felt like we spent to long getting them over and over again due to dying so many times to some boss's.

I only got the pc version for myself a couple of years back and it's been glorious. Love it. Love this game an incredible amount. It's super engaging, the game mechanics are easy to grapple with, there's a lot to do in the game and it's fun above all.

My criticisms may be that it's not easy for people who don't have a history with it to start with and you'll most likely need to consult the terraria wiki a fair amount during your first playthroughs, but after that things come to you like second nature. If you want to put the time into it, you'll be rewarded tenfold. 

Also there are a lot of Things in the game, so a lot may be overlooked due to their window of usage being so small but if you take your time with things I'm sure it's possible to enjoy a good lot of these.

I won't pay attention on details such as gameplay, because it can't be roasted anyway. You'll just like it no matter what.
To advocate my words: – every 2nd person who bought Terraria has at the very least 50 hours of pure gameplay and a positive review. 
Indeed, no thing new I could tell you about the bug-&glitchless, balanced and unstoppable gameplay that no one else hasn't...
What I really think should be emphasized in this review is the OST! It always triggers me to return and play some Terraria, so it turns out to be an endless engine 🚂. 
Summarily, this Terra-piece deserves to be called a 9/10 game, and like I said before – every 2nd terrarian would synergize with my opinion, just no doubt!



Edit: ...oh, to anyone reading this – I've been tired by reviewing  (and rewriting) my old Terraria review so I'm too exhausted to keep going on this.. Maybe I'll give it a try some time to add new points and complete the whole essay,...buuuuut for now I'm done, thanks for reading allat!",1618472294,1707222319,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

Ingredients:

For the Dough:

1 cup warm milk (110°F/43°C)
2 large eggs, room temperature
1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
For the Filling:

1 cup packed brown sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
For the Cream Cheese Frosting:

1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 oz cream cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pinch of salt
Instructions:

Prepare the Dough:

In a bowl, combine warm milk and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt.
Add melted butter, eggs, and the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.
Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth.
Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
Make the Filling:

In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon.
Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a rectangle.
Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly.
Roll and Cut:

Starting from one long edge, tightly roll the dough into a log.
Cut into 12 even slices and place them in a greased baking pan.
Second Rise:

Cover the pan with a cloth and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes.
Bake:

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
Bake the rolls for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.
Make the Cream Cheese Frosting:

Beat together softened butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt until smooth.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For her true love and true love's first kiss.

(We see an outhouse and hear the sound of a toilet flushing. Out steps Shrek, an ogre, who tugs at his underwear and shakes his foot of the page still stuck to his shoe. He looks lovingly at the swamp he calls home, and goes about his daily routine. Which is taking a mud shower, brushing his teeth with bugs, bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign)

(In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their torches and pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. Shrek sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside Shrek's home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them)

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S SWAMP

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.

(Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob)

Shrek: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.

(The mob gasps)

Shrek: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...

(Shrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear)

Villager: No!

Shrek: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.

Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

(The villager waves his torch in Shrek's face. Shrek casually licks his fingers and pinches the flame, extinguishing the torch. The villager drops it)

Villager 1: Right.

(Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches. He wipes his mouth and waits for the villagers to stop screaming)

Shrek: (whispering) This is the part where you run away.

Villagers: (gasping)

Shrek: And stay out!

This mostly involves downloading an ""All Items"" world on Steam workshop and getting the most OP and achievement-related items, then making a new world and blasting through all of the bosses.

Except this one of course. Hundreds of hours of content, infinite replayability and an insane active modding community that's still making amazing mods up to this day. Can you imagine for lesser than 5 bucks you can play a game for hundreds of hours?

The gameplay is smooth and optimized, the game runs amazingly well in both single and multiplayer.

The overall progression is really nice, not forcing the early game player to go one path of things. An example: Instead of being forced to get ore weapons and armor, the player can get various other things to their likings. The player can fight in their unique way to their liking by setting up traps, fighting with their class weaponry or even with falling sand and etc.

Gameplay and difficulty: The mechanics of the game are very simple and easy to learn but a bit hard to master. The game rewards the player for taking risks such as going to the dungeon after defeating a 'certain' boss or even going to hell itself!. Even though all of theese, the difficulty is I think overall a little easy even on Master mode. However the player can activate some secret seeds to make the game WAY harder.

Overall: 10/10, one of the greatest games of all time... Would recommend buying and trying it out for yourself.",1684526306,1707063083,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's a lot more complexity than Minecraft, such as the different weapons, classes, et cetera. There's a lot of variety, and no run would be the same as another. Also, there's a lot more bosses, like a lot a lot more. It's an integral part of the game and its progression, as you can't really do much without defeating them. In Minecraft you don't have to do anything, but in Terraria you have to kill the bosses.
 The pixel-y graphics look super nice and the music slaps.
There's lots of content with weapon variety, seed variety, enemy variety, etc. Practically endless in the core game. However, you can check out TModLoader if you're a little bored with Vanilla.

Great game! I would recommend this and it's a reason why it's a best seller.

The gameplay was an absolute disaster. Navigating through the clunky controls felt like trying to maneuver a tank through a maze. The character movement was sluggish, and the combat mechanics were laughably basic. I expected a modern gaming experience, but Terraria felt like a relic from the past.

The so-called ""sandbox"" aspect of the game was nothing more than a glorified pixel art project. The world felt empty and lacked any sense of immersion. The lack of a compelling narrative made the game feel like a mindless grind, with no clear goals or objectives to keep me engaged.

To make matters worse, the sound design was unbearable. The repetitive and annoying soundtrack made me want to mute my computer just to escape the auditory assault. I couldn't believe how a game released in this day and age could have such a lackluster and uninspiring audio experience.

Even the community, often touted as one of Terraria's strengths, couldn't save this sinking ship. The fanbase seemed to be stuck in a time warp, clinging desperately to a game that should have been left in the past. The forums were filled with outdated memes and a general lack of helpful information.

In conclusion, Terraria is a game that should be avoided at all costs. Its outdated graphics, clunky controls, lackluster gameplay, and unbearable sound design make it a regrettable waste of time. Save yourself the trouble and invest your gaming hours in something more deserving of your attention.",1683831163,1706989936,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

one downside is that the game's combat itself relies totally on items and buffs, so if your finding a game that asks for combat skill and controlling skills, this may not be the game for you. mostly grinding and looking at the wiki is just all you do here. but the hours are not regrettable!
another thing i should add, is the end game playthrough. after you finish the final boss; ""Moon Lord"", you'll be looking forward to about 25 more hours of gameplay and then start to feel the repetitiveness of the game, or feel that the tasks left for you are just way to impossible and boring. still no fear! TModloader is here! TModloader is a additional modding feature in the steam store page you can get for free. which literally increases the whole game's length by an infinite amount of time. my personal fav is ""Calamity mode"" which also includes more bosses, and WAY too many items added.
i truly recommend you get terraria. grinding is hard, and research is boring. but terraria sure doesn't let you down my mate. anyone will enjoy this game, if provided with the right knowledge, and time.",1706969851,1706969851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of the achievements are filled with progression, like all the boss slaying ones. The Slayer of Worlds achievement is STILL  glitched so that you can not kill empress of light and queen slime and still get the achievement. The worst ones are easily getting all of the slimes and town NPCs, along with getting the entire world cleansed. (I hated that achievement.) After the progression achievements, you have the ones that are mostly miscellaneous achievements like lucky break, vehicular manslaught and throwing line. Those ones you have a chance of coming across, but sometimes you would have to go out of your way to get. There is one that I thought was not super bad but nobody agrees with, supreme helper minion. As long as you decide to cheese it with journey mode then its not bad. I suggest waiting until post moonlord to do the bucket of bolts achievement, its kind of hard. leading landlord is easy, just move the arms dealer into the desert with the nurse. Unusual survival strategies is just drinking water while drowning. And feast of mitas is eating a cooked golden critter. That's about it for interesting achievements.",1675773149,1706915621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's TERRARIA!
(Deep breath...)

You basically can do what you feel like doing with certain difficulties. (For first timers, it may not always be easy depending on your luck.)
It MAY become a BIT of an obsession to do most achievements, but it can be done!

The exploration in this game is possibly the most interesting thing since one world is not the other world alike. you always see different results and biomes. Some worlds even has both the evil ones! (Twice the nightmare....)

And then there is the events. Let's just say it spices up your gameplay. 

At a later stage however, they can be annoying by popping up every so often. Blood Moon & Solar Eclipse are some of the more common ones which occurs one after the other. The only thing you could do if not interested, is to simply (sigh) wait it out. Most likely somewhere in the sky where nothing could spawn.

A bit of advice - Storage is key. It's up to you if you want to make one, but I believe it may be more useful to have one early in the game. Of course I'm writing about the item sorting option, which send the items to treasure chests having the same item in them. It's highly useful imho.

Your adventure may not be the same as others, but it will always interesting in it's own way.

Now go fetch your pickaxe and/or bombs and start aiming for whatever and explore your own world!
It's waiting out there for you. =)",1706892358,1706892358,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing Terraria is an absolute blast no matter how you play. The game can be grind heavy at certain points, but as a whole, Terraria never fails to be an excellent experience. 

Here are some of the main reasons why I love this game: the bosses are stellar; the weapons, armors, and accessories are extremely well balanced; the progression is near perfect; the music is iconic; and the difficulty is on point. Plus, this game is infinitely more fun with friends. The level of hilarity that occurred during some of my multiplayer sessions were on another level of fun. 

The only potentially frustrating part of this game is how grind heavy it can get, especially toward the end. Granted, some of the grinding is genuinely fun, but farming enemies for multiple of a rare drop can get tiring after a while. 

If you're unwilling to grind, you could always duplicate the items, but unfortunately, the developers patched out the primary method of duplication (which was actually fairly balanced all things considered).

With that aside, this game is a must-play. If you haven't already bought this game, do it now. I promise, you will not regret it.",1574459911,1706845368,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

However, I will say one thing. If you either don't have an experienced friend to guide you through or are incredibly unwilling to have to use the wiki from time to time, you may have a hard time. Still buy the game, but it would be beneficial if you get some external help as the progression can take a long time to ""stumble upon"".

I purchased Terraria at release (many many years ago), back then it was already a lot of fun. 
However during the first year of release the developers added so much content. That spans everything from tools, to mobs, to materials, and so much more passive animals and insects that really made the world feel alive and provides so much more immersion and distraction :D .

Fast forward more than 10 years later, And the game is now about a 100X more. In every way. Bosses, Content, tools, progression, materials, events, NPCs, etc.
Also the unique way in which the world transforms as you get super strong for the ""original content"" of the game, transforming your world to gives you a lot more gameplay and progression than the base game offered. This is when you defeat a boss (at like a 3rd completion of game bosses) and enter the ""Hard Mode"". Now you have even more things to do, discover, new enemies to fight, resources to gather, new ores, new bosses to defeat, even new biomes in your world. 

Just for the sake of comparison:
I've played Minecraft for a while and I really enjoyed it, however it was always the cense of discovery that made me continue playing. I don't like modding so I just played the vanilla game. However after seeing most of what the game has to offer I kind of just didn't feel like it encouraged me to continue playing. Also with the fact that Mojang/MS add content in such a slow pace it's just insulting at some point.
Here with Terraria, man! oh man! The amount of content is just out of this world.

Yes Terraria is 2D and to be honest after beating the game for the first time, I was kind of done and didn't really feel like creating a new world to explore any further. However now with the super long list of updates and all of the additions to the world. It's just filled with so much to do, see, discover, encounter, and the list goes on. This 2D world is always providing new things from all aspects.

There are literally thousands (yes thousands) of items. the nice thing is that you don't really need to worry about it (at first). You just go and play. You will come across new things and discover how to use them and how to combine them, etc. 
And this just continues stage after stage after stage. 

If you want to decorate your buildings and base. Well you have a world of choice, so many materials to build with, so many decorations, lights and other furniture that you can actually use (uhm Minecraft). 

Best of all! Terraria is also an action game. There are many times you will find a new weapon that will make you feel unstoppable, or just fun to use, or are just super cool/funny/stupid. Some of the weapons at the end game are just crazy.
There are 4 classes as well, you can just pick up any weapon or armour piece so there is no class you need to play. You just use what you have and combine to your desire. All playstyles have plenty of choice when it comes to weapons and man the projectiles or arrows and weapons really become something special when you pass the starting stage of the game making every fight (boss fight) a spectacle like a firework show. Which just makes you want to summon the bosses again and again just for the fun of it.

There is just so much fun to be hand in the combat that it never gets old, so much variety and it's all made with tons of creativity, love and polish that I truly feel that Terraria is one of the best games I've ever played.

One last thing I really want to mentions is the separations between player characters and worlds. For me I don't really like to start a new world because I don't feel like going through the start of the game again.
However with Terraria, as long as the kind of world matches the player character you want to use, you can use any character with any world you have. 
So if you want to start a new world fresh, however do want some of your gear or accessories that make some aspects of the game much easier or faster to do, you can do that. You need a material however don't really want to go hunting for it, just get some from your completed world and craft what you need to continue. Some people don't like that and want to earn everything (even for the 2nd or 3rd time) however the game gives you the choice and let's you play the way you see fit.

Also There is multiplayer which is really a lot of fun, also many online servers that are to this day very active that you can join and play with others or just be a part of a server community.

All that for a super low price that has not changed over the years. No DLC, no in game purchases, And the devs have announced multiple times that they will not make any more updates to the game. Just to continue the development and add a 1000 more items and quality of life features into the game because they love the community so much. 

If you have not yet purchased and played Terraria, There is really no game I can recommend more highly than this one. With the plentiful options you have when creating your many worlds you can make the game as accessible or as hard as you please. So play any way you see fit and enjoy this true masterpiece of a game that is just brimming with quality, fun, creativity, love and adventure!

This is a game with a robust building system, combat that takes full advantage of being a 2d game, and incredible depth. While it does have some balancing flaws with the higher difficulties, the game is incredible fun and has secrets at all tiers of play.

The main gameplay loop is: Explore A Biome -> Upgrade with the Gear You Find -> Defeat the Newly Available Boss/Event -> Explore the next Biome with a secondary loop of building up a town for your NPC friends (who sell some of the most important gear).

However, at no point is any Biome fully locked off to you (unless it generates mid-game). Sure, the enemies there will punch your face in if you're not ready (and sometimes even if you are) but you can easily sequence break some things given enough luck or skill.

The only major complaint I have is that Summoner needs a bit more gear options, since playing it I felt like I had to skip over several upgrade loops because there simply was no armor option available. I believe there's only 1 metal armor set that has a Summoner option and I also skipped over that. The issue I had because of this is that I never had enough survivability until I got summons that destroyed enemies before they got close, which took a while. The strategy I had to employ was to reroll all of my Accessories into being Warding, which worked decently.

I would say my favorite thing, but it's an incredibly difficult endgame secret, I'll let y'all learn about it for yourself lol.",1365562380,1706723650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another ""indie"" game from someone who sword to ""topple"" the ""corrupt practices"" of companies like EA and Activision, and yet they can't even get the basics of encouraging proper player problem-solving right. Just look at the average ""house"" for NPCs; boxes of two floors each spread across the world (or one giant box for you OGs) is all that's needed to reach maximum NPC happiness. any sort of creativity, and you run the risk of having to compromise. Same goes with things like beds; good luck having one wedged underneath a single inverted slope block, because apparently that counts as an obstruction for the bed itself, and don't even get me started on Infection; what if Christians like me want to Hallow the world to their holy desires and bring about happiness and joy to all around them? Too bad, the Dryad ain't satisfied until you completely purify the world, and you may have to tear up your entire world just to get that last infected block hiding just out of sight in the midst of the stone and dirt, just like the Dirtiest Block, which is already painstaking to find in and of itself just to have as a pet, not to mention as part of the whole ""been here and done everything"" end-goal.

And of course, you have to grind CONSTANTLY just to get anywhere substantial in the game itself, and this could take up months' if not years' worth of progress just to get to a point where you can even relax and let loose in your very own world. This is something we could have never been more grateful for in the Game Boy remakes of the original Dragon Quest titles on the NES, which minimized (but not entirely eliminated) grinding, and thus you could just level up and grow stronger as you go and adventure on. This is a terrible practice for any and every game involved, and it all takes away from the whole point of a VIDEO GAME in the first place: something to enjoy, not grind the meat out of down to the bone just to win, even if it means stress and agony, and of course, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. (And perhaps the biggest irony to all this: the final update to the game is literally named ""Journey's End,"" the ultimate meme to describe all of this.)

If I wanted to play a 2D sandbox survival game, I'd rather be playing MapleStory than what Re-Logic has the nerve to call ""one of those to topple the evils of AAA and their diabolical schemes."" And besides, the ""overwhelming positive"" reviews are clearly ""sus"" to me as well, as I'm pretty sure almost all of their audience was influenced by the internet and how the big guys apparently got into all these so-called ""malpractices"" and even ""criminal acts"" rather than really looking into it.",1706716680,1706716680,False,0,0,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Much like other popular games such as Dead Cells, Hollow Knight, etc, it is a 2D game that includes parkour and maneuvering yourself around harsh environments. Although there is a lot of jumping, dodging, you can only progress by killing monsters, upgrading your loot, and killing strong, well developed bosses that all have unique attack patterns and well designed sprites to fit their dangerous attacks. Through killing bosses you must gain more loot and climb your way up the food chain to the final boss... the MOON LORD. While many say this is a ""rip off Minecraft,"" they fail to realize that after some trial and error, you learn that there is so much more to it than mining, crafting and speedrunning to the end. Terraria also has a well developed storyline that you are able to explore as you meet new npc's and allow them to move into your home. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy a little challenge with some unique twists around every corner.

I was one of those people who loved this game to death and couldn't stop playing for hours. Despite the ridiculous community still going strong to this day and the absurd amount of time I spent in Terraria, I started to look at this game in a more critical way then an average person. I do want to note, I have talked about Tmodloader before and said that until I gave Terraria a proper review, then Tmodloader would be relevant to talk about in this review since it gives you more to experience and play around with. So today, let's talk about the overwhelmingly positive reception of Terraria and if it is as good as I remember.

[b]Graphics:[/b] Starting off with the graphics, they look really nice along with the details! It's polished yet sweet. 

[b]Music:[/b] The music is solid, of course I've heard the classics, the day time song, the boss fight song, and everybody's favorite song, the wow, wow, wow song, also known as the underground theme, overall, a solid soundtrack.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Terraria plays like a sandbox game, I say sandbox because it's where you'll unleash your creativity, you can build houses, bases, arenas, anything! You also have multiplayer, where you can play with your friends. Within any world you are on, you have the option to explore the world, this can get you some loot, like weapons, potions, accessories, and so on. They're very vital for protecting yourself, why? Because their are enemies out there to kill you, so you must fight and not die. You also have other options to do, like  crafting, fish, play golf, and grind. You explore in a variety of places like grass, desert, ice, ocean, underground, underworld, space, hallow, and underground hallow, these places offer a different look and environment around you. The main goal of this game is to beat the final boss, in order to defeat the final boss, you have to challenge all of the other bosses, like King Slime, Eater of Worlds, and so on! Keep on slaying those bosses, explore your way through this game, until you get to the final boss which is the Moon Lord, slay the Moon Lord and finally, beat the game.

[b]Introduction for the negatives:[/b] Terraria delivers a very solid experience of a game here, it's all fine but then, this is where the fun stops.

[b]Flaws:[/b] Oh my, there are a handful of things wrong with this game, let's look at those graphics again, while yes they're pretty solid at first, the animations...are terrible. There's barely any movement or fascination to be had here, it's especially apparent when fighting a boss, they look very lifeless and static. While the graphics look nice, the animations are very unpleasant, boring, and dull to look at, talk about little effort. The next thing, cheapness, enemies are very frustrating to deal with, especially when trying to work on something or dig, you constantly have to pull out your weapon, kill the enemy, and go back to digging, it's very tedious and annoying, it's worse when exploring because you'll either have to rush to an area where you can get away or risk falling and missing some loot, especially your coins (granted summoner makes this issue non-existent. The worst flaw of all, is the atrocious amount of grinding, that means doing the most tedious and mindless part of the game and you need resources to gear up and fight, which makes the grinding a very time consuming, mindless, tedious, and most boring part of the entire game, oh and don't even get me started on those rare items and making a potion. Combine that with enemies constantly being in your way, luck, and annoying navigation, and you got yourself the peak of a snoozefest here. 

[b]Verdict:[/b] Overall, Terraria is an okay game. To me, it's average at best for a casual and creative experience but at it's worst, the terrible animations, the grinding, boring and frustrating gameplay of Terraria makes it very difficult if not impossible to come back to due to it's flaws. For what it seems, it's obviously overrated, I know I spent a lot of time in Terraria but looking at it in a more critical perspective, I can see why this game is impossible for me to come back to, it's not because I'm bored, it's a general issue that will turn many people off.

[b]Extra:[/b] I didn't forget the extra addition of this game, Tmodloader, I'm not going to cover every mod out there because there are way too many to talk about but i'll give this section a small amount of time. It's basically Terraria but with mod support! Since you can play with mods, it makes Tmodloader slightly better than the original game. You got the more popular mods like Calamity and Thorium, give it a shot if you like, though I will say this, having mod support doesn't erase the game's flaws, it's still full of boring and tedious grinding and gameplay, at least you have some mods that make the grinding less time consuming.

So first off terraria has a comically large amount of content that's able to keep you hooked for days and its so replayable that I completed the game 7 times without getting bored or burned out. So you have completed your first playthrough, what now? Try expert or master mode, too easy for you? Try the Legendary mode and the For The Worthy seed, Already done? Try  100% completing the game or doing a challenge run, you can even install mods that can keep you hooked for even longer that add a sh*t ton of new content like bosses, classes, weapons, post Moon Lord content, difficulty modes and a lot more stuff. These mods include the Calamity Mod, Thorium Mod, Mod of Redemption just to name a few of the best ones. 
I would personally recommend the Ultranium Mod, it doesn't add a lot of content but its quality is off the charts, this mod is quality over quantity, its confusing to download because you cant install it from tmod loader which is goofy as heck. 
But if you're someone that really enjoys vanilla terraria i would recommend the Thorium mod, it doesn't feel like a mod but more like a DLC.
The Calamity Mod is a must play, its so big that it takes a similar amount of space on your computer as terraria itself, its basically a 2nd terraria.

By the way did i forget to tell you that this game is dirt cheap? Its like less than 10 bucks, literally anyone can buy it, and i fu*king swear on god that its worth your time and 10 dollars.

Also the devs aren't pieces of sh*t that don't care about the game and just want to make money, there are zero microtransactions in the game. They actually enjoy working on the game, the devs poured their hearts out to create and update such a masterpiece of a game, although the ""final"" update was released like a year ago they still constantly update and polish the game.

As I said before the game is very polished, mostly there are no glitches and the few glitches that remain are going to get patched soon or were intentionally kept by the devs because they were so fun/interesting, like the infamous ""hoiks"".

But for me terraria is more than a game, terraria managed to keep me semi-sane during some of the worst times of my life, i bonded with my old and new friends by playing terraria and some of my favorite content creators are terraria players.

Lets start at the beginnings, which are so humble. Andrew, my guide, what a sweetheart. I've been able to compare this game to 2D Minecraft originally, but the further you advance in the game, the more you realize that there is so much more to do, and see.  

The depth of this game is already quite extreme, especially for a 2D and I know some of you will say that graphically you just cant do it, and to that, I will say that this is your first mistake. What lacks in natural graphics, it excels in game play, and reliability in that it will be probably one of the best RPG you have ever played. 

Benefits?
1. Bosses that gradually progress harder and harder, but are mandatory requirements to continue onward. Challenging, but ever so rewarding both in items, and feels!

2. Cosmetics.  Who doesn't love a cosmetic? Not just for you, but PETS as well. This could be a winner for a lady in your life, it certainly was a winner for me! 

3. The items and progression system are challenging but fair. You can set up however you like, but you are likely to follow classes, like Warrior, Summoner (my personal favourite), or Mage!

4. If you are a collector, you can bet you will find something to collect in this game. There's 45 toilets you can collect, and they actually benefit you when sitting on them and fishing! 

That's just some of the benefits I like from the game. Some negatives are up to perspective. I had some trouble with latency in some multiplayer worlds, but I cannot blame Terraria, as it could indeed have been my computer at the time. But I would see my friends character in places it wasn't, or rubber banding around me.

Overall, this is a very good game, and to the ""Nay Sayers"" out there who don't like pixel games, they are all pixels, and it would be a shame for you to miss this gem because of it.

I find it more interactive and progressive than Minecraft because of how much you can do (not making Minecraft look bad), but the feature of playing on the same server with other players, especially friends makes this game so fun for me! I also love the feature of building houses for various NPC's.
Overall, there's much more to do progression wise and its 2D bit animation really adds on to the adventure!
Definitely recommend anyone to play since there are many ways to play Terraria (adventure - my favorite, battle enemies, sell, buy, pets, mining, or making houses for NPC's - also favorite)!

The normal mode is quite forgiving, and to the experienced terrarian, probably a little too easy. This being the case, I obviously decided to take on hardcore mode. testing the various levels of world difficulty. after doing so for something like 50 hours of seperate gameplays, I can tell you with 100% certainty that the game WILL kill you. It will suddenly spawn more foe units than you can handle, and make them evade unnaturally well. The game will force units through blocks to get to you. You'll find that even if you're careful to avoid/destroy traps, you'll get either knocked into one by a mob or fall down a hole that doesn't exist until your torch goes away.

I can't say anything that would explain or justify how much this game is amazing. It's cheap, it's got a metric ton of content, you can play it on almost anything, the weapons are awesome, the armour and customisation is fantastic, the graphics are both simple, yet charming - complex, yet stunning.
