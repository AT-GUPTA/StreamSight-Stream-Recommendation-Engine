Certainly NOT
While some Additions like the Auto-Save/Checkpoint System are really nice (especially in longer Missions) there are still a lot of downright annoying Things in this Game. There are no Gamebreaking Bugs but you will definetly find some unaligned Textures and weird Animations here and there.
Also i don't understand why they haven't tweaked the Difficulty: some Missions feel easy af while others are just Infuriating with Hit-Scan Enemies that land every Shot.

And who thought those flying controls are any good?
The Jetpack is almost unusable and a lot of Aircrafts just feel a little bit too responsive.

Besides those Complains (and maybe the weird Artstyle) this is still a good Experience especially for People who never got to play the Original: The Open World has a lot of Variety, there are a lot of cool Missions, the Game has a good Story and even after finishing the Main Story you can still spend a lot of Time in the Game getting Collectibles, Racing or taking over Gang Territories.",1709054205,1709054205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This edition of GTA: San Andreas does NOT fix the glitches and the bugs that plagued the original version of GTA San Andreas. With that being said, I personally believe that the bugs and issues add to the charm and nostalgia of the original version of the game to a wider audience with it being able to be ran on today's modern PC's.

Even with the bugs and glitches I still recommend this game.

I've tried to adjust them in the control menu, but it seems that 50% of controls from the original game got simplified. To fly a plane is ok-ish, but to fly a helicopter... I don't care about the graphics, some of the quality of life improvements (like the tab-wheel for guns/radio stations) are lovely... but the flying.. hated that and it used to be one of my favourite means of transport before.

Yes.
Does it ruin the experience?
Not at all! You just see some goofy shit sometimes; nothing game breaking.
The game has also been updated recently (as of February 2024) which seemed to have resolved most of the big stuff people on here seem to complain about.

If you're thinking about getting this game, buy it when it's on sale and you'll still have a blast playing it.

Most of the negative comments are just butt-hurt man children who are trying to relive the same feeling they had in '04 and are pissed the game doesn't give them the same nostalgia as the OG, which makes them super sad :'(

I do understand that it doesn't hit the same (I also played the OG's in the early 00's) but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still a great game!

I'm just under 4 hours in and have not experienced anything more than a couple funny glitches here and there; but nothing worth bitching about.

If you're on the fence about pulling the trigger on buying the bundle, I say go for it.
You can always refund it if you don't like it.

Introduction:
GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition beckons players back to the vibrant streets of Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Ventruas in a remastered version of the beloved classic. However, while it seeks to reignite the nostalgia of the original game and modernize the experience, it falters in execution, resulting in a journey through San Andreas that is marred by technical issues and missed opportunities. In this review, we'll explore the highs and lows of this remastered edition.

Nostalgic Remaster:
For fans of the original GTA San Andreas, the Definitive Edition offers a chance to revisit the iconic world of San Andreas with a fresh coat of paint. The updated graphics, improved character models, and reimagined environments evoke a sense of nostalgia, transporting players back to the bustling streets and diverse landscapes of Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas. Rediscovering classic missions, memorable characters, and iconic landmarks is a nostalgic trip down memory lane that fans will appreciate.

Enhanced Controls and Features:
GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition introduces modernized controls and quality-of-life improvements to enhance the gameplay experience. The addition of updated controls, improved camera mechanics, and refined aiming mechanics makes navigating the sprawling cityscape and engaging in combat feel more intuitive and responsive. Quality of life features such as autosave functionality and enhanced checkpoint systems help to streamline the experience, reducing frustration and enhancing accessibility for players.

Technical Issues and Bugs:
Despite its efforts to improve upon the original game, GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition suffers from numerous technical issues and bugs that hinder the overall experience. Players may encounter frequent framerate drops, texture pop-in, and other graphical glitches that disrupt immersion and detract from the visual fidelity of the game. These technical shortcomings can be particularly frustrating and detract from the enjoyment of revisiting San Andreas.

Lack of Substantial Updates:
While the Definitive Edition offers updated visuals and some quality-of-life improvements, it lacks significant updates or additions to the gameplay experience. Beyond the revamped graphics and controls, the core gameplay remains largely unchanged from the original release, offering little in the way of fresh content or innovation. Players hoping for new missions, activities, or gameplay mechanics may be disappointed by the lack of substantial updates, leaving the experience feeling somewhat stagnant.

Conclusion:
GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition offers a bumpy return to Los Santos, blending nostalgia with frustration in its remastered rendition of the classic title. While it successfully recaptures the essence of the original game and provides a nostalgic trip down memory lane, it struggles to overcome technical issues and missed opportunities for meaningful updates. Despite its flaws, it remains a worthwhile experience for fans of the series looking to revisit San Andreas with a fresh perspective, albeit with some bumps along the road.",1708104041,1708104041,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

For a fan as big as I am of the ""Grand Theft Auto"" series, these games are simply the icing on the cake. Although these games have gotten quite a lot of hate, in my opinion they are not as bad as people make them out to be. Yes, they do have their minuses compared to the originals, such as the radio in GTA VICE CITY, which is missing a few songs like Michael Jackson's. Yes, they do have some bugs, but you also have to keep in mind that the games were not made directly by Rockstar. I bought the trilogy simply for the childhood memories and I can say that I don't regret for a second the 30 euros spent. The only thing that bothers me would be the fact that you can no longer buy the original games on steam, which in my opinion is a huge minus. The best solution in my opinion would have been to offer you the original games when you buy them. However, in my opinion, if they are at a discount, they are worth buying. It simply gives you the feeling that you are playing GTA SA, VICE CITY or III, but in the present era. I hope one day they remaster Bully, which in my opinion is one of the best games made by Rockstar after GTA and RDR.",1707669505,1707669505,True,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Do NOT wait

These versions are good enough, and sometimes they are considerably beautiful.
I have not found gamebreaking glitches at all.
In fact, what I've found is a huge amount of hours of excellent gaming. I've completed GTA III and Vice City having a LOT of fun, and San Andreas is next.
It's just that in this case I am going to take my sweet time, because San Andreas puts GTA V to shame.

It is not only arguably the Best GTA game ever made, but it is something that I don't think we will find in GTA VI. If anything, I am afraid we will find more of the same as with V. VERY beautiful, but VERY cheap when compared to the Classics, and IV.

So do NOT wait for more embellishing updates, or lose time reading about how good these Definitive Editions could have been. Forget all that noise. The weapon wheel and the aiming (omg it was terrible in the so-often-praised vanilla versions) make these DE more than worth it, and there are many other things that make these versions far more playable.

So you can stay hesitant, reading complaints and criticism from high horses and rockstar haters, or you can just buy these game at -50% (or full price if you can afford it) because you will feel they are very worth your money and time.

Or you can buy the pack just for San Andreas, because this is one of the best games ever made.
Not only the best GTA there is.

And we will never get anything like this 
Ever again.

I could attempt to describe this game with words but many of us who are in our late 20's/ late 30's know this is the video game that changed the landscape in gaming itself.

I gave them a year before buying just so the kinks would be ironed out by the time I played it. It's still buggy. The sound mixing is a complete mess. Targeting is downright inferior to every other version of these games that have been churned out. It's called the definitive edition but there's really nothing definitive about it. Missions now have a quick retry option, and autosave is a welcome feature. Probably the biggest improvement over the original trilogy is that they're capable of running at 60fps without gamebreaking issues now. Aside from a few minor tweaks, very little has been changed to justify calling this ""definitive."" There is evidence everywhere that this was a rushed product. The intro movies use footage from the PS2 games. They didn't even bother to update them. Save confirmations don't use proper punctuation. I bought this for 50% off during the winter sale and I still feel like I got ripped off. I'm glad I got the original versions before Rockstar had them delisted from Steam.

It's like they took our beloved San Andreas, Vice City, and GTA III, put them in a blender, and hit the ""definitive"" button. But hey, at least Carl Johnson finally learned to fly – and not just in the metaphorical sense!

I fired up the game, ready for some nostalgia, only to witness Carl take flight during a high-speed chase. I mean, talk about character development! Move over, CJ, there's a new pilot in town. Who needs a pilot's license when you have the power of the definitive edition, right?

The graphics? Well, let's just say they are so definitive that even my toaster would be unimpressed. I half-expected Carl's lowrider to break into a dance routine at any moment, just to distract me from the pixelated mess around.

The pedestrians on the streets seem to have taken their dance lessons from the lowriders. They twist and turn in ways that would make a contortionist jealous. It's like the whole city is participating in a synchronized dance-off, and Carl is the unwitting judge.

Remember the iconic Grove Street gang? Yeah, they've upgraded from gang signs to interpretative dance. Now, when I roll up in my stolen car, they break into a routine that could rival Broadway. Who knew gang life was so rhythmically diverse?

But let's not forget the best part – the flying cars. I don't know if it's a feature or a bug, but watching cars soar through the skies like they've got wings is pure entertainment. Liberty City Airlines, move over; Carl Airlines has just been established, and it's taking off – literally.

All in all, the GTA Definitive Edition is a wild ride. It's a trip down memory lane, complete with glitches, dance-offs, and Carl Johnson defying the laws of gravity.

I don't understand how it's possible that after complete rewrite to Unreal, they managed to keep in so many of the original bugs, and even made some worse. You still have to lock FPS to 30 to be able to finish certain missions, just like in original - makes me wonder how much of the original code was actualyl repurposed, because this is crazy... also AI has laser focused aim, so some situations get overly frustrating to push through, but at least with properly implemented checkpoint system, it is easier to try again. Can't help but feel like they ran out of time, because it's obvious that San Andreas got the least love and care while working on definitive edition. Somehow - and that applies to all defintiive version of the games, they managed to make flying controls on M+K even worse than in originals. Straight up gave up and just grabbed a controller for flying missions.

I would recommend this only to people who are very big fans of the trilogy - which I am, hence why I finished it despite having many issues with it. If you buy the trilogy just for SA, don't buy it.

That being said, the core spirit of what made San Andreas so good is still there, so if you have very fond memories, and don't have access to original game (which also had plenty issues on PC, let's be real)... you might get some fun out of it.

and it’s not that the graphics are bad, although UE4 can be better for modern standards

the problem is the minimum of basic quality of life features of the game

yes they have improved driving

but they didn’t fix the very aggressive auto-centering of the camera!!! on foot, which was invented in the era of early 3D for PS3 games and which needs to be corrected to modern standards

in the game it is impossible to run with the camera angle you need, it immediately flies behind your back!!!
without the ability to turn it off, without a delay of at least 5-10 seconds!!!
The aggressive auto-centering of the camera also does not allow you to shoot whitout aironsight on the move immediately in the direction you turned the camera!!!

because the camera immediately turns around and the hero shoots in front of him

in all modern games the camera waits 5-10 seconds before centering, or centering can be turned off completely, even in games on UE4, but not here

and roll when aiming!!!, it was also left only for movement to the sides, and not in any direction
also there is no free shooting from a car/bike

All this does not break the game design, this is the quality of life, these are modern standards of convenience that have not yet been formed at the release of GTA3/VC/SA, but NOW they can be done, especially on the ue4 engine",1704663633,1704663709,False,23,0,0.677878916263580322,2,True,False,False

-Much less songs on the radio (Rockstar was greedy enough to not renew licenses)
-Runs worse than GTA V, while looking like an absolute garbage
-UE4 crashes
-Auto-aim on controller is horrible, aiming on completely other targets
-Textures not loading up (or doing worse res than the original) if you are further than 100 yards, or stuff just popping up in your face. When you fly it's just an eyesore.
-Objects falling through the floor
-Lights flickering

It suffers from a game breaking bug where all enemies have aimbot. No, I don't mean it in a git gud type of aimbot where you say it out of frustration, I mean genuine aim bot. 

In original, enemies would shoot at you and only a few shots would land every hit. However Grove Street Games fucked up when remastering. In the original, the enemies would be coded to always hit you perfectly when shooting at you while you're in a vehicle, god knows how they fucked up this badly but they gave this aim to enemies while you're also on foot. A MASSIVE fuck up on their end.

So you could literally be ages away from an enemy and as soon as they notice you, they instantly land each shot. There's a mission which pushed me to my breaking point where you randomly get teleported in front of 10 enemies and they instantly kill you. This is no exaggeration, they genuinely instantly kill you. Don't believe me, the mission I'm referring to is called ""Beat down on B Dup"" if you want to look it up. 

Unless if you do extreme preparation before hand and get lucky, it's literally impossible to complete this mission due to this game breaking bug. It's so frustrating since this mission is literally at the END of the game, like you complete 80+ missions you're preparing for the final confrontation but because of this game breaking bug you can't progress past this point.

There are so many minor bugs and glitches.
Such as the cut scene dialog getting cut out and then the subtitles not matching up to what is being said.

Sometimes there are cut scenes that break which would break the game, making you have to load from autosave from the menu.

The game is overall visually impressive, but I dislike how the CJ's Clothing is so low quality compared to rest of the NPC, some NPC suffer from odd errors that seem to be overlooked. It seems like the animated skeletons are detached from the models, could this be a porting issue into the new engine.

In my opinion there was a few things that could have been improved, I dislike how lifeless the characters are when they're driving in a car, I know this was possible just a way to keep the feeling of the original, but come on, it kind of seems like really they had just painted over a rusted beat up car.

-Restored the classic lighting of all three games.
-Fixed multiple texture issues.
-Fixed multiple bugs.
-Improved the general gameplay

Currently the true definitive experience is only available on mobile devices with no word of a patch for consoles or PC.

Edit:

Digital Foundry have covered this topic with a tech review. It should be noted that while the classic lighting has been restored in the mobile port, it has only been done for Los Santos and all cities within San Andreas are still currently using Los Santos atmosphere.

As of November 14, 2023 the PC and Console releases of GTA Trilogy - The Definitive Edition is running a inferior outdated version compared to the new mobile releases.

The new mobile versions have

Classic lighting
Tons of bug fixes
Improvements to gunplay 
Improved animations
Improved character models

Rockstar are still charging 60$ for these versions while leaving them woefully behind these new mobile releases.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

[u] I bought Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition for a discounted price 50% of the release price [/u]

[i] I've only played the San Andreas version enough to comment on that version yet [/i]

[b] Many annoying original bugs are gone and fixed as the ones below [/b]

[i] -The vehicles no longer autobrake as soon as you run the game above 30 fps. [/i]
[i] -The game runs well in higher fps as well as higher resolutions. [/i]
[i] -Fps is selectable to lock or to run completely unlocked. [/i] 

[b] Improvements introduced in this remaster version. [/b]

[i] -Much more optimized for modern computer systems [/i]
[i] -The game feels much more alive with all redone textures, buildings structures, nature and landscapes,  reflections light angles more detailed everything looks very good overall and gives a good experience. [/i]
[i] -Pedestrians have more variety and new looks and clothes as well as police, ambulance and main characters new voice lines to police, ambulance and pedestrians [/i]
[i] -Gun wheel like in Grand Theft Auto 5 [/i]
[i] -Radio wheels like Grand Theft Auto 5 [/i]
[i] -Autosave function and checkpoints in missions so you don't have to restart everything from the beginning like the original version [/i] 

[u] would like to add that I have not experienced a single crash of the game during my almost 45 hours spent, which I experienced very often in the previous original version [/u]

[b] Bugs [/b]
[u] There are bugs in this version, it's not something I intend to shove under the chair. But if we are to look at it from a realistic point of view, every and every other game contains bugs today and always has and always will. Some of course worse than others, but I haven't felt really bothered by the bugs I've come across as it's mostly been visual things that have happened once in a while and I can live with that.

I would say. Definitive Edition is so much better than the original.

Yes, I watched numerous Youtube videos criticizing Definitive Edition, they are all correct, if you put DE under a microscope, DE has many flaws. Like extremely low polygon buildings in the far distance, CJ's first girlfriend has a cartoonish face, blurred graffiti on the wall, they are all there, they are all true. But are you really bothered by it?  I wasn’t. 

But the DE has many improvement that’s game changing.

1.Better graphics. It’s far better looking than that old PS2 game.
No more 30 FPS frame lock! Original GTA:SA has 30FPS frame lock, and it ties to the physical engine, you can’t increase it by mod. I am playing 120 FPS in the DE version, it’s smooth. 

2.GPS routing! Such a basic function didn’t exist until GTA4. now the DE version has it. 

3.Checkpoint and auto-save! Original game doesn’t have it, so if you failed a mission, ready spending minutes run back and re-accept your mission. DE just save your time.

4.Borderless Windowed! Another basic function people take for granted but didn’t exist before.

5.Low mouse sensitivity and smooth aiming with mouse! I can set my mouse to 1600 DPI or higher with DE version. But I can only use 400 DPI if I play the original game, and the aiming was still awful, mouse acceleration was crazy back then.

6. Better car control. Cars just have easier control overall, and acceleration is faster for all cars.


I had the origin GTA:SA, I hated it so bad, I played it 3 hours, it made my rage quit and removed that game from library. But with DE version, I 100% finished the game and unlocked all achievements.

But to the game itself, GTA:SA is 20 years old game(reviewed at 2023 november), everything about this game screaming “old game” to you. Old game look, old game design, old game control, everything is old. Yes, GTA:SA is a classic in the video game history, but Super Mario at Famicon is a classic too. If you play that today, you won’t like it like you were in 1990.

So don’t expect some absolutely amazing game experience. Whether you like this game or not depends on your tolerance for old games.

After all, it's just an opinion from a Rockstar fanboy like me.

Pros:
- The game brought back ol'good memory when I was a kid. Can't deny that.
- The game can now run at >30fps.
- Some visual quality undeniably did improve significantly over the OG edition.
- Contains some additional or improved gameplay mechanics good for new players.

Cons: Unexperienced studio just simply port the Unreal Engine 4 on top the Renderware's code. Result in variety of bugs:
- Broken animations.
- Ugly visual in some places due to the lack of polishing.
- Broken ass control of some vehicles, infrastructures.
- Contains no new innovative gameplay improvement, even just those from newer GTA games.

I liked the first part, though. My hood. And little Las Vegas. Fighting for hoods was nice, but repetitive. And annoying if your had to defend it or get your district back.

So, I just started the game. I do not have much nostalgia for it. It runs on Steam Deck (nice!), but sometimes the controls (press A) did not work as intended or the movement animation was even faster and weirder than in the original (getting thrown out of the car and getting up). Might be a shuttering issue on the deck. So yeah, this game needs more resources than the original. But gladly no more modding.

I like the graphical improvements and I am already curious to see Little Las Vegas again. I'll update this review. ;)

Did I expect too much from the word “definitive” edition? Honestly, it falls short of my expectations, but overall, I think it's a good remake version of the original game(Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, 2005), so I'll give it a positive review.
In order to keep the unique atmosphere of the original game intact, developers have made changes to the appearance of characters and the designs of its map, and improved the user-interface(UI) without making major changes throughout the game. However, this may give customers the perception that the game was made at ease from a different perspective. It is true that this criticism is inevitable due to additional bugs and glitches, and inconveniences that were not found in the original game. From this point of view, I'll briefly write down the pros and cons of this game, and the conclusion.

PROS
-Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is the LEGEND, and it will never be changed. It still excites us until now.
- Improved graphics and weapon aiming compared to the original.
- The UI has been improved, and it certainly seems to be convenient in that field. (weapon selection, stats check, etc.)
- Elaborate the game more carefully and diversify the customization of the protagonist and vehicles (such as new and detailed food menus and car customization)
- Glitches in the specific missions in the original version are mostly removed and the difficulty level has been well-adjusted, making some overly difficult missions easier for beginners. The overall difficulty is well-adjusted. I definitely like that.
- Add Steam achievements

CONS
- Many bugs and glitches that were not in the original are newly created. (For example, a player can pass through obstacles at will, and there is a glitch where the character is moving to a strange place or falling out of the air.)
- Still stupid AI and NPCs reaction
- Uncomfortable with its control. (Plalyers’ sight is continuously forced forward, so it is impossible to look around.)
- It's hard to feel a big difference compared to the original. So it makes me feel like the developers have made the game at ease (it feels like I'm playing a mod made by amateur)
-The price is too expensive considering the quality of this game.

Conclusion
Anyway, it's a good remake version of GTA: SA, and the developers' intentions themselves deserve high praise. Therefore, I'll give it a positive review. If you're new to playing GTA: SA, it's worth buying it for over 50% off. However, if you've played the original GTA: SA, I recommend you to buy it at least 80% off. If you compare it to the original, not the game itself, there will be NO significant difference, or you can find many disadvantages and glitches. Don't expect too much and evaluate the definitive version as it is!",1700332320,1700432024,True,3,0,0.516233980655670166,0,True,False,False

Despite not being recommended to buy it for these reasons, I purchased it due to my fondness for nostalgia, and the situation turned out to be lamentable.

Негры, разборки за улицы, лоурайдеры, мафоны, продажные копы — это все то, что представляли себе мы, когда слушали N.W.A., Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, 2PAC, Snoop Dogg, Wu-Tang Clan. Это полный разъеб.

В России Сан-Андреас проходили с промтовским переводом, что породило мемы (хотя такого слова еще не было) про углепластик и траханье. А миссию про горячий кофе помните?

Мне сложно что-то добавить. Когда банда с Грув Стрит садилась на велики и гнала по району — это то, что я взахлеб обсуждал с пацанами со своего двора. А еще в игре был парень, который представлял себя рэпером, но драил толчки )

Феномен Сан-Андреас в том, что при всей своей зарубежности она была абсолютно понятна обычным пацанам с района. Нам было очень легко ассоциировать себя с СиДжеем и его окружением: бедность, родной дом, братаны, которые вместе преодолевают все трудности.

Я не готов назвать Сан-Андреас своей любимой частью, но я признаю ее величие. Меня просто не хватает каждый раз на то, чтобы добраться до финальных титров. Это (в то время) очень длинная игра. А я уже знаком с предыдущими частями, мне непросто повторить то же самое в третий раз.

И тут очень много контента, движок развили по максимуму. Возможность одеваться в магазинах, характеристики у персонажа. Для того времени появление RPG-элементов в экшене было взрывом мозга )

Мне кажется, что из всех частей трехмерной трилогии именно Сан-Андреас является неоспоримой классикой. Это уже история.

As a 7-year-old, this game would likely have blown your mind with its updated graphics. The addition of bump-mapped textures and parallax textures undoubtedly adds a layer of realism and immersion to the game, making it more appealing visually.

However, not all changes are for the better. Many fans have expressed their dissatisfaction with some of the alterations made to the game. The characters, in particular, have drawn criticism for looking strange and, in some cases, downright uncanny. These changes can be jarring, especially for long-time fans of the original.

On the positive side, the game remains as fun as ever and even more completion-friendly. The core gameplay, storyline, and open-world sandbox elements that made San Andreas a beloved title are still intact, ensuring hours of entertainment.

This remaster offers a mixed experience.

Having said that; if you are willing to spend some time modding the Defective Edition they start to become at least as good as the originals. I would go as far as to say that mods (and some improvements made by Grove Street Games) can make this the best version for a modern audience.

It's like the game devs spent more time drinking coffee than developing a game. Trying to look around while driving or walking gives me flashbacks to consoles (but 5x worse) it's like some aggressive barber that keeps adjusting your head to look forward, and if you have too much fps, or if your mouse sens is too high, the barber in question becomes SCP-173 and starts snapping your neck in an instant. 

And the bikes, bruh moment numero 2. The jump and lean forward buttons decided to join forces, forming a dynamic duo of inconvenience. It's like they're on a mission to make every bike-related task feel like living with my parents. No way to separate both those controls either, so whenever you try to hop with your BMX you'll end up faceplanting. And for some reason CJ is stuck to doing the Tour de Fr*nce, since you can no longer manually sprint with bikes, nor cycle at normal speeds. If you looked down too far while cycling your camera starts spinning at supersonic speeds, almost becoming tazman from looney tunes.

And the flying pains are also a nightmare of controls. it's like you're strapped to a seat and the barber is your co-pilot except hes buffed now, or you got stuck to using a cervical collar after driving with that horrendous camera for a while.
You cannot freely look around while flying in a helicopter or jet, since your camera is fixed in place (looking forward) 
And doesn't even move down with the plane. Which caused me to fly through yet another office building. 

Helicopters and jetpacks only fly up if you press left mouse button, which makes no sense. Can't even properly shoot my funny dual uzis anymore while in a jetpack. Plus the camera is also broken in helis, and combined with the poor controls, it turned me into an uncontrollable beyblade which led to me mowing down all existing creatures in a vast vicinity, ending with an unfortunate series of explosions.

The graphics looked cool until all street lanterns just randomly decided to become a bit quirky at night, and quit having a functioning light source. Almost had to grab an uv lamp to check for fingerprints.

Playing this game was like being in a comedy where the controls were the punchlines.

GTA SA will always hold a very special place in my heart for its astonishingly amazing story. The problems with this game, though, are the reasons why I don't recommend this remaster to other people. Firstly, the bugs. All of the glitches in this game that make it unplayable are super annoying as well. There are some lighthearted bugs that they fixed like the one where if you go in first person mode on a bicycle and then apply rear view, it just zooms in to CJ's face, which is pretty funny, but they patched that. I had a save file corruption at one point that made the game simply unplayable. When you open up the save file, I'm in freemode near a floppy disk as usual. But when you go outside, there are multiple invisible fighter jets constantly shooting rockets at you no matter where you go. You can be under a bridge and the missiles will explode on the bridge but still damage you. So I had to heroically get in a car, drive to a mission which wasn't that far away, and get there but with the risk of being bombed by invisible fighter jets. I got to the mission and completed it. After that, I didn't get the glitch again, but it sure was something that made me quit the game for a couple weeks. That was the only unplayable glitch that I encountered, but people have reported encountering much more severe glitches than mine. Secondly, the graphics. For a remaster, the graphics are horrible and I had to change a bunch of settings to make the game at least slightly presentable. I would honestly prefer the old PS2 graphics over this garbage. The remaster removed so much of the emotion from the characters' faces. It also deformed their faces. A prime example of this is Officer Tenpenny's face. The old version had emotion and looked like a real face. The remaster, however, looks so much worse and deformed. This remaster of our favorite childhood GTA games could of been so much better. They could've revamped the map to make it look more photo-realistic instead of the cartoony look that it currently has. They even could've remodeled the characters' faces to make them look way better, and they could've animated the characters' movements with motion capture like they did for GTA 5 and took the old sound bytes of their voices and applied accurate lip movements. But instead, Rockstar, like the greedy scoundrels they are, decided to employ a company that makes mobile games for the remaster and pocket all of the change.

It's the fact that the OG versions of these games were replaced with these versions. The older versions run better and have so many mods that were created since the games were released on PC. 

I do have fun when playing the definitive edition versions though and it's nice to just install the game and not have to download graphics mods just to see a slightly more updated version of the game and also have better controller support without installing a mod. Plus the definitive edition versions lack the compatibility issues the older version may have with certain PC configurations. 

However, the definitive edition versions have so many issues as many people have already described: downgraded/weird looking character models, poor optimization especially for how the game looks, and bugs. A year later and these versions are extremely far from perfect. These games should have been remade from scratch using RAGE. We should have gotten something that looks like Vice City Rage with improved graphics and shaders. That would have been amazing, but one could only dream.

Is this game worth a buy? Maybe under these criteria: It's on sale, you have a powerful PC, and understand that these games were lazily ported over to Unreal Engine.",1674618195,1693976076,False,53,1,0.775642514228820801,0,True,False,False

-It's GTA: San Andreas
-Great Soundtrack
-Majority of the textures look alright and don't glitch out

Cons:
-Too many bugs and glitches to list, even in the latest patch
-Updated controls that actually feel more janky than the original
-AI damage and accuracy is stupidly OP, I enjoy a challenge but at times this is just ridiculous.
-Launching errors and long loading times
-Plants and Shrubs draw distance issues, the same as the original SA, for a 2021 release... come on...
-Huge performance issues (I can run GTA V/RDR2 on MAX at min 60FPS yet this stutters and lags on max, even when running in DX12 like suggested by the community)
-Overpriced
-Lack of mods or unofficial fixes unlike the original SA (Probably due to needing Unreal Engine installed to mod)

Recommendation: If you can get it for a good price, I mean under £20 for the trilogy, then you may be able to get your moneys worth out of it. Anything over that is just insulting to the buyer. Hopefully more people tackle the modding scene in Unreal Engine to fix and enhance the game, but with the amount of effort required to even replace one texture, it's unlikely the Definitive Edition will ever reach 10% of the amount and quality of mods for the original game.

They completely destroyed the atmosphere of original and made th character models look like plastic toys.
Instead of taking  inspiration from modders which alreadyfixed the problems of og San Andreas with updates like SkyGFX and SilentPatch, improved lighting, improve the foliage, and update the controls etc. They removed the original game and also forced shut down of the mods with lawsuits.
Also this game is using using mobile/xb360 versions notorious for bugs and glitches slapped onto unreal engine 4.
No amount of updates could fix this broken game , unless they built the game from scratch.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ROCKSTAR DOSNT DESERVE A SINGLE PENNY FOR THIS LAZY BROKEN POS GARBAGE

Don't bother buying these games if you have any intention of trying to 100% the game. Currently the vigilante mode is broken rendering it impossible to finished. I just spent the last few hours trying to finish the vigilante mode for the armor boost. My experience was the vigilante mode breaking and no longer spawning enemies for me to take down on level 3, 4, 3, 8, and most recently level 11. For the console players they set it to fidelity mode but that's not something you can do on the PC version. Other say set it to performance mode, the only setting that can be set to performance mode is DLSS which I don't see how that has any effect on enemies not spawning in vigilante mode. Anyways I set the DLSS to performance mode because I was willing to try anything at this point, it even seemed like it was working because I managed to kill the enemies on level 11, then the timer just stopped and no new enemies spawned. So I finally said fuck it let's try to cheese it with the cluckin bell method, this is where you start vigilante mode, enter cluckin bell for 20 seconds, the enemies just magically die somehow, then you run back out hop on the bike to reset the timer, rinse and repeat until you're done. Yeah they can patch that out but they can't patch the enemies not spawning in the first place. Good job Rockstar/Grove Street Games.

The customization of CJ from his clothes, tattoos, hair and body was vast.  One of the biggest additions to the game was the newer vehicles that was added along with new weapons that could be leveled up thus increase proficiency with said weapon (faster reload, increased accuracy and even dual wielding).  San Andreas was also the first GTA to allow swimming and under water exploration. 

Now for the definitive edition I did come across some glitches and bugs but nothing too insane or game breaking.  The glitches would range from npc's running in place or floating when they died, to not being able to return girlfriends home after going on a date (thus not being able to complete the date) or hint or info menu's not showing when the game is trying to explain the task at hand. I also would see a lot of texture pop ins especially when flying planes to different locations.

Other than that my experience of the game was pretty smooth and fine, I def enjoyed how the game play or shooting mechanics were improved from the original game.  Overall GTA San Andreas is def worth playing (this version or the original) for the story and characters alone, the games story takes a bit of Boys in the Hood and Training Day themes and mixes them up together creating a very strong narrative.  The gang wars was probably one of the better parts of the game where you fight rival gangs for territories (this would later be implemented and the main focus in the Saints Row games).",1692036791,1692036791,True,30,5,0.595817148685455322,0,True,False,False

The 3D models are wild. It feels in their attempt to smooth out the jagged edges of the 2004 models involved opening them up in Maya, and hitting 3 to smooth out the mesh. Which results in the straight up breaking of some of the models. 
The quality of these models is nothing to write about either, with most of the character models looking very similar to an assessment for 3D characters I submitted when I was in animation school, and that is [u]not[/u] boasting on my part, I did not do well in that assessment.

It's genuinely impressive that this 'remaster' managed to break as many things as it did. 
The camera controls in vehicles is an absolute mess, would you like to look up or down? [i]Too bad.[/i] 
Would you like to look anywhere but straight ahead for 2 seconds while? [i]Not happening, buddy.[/i] 
There are even some bizarre choices, like removing the ability to rebind certain keys for aircrafts. So anytime I wanted to change radio station, I would put my landing gear down, or using flares in the hydra, would also fire machine guns. 
That's without me even touching on all of the tears in the map, I genuinely lost count of the amount of times ground textures were not aligned correctly, resulting in a glimpse into the abyss of nothing. Visually, that sucks, but while collecting Oysters, I actually fell through one of these tears, so unfortunately it's not just a visual issue.

On its own, things like these aren't that big of an issue, but when these issues didn't exist in an almost 20 year old version of the game. It's very hard to recommend this game, and it's even harder to call it the [i]definitive[/i] way to play GTA San Andreas.

Just so I wasn't [i]completely[/i] negative about this game, sometimes the lighting looked okay. Like the neon lights of Las Venturas at night. It also has achievements, which unfortunately the classic version does not. If it didn't, there is absolutely no chance I would have played this as much as I did.

TL;DR: If you want to play GTA San Andreas, just play the classic. This one sucks.",1691826659,1691850490,False,19,0,0.66610640287399292,0,True,False,False

Other than texture related issues, you have bumpers scattered all over the road, low brightness in some places, unhinged character models (though those got better over the course of updates but far from perfect), strange rendering that looks much worse than the fog as in the original (thanks to how the game renders, you sometimes come across invisible walls of objects which were supposed to be visible, even outlines would do the job). 

Now I'm not sure if this was the case in the original but there are way too many cops spawning than I remember which makes the game even more annoying. The only redeeming feature this game are checkpoints so you don't need to reload the latest save, also I'm not sure if that's a bug or not but you don't need to mesh W in order to cycle faster as it does it automatically just for pressing the button.

All I can say is, the whole trilogy are some of the laziest remasters you can find out there. I can recommend this game to all the people who want to get achievements and also to those who never played the original games (as you can't buy the originals on Steam anymore). Besides that, even though the price isn't too bad (10 euro for each game while on sale) it doesn't mean these games are any good.

You step into the shoes of Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, returning from his native Los Santos to bury his mother and reconnect with his family (both biological and street). In an unsurprising twist, CJ is soon thrown into a criminal maelstrom of gang wars, corrupt cops, triads and conspiracy theories, which gradually take him to the cities of San Fierro and Las Venturas, replicating parts of California and Nevada. Following the example of the previous part, you gradually work your way up from a petty criminal to the boss of a giant mafia empire. And all this to the sound of classic nineties hip hop. The American dream of every boy growing up in the ghetto.

Compared to the previous installments, San Andreas could be summed up in one word - more massive. The game world is much bigger and brings an incredible amount of new activities that can keep you busy for tens of hours. In addition to the obligatory four tasks in a taxi, ambulance, police or fire truck, this time you will also enjoy apartment burglaries, aerial acrobatics, swimming, dating or ""dancing"" lowriders. At the time, the game offered as a big draw the possibility of modifying the main character's appearance - in addition to the traditional changes of suits and hairstyles, you were given the opportunity to improve your hero's abilities and influence his physique by visiting a gym or a KFC. These changes then opened up new missions and the other characters reacted accordingly to CJ. From a game point of view, it was a perfectly polished diamond that Rockstar carefully worked on for three years, and the game deservedly collected absolute ratings.

Gamers' hunger for nostalgia was so strong that Rockstar decided to call this gem back from retirement and offer it with the Unreal Engine polish. Rockstar would add another box office hit under its belt and revive the excitement surrounding the continuation of the series. However, this job should not be given to the studio Grove Street Games.. instead of quick bucks, Rockstar has rather embarrassed himself.
Just as CJ's unsurprising twist at the beginning of his story awaited players, this unsurprisingly messed-up remaster awaits players. [b] 75% [/b]",1691765433,1691765433,True,11,0,0.500670790672302246,0,True,False,False

Out of the 3 remasters GTA SA is the least improved one of the bunch. 

[b]Stability/Bugs[/b]
Game is stable. I was able to finish 100% of it including all achievments. No crashes encountered.
That being said - lots of bugs, few of which actually prevent normal completion of some missions.
Example are girlfriend dates - if you take them on a food date afterwards game soft locks. They stick with you and date wont end unless you kill them. You need to use a different bug to force complete a date by going into a gym. 
Some missions have missing audio dialogue. You see subtitles but no sound, or other way around.
Audio in radio stations have a tendency to cut-off and suddenly start playing next song. 
Some missions have desynced cutscenes, where audio is late.
Oh and of course floating cars, cars driving in air, cars spawning in each other causing explosions, cars spawning and driving in reverse (original bug from 2004) and lots of random issues similar to this all around the game.
In some cutscenes character models break and  eg CJ can move his torse while his legs are stuck in one place making his model tear apart.

Overall, game is stable, but does require some workarounds for some missions to be able to finish it fully.

[b]Visuals[/b]
Even with latest patch and few mods installed there are a lot of noticable visual bugs.
Distant LODs look horrible. Ability to see entire map from higher altitude breaks the immersion of its size.
A lot of roads in countrysides are not connected to the grass areas, leaving holes into the void, which you can clip thru and fall down. Very noticable as you drive around.  The sesert tunnel is missing entire model for entrance. You can see entire mountain inside, huge hole.
Some objects float in the middle of the street, eg. street lamps in the middle of a road in LV floating mid air which you can actually hit. Some random ""tires"" on country roads that from a distance look like a clipping car or tree.  Often cars spawn clipping into the road. Road collisions in some areas different than the road model, which makes your car clip into the ground, sometimes fully (on main roads used for story missions!).
Grass floating midair in countryside etc. So many visual issues there is no space to list them all. And worst - they are actually very noticable while playing, even if you dont look for them.

Oh and the new lightning engine actually makes some story mission areas much darker than original making it harder to navigate thru.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
As the most 'modern' of all 3 remasters, GTA SA doesnt really feel like a remaster compared to other 2. 
Not many new additions, if at all. Free cam movement, free aim etc were all already in the original GTA SA.
Visuals and new lightning engine doesnt make that much of a difference with the remaster compared to eg. GTA VC. Getting any shader for 2004 game gives better results without all those new bugs.  
Maybe some textures are sharper, car reflections look better, but thats not that noticable here.

Due to all listed bugs and visual glitches above the gameplay is actually much worse than in the original. 
Basically nothing new added  but a lot of things taken away due to bugs. 

Did  I also mention that majority of weather conditions are gone? Fog in San Fierro? Forget about it. Sand Storms in LV? More like a poorly added filter/texture on all objects which breaks any immersion left.
All 3 cities/areas look and feel the same, so orange sunsets in LS, no heat waves in LV. Same weather everywhere....
Oh and objects you can break have no ragdol and just ""drown"" into the land in an unnatural way.

[b]Summary[/b]
Not worth it. Play original with even shitties shaders and you will get much better experience.
Only positive thing this remaster adds are sharper textures, car models and reflections, but all those things can be modded in original with better results. 
And it introduces a TON of bugs/soft locks/visual gliches and many immersion breaking moments.

Yes, its playable. Yes you can finish it 100% (with usage of glitches and bugs to combat other bugs) and Yes, it looks visually better (kinda) than the original, but its NOT worth it at all.

Play original if you want to replay this game.

The original game is amazing, so don't let this ""definitive"" version put you off from playing it, if you haven't, you absolutely should. 

The only reason I'd recommend this ""definitive"" trilogy is if you want to play GTA III and GTA Vice City with a few small QOL features added, the only real ones being the radio wheel and weapon wheel, or if you don't already own the originals. If you just want to play San Andreas, play the original, you can find mods pretty easily for the radio/weapon wheel. The only reason I say otherwise for III/VC is because I couldn't find a mod for those games.

Mainly I got much more in to the story and now I can say that the story of the game is quite good at least for a game this old. I also learned more about the characters because again when I  was younger maybe I just wasn't paying that much attention to them. I don't really see a point scoring the game as I have done that on the original and I would maybe add a single point to graphics but again what made this fun for me was the fact that I changed more than the game and I got deeper in to the story.

Welcome to San Andreas, I'm CJ from Grove Street
Land of the heinous, gang bangers and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competin', even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast wit' the flag on the strap, that's OG
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get supercut and big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats: Respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat and sex appeal
You get clothes from Binco, and ProLaps
Suburban, Zip, Victim and D-Sachs
Watch yo' back when them rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survival's good (Survival's good)
Duckin' shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out, bus' a gun until they tuck they tail
It seems like I'm on impossible missions
Twisted predicaments, hostile positions
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Cause the 'Dreas's full of gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains 'fore how you do yo fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones, dump 'em out
Bend the block, shake before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none

This game has a impressive amount of glitches, some rendering the game completely unplayable. However, the nostalgia from the game was worth the purchase. The price of the game does provide a lot of story time, roughly 50-70 hours worth. considering most games you can complete in under 20 hours, this is well worth the price tag especially when discounted on the sales.

Some glitches i experienced: 

When you're in a gun fight and turn, your suddenly aim directly into the sky, resulting in you being shot and loosing health, this can become very problematic especially when this happens multiple times within a short period of time. 

Sometimes i would spawn in, and randomly all my weapons and armour would be missing, however my in game balance would still remain the same and show the value showing i had purchased the items that didnt load.

Also, i would load into missions with all my tyres randomly popped. 

Some missions didn't have clear instructions and resulted in me being confused. 

Other people have experienced this game crashing, i have only had a handful of crashes, which doesn't make sense given how powerful my computer is. Research shows these are mainly issues with cloud saves.

One time i was driving and randomly hit a invisible barrier in the middle of the road, strangely enough the other cars in the race just went completely through the barrier, resulting in me being unable to complete the race, then loosing by default.

Sometimes i would shoot enemies and the bullets wouldn't register at all. forcing me to change positions during the gunfight, resulting in me loosing almost all my armour and health.



Given all of this, it makes it very difficult for me to recommend this game, especially if your considering 100%'ing the game. The mental stress from this is unbearable, making the game only playable for a hour or two max before needing a break of equal length. It's sad given how fun this game was back in it's prime, rockstar obviously didn't care hence why a team that made mobile games was given this to complete. what a waste of a opportunity.

If you can avoid this game, don't play it. vice city and gta 3 are much better and have a lot less overall issues. this game need serious fixes, that rockstar wont implement.

Sometimes when i would enter a building, for example the ammo store, when i left the store the car that was outside has been randomly replaced. 

However i do feel that the more time you invest into the game, the more powerful CJ becomes, this makes you efforts feel more rewarded.  Missions also become much harder. 

One major downside i personally experienced is that flying aircrafts are slightly confusing and annoying, not unplayable but annoying. 

After 100%ing the game i can confirm i would recommend it. It took me 56 hours to fully do everything and earn all achievements. The last mission did glitch, fire extinguisher wouldnt work at all. thankfully i managed to jump thru the fire. beside from that",1688637624,1688910959,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So i started the game realized my game launched on the wrong screen and then i went into settings as by the law of gaming order and there was no way to change the monitor. So i had to change the window to windowed mod dragged the game over to the monitor i want then clicked full screen. Well then my PC went ape crap and started messing with the display gods and by now you are all thinking i am probably insane. I do not recommend if you want to play on the monitor of your choice.

Overall, the game is definitely fun to play through and I really enjoyed it, but it is not really an improvement over the original in any way besides maybe a slight improvement in the graphics.

I was quite excited to try out the remaster of this classic, however after i dived into the game it was obvious that this ""remaster"" had a fair share of hits and misses.

Firstly the positives. The updated visuals are a very noticeable improvement from the original, and the modern facelift gives the game crisper textures, enhanced lighting. The cities feel a lot more alive and vibrant, and the inclusion of widescreen support and high frame rate makes this a very smooth experience.

One area that the developers did really well in is preserving the detail in the world, every street corner, building and feeling feels exactly how it did in the classic. And of course the nostalgic radio stations which remain a highlight (even though a lot of songs got removed).

The core gameplay experience is more or less the same as it was in the classic with the open-world exploring, driving and shooting which i am glad remains intact from the classic.

However despite these positives, the game still falls short in a few ways which might leave some people disappointed. One glaring issue was a few technical bugs. Usually its just visual glitches like characters/vehicles suddenly disappearing, to more severe issues like crashing. These frustrating issues should have been ironed out by now, which is quite disappointing as you would expect something more from Rockstar.

In conclusion; The definitive edition is a mixed review from me, the improved visuals and preserving the original games detail remain a positive for me, but the numerous issues, horrible character models and missing content soured my overall experience. Grove Street Games had the chance to deliver an amazing definitive edition but they fell under expectations.

the game is amazing, and the graphics add to it.

the only issue is that because of the new control schemes, certain things have broken such as not being able to look up or down.

people say this is from it being ported from the mobile port, THIS IS NOT TRUE.

THE GAME WASN'T PORTED FROM THE MOBILE VERSION, IT JUST HAS MOBILE PORTS BUILT INTO IT BECAUSE UE4 DOES THAT BY DEFAULT ON EXPORTING GAMES.

as for the reason behind the inability to look up and down being because ""touch screen controls"" this is not true, the reason is because the right analog stick is not set up properly in the exported version of the game for planes.

vice city works just fine when looking up and down in aircraft, they just broke it in SA is all it has nothing to do with it being a mobile port which as i said, just isn't true.

within the source files you can find the port settings for every port, these are there because on default, when exporting a game from UE4 the controller node will automatically set up controls for touch screen.

this does not mean it was a mobile port, it just means the game was exported with the ability to be played on a mobile device, which it is, and when you do play it on there the bug in flying planes still exists, (go figure,)",1687773127,1687773127,True,0,6,0.39970928430557251,0,True,False,False

-Crunchy gameplay
-Camera controls suck
-NPC's are looking cartoony and plastic
-Perfomance is not that good
-When you start playing it sooner or later you will want to add some things to the game and there's the other thing.. Searching for mods that are made from people that care about this game. 
-Most of the legendary songs from our childhood are removed
-Most of the bugs from 2021 are still not patched
-Don't waste your money even if you have them. Buy something better instead

Why i think this game have potential?
-The whole trilogy has a good potential and if money grabbing a$$hole$ from Rockstar decide to fix it it will explode and will have huge profit from it. 
Including the graphics that are presented, the game if fixed as i said have huge potential 

P.S: As of writing this i requested refund and i will not buy this crap again until its fully fixed (a.k.a never). Huge credit to the moders who make mods for the trilogy. If you have spare time you can make the trilogy from garbage to perfection but i will not. Instead i will be downloding the original trilogy and i will mod them instead!

GTA: San Andreas is very sentimental to me because it is the game me and my dad would play constantly before he died. 

I have since his passing played this game constantly to remind me of him and our adventures. So this is my third attempt at 100%-ing the game. Hence, I'm very, very familiar with the game and its bugs and intricacies. (I had 700 hours on my PS3 save, 5 years on my PS2)

This version, is by far the WORST version of GTA I've ever experienced. I won't list any specific ones, but I'll tell y'all that I knew every bug on GTA SA because you couldn't really send out an update or patch a PS2 disk. On PS2 there were bugs but nowhere near as game breaking as this game has been. It's frustrating and I don't even struggle with zeros missions or driving school because I'm so advanced in this game.

Ran into zero issues in my play through of all 3 games and had no problems with the graphics.  The only thing I really take issue with is the removal of certain lines in Vice City involving the Haitians due to the political correctness of today.  I also think they removed the confederate flag from some guys shirt.  yes, obviously people who fly and wear that flag are idiots but it’s a damn video game where our character is a murdering gang lord.  Anyways, overall Grove Street Games did an amazing job and don’t deserve the negative reaction they’re getting.  I hope they’re working on a remaster of Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories as i’ve always wanted to play through those legally with steam achievements.

I am not impressed with the way the game works and handles as well as the random ""Fatal error"" messages that makes the game crash unexpectedly. The controls are cumbersome to say the least and there is no mod support either. I have the original of GTA San Andreas and it can be modded to be better than this defective edition. I am glad I never paid full price for this one in its current state. 

That said, when not on a mission. There is more NPC's with different clothing and styles that makes it more like GTA V. The vehicle explosions are now more realistic than before as the fires now kill the NPC's after they walk into the flames. Good effects as its realistic but why not make the NPC AI more realistic so that they don't walk into the flames? You did well on the fire effects but the AI is still dumber than the original GTA SA game has. 

I would like to see mod support so we can add realistic cars and mods into this game like we can in the original. Especially if the txd and dff files are the same type as the original game was.

The controls are reason enough to make this the best version. The controls in the original version were really dated. Here they are much closer to modern GTA games.

The graphics are very smooth, sharp, and shiny. I like them. Being able to play at higher resolutions and 60 fps is how the game deserves to be experienced.

The game is as enjoyable as ever. I never played it much back in the day, so it's a great opportunity to play them now.

I guess most things that were bad in the original release were fixed with patches, because it has been a really positive experience so far.

GTA San Andreas is a great game

GTA San Andreas - The Definitive Edition is not.

I wanted to make that clear because I love San Andreas. I first played it on the Original Xbox, and I loved it. I then found out it was on the Xbox 360, and I didn't like it as much as the OG Xbox version. The only thing the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions have going for them are the Achievements/Trophies (and the PS2 classics version that was on the PS4/PS5 store). I then bought the original game on Steam because I was getting more into PC by then and decided ""why not? It's a great game,"" and I loved it. A few years later, my dad gave me a bunch of his old games, and the PS2 version was among them, so I played it and loved it more than the OG Xbox version because the PS2 is my favorite console.

So then in 2021, Rockstar decided to remaster GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas. I'm sorry, did I type ""remaster?"" What I meant to type was they took the Mobile versions, ported them to Consoles and PC, called them remasters, and removed the originals from digital storefronts. Oh and they had Grove Street Games, formally known as War Drum Studios, do it, and they haven't been known to make good ports. Now I'm pretty sure Rockstar did give people the originals on the Rockstar Games launcher for free after the backlash, but I don't know about steam since I already had the originals before.

This version pretty much sucks and I'm only into it for the Achievements. I was in an Ambulance doing the Paramedic mission, and when I got to level 10 after like 20 minutes, one of the patients was underground down some stairs. I couldn't find her for a long time, but I finally did in the nick of time and had to drive the Ambulance into the small tunnel. I have also run into this issue where Grass is just floating in mid air.

Their are many other reasons as to why the ""Definitive"" Edition sucks.

If you want this game, here are a few recommendations:
1. If you have a Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S, get a physical copy of San Andreas on the Xbox 360 or OG Xbox since they are Backwards Compatible. The OG Xbox disc downloads the 360 version, but since the OG Xbox version is usually cheaper, I would get that one.
2. If you have a PS2 or OG Xbox, get it on there.
3. If you have a PS3 or Xbox 360, get it on there. They are also mobile ports, but I would say they are still better than the ""Definitive"" Edition. I'm not sure if putting a PS2/OG Xbox copy of the game in a PS3/Xbox 360 plays the PS2/OG Xbox version or the PS3/Xbox 360 version, someone else will have to verify that. If the PS3 and Xbox 360 do play the PS2/OG Xbox version when you do that, then I would buy the PS2/OG Xbox version.
4. I'm not sure if this would work, but if you only have a PC, then you could try finding a physical copy of the original game.
5. Not that you should do this, but if you only have a PC and don't feel like spending extra money, you could download a PS2 emulator and the GTA San Andreas PS2 ISO file and play it like that. If you do go the emulator route, I would only recommend the PS2 version.

Thats my review.

There are no other improvements to GTA San Andreas at all and it's buggy as hell: constant frame rate issues, slow gameplay and random crashes even on the lowest possible settings. Unacceptable considering this game is 20 years old. It's worse than Cyberpunk 2077 release day 1 with the bugs. 

Even the nostalgia rush I get playing this game when it actually fucking works can't overcome the glaring issues this has. Rockstar fucking sucks, they are greedy inept scumbags and this is the last game I'll ever buy from them. Fuck Rockstar for screwing this up so badly. Bags of shit pimping out an old game for a money grab and can't even get it to work properly in the year 2023. Astonishing negligence and absolutely not worth your money.

At the current time of this review, I've completed all the main missions, and it's a good storyline. Although I did experience at times some issues when playing, they weren't overly massive/ completely game-breaking. 

Would I recommend this game? Yes and no, simply put it's a game that you can miss, or move to the very bottom of your wish list if you are someone who has already played the original. However, if you are someone who has not played the original before and have no idea about this game, then I would recommend it, Good story, great characters, but also some great voice lines which are legendary. 

However, as mentioned previously, I experienced some non-completely game-breaking problems, which isn't great. Lastly, it is 100% not worth the full price, another factor for me in this review. I bought this game on sale, and that was a lot better value, particularly for this.

- Story (obviously)
- Characters (obviously)
- Graphics
- Mini Map Rework
- Modern Controls (Old Ones Sucked)
- Most of the Bugs have been fixed... most

Con:
- Physics, despite it being 2004 it originally released, it still is annoying as heck lol
- LOD Bugs
- Doors not being placed correctly on some buildings like the Casino in Las Venturas owned by Ken
- New Models placed on Old Skeletons, which resulted in Sweets broken arm, and Ryders hunch back with all the other characters
- Cutscene audio delay in lots of cutscenes for some reason, probably due to lag spikes because how badly UE4 is optimized
- Props render/pop in right infront of you (Broken Render Distance)
- Bad frames as i just mentioned, because UE4 isnt optimized good
Overall:

I have this to say;

Cons
. This version of the game is very glitchy.
. I experienced lots of visual errors within the landscape.
. Most of the ""updated"" character models look like play dough.
. The original on PS2 is miles better visually despite this being a remaster.
. Everything looks like plastic.
. I experienced frame issues despite having high end PC.
. I clipped through the floor several times. 
. Underwater sea beds have no collision often
. It rains indoors
. NPCs often will do massive damage to a vehicle despite only bumping them lightly.
. Colours are more saturated than Super Mario 64.
. Often I'd see vehicles driving on the freeway spawned in incorrectly and we're stuck in floor.
. When flying island to island textures became ugly blurry soup even after landing.

Pros
. Overall frame rate is generally better than original.
. Menu and UI is way better.
. Some visual aspects have improved such. as; lighting, NPC and vehicle variation.
. Some main NPCs look better generally.
. The added checkpoint system is very appreciated.
. Gameplay is still top notch.

I'd recommend this game despite its issues. Ultimately GTA SAs gameplay shines through the bs.

There is no denying the legacy that San Andreas holds, especially almost 20 years later, but you also can't deny the hap hazard way that Grove Street Games went about remastering this game, and it's prior titles. At it's core it's still the same old story of gang warfare, and corruption that every buster knows by now, it just wears a botched skin job that very loosely “re-invigorates” it. I haven't had any problems while playing the game, and for the most part I have had some fun, even if the AI for enemies is on par to that of a lobotomite, I mean seriously you can get enemies to funnel into a choke point, and they will mindlessly keep walking into your line of sight just to get shot. But my real crux of this review is to throw heavy shade at Grove Street Games.

It's criminal to charge people again for one of the worst & lazy ports. The Mafia Definitive editions at least didn't introduce a ton of broken items, it just kept old ones in....

Speaking of just this ""Definitive Edition"" and not GTA itself, the game is trash. Textures do not line up(you can see through the map, you can fall into the map(both on foot and in cars) in numerous locations. The climbing animation is broken which didn't happen in the original game. You swim 5 ft out of the water before it notices and drops you back into the water like you jumped in. Cars are programmed to turn left from the right lane and right from the left lane. Textures are as bad as the memes make them out to be. They did absolutely no CPU optimization as it will not load in textures more than a block away so it's just ugly textures everywhere when flying. Stealing cars just stops mid car jacking 50% of the time.

As we all know, Rockstar Games has been aggressively cracking down on mods in order to compel people to purchase Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. After almost two decades since the release of the three games, has Rockstar Games suddenly remembered that mods are a copyright infringement? No, they have done this to force players to purchase three games that are outdated and full of bugs! Who in their right mind would pay $60 for three games that are outdated and full of bugs?

And let’s not forget about the Rockstar Games Launcher, a substandard software that is plagued with glitches and only permits reinstallation. It is 100 times more frightening than EA's Origin! If you encounter any issues, can you contact Rockstar Games customer service? Unfortunately, there is no assistance available, and you cannot even locate contact information on their website.

My fellow players, we deserve better from Rockstar Games. We deserve to play without interruptions and have access to the mods we choose. It is time to let Rockstar Games know that their actions are unacceptable. We must unite and fight for our right to play the game we love.

We are GTA players, united we stand for our right to play!

As I've been learning lately from some other games I've first played years ago, it's often not a great idea to go back after so long. The game is over eighteen years old, and despite the new coat of paint, it really shows. The gameplay is incredibly outdated, the production quality, which was pretty good for its time as I recall it, is nowhere near the standards Rockstar have set since. The characters are a big cliche, the ""gangsta"" setting went out of fashion years ago and isn't really worth revisiting (while settings like the age of pirates, knights, samurai's and cowboys continue to appeal, there's nothing ""romantic"" or otherwise redeeming about ""gangsta's"" if you ask me, although 14 year old me would probably have disagreed)... 

It might seem appealing to buy 3(!!) full GTA games for ""only"" 30 euro/dollar on sale, or 60 off sale, you might think you can get hundreds of hours of fun for that relatively small amount of money, and that's the exact logic I had when buying this.

However if you are experiencing this game for the first time, proceed with purchasing but just know that these games haven't been shown love or attention needed to make them enjoyable. I still prefer the welcomed upgrades in this edition over the original games so I will continue to play this version.

Some of these reviews on GTA San Andreas are extreme left or right. They either have a troll comment with a positive recommendation given or they are hating on the game without balance or explanation. Which is IRONIC because they have given bad reviews but their playtime is extremely lengthy. I'm here to provide a balanced review with some details of what you will enjoy and what issues you will face.

Full Review:
I have been playing San Andreas for the last few weeks and I have noticed so many bugs from the beginning of my play-through. These bugs are not game breaking (meaning you can progress through the story) but rather a disappointment to this majestic title. Let me explain.

The game looks visually pleasing and the upgraded textures are a welcome. The new weapon wheel, radio wheel, world lighting, controller support, mission restart and fake building interiors are much welcomed to allow this game to feel modernised. Which is why I would always prefer this game over the original but it is a real shame that Rockstar  put such little effort to bring these 3 titles to a polished standard even after Grove Street Games (a mobile game developer) had failed to release these games in a playable state. GSG is not at fault because they are a small team who did their best to execute and meet the given deadlines to launch these games. Rockstar decided to give these classic, nostalgic and generation defining games to a team who is incapable of being able to serve these games the attention and level of skill required to bring them to modern standard. It really frustrates fans who love these games and want to experience their glory once again 20 years later.

In this section of my review I will go through some of the issues that still exist in this game. Before I start, these are my PC Specs:

CPU Ryzen 7 7700x
GPU RX 6950 XT
I am playing the game on MAX settings
I play on a 34"" Ultra Wide monitor (21:9 aspect ratio)

Issues:

*edit:*
There are 3 game impacting things which no body has really mentioned online or in reviews:

- You cannot shoot/snipe someone out of their vehicle. There's an invisible glass that wont break. You also cant shoot someone off their bike. If they are in a vehicle it is almost as if they are safe from all bullets. Some missions need you to shoot people off bikes and now you need to blow up the whole vehicle to kill them.

- I play and switch between Keyboard & Mouse and Controller. When I use KBM, I notice that it is EXTREMELY difficult to look upwards and downwards EVEN if i increase my DPI and in-game sensitivity settings. This issue and the issue above were not present in the original game which makes it even more frustrating.

- The last thing is related to LOD which is an extension of my point below. Whilst driving, if you spin your camera around to look back and then spin it back to look ahead, cars near by will stay but cars at a moderately close distance will disappear. If you press the scroll wheel (or R3 on controller) to look back no cars disappear. The fact that this even happens is disappointing.

*end edit*

-LOD (level of detail) especially at a distance is awful. Buildings look like a mount of clay. Then as you get closer it will load in correctly in higher LOD.

-Perfomance stutters every once in a while. I play on 165hz and it is smooth for the most part but a few stutters happen randomly.

-21:9 ultrawide screen is supported but sometimes the HUD (heads up display) is adjusted perfectly and other times it is stretched or miss placed. The cutscenes will have black bars (reasonable) but sometimes the cutscene is more to the right making the left black bar thick and right black bar thin.

-Fences + thick bushes which split the road in two, do not cause collision upon contact. You will walk/drive right through them.

- The fog isn't significant to allow similar feeling to original title. It barely exists and you can see the whole 3 cities from the Maze Tower. Disappointing because the fog added a level of mystery to the far distance and made the map feel bigger. Now it feels weird seeing how small the map is when in reality it isn't that small.

-On a lot of roads especially motorways, there are weird pop up textures from below the ground. They look like palm leaves in shape and car tires in texture.

-When destroying lamp posts or traffic light poles, they will fall straight through the ground.

-Lighting in cutscenes sometimes can be too dark so some characters cant be seen. Most cutscenes look exceptional however.

- Limited amount of cars on motorways and sometimes not a lot of NPC's in areas where the original game had plenty.

-CJ's hand misplacement-  for example when using the gym tools, riding a motorbike or when drinking soda.

-Certain character facial expressions and textures look poorly designed.

-When you are driving and passing buidlings, details continously pop up even though I am playing on Max settings. This is extremely frustrating especially for vegetation that pops up because there are so many more loading in real time rather than at a distance.

-The radio wheel and weapon wheel lack colour, distinction and personality

-The aiming/aim assist system is so bad. They should've used the aim assist from gta 5 which can allow you to free aim if you want. Rather than having it as either always a free aim OR always strong aim assist.

-Some fan favourite & nostalgic radio tracks have been removed.

-THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME IS NO CO-OP HOT SPOTS :(

If i remember more I will add them but these are my main complains. I have been on a roller coaster of hope, disappointment and then back to the realisation that these games will most likely never be touched again.

Sad when you realise that Rockstar could have done so much more to the games that have filled so many childhood memories. These 3 games literally set the industry standard for open world and they still hold up even after 20 years.

Rockstar to cut off the hand that fed them is truly a shame.

I hope my review has been helpful.

- Emmet cutscene has lots of camera shakiness.
- Game crashed about 24x throughout 64 gameplay hours
- Changes to the stats bar don't always appear on screen, although at times the sound does trigger, regardless.
- The design of the green jeans from Binco was something only an unsupervived machine learning algorithm could love!
- Some chains clip through clothes or skin. No painful expression noted.
- Saved games don't have a visible timestamp, which is trivial to implement.
- The bass boost car upgrade actually lowers the radio volume.
- Denise's gun runs out of bullets at just the right time. Wasted.
- The whole house doesn't experience an earthquake, as it did in the original during coffee time. Must be a bug.
- The fence near the Angel Pine ambulance has no collision.
- Saved games not loading at times.
- Woozie freezes during his first mission at his HQ.
- Shadows from buildings move in janky increments and not smoothly over time. Like your great-grandparents' old clocks.
- Visual snow-like artifacts appear while swimming for no reason.
- Snakehead mission had such dark sections it made the whole mission unbearable. 
- Tempenny can now stretch his neck beyond acceptable biological limits. For a human, at least.
- The driving school has a checkpoint system but the boat school does not. Thankfully, the latter also crashes more than the former.
- FPS dips are common in heavily illuminated areas.
- The game sometimes decides to give CJ white shorts instead of his regular trousers. Likely to occur after the loss of his suit due to a hospital or police station visit. 
- CJ's character and clothes at times turn to black upon loading a saved game file. Going into the changing room fixes this.

TLDR: 10/10 if the Rockstar money men ever decide to fix this gem. Till then, keep rocking and/or listening to Playback FM ;))",1680147488,1680147488,True,51,16,0.788157224655151367,9,True,False,False

b*tch can't even launch R* social club, 90 minutes mark on playtime record, while the whole 60 minutes itself was me trying to launch the sh*t*y rockstar launcher.

after being able to run the social club, the game still can't be played due to failed on verifying game ownership, and even after the verify is success the games keep crashing with no f*c*ing reason during loading screen or even in the middle of gameplay.
even without problems that i have mention above, the game is still a big disappointment, since the optimization of this game was really bad, it's kinda hard to enjoy the game when the framerate keep dropping with no reason.
c'mon man, i mean im able to run latest game that has better graphics with decent fps and got no performance issues, but look at what i got with this remastered is a performance issue, technical issue, network issue LOL.

tbh my expectation isn't that high, since i already knew that the games isn't heavily remastered or even a remake, but hey at least make the games optimized.
the only reason i bought this remastered is because i wanted to replay the games, so that i'll be able to feel the similliar experience that i have ever experienced as a kid playing the og ones, but with a slight improvement on the graphics and gameplay in it.

The character models are by far some of the worst of this generation. Where the game had perfectly fine low-quality LOD meshes for distant buildings, SADE introduces absolutely horrible decimated meshes that look like the stuff of dreadful fever dreams with triangles jutting out in all directions, done through automation. The world has no fog or cloud haze or depth, so when you're flying a plane, you can see that the map is 10km wide and can see to very ends of the San Andreas state (!) up to the edge of the sea, visibly a mere water volume, where the game fades into a volume trigger (which respawns you back into water if you swim to it) beyond which there is nothing. Where the game previously had acceptably good (not just for the time!) cloud cover, this game has none on low detail modes for low power devices like Steam Deck. There is no excuse for not supporting a basic level of fidelity in a remaster at low option modes.

There are no major bugs, no show-stoppers, and everything is in line with the revision done for the mobile port, but there are numerous physics bugs now and ped despawning for some reason still happens 17 years after release. It's again badly optimized, with streaming of geometry and assets at 60FPS presenting consistent and repeatable stuttering on low-power devices such as Steam Deck. However the game basically looks uglier than any other version and still does not match PS2-grade post effects. 

Since GTASA is no longer available in its original form, I'm again disinclined to hit this with a flat No, because there will likely never again be a re-release of GTASA in its OG engine (remember Star Wars Special Edition?) and so this is the way people growing up in 2023 and born after 2023 will experience the game.

- Complete bullshit camera controls, it's not enough that they are controller based, in vehicles, the up/down axis is slowed to like 10%...
- They introduced a bug that gives enemies 100% hit-scan acurracy, so this remaster is on hard as f*** difficulty all the time. Combined with the camera controls....
- Most characters look like complete crap, the old low polly versions were way better.
- The plane/heli controls. Good luck with them.
- Doesn't have the full radio soundtracks...

I brought this game in the hopes that I would get back the fun I had as a kid and for a while I was having fun.. 

Then I got to the gang wars and found a lot of the issues, so to those who don't know if you do 12 ""side missions"" in a cop car, fire truck, ambulance and a taxi (plus some others) the game gives you permanent bonuses i.e (cops = more armour with bullet proof vests and fire truck = no fire damage) but during these missions I found that going from level 8 to 9 nothing will load and your timer will slowly count down to 0 and you will FAIL! 

I had this happen several times with all the missions except the taxi ones. So pushing through that and trying to get my step above the other gangs I managed to finish them all (I did rage quit 7 separate times because the cops while doing police missions will come after you and ignore the people shooting at you, I was taken out by a cop car so many times its beyond a joke, if you stop the bike and try and hide the cops will just appear where your not looking!). So I got all my bonuses and then tried to do the gang wars... 

The AI is worse then I remember! I have the original GTA SanAndreas and the AI for your gang members isn't this bad, a lot of the times if not all the time your gang when not in a car will just stare at you and get killed, the other gangs have AK47s and SMGs and your gang have basic bitch pistols, bring 6 gang members you say? Well that's fine it'll be to much for the game to handle and 2 of the 6 will just stop moving all together. 

The ""bad"" gang path finding is also something else, you can simple walk around the block and the bad guys will walk to the other side of the city to path back to you, but if you leave the war zone you start it all again because ""You left""! I honestly really tried with this game and I had lots of fun up until this point but I really don't want to keep trying to play core parts of the game if it's this broken, I'll never be able to use my own gang to help cause a lot of the time the aren't even good for meat shields, the cops and other gangs will just spawn on you and every time you pause the game you will have to deal with a good 5 second studder before your game starts running correctly again.",1674558662,1675474606,False,50,0,0.690925657749176025,1,True,False,False

 My problems with the current state even after completing the main story.

Cons

1.  Throughout you WILL have to end up replaying some of the missions multiple times from the AI all of a sudden having a hive mind and all of a sudden they can all lazer you and you will die super quick especially on the early parts of the game. 

2. The achievements are busted. I have tried multiple times attempting to upgrade my armor in the game for those really hard missions at the beginning of the game but every time I would get to 10/12 for the mission it would stop spawning the criminals therefore making it impossible to complete.  I have also attempted basketball achievement to simply shoot at least 30 points in one session which could take literally minutes to complete and gone well over the limit to not get the achievement; which would prompt me to go reload my file and try again only to not be able to get the achievement no matter what I do. This is only a few of my experiences trying to get some of these achievements despite all odds the game just will not give it to you.

3. There are bugs of enemies once in a while spawning into stuff and being able to still shoot you or just not being there at all to begin with. Despite my best effort for it being a classic to me personally it can be really annoying sometimes for this being called the ""definitive edition"".

4. The cloud save is buggy sometimes. When I switch from my PC to my Steam Deck sometimes with cloud saving on I will not get the same states of where I was switching to a different system and losing saves and having to restart hellish missions that will make you want to commit a toaster bath 

Pros

1. It runs great on the steam deck and doesn't take too much battery so you can play it for a couple hours before you really need to start figuring out where your going to charge it. 

2. Even though when the game first came out the facial animations were really goofy they did fix it up a bit and  even though it isn't perfect, it has that old ps2 charm that I remember back in the day that really is a great experience playing.

3. Its got lots of things you can do and the humor in the game is hilarious especially playing this as a adult vs being a kid growing up now realizing how vulgar this game really was.

Verdict

The game still is a great time to play but it really does need more tweaks and needs way more support from Grove Street games and Rockstar for trying to push this game out at its state for a full price. If your going to pick this game up id 100% wait till its at LEAST 50% off for its current state

100% completed over 74 hrs.... 8/10 remaster....

Steady 60fps @2k max settings ( Same on GTA 3 & VC )  ( In few area's around LS and red county got 30fps
like something was loading or trying to... After leaving the area went back to 60 ) 
No stutters
Textures looks great compared to OG version 
2 Crash in 74hrs 

First off glad they got rid of that awful yellow fog from the OG Version now you can see everything... ( same in GTA 3 LC ) 

For the most part had a bug free playthrough and god i missed playing SA... Feature packed game from floor to ceiling. I have another version of it on the R* Launcher don't know if its the OG one, ( got it for free ) But i tried  playing it and couldn't, just because of its outdated textures.. I've always struggled with replaying games that old...  

I had a couple of crashes not doing anything other than just walking down the street with this one, And few times on VC i kept hearing explosions in the distance.. On SA it was more profound and soon figured that it was planes and heli's crashing into buildings.... And some cars spawning in buildings and blowing up.. 

Another bug that i ran into was save game icons in game would bug out, And either not open the menu to save or disappear but this only happened around second island and stopped when i progressed to the third island 
(work around i used.. Was try other save game icons from properties i bought or start a mission and get an autosave ) 

In some area's got mass frame drops and would hang till i left the area.. One was in Los Santos near the grave of Brian and Mom...( just the street block around the graveyard ) the other just to the right of a girlfriends farm in red county the only place's where frames would drop and hang @30fps..... 

GTA Trilogy DE Review 

All three games are enjoyable and great to revisit.. Tho rough around the edges..   

I've seen some of the videos of the first launch on R* a year ago and yeah it didn't go well  lol and can understand why many feel the way they do.. textures not lining up, spelling mistakes, low quality fps etc... 

But its clear that most of this has been cleaned up..  few bugs may remain but i didn't notice or run into those bugs at least any that are not from the OG Versions of the games 

With the remaster we lost a lot of music, And in SA in seems to be more profound than in VC... Few station only have couple of songs left and was running into the same song over and over again... 

From what i seen in the discussion tab for GTA SA... Its said that a mod will restore or you can drag old files into this one.. you will have to look it up for that... Its a shame but was to be expected in any remaster/remake. 

But am not gonna sit and cry about it or demand Rockstar do something about it.. I have a PC with internet browser and youtube with ad blocker just simple typed in GTA radio stations and what you know i have the old station again...  

If you really want to see what GTA was like 20yrs ago go get a PS2 and copies of the games bang that S^:T on. 
Its truly the only way to enjoy what we did back in the day.. and you will get cramp in your hand from the tiny PS2 controllers haha 

Still glad i ignored the neg reviews and just tried it for myself with steams great 2hr return policy ( cough cough Ubisoft) felt safe to give it a whirl. Should point out that all GTA games thrive on bad reviews and bad publicity and those that bought the game and refund just to leave a neg review.. were/are the cause of the game going up in the steam charts... talk about counter productive hahahahaha dumba$$


Totally worth full price... But like i said any game in a sale is a bargain.....

It was pretty cool to play this throwback of a game with RTX. I enjoyed it enough to complete it 100%, but I would still advise purchasing this game while it's on sale, as there is a moderate amount of bugs and janky controls for a remastered game. I think the game crashed on me a total of 5 times throughout the 80+ or so hours I played. Personally it doesn't bother me as much as some others. I can almost guarantee you It'll happen at least once to everyone. Lastly, the unrendered textures are still very much so prominent at times, especially outside Los Santos, I mainly refer to Red County and San Fierro in particular. It felt like I was playing the game on Ps2 and not in a nostalgic matter (The annoying is my Ps2 going to visit mars kind of matter). 

Regardless, it was a good use of $44AUD while I got some free time. Now to play the the other 2. I don't know if I'll 100% them. I only did this GTA because it is my favourite out of the franchise. We will see :)",1675262314,1675262314,True,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Lighting
Draw distance 
More diverse NPC's
Better textures (In most cases) 
Radio wheel
Weapons wheel
More details in certain places (Garages, graffiti on walls etc) 


Cons:

Annoying mobile controls (Lifting weights, sprinting, riding bicycle, using hydraulics, flying, lowrider minigame is really easy and simplified)
The characters looks like jelly. (Riding bikes, in cutscenes etc) 
Clothes (EX: Green jeans has the texture sideways it seems. Looks horrible) 
Ghost fences. (You can clip through them while driving) 
Destroying traffic lights and lamp posts makes them fall through the ground
Looking around with mouse feels weird and slow (the camera tries to center when you look around) 
Most characters looks off (babyface, doll'ish) 
Horrible LOD's

Overall it is playable but many bugs (mostly minor) here and there slowly annoys you more and more over time. 
It's not usual Rockstar quality. I'd say get it only on sale. Or not. It's your money. 

EDIT:

I have now completed the game and found several other bugs and annoying stuff:

Transfender and Wheel Arch Angels are missing several tuning options on different cars. You can still select the options in the menu but it is invisible on the car/changes nothing. 
Wheel Arch Angels parts can change color after storing in garage. 
When buying food you can't see the health bar.
The Stat messages can often not be seen. You can hear the sound of stat message but can't see what is actually changing. (Ex: muscle, respect, girlfriend progress, skills etc) 
When exiting a vehicle you can't leave the door open anymore.
I have had my car go up in flames and explode several times after running a ped over even though the car wasn't damaged at all. 
The jetpack controls are really dumb. Increasing and decreasing thrust is with the mouse which is also used for aiming and shooting so you cant really shoot when flying jetpack. So alternative strats must be used during green goo. 

All in all the game looks really good on the surface especially the lighting and vehicles. You can complete it as well but will find many (mostly minor) annoyances along the way.

We would go over to my friends house literally every day after school with my PS2 copy of San Andreas and all the cheat codes written down on a piece of paper inside my backpack.

And it is for this reason, that these three Remakes are so disappointing. The original 3D-Trilogy of the Grand Theft Auto series did not only make my, but other childhoods as well. Not only that, but it also put Rockstar Games on the map for decades to come. You would certainly think that they would put some love into these three games especially, but they instead decided to hand the work to an under-staffed studio, which does not seem to have a single bit of love or care for the original titles. These games should have gotten the Rockstar treatment we have gotten used to: In-house development and a care for the tiniest of details.

Now, are these Remakes really that bad? No, not at all. All three titles look amazing with the new skyboxes, volumetric clouds, dynamic lights, upgraded models and AI-enhanced textures. But this is the bare minimum that they could have put into these games anyways, because underneath the new Unreal-Renderer there are still the old codebases running. This could have very well been a free update to the existing, older titles, as a gesture of good-will for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI or a tie-in event in GTA: Online. Yet, they decided to sell the Trilogy at full price, while they didn't even put a meaningful amount of resources into this project.

While I do realize that Grove Street Games (WarDrum Studios) is at fault here, it is not fair to give Rockstar Games a pass on this, like most GTA fans seem to do. They had to have at least taken a look onto these games and given the final green light to make this release happen. This makes them just as guilty for how bad these ports are.

And to withhold other remakes and updates for the PC version of RDR2, just because the reception to the Definitive Edition Trilogy wasn't as good as they had expected (deservingly) seems really petty and embarassing on Rockstar's part. And it is for all of these reasons, that I cannot recommend this game, while I do enjoy the new visuals, which will make the Trilogy viable for another decade.",1675101646,1675101646,False,113,4,0.833174347877502441,13,True,False,False

If you are looking for better lighting, graphics and shadows. This version of the game is awesome. I am also enjoying the Achievements for the game. Unfortunately that is where it ends.

The game is lacking so many features that made the old version great.

- Light poles do not have collision detection and sink through the road. Sometimes cars (including my own) drive straight through them.
- Collisions on some objects are a little buggy - the weighting for these gameobjects seem off and causes rubberbanding type physics
- The gym and other minigames are taken from the mobile version and its nowhere near as challenging/nerfed - you can pickup the heaviest weights from the beginning
- Streetlights or building lights do not emit light at night nor is there any kind of atmospheric moonlight - it is a very dark map, especially at night
- the combat system for controllers is janky - free aim is not smooth at all
- Some character models dont capture the original look
- Theres a fair bit of stuttering throughout the game
- Missing classic soundtrack that made the radio great. Including songs from LoveFist which is just strange

I applied for a refund but I had spent too much time with the game, I was keen on the achievements for it however the older version has a far more comprehensive environment and physics - not to mention things like ragdoll mods etc and basic QOL.

Will update as this progresses. If you can get your hands on the classic steam version via third party redeem code I'd activate the old game that way. 

Could not recommend this version in its current state.

UPDATE: 9hrs to 12hrs

I have continued with the game and progressed into the countryside/county area

The roads have holes in them where the texture/meshing does not connect to the next section of road or grass. I tried to walk over them to see if I would fall through the map, this did not happen however it looks like some kind of patched over collider has been placed over the top as a band aid solution. Quite bizarre.

The animation/characters continue to get worse as the game progresses but I am dealing with it for now.

The countryside at night is INCREDIBLY dark. The is no atmospheric lighting at night and some areas are almost pitch black bar the lights from your car. I do not know if this is on purpose but in one scenario I lost my car in the bush and had no clue where I was.

It seems as if they did not expect me to play this far into the game.

I played a mission with a combine/harvester that you steal from a farm, the mechanics when running over a hay bail were appauling, sending the hay bail object flying down the map at high speed for  it to sink into the world map. The harvester does not eat up the hay like it used to.

I would almost argue this was for better performance however I find that even on my 3080 with DLSS on, some areas I am getting a severe FPS dip. I just doesnt quite make sense at the moment.

I don't think this version of the game is bad but it's neither good nor a definitive edition. For every improvement that's in the game, there's something that's equally worse than the original PC release (which in turn has differences to the PS2 release).

This certainly isn't a bad way to play the game but it leaves a lot to be desired. There's not been any major patches to the definitive edition for a long time with the last coming almost a year before it's Steam release. I think the implementation of the checkpoint system into missions is a perfect summary of the wider games. There's a few missions in which it's perfectly implemented and you checkpoint at very logical locations but most missions have a poor implementation that's basically just making you replay entire mission chunks that happened 10 minutes before I got wasted/busted.

Calling myself sick at work for a few days. Locked the door, phone off, big bag of weed next to me...Those were the days.  So i had my doubts, but for me this is the game I got most excited by in my whole life. I wanted to go to bed last night, but I bought it and installed it. Over 18 GB game instead of the 700 mb it was back in the days. When I started, it felt like a trip back to memory lane. The graffics looks so good. They really didn't lie it has the GTA 5 engine. It plays like a game of these days. After 2 hours playing San Andreas I already can recommend this for the old school players. I don't know how it feels if you never played it.

The different coloured clothing for pedestrians and some cut content for character clothes for gangs and peds has been added here. The reflections on cars also is worth a mention as well as some other small details like the explosion ash on the floor from blown up cars. Everything else about it is an absolute mess which I don't need to mention really do I? You all know what's wrong with it like the facial features looking like Sims 4 models but whatever.

You may think that's hyperbole with all of the garbage releases in recent years (Halo: MCC, Assassin's Creed: Unity, Cyberpunk 2077, etc.), but I'm totally sincere. Here's a long list of everything I can think of that this game does poorly, as well as the mistakes made by Rockstar and co. themselves.

-Playstation players got unintended early access, meanwhile PC players had to wait days to play it after a few hours after launch with no explanation of why or when it would come back until the day before it finally did. Why? They left assets in the game code they didn't want public. Not just a few things, but a ton. If that doesn't speak to how amateur this project is, I don't know what does.
-The game released in an inexcusably abysmal state:
-This game is chock full of bugs. 
-The atmospheres of these games are ruined. Instead of GTA III's distinctly moody vibe, served by its blue tone and unusual soundscape, you have an ugly, grey, bland and overly dark visual backed by extremely muffled audio that sounds significantly worse than the original PC release. Instead of SA's sunny, orange hue, you have a generic artstyle. VC suffers from many of the problems found in the other two games, but it always had a vivid, larger than life aesthetic, and so the cartoony models and exaggerated colours don't look totally out of place.
-As a general statement about the artstyles of these games, they look too cartoony. This now seems to be purposeful, unlike the original games which only looked cartoony as a result of their limited technology and not due to an intended style. Now that we have better tech, there's no reason outside of budget and developmental constraints that they shouldn't look as realistic as they were originally intended to be. Colours are too vivid and the lighting gives everything a plastic, glossy look (characters look like action figures).
-Ambient occlusion is too strong, making the games look ridiculously dark at times - especially in cutscenes. Turning it off however makes the game look flat and outdated.
-Misaligned and ill fitting textures everywhere.
-Performance is dreadful. Why does a game from 2001, which looks worse in many areas than its original release, run significantly worse than brand new games built from the ground up released in 2023?
-""Improved combat"" is a lie. The auto aim isn't even as snappy as the controller input (GInput) mod for the original versions of the games. The only thing they did to improve it was allow you to move while firing some weapons and add a weapon wheel. Wow. Incredible.
-Missing music from the original games - a lot of it. Hardly ""definitive"", is it? You're a multi-billion dollar company. You make more in a year from GTA: Online than most game developers and publishers ever see. I'm certain you could've afforded to re-license some songs, cheapskates... just as I'm sure you could've afforded to hire more than some mobile developers to remaster the games that got you where you are today.
-Censorship: GTA III, and to a lesser extent, GTA VC's heavy dismemberment, made killing so satisfying. Now there are just occasional decapitations. Why?
-Rockstar exclusive for a year with no announcement that it would come to any other platform until it randomly appeared a week or so ago on Steam. Why? They didn't want people waiting to purchase it on Steam. They wanted us to buy it on the Rockstar Game Launcher. Exclusives suck as is, but most publishers at least tell players ahead of time they they're limited exclusives. Rockstar didn't want to do this.
-Misspellings everywhere due to AI upscaling. These should've been impossible to miss.
-Again the audio is horrendous. Why does everything sound so muffled?
-III and particularly VC have the worst AI I've ever seen in video games, regardless of era. Unbelievably, they're even WORSE now.
-Broken collision and geometry. Fall through maps, hit invisible fences, etc.
-The occasional clunkiness of the original games' movement hasn't been resolved.
-Minor but still noticeable and offensive changes to gameplay - both done on purpose and things overlooked.
-AI upscaled textures are the bane of modern modding and game development, from a consumer's point of view. I have no idea why anyone thinks these look good. I've yet to see a single example of upscaled textures, outside of ultra low resolution pixel art that looks like anything other than a grainy, fake mess. This game's full of them.
-The radar now has a GPS for mission objectives that you can't turn off. This is a nice addition as an option, but the maps are small enough so as to not warrant it for me personally, and so I'd rather be able to use the minimap to plan my route myself on the fly without being guided the whole way through. It's a difficult thing to ignore. Honestly, this is one of my biggest gripes with this release even though I appreciate what they were trying to do. Is it really that hard to just add an option to disable it, though? GTA IV and V have this option.
-A full year later and almost nothing has changed. It's been a year since we've had a sizeable update.
-No separate sensitivity settings for vehicles and on-foot.
-Rockstar and Grove Street Games were dismissive in attitude towards their massive failure, adding further insult to injury. The fake apologies were late, too.
-You can't buy the games separately... despite launching and downloading them separately. Why? Because Rockstar knows nostalgia is a powerful tool and that people will pay the full price of admission for even one of these games. People can rightfully bag 343i all they want, but when they re-released the Halo games on Steam, they didn't force you to buy all of them at once. They allowed you to buy each of the six games contained by themselves, paying only $11AUD for each. THAT's good customer service and business practise. What Rockstar have done here is spit in your face.
-Even for 3 remastered games, regardless of how well they released, $90AUD is a lot to charge.
-Camera modes are weird. They're either too close or too far. No in between. I don't have this problem with the originals or other Rockstar games.
-Auto view centering is really annoying. Please let us turn it off.
-Even the desktop/Steam icons look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dreadful.
-The price is much higher in some regions because Rockstar are idiots.
-Some achievements are mission specific, and given that you can't replay individual missions, if you miss it the first time then you have to restart the entire game just to get to the point where you can earn the achievement again. Some of these are ""secret"" achievements, too. The developers realise these are incredibly long games, right?
-The difficulty of these games have been decreased in specific missions for the sake of bad players.

I'm a complete and utter moron and so I bought these on Steam (I refunded them on Rockstar when I bought them on launch). I love these games so much and even if they're inferior versions, having an excuse to replay them by getting all the achievements was incentive enough for me to buy them at half price. I'm also delusional enough to hold onto hope that they may be fixed one day. In other words, I'm a total sucker, and that's exactly how these companies get away with treating us like crap: because suckers like me will still buy them despite causing a fuss. This negative review won't do anything to prevent this garbage collection from being a top seller, and why bother to fix it when despite being upset about it, I'm still going to buy all future GTA titles? They don't have any reason to. I don't really know what point I'm trying to make... I just want to acknowledge the irony of me paying for these pieces of crap while complaining that they're pieces of crap. It isn't lost on me and I am part of the problem. Hopefully you won't be and you'll either pirate this ♥♥♥♥ or just play something more worth your time.",1674378313,1674451757,False,51,4,0.703829526901245117,0,True,False,False

Is it more fun than the original? No, the graphics make it look more eye-candy like, but that's about it, they did add extra variety to each individual pedestrian, which is a lovely detail.
As you may or may not be aware, this game is full of bugs that the original did not have. The original did have a few bugs, but for the most part they were very few in-between and harder to encounter than the ones found in this ""Definitive Edition"".
You cannot have custom music like in the original game by dropping music to a folder (the custom radio has been removed, from a 2004 game that HAD it...)
The camera is non-functional. (With the old camera, whenever you took pictures, those would save as in-game screenshots in a folder in your PC). You can take pictures with it, but no picture will be saved to your PC.
Still, having Steam achievements is nice I guess...
Is it fun? Yeah, can be.
Is it better than the original? Definitely NO. This is supposed to be a ""Definitive Edition"", but it has greatly failed, at the bare minimum, a Definitive Edition should have as few bugs as possible, and even though more bugs have been fixed than when the game came out, it's still full of them. Not only that, but it has had features replaced entirely or, much worse yet, completely removed or not working correctly.
Sometimes your feet will sink in some surfaces, pedestrians sometimes sit on the wrong part of a seat. (Easiest to see in benches by the beach in Los Santos)
In short; You can play this version of GTA San Andreas if you want, but the only worthy thing about it is that you get achievements on Steam and that it looks kinda prettier in most cases. If I were you I'd hesitate to buy this product unless its price is really lowered, I bought the Trilogy on a 50% sale and the value of the product is not really reflected well with the level of care, which is probably why when GTA VI comes out, I'll be extra hesitant to pick it up. (As I was with this product at first, I only ended up adquiring it since they did fix some of the bugs and put it on Steam, as well as put it on sale.)
It is also disappointing that despite all the resources they have nowadays as a company, they couldn't bother to for instance, bring PS2 co-op mode or something of the sorts.
Was it so hard, Rockstar? Because I do not think so.
I even got stuck at the pool game inside of the bar near Grove Street. (It all got stuck, extremely glitchy!)
Same can be said about the basketball mini-game too.
All in all, it's a fun experience, but for the price they're asking? Not worth it AT ALL. Enough said. Pick it up at your own discretion, and ONLY during a sale.",1674436556,1674437282,False,226,5,0.89701610803604126,0,True,False,False

The visuals are very bizarre, and just look very strange. The textures were clearly upscaled without actually looking at them, and the models can be very strange as well. This may just be my opinion, but the game just looks so strange. I somewhat got used to it, but never fully.

Many cutscenes seemed to have issues, with characters walking into walls. Lampposts and streetlights would fall into the ground when you hit them with a car, which could be in the original game as well, but it's still strange.

The performance was not good. This was clearly not optimized very well. (I would like to note that I played on linux, so maybe some of these are not the games fault, but I doubt that from what others are saying.) Sometimes after finishing a mission or just going into the menu, the game would drop to about 20 fps and stay around there for a while before suddenly returning to 60. There were also some stutters as well.

The worst part about this is that we can no longer buy the original trilogy on steam, so we are stuck with the defective editions. I would not recommend this, even for 50% off and certainly not $60.

So, yeah, it's fantastic to be able to play the older GTA's in wdescreen on a modern computer with improved graphics and high frame rate. The originals all have issues, ranging from lack of proper widescreen support (GTA 3 and Vice City), or mouse issues (San Andreas). So, the Definitive Edition is the way to go on modern computers.

The performance also is kind of laughable when you look at what this is.

The game runs well on ultra settings, although it does stutter at certain times, however, there's no FPS cap so it's super smooth most of the time. So far I haven't encountered any bugs.

I own the original edition on Steam, so when this was first released, I redownloaded it and played it. After all, mods can do everything this game did and more right? Well, I found modding this game to be a bit troublesome. I would have numerous issues, either with the gamepad mods to work with certain missions, such as the lowrider mission or even just using hydraulics in general. Other times, I would start missions and my game would instantly crash, like the missions OG Loc gives you after the bike chase. I would scour gtaforums and Reddit and other things to find fixes to these issues but would often spend more time troubleshooting issues than actually enjoying the game. Or, with an unlocked frame rate, I would be unable to use the treadmill unless I went and edited the FPS back to 30. I just had a bunch of weird issues like that. Ultimately, that's just a thing that happens when you try to play older games on newer OS's and hardware. In some cases they are kind of tricky to get working just right.

I don't have any of those issues in this game. 

There are also so many other good QOL changes they made in this game. For instance, in the original, scrolling through menus at Burger Shot was annoying because you had to press the button to see each next food item individually. Now there is a list. You can instantly replay missions after failing them, unlike before where you had to drive all the way back to mission start each and every time. The controller support is good, there's a weapon wheel, unlocked framerate that has none of the issues I mentioned above and more.

Is it a perfect remake? No way. The new textures look...weird. On max settings, some things look surprisingly good, but on weird blocky textures and it just doesn't look right. The original game with graphics mods does feel better, in my opinion. Also the way in which Rockstar rolled this game out originally is really bad, and there was no quality control at all. It's also a shame they didn't release this on Steam with a new patch that would fix issues other people are having. You also can't rebind buttons on the controller (shame).

But overall, I think comparing the two experiences, I have had a better time with this version of the game then trying to deal with the modded version, with all it's issues framerate issues and crashing. I'm actually playing it and having fun this time rather than messing with .ini files, hoping to find an answer for an issue on the internet, or playing for several hours only to have a mission crash the game any time you are trying to start it.

Would recommend (on sale of course).",1674253542,1674253542,True,7,6,0.484632700681686401,0,True,False,False

It's because, like I stated in my GTA III DE review, these are based on the mobile ports and the mobile port of GTA SA is notoriously bad and this makes the experience even worse with the messed up textures, models, rigging, handling, new bugs and every other issue you can possibly think of. By far though, the one thing I absolutely hate is how the atmosphere is completely massacred in this one, every weather looks identical and it really lacks the charm the original had. While the original used far more outdated technologies, they were utilized with love and passion and because of that, they actually looked good. Here on the other hand, it almost feels like AI upscaling wasn't the only thing involved in the remaster, it feels like the AI remastered the entire game. I can't stress this out enough but don't buy these, unless they're really cheap or they end up getting fixed at some point. If you want to look at my other reviews, feel free to do so, as I talk about more of the problems in them and I don't want to repeat myself over and over again.

A spit in the face to the millions of fans who grew up with these (once upon a time) masterpieces. Completely butchered by a money-hungry company, which does not care about you and about the community.

After countless takedown notices of mods, lawsuits and complete neglect towards the fans... you can clearly see where the priorities of Rockstar Games and Take 2 Interactive lie... your wallet and pleasing the investors.

These ""remasters"" are very portly made, many new glitches and problems were introduced, all in the favor of graphics, which in same cases are worse, especially on the characters.

I am a content creator and that's the only reason I bought it both on RGL when it released for 60 euro and on Steam for 30 euro.

Unfortunately, it seems the game has not been patched for the Steam release. To me, the original versions are still way better in terms of stability and performance, and also atmosphere and art style. Yes, I know this has some fancy effects the originals didn't, and some of those features are great, but the vibe is gone. Los Santos doesn't seem sunny and hot, like it did in the originals, and the new character models are still completely terrible, even though Rockstar has had over a year to fix this.

With regards to the quality of the remastered trilogy, it seems there are two kinds of people:

Those who don't care and just enjoy the trilogy remaster despite some bugs or shortcomings. These will probably tell you that the game is perfectly fine, no bugs, no issues, and that the people complaining are just whiny idiots. If you are one of thee, good for you, enjoy the games!

...then there's those that would rather wait until the game hopefully gets some more patches. Many of these people will probably tell you the game is completely broken and unplayable.

Personally, I'll wait for patches or mods that fix the problems that are present right now. The animation glitches weird me out, I'm sad that San Andreas doesn't have the sunny vibes anymore, and I can't stand the weird gamepad-ish mouse controls, among other things.

I'll wait for a couple of days, and if a patch doesn't arrive, I'm probably going to refund this. Waay too many issues to justify this, even at a 50% discount.",1674155837,1674155837,False,172,4,0.811417698860168457,0,True,False,False
