Simple review details - I rank games on an out of 10 basis, granting up to 3 points in 3 categories, as well as a last, single point from my own self, depending on my experience with it.

GAMEPLAY

Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat-em-up, and it is somewhat 2D, somewhat 3D, but it struggles with its 3D field implementation, causing issues with hit detection and combat flow. The controls involve opportunities for movement, attacks, and interactions, overall emphasizing beat-em-up mechanics.

 While the game offers polished elements, such as the ability to stagger enemies and thus perform impressive combos, the addition of the third dimension complicates combat, leading to inconsistent interactions. The game introduces features like stat allocation, mounted combat, and unique pets, but falls short of addressing core issues, hindering the overall gameplay experience and preventing it from reaching its full potential.

PRESENTATION

This game is the internet‚Äôs culture from the haydays of flash, from the 2010s. It features visuals that are particularly distinct, drawing from the aesthetics of that aforementioned era, and looks fantastic. There‚Äôs humor, and it‚Äôs crass, and it  includes elements like poop, farts, and gore, reflecting the tone of content from platforms like Newgrounds. 

 The stylized look uses thick black lines to outline interactable elements, and the music and sound effects contribute to a very high-quality presentation. The story is conveyed through dialogue-free cutscenes with expressive animations. While the crass humor may not be universally appreciated, the overall quality of this thing, when it comes to how it is presented, is top-notch.
3/3

STORY

In this game, the Player, along with up to three friends, takes on the role of a knight (or a set of knights) partying in the barracks, when their celebration is abruptly interrupted. A stranger crashes in, dies, and reveals that the castle is under attack. The King's magical crystal has been stolen by a wizard-ish figure who is also abducting the king's daughters. The knights embark on a quest to save the princesses, recover the crystal, and face various challenges in different lands. The story is minimal, typical of flash games, serving a basic conceptual purpose.
1/3

Legendary Point

Does this game get the legendary point, so craved and wanted by all and none at the same time?

I am inclined to say yes , because this game truly reminds me of the glory days of flash, of those games with the beefy purple guy with a chainsaw cleaving through hundreds of goons, of this rampant age of obscurity filled with wonder and the unknown‚Ä¶ But at the same time I know better than to do that. While Castle Crashers is a near timeless remnant of that age, the age has come and gone, and it should not be the reason I approve of this game. So no, Castle Crashers does not get the Legendary Point. 0/1

CONCLUSION

6/10. Castle Crashers is a very good game to play with friends. It is also a decent game to play by oneself, but I'd only recommend it to fans of side-scrollers and beat-em-ups, as well as folks who were fans of flash games.

I tuck it under my belt, safe from the bag of mediocrity, but sporting more dust than is proper.

Too much of the combat is centered around enemies locking you down with ranged weapons keeping you from getting up by being on both sides of you at all times and always moving the perfect distance away when approaching them only to be shot in the back by another enemy. Other beat em ups don't pull schiesty crap like that and still offer a fun challenge and in this one ""trapping you"" underneath bullcrap like that is commonplace.  I love the character roster and there's a great many people to choose from and I would to have loved to play as so many of them....if they weren't all locked behind beating the game or playing Insane mode not counting the few you unlock behind arenas. There are over 30 characters in total and who in there right mind is beating this game over 10 times to unlock everyone? Ridiculous. Insane mode is a mode you unlock with the character you beat the game with. It makes the game harder and you unlock more weapons and characters through this mode. Im all for more difficulty but this mode doesn't even seem real and it should be a solid lesson what never to do as it doesn't offer proper challenge and seeks only to frustrate the player and artificially fatten the time you play it tremendously while not offering any sort of compensation or satisfaction that you had done anything at all. In Insane mode all enemies and bosses get 10X health and do 10X the damage except for a few select bosses because of they were beefed any more they would be too much. In order to survive Insane mode you must learn to permanently juggle and stay in the air permanently as you can be 2 hit by damn near EVERY enemy in the game now and some bosses will 1 shot you regardless of stats. All you can quaff did not make it from the original Castle Crashers wich is a bummer as I loved it and instead they replaced it with Back off Barbarian. A game mode where the timer goes slower than normal and you must survive board. The enemies get faster and faster as time goes on and it is fun and stressful but the mode ultimately just doesn't scratch that itch. All in all it is a game I will play again in the future with friends as I really do enjoy Behemoth's games but this one messed up in some serious ways.",1707891157,1707891157,False,1,0,0.4797687828540802,0,True,False,False

You will have to learn how to juggle enemies which is continuously hitting them in the air from side to side of the screen for the entirety of this mode for like 5 mins for every wave of enemies you encounter and thus making the game feel repetitive. the starting enemies could kill you in 3 hits even at a high level. if you don't want to put up with the bullsh*t of insane mode, have fun missing out on 1/2 of the playable characters.

[h3]Back Off Barbarian (BOB)[/h3]
this minigame is entirely optional and not required for progression of the main story. BOB is pretty fun but execution was bad. the timer runs at 0.9x speed compared to real time and the worst thing (for achievement hunters) is that there's an achievement requiring you to survive for 2:30 mins (2:47 real time) which is unexcusable.

Castle Crashers has many different characters to choose from. You can choose to play as an Ice Knight, a Fire Knight, a Love Knight and many, many more characters. Once you complete the game, you will unlock a new character depending on what character you beat the game with. With those newly unlocked characters, you can unlock even more characters by beating the game again which is why I said you'll be playing over and over again.

I will have a guide on my profile on how to unlock every character in the game. If your curious on how to, the link is right here:

Each Character has Magic, which are special abilities which vary from character to character. For example, the Lightning Knight will have lightning magic,  the Fire Knight will have Fire Magic and so on. Magic can be a very important part of this game, again depending on which character you play as. If you choose the Gray Knight, you'll probably not use magic much. But if you choose the Industrialist, magic is like the only thing you'll be using.

When playing Castle Crashers you'll find your character leveling up. Leveling up allows you to spend points you earn from leveling up towards a skill tree. The Skill Tree has 4 different paths to go down. Those Paths are Strength, Magic, Defense and Agility.

Strength is how much Damage Your Character does. 
Magic Allows you to deal more damage with said Magic and unlock new spells.
Defense Increases Your Hitpoints.
Agility Increases your speed and Archery skills.

Castle Crashers also utilizes items. Items will be very crucial to beating the game. One of those items being a bow. Your bow has infinite arrows, and can be upgraded by spending your level up points towards Agility in the skill tree. Another Vital Item is potions. You can buy Potions with Gold, which will restore all of your Hitpoints instantly on use. There are many more items to utilize, but I will let you discover those items and figure out their uses.

As you might've read in my last paragraph, this game has a gold system. Gold can buy you things like Potions, New Weapons, New Pets and much more. You can earn gold by multiple means, those being by killing enemies, bosses or just finding it.

Another aspect you might've just read about is pets. You can obtain pets by finding them or by buying them with your gold. Each pet does something different, and you can see what they do by going to the nurse at the pet keep. Some pets can give you items to heal, some pets fight the enemies with you and can do much more.

Finally, After you have beaten the game you unlock a new gamemode called Insane Mode. Insane Mode Is the hardest version of Castle Crashers there is. Only the most experienced players will beat Castle Crashers on Insane Mode.

In conclusion, Castle Crashers is an amazing game. If your going to get the game I suggest playing with up to 4 people. If you can't get anyone to play with you, you can play singleplayer just fine or you can play publicly. I first played Castle Crashers on the Playstation 3, and it was also the first ever video game I played and am still playing it.",1705178802,1707768899,True,3,0,0.491949886083602905,0,True,False,False

Playing as multi-coloured knights, your job is to defeat hundreds of baddies and bosses across a relatively short campaign in order to save the princesses. The addictive hook comes from the simple but satisfying combat, concise RPG elements, and a huge range of stat-changing weaponry to unlock. It's still uproarious good fun, and the new version remaster comes with an arena mode and mini game to flesh out the package.

PROS:
‚úì Beautiful hand-drawn cartoon style makes this a joy to watch
‚úì Enjoyable solo but better with friends
‚úì Multiple game modes are fun to play
‚úì Boss fights entertain as much as they challenge
‚úì Genuinely amusing sense of humor
‚úì Eclectic original soundtrack makes each level feel unique
‚úì Simple knockabout combat is still great fun
‚úì Tons of unlockable content to encourage replayability
‚úì Many playable characters in the game

CONS:
- Sometimes online play can be pretty broken
- Enemies can be overly damage spongy
- Can‚Äôt respec character stats

So, there I am, stumbling upon Castle Crashers, feeling all nostalgic like I've just unearthed the holy grail of side-scrolling joy. It's like Castlevania had a funky cousin who partied a bit too hard. The game not only met but exceeded my expectations. The graphics are as vibrant as a unicorn on an energy drink, and the gameplay? Well, it's like the Goldilocks of gaming ‚Äì just right. Easy enough to get the hang of, but not so monotonous that you start questioning your life choices.

And oh, the multiplayer! You can either gather the gang for a local shindig or venture into the wild world of online multiplayer. It's like a party where everyone's invited, except for that one guy who keeps ruining the vibe. Countless hours disappeared into unlocking characters and supercharging abilities, and let me tell you, it was time well spent.

Back in '08, Castle Crashers was my jam. The Behemoth didn't just stop there ‚Äì they injected more life into the game with DLC that introduced characters with abilities so unique they'd make a unicorn jealous. Animal orbs were like the entourage you never knew you needed, and weapons? Well, they were the secret sauce for character growth (or a challenge if you were feeling masochistic).

The game made its way to the Playstation Network in 2010, with exclusive mini-games in tow. Then came the Steam port ‚Äì a bit wonky on launch, but fear not, The Behemoth swooped in with updates, turning the chaos into pure, playable fun.

Verdict time, my fellow adventurers:

This is a hack and slash RPG that's been hugged by gamers of all stripes. Yeah, it might feel a tad repetitive as you level up, but the game throws curveballs like a stand-up comedian on roller skates. Fresh scenery, quirky opponents, and jokes that hit harder than a dad joke at a family reunion.

Playing with friends is the real deal here. So, if you're pondering the purchase, rally the troops. Completing the game is a quest in itself, and that's where the real fun lies ‚Äì unlocking characters, hunting down animal orbs, and upgrading weapons like a gaming Sherlock Holmes.

Thinking about trying it out? Download the demo. Budget tight? Wait for a discount or keep an eye on those Humble Indie Bundles. Oh, and can we all agree on one thing? Give us a sequel already! Castle Crashers 2 ‚Äì the world demands it.",1705914191,1705914191,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I kinda like that they moved some of the old DLC characters into the base game, and made them unlockable by beating certain points of the game on Insane Mode. This actually provided some incentive to take a crack at Insane Mode, whereas before, it was just kinda an extra grind that you could do for no reward whatsoever. This also means that there is more content in the base game, and you don't need other DLCs or other games to unlock characters like the King, Necromancer, Alien, etc. (The only character you get from owning a separate game is Hatty Hattington if you own Battleblock Theatre).

That said, it feels weird that the only DLCs now are the ones that give you the Pink Knight and Blacksmith, and that there are no further extras you get in those DLCs (apart from two or three new weapons). It makes those DLCs feel too small, and less rewarding. If they are only going to give you one character each, then they should've moved those characters into the base game as well.

Overall, this game is endlessly entertaining, and I hope the recent remaster is a hint towards even more DLCs, or possibly a sequel. I know we would all love more characters and missions.",1705778355,1705778355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The whole ethos of the game is that ""more is more"" where they throw a crap ton of enemies at you, who stun lock you almost permanently, yet the game is still quite easy because the devs must know about this design feature because to combat this, they also throw a crap ton of healing items your way. So in some ways, the game is simutaneously very easy and very frustrating.

Stunlocking aside, the combat system is also very boring. In fact, here's a breakneck speed on how to win virtually all but one or two encounters, whether that be standard or bosses: 1. Wait until you unlock the dash attack ability (which is very early on). 2. Turn yourself from a knight into a one man cavalry. 3. Zig zag vertically to avoid being stunlocked. 3. Dash attack the enemy as soon as you move (vertically) into their line of sight. 4. Repeat. This is easier and quicker than any other way of combating the enemy, mostly because, and again, this avoids being stunlocked. I know some will cry skill issue, but I don't think it's any lack of skill if you get hit but once, and then you can't move out of the way before the next bullet or arrow hits you, stunlocking you further.  So if this is a skill issue, then the solution to getting better is not getting hit at all, which isn't exactly realistic. 

Edit: I tried giving the game another few hours. There are so many other issue with the game in hindsight. The bosses are bullet sponges. I tried the magic system, and it sucks. I got the magic bar 75% (ish) of the way full and it does ONE damage to the later enemies. What is the fucking point? You know what? Not only do I not like this game, the game itself is trash. I've negatively reviewed other games before, but this game, this is the only one I have a bone to pick with. I honestly do not get why people like this game. Is it a ""so bad it's good"" type of thing? I'm genuinely curious.",1705387928,1705403437,False,0,2,0.373256772756576538,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
Milk - 0.5 l
Eggs - 3 pcs.
Vegetable oil - 1 tablespoon (+ for greasing the pan)
Flour - 250 g (slightly more than 1.5 cups with a capacity of 250 ml)
Sugar - 1 tablespoon
Salt - 1 pinch
Butter - 1 tablespoon
Mix the eggs, salt, sugar and stir with a mixer. Add the flour and pour in the milk. Beat the pancake batter to achieve a smooth consistency.

Pour vegetable oil into the dough so that the pancakes turn over easily at the time of frying and do not burn. Mix it up.

Preheat a frying pan and brush with oil.

Pour a small portion of the dough into the center of the pan. Immediately rotate the pan in a circle so that the dough is evenly distributed over the entire surface.

Fry thin pancakes over medium heat until browned on both sides. Turn the pancakes over carefully with a spatula. Lubricate the finished pancakes with butter immediately so that the edges are not dry, and the pancakes turn out to be tender.

Thin pancakes with milk can be served with jam, jam or condensed milk.

It's super easy to play as well with button mashing somehow managing to get me through several boss fights. Also, this game is so good I decided to make a cake. Here's the recipe.

Ingredients
Cake:
2 ‚Öõ cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
¬æ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 ¬Ω teaspoons baking powder
¬æ teaspoon baking soda
¬æ teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1 cup milk
¬Ω cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Topping:
2 (20 ounce) cans pitted sour cherries
1 cup white sugar
¬º cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Frosting:
3 cups heavy whipping cream
‚Öì cup confectioners' sugar

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans; line bottoms with parchment paper. Place a medium bowl in the refrigerator to chill.

Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; beat until combined. Pour cake batter into the prepared pans.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool layers in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Run a paring knife around edges to loosen and invert carefully onto racks to cool completely, 1 to 2 hours.

While cake layers bake, drain cherries for topping, reserving 1/2 cup juice. Combine reserved juice, cherries, sugar, and cornstarch in a 2-quart saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until thickened. Stir in vanilla. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely before assembling cake.

Combine whipping cream and confectioners' sugar for frosting in the chilled medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff peaks form.

Split each cake layer in half horizontally using a long serrated knife. Tear one layer into crumbs; set aside. Gently brush loose crumbs off top and sides of remaining layers using a pastry brush or your hands. Reserve 1 1/2 cups frosting for piping decorations on cake; set aside.

To assemble, place one cake layer on a cake plate. Spread with 1 cup frosting; top with 3/4 cup cherry topping. Top with second cake layer; repeat layers of frosting and cherry topping. Top with third cake layer and frost sides of cake.

Pat reserved cake crumbs onto sides of cake. Spoon reserved 1 1/2 cups frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a star decorator tip. Pipe around top and bottom edges of cake. Spoon remaining cherry topping on top of cake.

Store covered in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",1705252165,1705252165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure this makes you think more and deters mashing but it ends up backfiring anyway because for those who enjoy fast paced combat, this totally derails all combat completely, any momentum and adrenaline built up in the fight is thrown out the window because you have to keep stopping to block enemies nearly instantly switching from sword and shield to arrows being shot at you repeatedly. Yeah you have your own bow and arrow you can use or a ranged magic spell but by the time the animation is complete for actually using those attacks, you're already hit by the enemy arrows.

Then while going through stages, the devs thought it would be a good idea to keep delaying you while going through stages to watch UNSKIPPABLE cutscenes of things like an owl being afraid of noise in the background for a whole 10 seconds or more or a deer being scared of noise and taking a shit on the ground. Yeah it's a little funny the first few times but to force people to stop and watch this repeatedly, every time they have to repeat a stage gets annoying quick and shows a lack of respect for the player's time.

 Castle Crashers is a hilarious and addictive beat-em-up that shines brightest with friends. Its charming visuals, simple yet satisfying gameplay, and endless replayability make it a timeless classic. Just remember, chivalry isn't dead, but princesses probably are. So grab your chicken sword, gather your knights, and prepare to brawl your way to (maybe) happily ever after!

-={ GAMEPLAY }=-
Chaotic co-op joy: Team up with friends (or frenemies) for side-splitting mayhem and competitive princess-snatching.
A cast of quirky characters: Unlock and level up unique knights, each with their own fighting styles and hilarious personalities.
Beat-em-up bliss: Simple controls deliver satisfyingly crunchy combat, letting you juggle combos and unleash magic like a pro.
Replayability galore: Secret levels, hidden weapons, and endless challenges keep you coming back for more.
Potential court jester moments:

Repetitive gameplay: The core combat loop can get old after a while, especially solo.
Short campaign: Can be completed in a few hours, though DLC and challenges extend the fun.
Juvenile humor: Not for everyone's taste, with plenty of potty jokes and slapstick.

The attention to detail in this game is amazing everything from having different magic ability's as you progress through the skill tree. The black smith having weapons inside a frog with animations on it all the different characters having different magic ability this game is great I'd give it a 10/10.

I say this because those games showed the world all the ways to make games hard but fair, and plenty of ways to make games hard and unfair. Castle Crashers didn't have these games as a reference, and it really shows, as the challenge in this game comes mostly comes from breaking the rules of what is or isn't fair every 30 seconds or so. The controls are clunky. Magic is mostly useless. If you're slightly off on the Y Axis you'll miss enemies completely. You're constantly getting pelted by arrowfire from multiple directions, but you can only ever block from one. your own combos lock you into long animations, while enemy windups are quick and barely telegraphed, so the only real way to block damage is by predicting their attacks. Some enemies don't stagger but still have giant sweeping attacks that can't be dodged, blocked, or jumped over. Not bosses, normal enemies. You WILL be taking a lot of damage, but recovery items are almost non existent. Food will very rarely drop from dead enemies, but will only ever restore about 2 or 3 hits worth of damage. You can and will get be getting juggled for twice that much.

The screen is constantly getting blocked, whether by enemies in the foreground, tall grass, stage clutter, or even just the boss being too big to see anything else behind him (such as all his friends winding up their attacks). One of the first levels in the game is a straight up rip of the infamous Battletoads sewer level, where you're on a speeding vehicle forced to react split second to shit flying at you from the right side of the screen. You're going to fail a lot. Then it immediately drops you into one of the worst controlled levels I have ever played in a video game, where you're floating in a river, barely able to move, unable to block, and only able to attack by jumping. But they keep throwing swarms of flying enemies at you, untouchable enemies shooting arrows from offscreen, giant fish who do unblockable charge attacks without windups, and bigass rocks that you still have to not run into or get knocked into by an enemy. The whole game is made with this kind of design philosophy.

This game is not fair. This game is not fun. Damage negation is a joke and there's almost no health recovery. Most of the players' tools don't work, and almost all of the enemies or obstacles are different flavors of bullshit that would never fly in modern games. Castle Crashers is a beloved classic because of the era it came out in, where riding a deer rocketing along from its own jet propelled shit stream with your friends was all you needed to think a game was entertaining. But more than a decade and a half later, those rose tinted glasses are putting in some serious work.",1701980135,1701980135,False,0,1,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

I can't help but cringe as I use that last word. Firstly, the mechanics are pretty solid and overall smooth. There are some exceptions:
-Vertical movement has the typical brawler problem of being 2x slower than horizontal, making it a chore
-Horizontal jumping doesn't keep enough momentum to feel tight
-Hitboxes feel a bit odd before you're used to them
-No actually good combo strings so attacks feel very basic and repetitive throughout the game

Otherwise, the controls and physics seem to pan out well. The graphical style is...2001 Newgrounds flash game. It's really quite bad and its only saving grace is that there are a few vector layers on each sprite for lights and shadow which flash games hadn't evolved yet. They opted for a more cartoonish storybook feel seemingly to fit the...""c-o-m-e-d-y"" but it falls flat and feels like an excuse to be lazy.

Much of the humor in the game relies on poop, fart, college frat jokes and having women be creepily fought over for kisses...which they have seemingly no say in. The game includes many references to popular culture, which can rub many people the wrong way.

The game does enough to keep things fresh and alive by having many different knights with different powers, which you don't really get to use unless you put points into that special stat (whoops!). There are many findable secrets that include useful pets and weapons.

It's a question asked occasionally to me that I usually say a different answer to whenever asked. Usually, it'd be the game I'm currently playing, or a hit game, such as Yakuza 0 or Ghost of Tsushima. But I felt that the games don't fulfill that quota. Sure, they tell compelling stories and I had fun playing them, but they're not actually the game I wanna relive my experience with. And then it hit me. It's not about what it means and how good a story or game it is, it's the experiences and fun you had with it that makes me want to relive the moment. I'm probably not explaining it well, so, let me put it this way; which would you remember more? A single player game, or a game that you played with friends that you get to share the experience with? That game for me was Castle Crashers. I remember when I was 8, sitting on the couch with my older brother, turning the Xbox 360 on. We'd sit there, controllers on our lap, as my brother navigated to the library to start up Castle Crashers. I miss that moment, if I'm gonna be honest. My brother is gone from this world, but that doesn't mean I can't share the fun I had with the world. So, if you are a person thinking of getting this game, my answer is a resounding yes. It's worth the money, it's great with friends, it's great solo. And you won't regret it.",1619942791,1700913814,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But I finally picked it up on Steam! I like being able to invite a friend to play the game with me, so I finally don't have to do it alone!

I've played through the campaign MAYBE one too many times (try more than 30 across consoles I've played it on), and what can I say? The gameplay is simple with some complexity to be learned if you want to get the most out of it, and the skill points assigned to stats when you level mean you can focus differently and have a different kind of playstyle for your run! Each knight's magic also has different elements, so you can experiment and find one that you like: be it the arrows and bombs of the Gray Knight or the ice magic from the Blue Knight to freeze enemies in place.

The story is pretty goofy and lighthearted: mainly just some laughs and enough of a reason to go through the stages. It will probably make you laugh at least once with some of the ridiculous moments that happen in the stages. And the music in the stages is top-notch, for every stage!

Maybe I'm just a little biased because I love the game so much. But I think it's worth the time to try for anyone who has some time to kill!",1700513140,1700513140,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

there are 31 characters to play as whether they are unlocked at the start or unlocked by other means like finishing the game as a specific character or defeating a certain boss really adding to the replay value (at least for me), there's a lot of stupid (yet funny) random moments every now and then, the gameplay is simple yet entertaining and easy to master, the music, which is made by newgrounds users, is really good and placed very well in the game etc.

Its not a hard thing to pull off, just might turn off new players getting jumped and not finding anyone to play with. The game does come with full online capabilities. No 3rd party bs or anything.

The game is a blast and is probably one of the best things I played on Xbox. The game is very funny and it has an easy and hard mode, in case you already beat the game once.
You just have to run around with your character, which can be a crusader, a soldier, a barbarian, a skeleton, and more; while you are killing stuff and throwing spells to everything you find. Some times you find ""vehicles"" and other you can find specific pets that give you a bonus. Also, at specific points you can change your weapon for another one you find in battle or at specific places. The objective is saving the princesses of your kingdom.
I recommend to use a controller for this game. However, I played it myself some times on keyboard and is still good.
The game is 100% epic and funny and these 2 adjectives increase by 100% each time you add another player to the game. At some specific points all players battle between them to get specific bonuses, which make the game very funny and makes you wonder if you should spend your potion or keep it for the battle against your friends.

[i] Title: ""Castle Crashers Critique by Shrek and Friends""

[Scene: Shrek, Donkey, Puss in Boots, Pinocchio, the Three Pigs, and the Gingerbread Man are gathered around a TV with controllers in their hands. Castle Crashers is loading on the screen.]

Shrek: (scratching his head) What's all this then? A game about smashing castles? Count me in!

Donkey: (excited) Oh, I hope I can be the dragon! I wanna be a flying donkey!

Puss in Boots: (looking at Donkey) Donkey, I assure you, you can't be the dragon. Calm down.

Pinocchio: (nervously) Can someone please tell me if lying in this game is a bad idea?

Three Pigs: (oinking) Let's huff and puff and smash some castles!

Gingerbread Man: (nervously) I hope we don't run into any gingerbread castles...

[The game starts, and they choose their characters.]

Shrek: (selecting the Green Knight) Naturally, I'm going to be the green one. Now, let's smash some castles!

Donkey: (choosing the Blue Knight) Blue is the color of royalty, right?

Puss in Boots: (selecting the Orange Knight) Orange is just as charming as I am.

Pinocchio: (picking the Red Knight) I hope my nose doesn't grow longer in the game.

Three Pigs: (each picking a different color) We'll cover all the bases, guys!

Gingerbread Man: (hesitating) Should I choose the Brown Knight? Nah, too risky. I'll go with the Gray Knight.

[They dive into the game, start bashing bad guys, and collecting items.]

Shrek: (smashing enemies) This is more fun than rescuing princesses! Sorry, Fiona.

Donkey: (kicking an enemy) Take that, you castle-wrecker!

Puss in Boots: (swinging his sword) I wish I had a little sombrero for my knight!

Pinocchio: (using magic) Hey, it's like playing Pin-the-Tail on the Castle.

Three Pigs: (laughing as they use weapons) Who needs bricks when you have swords?

Gingerbread Man: (throwing grenades) Catch my ginger grenades, you bready fiends!

[They encounter a giant boss, a catfish wearing a snorkel.]

Shrek: (laughing) A catfish? Must be Catfish Mignon!

Donkey: (singing) ""Catfish in the sea, you and me, oh, how happy we'll be!""

Puss in Boots: (sword-dancing) I've always wanted to tango with a catfish!

Pinocchio: (shouting) Lie, you fish! I dare you!

Three Pigs: (oinking in unison) Let's turn this catfish into seafood!

Gingerbread Man: (tossing a ginger grenade) Eat this, you soggy fish!

[They defeat the boss and continue playing.]

Shrek: (counting loot) I've collected more stuff than in my swamp!

Donkey: (grinning) I'm the loot king! Who needs dragon treasure?

Puss in Boots: (gathering gems) I'm getting a gem-encrusted litter box after this.

Pinocchio: (with a growing nose) Oops, it's growing! I mean, my inventory, it's growing!

Three Pigs: (oinking with glee) We'll have a piggy feast tonight!

Gingerbread Man: (collecting icing) They say diamonds are a cookie's best friend!

[They finish the game.]

Shrek: (high-fiving) Well, that was a smashing good time!

Donkey: (laughing) It's a good thing we didn't run into any flying donkeys!

Puss in Boots: (posing) The only thing missing was a catnap power-up.

Pinocchio: (looking at his inventory) My nose didn't betray me! Yay!

Three Pigs: (belching) Oink, that was satisfying!

Gingerbread Man: (licking his icing) Sweet victory, mates!

[They all cheer and continue playing. Castle Crashers receives a unanimous thumbs up from the crew.] [/i]

[b]Well, the knights began to clash
As they fought right through the castle door
The colors of their knights
Were as wild as a lion's roar
Crushed beneath their might
Like a siege, we couldn't take much more
We're all just warriors on the Castle Crash Floor üè∞üí•

Swing a little more, little more, with your sword in hand üó°Ô∏è
Swing a little more, as you storm the castle land üè∞
Swing a little more, little more, through each game you'll soar üéÆ
Swing a little more, on the Castle Crash Floor! üí£

Pressed against the walls
We could feel the enemies swarm in tight üåä
The bosses were so tough
And our health potions were out of sight
Nothing ever came
Easy in this chaotic fight
Pull yourself together, knight
And let's smite with all our might ‚öîÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è

Well, they took their quests to heart
Facing dangers in the dark unknown üåå
Their armor shining bright
As they fought for the princess on the throne üë∏üëë
Tell me something, knights, what treasures you have in store üèÜ
They said, ""Come with us now
To the Castle Crash Floor!"" üéâüéä

Swing a little more, little more, on your quest to soar üèπ
Swing a little more, as you conquer castle lore üìúüè∞
Swing a little more, little more, in the dungeons' roar üï≥Ô∏è
Swing a little more, on the Castle Crash Floor! ‚öîÔ∏èüí∞

Swing a little more, on the Castle Crash Floor
Swing a little more, on the Castle Crash Floor

The loot they found was sweet üç¨
Oh, much better than they could foresee üîÆ
Another potion's sip
They knew there was no stopping, no mercy üç∑üí•
The treasures they pursued
Led them on a wild journey South and East
Brave hearts still cryin'
'Cause there's no retreat üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Swing a little more, little more, in this epic lore üåü
Swing a little more, as you claim the treasure store üíéüè¶
Swing a little more, little more, in the game galore üéÆ
Swing a little more, on the Castle Crash Floor! ü§ñüöÄ

Swing a little more, on the Castle Crash Floor
Swing a little more, on the Castle Crash Floor

So pick up your controller üéÆ
And join the knights in this grand adventure üéÜ
Castle Crashers, oh, what a world
Where every foe is met with brave grandeur üèπüõ°Ô∏è

Swing a little more, little more, with your sword in hand üó°Ô∏è
Swing a little more, as you storm the castle land üè∞
Swing a little more, little more, through each game you'll soar üéÆ
Swing a little more, on the Castle Crash Floor! üè∞üí£ [/b]",1698194171,1698194206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it is technically a retro-game, it's aged like fine wine!

The controls are tight and intuitive, and it's a blast in single player or 2 - 4 player!

Castle Crashers is a game that not only brought back nostalgic memories but also created new ones. From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by its colorful and charming art style, quirky humor, and addictive gameplay.

The graphics in Castle Crashers are beautifully crafted, with each character and enemy having their unique charm and personality. The animations are smooth, and the vibrant world is a joy to explore. It's a testament to the game's timeless design that it still looks fantastic even years after its initial release.

The gameplay is where Castle Crashers truly shines. The controls are easy to pick up, making it accessible for players of all skill levels. But don't let the simplicity fool you; beneath the surface lies a depth of strategy that keeps you engaged throughout the entire adventure. Whether you're smashing enemies with your trusty weapon or unlocking new combos and magic spells, there's always something new to discover.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of Castle Crashers is its co-op mode. Playing with friends, either locally or online, is an absolute blast. Teaming up to defeat challenging bosses or competing to see who can collect the most gold adds an extra layer of fun and camaraderie to the game.

The humor and charm of Castle Crashers are also noteworthy. The quirky characters, humorous dialogue, and wacky scenarios had me laughing out loud multiple times. It's a rare game that can be both challenging and lighthearted, and Castle Crashers strikes that balance perfectly.

With a variety of characters to choose from, each with their own abilities and playstyles, Castle Crashers offers excellent replayability. You can experiment with different characters and strategies, ensuring that each playthrough feels fresh and exciting.

In conclusion, Castle Crashers is a timeless classic that has earned its place as one of the best indie games on Steam. Its delightful art style, addictive gameplay, and endless replayability make it a must-play for gamers of all ages. Whether you're a fan of beat 'em ups or just looking for a fun game to enjoy with friends, Castle Crashers has you covered.",1695694738,1695694738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] Actual Review (No Spoilers): [/b] Yup. Castle Crashers still holds up all these years later thanks to a ton of replayability, a timeless art style, and goofy, fun-natured gameplay. I remember always wanted to play this game when I would visit my friend's house years back since I didn't have a 360, and it holds the same amount of charm today.

The game has a TON of unlockable content like characters, weapons, and pets. There's a lot of variety although admittedly not everything is useful or unique. A lot of characters are largely redundant, and a lot of the pets are pretty underpowered. That is basically my singular complaint with the game. But there's still enough there to spend countless hours trying them all out to see what is the most fun.

The combat is that of a beat-em-up and there is a surprising amount of depth to it. Juggling is by far one of the best parts of the combat, if you're good enough you can stay airborne for entire fights. The weapon selection is also really good. There's a weapon for any type of build. There is also a rebalance mod to use if you're wanting to make characters feel more unique from each other which also tweaks a bunch of other stuff to make everything more viable and fun to use.

The multiplayer is where you'll have the most fun. Up to 4 player co-op and it's always a chaotic mess. Sadly the online multiplayer is both pretty bad and pretty dead, but you can still plug in multiple controllers for couch co-op.

There are only 12 achievements to collect and the only grindy one is the arena master one where you have to win 40 online arena matches. Thankfully I was able to find someone to grind it with on the discussion forums. All other achievements will come pretty naturally aside from one or two.

Cannot recommend this game enough. Even if you're playing single player its a blast every time. 10/10",1695111891,1695112207,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I like how you have so much characters that unlock other characters and those characters unlock other characters when you finish the game with them. 
If you thought that the game was easy, then there is an insane mode that isnt really hard so you need to sweat but it takes some skill to pass it.

I like how we get the whole story without a word said about what is happening, we get it through funny animations of villians and cutscenes.

I also like how you can do some ""side quests"" liek collect every animal on every charactery collect every sword and things like that. 

Right now I am sitting for good 10-15 minutes and couldnt think of one bad thing about this game. I dont regret a minute or a penny spent on this game.

Finally getting to play the full game on a 1080p monitor instead of a 720p tv was a blast! If you're wanting to play this game how it was meant to be played, use a controller. Now if you wanted to play this game like it was MEANT and I mean MEANT to be played, get one of those wired xbox 360 controllers, if you can find one. Alternatively buy the hyperkin xenon controller, it's a licensed by xbox controller which is basically a 1:1 replica of the original wired xbox 360 controller. Oh yeah I should probably review the game huh. This game is what you expect, classic level based beat em' up. Every knight has different magic abilities (oh yeah there's magic too) so make sure to research which knight you want to take if you really care about magic (melee gang ftw). What else is there to say about this game really? If you didn't grow up with it, I highly recommend you pick up this game even if it's not on sale. It's not everyone's cup of tea but the simplicity of this game really makes it more enjoyable than most games released today, simple premise, simple end goal.

It's over fifteen years old and I'd say it's still the same great gem that it used to be. Be warned that this game is very much meant for more than one player! But don't worry, you wont have to buy a second or third copy if you're in the same place. All you need are controllers, and you're good to go!

My time on this computer is only 17.2  hours. But back in the day I know I had roughly 100 hours at least on the Xbox 360. I've revisited it recently to see if it's as good as I remember, and I can proudly say it was. Admittedly this is very much a product of it's time, but it's still decently funny and extremely fun even after 15 years.

The game runs extremely smoothly. I'm very used to playing games with annoying loading menus but Castle Crashers is an extremely seamless experience. The levels are long but not too long, and if you die halfway through you can pick up right where you left off, and also replay levels from that point. 

I wouldn't say any level is extremely tedious, though it can be a bit difficult. There have been maybe one or two things that I'd deem as too annoying, but the grind through it is far from awful. The game also doesn't hold your hand, and you get thrown into things immediately. You also have to pick up mechanics on the fly. But honestly the games control scheme is so easy to pick up at first that you should learn quickly how to at least survive your first encounter. 
I think the only parts I've really disliked are the water one, and escaping the alien ship. But honestly, the former is easy enough once you learn how to beat it, and the latter just takes a few goes through. (Plus the end of that level is very funny, to me!) Also there's some minor issues with aiming at things and the Y-axis, but honestly that's just something you get used to.

There are a lot of secrets and the game encourages you to run through it again/backtrack with new items, since you can get pets or weapons that were previously unavailable to you. There are some mini-games in levels that break up game play, which I enjoy.

Like I mentioned before this is absolutely a game to play with the fellas. Thankfully it has local play, so you just need to hook up some controllers to your computer and you're good to go. You cannot change the control scheme which sucks, but I find the control scheme to be fine enough. The absolute relief I felt when the game just picked up the two controllers with no fuss was immense.

This game is super fun, I cannot recommend it enough. Have fun crashing them castles or something",1693287985,1693287985,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

Basically, I don't see anything special except funny characters. The gameplay is to adjust to the 2.5D view and find out where to stand to land successful hits, what's left is repetitive beat'em up. The level design doesn't help a lot, simply restrict our view or where we can stand. Their BattleBlock theater provides a much more interesting story and level design. 

And I met some saving issues. Steam Cloud Save doesn't work , fine, I could put  the blame on Steam, but why do I lose part of my progress just after restarting?

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 30 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

If you want a cozy / simplistic game to play through with others, or alone like I did, that has cheeky lowbrow humor, this game is for you. The RPG elements are basic, and for a beat 'em up, that's perfectly fitting. On top of that, there is plenty of characters to choose with varing magic abilities and quirks to them to encourage replaying the game. The environments and assets are all uniquely drawn and stand out. There is so many memorable locations and enemy / boss designs in this game. My only complaint is that if you're playing solo, you are definitely going to have to grind for a few levels here and there, but it's just not so excessive that I felt like it was a serious subtractor to the game itself.

The game looks like a 2004 flash animation with charmingly simple cartoony graphics and it plays about as complex as one too. You have light, heavy, ranged, and magic attacks but they aren't employed in any tactical way. You eventually unlock combos as you level up but otherwise it plays like an old school side scrolling brawler (ala Streets of Rage).

The story is minimal and very silly. Each stage has it's own jokes as you hunt down the dark wizard and face off against his various minions. It's not a very deep game but my god is it a grind as it goes on and on. If you're playing with friends there's a bit more to it but as a single player adventure it just drags and you'll have to grind levels at points to get past later stages due to linear difficulty.

There's some collectibles, cosmetics, and reskined characters to unlock, but those are only for the truly dedicated. If you want a simple silly adventure it's cheap and plentiful but it's so basic it has trouble sustaining a playthrough.",1690327381,1690327381,False,0,0,0.459930330514907837,0,True,False,False

It's got a ton of content, the boss battles are fun and usually somewhat difficult, and the difficulty system of the game is very well balanced in my opinion. I originally played the Xbox 360 edition several years ago and although that game was good, this version has been remastered to include very important changes such as tweaking the prices of shop items. 

I really enjoy playing this game solo, but it's even better if you can get a few friends together and play. Not only does it lower the difficulty a bit through the resuscitation system (which allows other players to revive you if you die), the hours of fun and crazy excitement that you will get from this game will be completely worth it.

I highly recommend Castle Crashers at any price. The DLCs are also decent, and I enjoy the characters that come with them. Since they're at a very reasonable price, I would recommend buying them if you have the spare cash. If you don't buy them though, that's okay, as there are many other characters in the game that are either available by default or unlocked through gameplay.",1689536805,1689536805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom nestled deep within an enchanted forest, there lived a curious little rabbit named Oliver. Oliver was no ordinary rabbit. He had the ability to speak with all the creatures of the forest and had a heart filled with an insatiable desire for adventure.

One moonlit night, as the stars twinkled above, Oliver couldn't fall asleep. He hopped out of his cozy burrow and ventured into the forest, hoping to find something exciting to do. As he hopped along the winding path, he stumbled upon a shimmering light emanating from a hidden glade.

Curiosity overwhelmed Oliver, and he hopped closer, discovering a group of woodland animals gathered in a circle. At the center stood a wise old owl named Orville, known for his infinite knowledge and captivating storytelling. The animals sat in awe as Orville began to recount a tale of a lost treasure hidden deep within the forest.

Oliver's eyes widened with excitement, and he knew in his heart that he had to embark on a grand quest to find this treasure. He shared his intentions with Orville, who encouraged him and offered guidance. The owl explained that the treasure was guarded by three challenges, each requiring bravery, wisdom, and kindness.

With newfound determination, Oliver set off on his adventure. The first challenge awaited him at the Crystal Caves, a labyrinth of gleaming crystals that shimmered like stars. Oliver navigated the twisting passages, relying on his intuition and cleverness to find the way. Finally, he reached the heart of the cave, where a massive boulder blocked his path. Remembering the wisdom of the owl, Oliver channeled all his strength and pushed with all his might. With a loud rumble, the boulder gave way, revealing a hidden passage.

The second challenge led Oliver to the Whispering Woods, where magical trees whispered ancient secrets. As he wandered through the forest, he encountered a lost fox cub, frightened and alone. Oliver, showing his kindness, comforted the cub and helped it find its way back to its family. In gratitude, the trees whispered directions to the next challenge‚Äîthe Tower of Wisdom.

The Tower of Wisdom stood tall and majestic, reaching toward the sky. Oliver climbed the stairs, his heart pounding with anticipation. At the top, he faced a wise old turtle who posed a riddle. The riddle tested Oliver's intellect and problem-solving skills. With careful thought and reasoning, Oliver solved the riddle, impressing the turtle with his cleverness.

Finally, Oliver arrived at the secret location of the hidden treasure‚Äîa sparkling waterfall in the heart of the forest. He gazed at the shimmering water, feeling a sense of accomplishment and pride. But instead of claiming the treasure for himself, he realized that true happiness came from sharing and spreading joy.

Oliver returned to the glade, bringing all the forest animals together to witness the unveiling of the treasure. As he pulled back the curtain of leaves, a burst of radiant light emerged‚Äîa magical fountain that granted the wishes of those who believed in kindness and unity.

From that day forward, the animals of the forest lived in harmony, their wishes granted by the enchanted fountain. And Oliver, the brave and selfless rabbit, became a cherished hero, guiding others toward kindness, wisdom, and the true treasure of a loving heart.

As the animals settled down for the night, Oliver's tale lingered in their hearts, reminding them of the power of courage, compassion, and the magic that resides within each and every one of us. And with dreams filled with hope and wonder, they drifted off to sleep, knowing that tomorrow would bring new adventures and possibilities in their enchanted forest home.",1689116201,1689116201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Castle Crashers will forever hold a special place in my heart, as I first played it on the Xbox 360, and finally being able to play it again on Steam was a dream come true. There is so much to say about this game, the art style and graphics are, and will be forever charming and fun, the locations and enemies are very diverse, providing a unique and captivating experience the whole way through, and the gameplay is surprisingly smooth for it's time; Learning combos and other crazy ways to juggle enemies is some of the most fun I've ever had in a game. Playing with friends is extremely fun as well (Especially when you're 20 levels ahead of them). The game has plenty of secret unlockables and side content to keep you busy as well, such as the slew of unlockable characters, and the Back-Off-Barbarian gamemode.  I do have a couple complaints though, the ""Insane Mode"", an optional mode you earn after completing the game, is complete garbage. It bloats the enemy's health and damage by an almost comical amount, which makes for a MISERABLE experience. Another complaint isn't really the game's fault, more the passage of time's; The online community is pretty much completely dead, which is a shame considering how much fun the arena game mode could be. Overall though, Castle Crashers is a fantastic side-scrolling beat-em-up that I cannot recommend more, it's fun throughout the whole game and offers a unique experience that I'm sure will pass the test of time.",1680675432,1687736068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As complex as any beat 'em up, castle crashers of course achieves a feeling of bad-assery (if that is even a thing) as competent as the one you would get with Devil May Cry or God of War, I especially highlight this feeling in bossfights with equals like the cyclops, the necromancer and the wizard (if that was his name lmao); all of this even though the game is comedic enough, proving itself as a tough, while not infuriating challenge, unless we talk about insane mode, that shit is from another world.

In-game collectibles generally work out well thanks to the lack of quality distinction between one another, in the case of weapons, while there is some representation of progression with some weapons, in the late game the choice becomes a matter of playstyle and choosing an aesthetic; on the other hand, pets, the other collectible, give all very different abilities that ultimately come down to the situation where they are more appropiate; inventory elements like the bow, the boomerang and others are all extremely distinct and have no point of comparison, constituting fundamentala features of gameplay each of them.

In case the collectibles didn't suggest enough that this game has insane replay-value, the playable characters will: in the base game you have the four knights with different magic powers and some variation in statistics, the steam version also includes the alien from Alien Hominid since this one is, unfortunately, not available in steam; you get plenty new characters on your first playthrough thanks to some feats you will do in order to beat it, or some you CAN do if you are skilled enough, like completing arenas of each region. Beating the game with each base knight unlocks four new characters, which, in turn, unlock another four; long story short, if you get into the replay world of this game, you're not getting out any time soon.

Castle Crashers is, finally, one of the most memorable couch-coop experiences you will ever get, and experiencing its multiplayer is practically mandatory if you want to get the full flavor of it.",1531528142,1687576813,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I originally played this game years and years ago on the Xbox 360 and as a kid loved every second of it, as I've grown older I still enjoy parts of this game whilst some of it just bogs me down.

I'll start with the pros, the game runs incredibly smooth, the Steam version has great graphics, all the achievements work, and I never encountered any game-breaking bugs!

The cons include very VERY repetitive game play, which while some may enjoy it just didn't sit well with me after all these years.

You can level up your character to build their stats up and make them stronger and the game does a really great job at balancing those skill-sets while you progress during your first play through, the developers encourage replay-ability by having you unlock new characters, and the kicker there is once you start a new game with a new character the whole campaign is reset for that said character. That sort of repetitiveness to me just isn't enjoyable.

I enjoyed playing with friends but I sadly would not recommend the game if you're playing solo.
Multiplayer works and is either co-op campaign or PvP mini games that feel old after a few rounds.

Overall I recommend the game from a creativity, soundtrack, overall feel, and polished standpoint,
I just can't recommend playing the whole game and achievement hunting without friends to play with and back you up.




also completing the back off barbarian achievement is the most rewarding feeling I've experienced in a long time lmao.",1685676923,1685676923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The visuals in this game are as vibrant as a bedrock sunset. The colorful landscapes and zany characters will make you feel like you're walking through the streets of Bedrock itself. You'll encounter cavemen, dinosaurs, and all sorts of wacky creatures on your way.

The gameplay is as thrilling as racing down a volcano on a boulder! You'll swing your clubs and throw stones to defeat enemies, just like when Fred and Barney went bowling. You can team up with your pals for some dino-sized co-op action, just like Fred and Barney teaming up for a game of golf.

Each level is packed with surprises, just like the time Fred and Barney got caught in a landslide of laughs. You'll face fierce boss battles that will test your strength and skill, like wrestling a T-Rex. It's a stone-cold challenge, but you can do it!

The humor in Castle Crashers will have you laughing harder than when Fred slid down the tail of a dinosaur. The silly antics and slapstick comedy will make you feel like you're part of a Flintstones episode. You'll giggle, chuckle, and have a grand old time.

Now, keep in mind, this game may not have the latest dinosaur-powered technology, but it's got that old-school charm that'll make your heart go ""yabba dabba doo!"" It's a blast from the past that'll transport you back to the stone age.

In conclusion, Castle Crashers is a rockin' good time, just like a Bedrock BBQ! It's got caveman style, prehistoric pizzazz, and enough fun to make even Fred Flintstone proud. So grab your clubs, gather your friends, and get ready for a dino-sized adventure that'll have you shouting, ""Wilmaaaaaa!""",1684720842,1684720842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Childhood favorite to some, a crazed party game to another; Castle Crashers is just great. A wacky adventure with 1-4 players that will grip you with it's amazing soundtrack featuring epic orchestras, creepy cave music and classic moodlifters. The story although standard is hugely helped by the comedic twists to the characters, areas and enemies. A fun system for weapons and pets along with satisfying hack and slash combat. The only negative i can think about in this game would be playing solo as it is faaar more fun with friends and the sometimes frustrating vertical element to the 2D side-scrolling. The game doesn't end after one completion either, each time you finish the game with a certain character you unlock another based on who you completed the game with. This allows for fun exploration of different abilites between the different characters. After completing the game you also unlock the hard mode which is just a more difficult mode for the game during your 2nd playthrough and onwards. The cherry on top in this game has to be the free-for-all pvp with all your teammates once you rescue a princess.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 30 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Many different types of mobs to fight, dozens of characters and swords for you to unlock. A campaign which is neither short nor easy. There's an insane mode, after you finish the game on normal. It's a game designed for multiplayer and it's genuinely fun to play with friends. Background music and sound effects are unique and slightly silly. 

You CAN play single player mode, if you want to unlock certain characters or want to test your own mettle. But that doesn't have the punch which multiplayer does. I wouldn't suggest buying this, if you don't have someone to play this game with. Because sadly, ""play with anyone"" multiplayer mode is almost deserted and folks play this game, usually play in closed lobbies with their friends. There is the option of joining a game group and find friendly people to play with. But that's not a as simple.

It has three modes: Arena Mode - a typical arena where you fight enemies.
Back off Barbarians - you have to jump and dodge your enemies
story Mode-singleplayer or multiplayer (you can play all named modes in multiplayer)
story mod something like arena mode but with more locations.

Story: Not much, but at least someone has 5/10

Gameplay: Here I have to point out that it has terrible controls at the beginning, but you can adjust it 4/10

Style: The animated 2D style is my dream, so I have to give it 10/10

Soundtrack: The songs usually fit the moment 9/10

Length: It took me about 15 hours to finish, but it's definitely faster 10/10

Mods: Three are enough, all of them will keep you busy for a long time 10/10

Characters: I think more than 30 characters is enough and each one has different abilities 10/10

Nothing wrong with this steam version, has all the modes from the 360 version, and some extra ones. If you want a good online game, that connects well and is a decent price can't go wrong with this one its a classic. One of the best non licensed original beat em ups ever made only comparable to scott pilgrim. And its hard to say which ones better since I love them both, but this one is a lot harder, scott pilgrim is a fun rpgish beatemup you can easily grind out a win, this is much harder. Dunno if that's a positive or a negative guess it depends on if you want a challenge or not. Its not battletoads hard I beat it long ago, long as you stick with a knight, power him up, and learn the boss strategies its not that tough but it is a damn fun game.",1681107070,1681107070,True,1,0,0.390243053436279297,0,True,False,False

Its such a simple yet perfect game, The Artwork and soundtrack are amazing, the combat is practically perfect, the levels don't feel like a chore and aren't dragged out unnecessarily.

I love this game with all of my heart and I cant believe I hadn't played it EVER until 3 days ago. If you're seeing this and considering buying this game, DO IT. Its worth it and I promise you'll have a good time.  I would also like to remind you that this review is after playing only 3.7 hours of the game.

THE GRAPHICS ARE PRETTY SIMPLE BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT ADDS TO THE NOSTALGIA FACTOR. I LOVE HOW YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOUR HOMIES AND JUST MESS AROUND. HOWEVER, I HAVE TO ADMIT, AS AN ADULT NOW, IT'S NOT AS FUN AS IT WAS BACK THEN.

DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S STILL A GOOD GAME, BUT IT'S JUST NOT AS ADDICTIVE AS IT USED TO BE. I FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE FOR THE KIDDOS THAN FOR GROWN-UPS. BUT HEY, IF YOU WANT TO RELIVE YOUR CHILDHOOD MEMORIES, THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.

JUST DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM IT, YA HEAR? IT'S JUST A SIMPLE AND FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH YOUR BUDDIES. SO, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A QUICK AND EASY GAME TO PLAY, THEN CASTLE CRASHERS IS WORTH THE MONEY.

BUT TO BE HONEST, I WOULDN'T PAY FULL PRICE FOR IT. IT'S KIND OF A RIP-OFF IF YOU ASK ME. BUT IF IT'S ON SALE, THEN GO AHEAD AND SNAG IT UP.

PEACE OUT!

The classic arcade feel when it came to fighting games was furious mashing. So I guess they weren't wrong when it came to Castle Crashers.

Aside from the gum-grinding mechanics of general play, button mashing is the main gist of this game. Don't try to play tactical, no sir. That's the BEST way to get ganged up on and out...maneuvered? If you wanna call a counter-gameplay mechanic a maneuver. Everything about this game is a fight, especially with the game itself. You are fighting EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING WANTS YOU TO HAVE A BAD DAY.

So unless you have friends to play this with, don't even bother. And even then, I'm sure you all would be better off with Mario Kart or Mario Party.",1680183012,1680183012,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game provides a range of weapons and magic spells that can be used to your advantage, just like in our battles on Cybertron.

Despite the serious nature of our battles, Castle Crashers adds a lighthearted tone with its humor. The game is full of hilarious jokes and references that will keep you laughing while you're bashing in some Autobot heads. The game's cartoonish graphics and quirky characters add to the overall experience, making it a fun and enjoyable game.

[b]Co-op[/b]
Playing Castle Crashers with fellow Decepticons is always a good time. The game is designed to be played co-op, and it's much more enjoyable when you have someone to play with. You can work together to take down bosses, revive each other when needed, and share items and weapons.

[i]Tip[/i]: Don't be afraid to experiment with different weapons and magic spells. Each Decepticon has their unique abilities, so try them all out to find what works best for you and your partner.

People have played this on and off since 2012 and they will continue to do so until the end of recorded history. This game drags you back in for 5+ hours every couples years to relive the sensation of undertaking an epic journey and unlocking new characters to epic journey with. 

The weapons, the magic pets, the playable characters and the ‚Äúwtf am I looking at‚Äù moments never stop. . 

The combat is clean, the movement is fluid, the boss fights are epic and the story is told silently in such a comedic way it almost feels sombering when contrasted with the death you cause. 

You unlock enemies by fighting them in coliseums or beating the linear campaign. You keep on playing to keep on unlocking characters. You then use these characters to beat the story again and unlock more characters. It‚Äôs like trickle down economics but not stupid.

The game's story is relatively simple: a group of knights must save the kingdom's princesses from an evil sorcerer. However, the game's humorous writing and over-the-top cartoon violence make it a joy to play. The game's art style is bright and colorful, with each character having a distinct look and personality.

Gameplay in Castle Crashers is straightforward, with players battling enemies and bosses across a variety of levels. The game's combat system is simple to learn, with players able to attack, block, and use special moves. Players can also unlock new weapons and characters as they progress through the game.

Castle Crashers also features local and online multiplayer, which allows up to four players to play together. Multiplayer adds a new dimension to the game, as players can work together to defeat enemies and bosses.

The game's music and sound effects are also noteworthy, with catchy tunes and satisfying sound effects that enhance the game's action.

One potential downside of Castle Crashers is its length. The game can be completed in a few hours, and while the game is designed for replayability, some players may find the game's content to be lacking.

Overall, Castle Crashers is a fun and engaging game that is perfect for players who enjoy humor, cartoon violence, and action games. Its colorful visuals, simple gameplay mechanics, and multiplayer options make it a great game for playing with friends.",1677230190,1677230190,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This side-scrolling adventure game is chock-full of wacky characters, hilarious dialogue, and over-the-top battles. You and up to three friends can team up and embark on a quest to rescue princesses, defeat evil wizards, and battle bizarre bosses, all while unleashing a barrage of attacks and magic spells.

The humor in Castle Crashers is on point, with witty one-liners, sight gags, and absurd situations that will have you rolling on the floor. And let's not forget about the animal companions that you can unlock and ride into battle, including a giant frog, a snail, and a deer with laser eyes.

But don't let the humor fool you - Castle Crashers is also a challenging game, with plenty of tough enemies and boss battles that will put your skills to the test. You'll need to strategize, dodge attacks, and use all of your abilities if you want to emerge victorious.

Overall, Castle Crashers is an excellent game that strikes the perfect balance between humor and action. If you're a fan of medieval knights, silly humor, or just want to have a blast with your friends, then you need to add this game to your collection. And if you're not careful, you might just become addicted to the laughter and adventure that Castle Crashers has to offer.",1676901677,1676901677,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

A classic for me, a really fun side-scrolling beat 'em up that can be played solo, online and local co-op.
You can play through the main story, do arenas, and then there's ""insane mode"" which is similar to new game+ in a way, enemies get massively tougher and you play through again. You can do this on every character (which there's a lot of) that adds a lot of replayability.

+ Love the art style
+ Great soundtrack and audio
+ Good funnies
+ Good variety of characters
+ Fun in co-op (options of online & local)
+ Playable with mouse & keyboard aswell as controller

Games like hobo or that purple demon kid with his father idk name. 
And I was playing this game with one of my best friends when we were kids so i had to beat it.
And now I was playing it with my brother. I like soundtrack its like from geometry dash. I love graphics and combo moves.
We were playing on strength which was worse than magic becouse strongest magic spell can do really good demage.
Sometimes it was hard and so we rage quited.
But then I beated these bosses alone.
Story of 4 kidnaped princes was funny and good.
I like bosses.
Animal orbs are helpful.
Idk what to think about weapons becouse i havent seen more than 6 strenght or 5 idk.

The story is simple: an evil wizard creates chaos in a kingdom by stealing a huge crystal and kidnapping the four princesses. You play (when you are new) as one of the four knights. Each one has an unique magical hability: red has the lighting power, blue the ice power, orange the fire power and green the poison power. Then your mission is to progress all along the map defeating enemies and upgrading your character until the final boss.

Gameplay is really creative and unique: basically the game is a beat-em-up with weapons and magic. There is also a pet that might help you (there are 28 pets, and 29 if you buy Battleblock Theater). As I mentioned, each character has an unique hability that might help you on your journey. You can buy consumibles that will help you unlock new pets, weapons and areas. Apart from the story, you have an arena mode and a crappy minigame of surviving on a board. As consumibles you have bombs that help you destroy obstacles, a bow, health potions and a sandwich (TF2 reference??). The weapon's arsenal is huge, with weapons that can improve your stadistics. The Behemoth was really creative with this game. 

Graphically looks really good, like an old Flash game (basically the game was on Newgrounds), with a cartoonish style.

Soundtrack is well-made too, with a really envolving music. 

But what's the best of the game? Multiplayer. That's right, it has coop mode for all the game modes, and honestly it feels much amusing playing with three more friends rather than alone, no matter if it's story, arena or the minigame. 

If you want to get archievements and badges, this game is ideal for you. Archievements are, most of them, easy to get just by playing solo or with friends (some of them need a partner to be archieved). 

I think at full price game is not a bad deal. You pay 12‚Ç¨ for a game that you can spend hours and hours playing alone or with friends, with two DLCs that cost less than 1‚Ç¨ (still, I don't like the blacksmith). So if you buy it for full price, you won't regret it.

I must say that Castle Crashers has become one of my favourite indies of all time, and honestly is a great option to play with friends an entertaining game.",1670935401,1675343736,True,20,1,0.693059623241424561,0,True,False,False

But there have been so many times I've taken hits when they didn't even visually connect for that attack and my attacks seem to do nothing when I'm clearly positioned right to hit them. The more recent versions of the game's changes also soured the experience a lot for me. The new modes and menus are jarring to me as I was used to how they used to look.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The game looks great for a 2D game. There are a lot of funny jokes throughout the game, this includes a lot of potty humour (some people may not be into that), but there's different types of humour for everyone in this game.

Castle Crashers is a silly romp through colorful and beautiful, hand-drawn lands to collect all kinds of nifty little powerups while you become the strongest knight in the land and kiss all the princesses (unless your friends do first).

It's a tongue-in-cheek fusion of the best old beat-em-ups your dad wasted his quarters on. Double Dragon, Golden Axe, Turtles in Time, and many more all influence this game's play style. Each knight has its own variation of spells to learn and can be further customized through pets and weapons you find in-game which will be added to your armory.

Running different characters for unlocks and a variety of hard hitting spells makes the game so replay-able, even after months or years. Definitely worth playing with a group of friends just to beat the crap out of each other. It can get heated or turn into a ton of laughs during the princess battles.

Pros:
-Great combat
-Good music
-Variety of weapons and abilities

The game, as it came out a while back, felt short. I wished there was more to explorer. The only thing I feel can be a bit of a chore is the leveling system. Getting a max level character can be rewarding but takes forever.

Cons:
-Length of campaign

castle crashers is a action rpg/beat em up hybrid developed by the behemoth, the second game they ever released, however the steam version had the 2015 remastered version added on to the original with a free update. it's a side-scrolling beat em up with some pretty basic rpg elements tied to what character you use. there's a super mario world-like overworld you go through as you complete the game, and with 4-player co-op supported, this is an absolute blast to play online with friends. your progression is tied to your character, so a group of people playing can only go as far as whoever is the farthest in the story. it's a very simple concept but not something you always get with co-op games. the game isn't terribly long, as for most people a single playthrough will be coming in around 6-8 hours depending on a few factors. but for me the fun was playing other characters and grabbing all the achievements, while also playing the minigames that were added in the remastered version. the game is fun for a single playthrough, but playing again with other characters or weapons. I definitely rushed through this, as there was a lot more to do but after getting all the achievements, i didn't feel the need to try to get every character to lvl 99 or anything like that. overall, grabbing this game for $3 (or 80% off) is a steal and this is one of those games that are probably worth grabbing a four pack, as most people who have 3 people to gift the game to probably wouldn't regret it if they could all play together.",1672688259,1672688259,True,1,0,0.485011786222457886,0,True,False,False

With its retro graphics and simple, yet satisfying gameplay, it's a reminder of why we fell in love with gaming in the first place.

In a world where games are constantly pushing the envelope with cutting-edge graphics and complex mechanics, it's refreshing to play a game like Castle Crashers that hearkens back to a simpler time. The good ol' days of gaming were all about having fun, and that's exactly what Castle Crashers delivers.

As I hack and slash my way through castles and dungeons, I can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for the good ol' days of gaming. It's a feeling that I don't get from many modern games, and it's one that I cherish.

Overall, if you're looking for a fun and nostalgiciac gaming experience, look no further than Castle Crashers.
