Basic Review:
First, let's start with the basics of MOWAS2. Men of War in general is a RTS-based game where you take place in the WWII era. Either be it Japan, Britain, America, Germany, or Russia. My time on MOW is very limited, so I may not have the best review but it works for me. 

Modding:
The modding community is very well built and made. The modding system varies off on your computer and the workshop, so spend it wisely. I suggest some 3-5 mods for a good experience in the modding community. (Two main mods, and one or two smaller mods for patches or better quality of graphics.) The modding platform consists of mainly extra troopers, vehicles, and other such types of units. 

Gameplay:
The gameplay of Men of War is very straightforward, only needing slight brainpower to handle. You hold a left-click to select some units and right-click on an area to move them forward. Right-clicking next to barricades, broken down cars or tanks, buildings, or walls will make them border it. They will take spots and use them for cover. If you have a group of two or three units, put them in crater holes or cars. If you have five to six units, put them beside trucks, walls, and crater holes. If you have a total of ten units, put them inside buildings, behind broken-down tanks, and trucks, or put them beside bushes to set up an ambush. W-A-S-D may or may not work to move the camera, so it's just better to drag your mouse across your desk to move the camera. I highly doubt people on mobile or IPads will see this, so, I wouldn't worry about that. However to be nice, just drag your finger over the big screen to move the camera. (Hopefully.)

Every faction has a different set of weaponry. Spanding from the Second World War, stretching from Lugers to M1911 Machine Guns, there are very well lots of weapons to choose from. There are also lots of tanks, planes and also even artillery. 

Conclusion
Men of War is a very vast and expansive game. With lots of equipment, units, different mechanics to enform you and also lots of modding that you can choose. What I like about Men of War, is that they really tried with this game, and, to me it worked flawlessly. Sure, there may be a few bugs here and there, but in general the game is pretty fine and well shaped. Afterall, I only scratched the surface on what you're able to do in Men of War! Thank you for looking at my pointless ramble and review. :)",1602303116,1708208724,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

At its nucleus lies the perennial struggle for supremacy, wherein nation-states engage in a perpetual dance of strategic calculus, propelled by imperatives of security, resources, and influence. This essay endeavors to dissect the labyrinthine contours of geopolitical thought, delving into paradigms that elucidate the relentless interplay of statecraft on the world stage.

Historically, geopolitical thinkers such as Halford Mackinder and Nicholas Spykman have proffered seminal frameworks, positing the centrality of geographic determinism in shaping international affairs. Mackinder's Heartland Theory, a geopolitical sine qua non, contends that control over the Eurasian landmass confers dominion over the ""World-Island"" and, by extension, global hegemony. Conversely, Spykman's Rimland Theory challenges this orthodoxy, emphasizing maritime power and the pivotal role of coastal fringes in geopolitical maneuvering.

The geopolitical landscape, however, is not static; it evolves with the ebbs and flows of socio-political currents. The post-Cold War era ushered in a reevaluation of traditional paradigms, with scholars like Samuel Huntington introducing the clash of civilizations as a framework for understanding geopolitical fault lines. This paradigm posits that cultural and religious identities, rather than strictly territorial considerations, drive geopolitical conflicts in the contemporary era.

Furthermore, the rise of non-state actors and the asymmetrical nature of modern warfare have injected complexity into the geopolitical milieu. Transnational threats, be they cyber-espionage, terrorism, or pandemics, defy traditional state-centric analyses, necessitating a paradigm shift towards a more nuanced understanding of power dynamics in an interconnected world.

Moreover, economic forces exert a profound influence on geopolitical outcomes. The burgeoning significance of globalization has intertwined the fortunes of nations, rendering economic power an indispensable component of geopolitical ascendency. States strategically leverage economic instruments, such as trade agreements and sanctions, to wield influence and advance their geopolitical objectives.

In conclusion, geopolitical theory, a mélange of historical legacies and contemporary exigencies, provides a lens through which we discern the intricacies of global power dynamics. From the deterministic propositions of Mackinder to the cultural paradigms delineated by Huntington, the intellectual tapestry of geopolitical thought continues to evolve, mirroring the dynamic nature of international relations. In an era characterized by unprecedented connectivity and multifaceted threats, the imperative to comprehend and navigate the complexities of geopolitics remains paramount for policymakers and scholars alike.",1706843834,1706843834,True,2,2,0.501703202724456787,0,True,False,False

I've been trying for hours now to figure out where the skirmish is saved so I can force the map into the generic load file, but I can't figure that out either. 

And lord oh mighty! Good luck googling it because, for some reason, there's not a single video or thread explaining it.

I really like this game, a lot. it has brought me much satisfaction. The handling of the controls is rather simple and takes very little time to learn and practice. To me, this is one of the best games i have ever played and will continue to enjoy and play this title.

reasons why i like it is: 
-the intimate squad level to large scale troop control
-interface simplicity
-replay ability (being able to play multiple times over and over)
-satisfying tactical ability and strategy planning

cons: 
-enemy (AI) meat waves with no real point besides overwhelming force.
-weapon range is strange. can be fixed with ROBZ REALISM.
^^ beware, robz makes the game go from holding hands in the park to sprinting through no mans land.
-multiplayer combat can be super cheesy (like rage inducing cheesy)

Multiplayer: 
i personally don't care for it. people in every game look for the cheeser way to winning. this can be annoying if you are going to be rigid in your play style. there are ways around it. the way around it is, play the single player game. 

the game is also pretty dead, in terms of being able to just jump in a game and go.

The balancing of factions makes no sense. you destroy some tanks with an anti-personnel grenade but you can't destroy flack gun with a tank round. 
also might i add the AI is stupid beyond belief they can't drive, they have to reverse to turn 30 degrees to the left or right which is horrible when getting rushed by the OP grenades and the foot soldiers never notice when a grenade has been chucked at them and stand on top of it like dopes and when they try throw it back they send it into the wall in front of them killing themselves and everyone round them.

Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a hardcore tactical real-time strategy game that throws you into the brutal realities of World War II squad-based combat. It's not for the faint of heart, demanding careful planning, precise execution, and a healthy dose of luck to emerge victorious from its unforgiving battlefields.

Strengths:

Unparalleled Tactical Depth: Unlike other RTS games where you command large armies, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 focuses on small, tightly-knit squads. Every soldier under your command is an individual with strengths, weaknesses, and a fragile life hanging in the balance. Every decision you make, from cover placement to weapon selection, can have a profound impact on the outcome of a firefight.

Granular Realism: The game strives for an almost unsettling level of realism. Ballistics are meticulously simulated, meaning every shot matters. Friendly fire is a very real threat, and cover isn't just a suggestion – it's a necessity. You'll need to utilize terrain, flanking maneuvers, and combined arms tactics to overcome your enemies.

Intense Multiplayer: The game's multiplayer mode is where it truly shines. Coordinating with your squadmates to execute complex flanking maneuvers, laying down suppressing fire, and calling in devastating artillery strikes is a thrilling and rewarding experience.

Weaknesses:

Steep Learning Curve: The game's depth and complexity can be overwhelming for newcomers. The multitude of hotkeys, tactical options, and unforgiving mechanics can lead to a frustrating initial experience.
Technical Issues: The game can be prone to occasional bugs and glitches, which can be immersion-breaking in the heat of battle.
Repetitive Missions: While the core gameplay loop is engaging, some of the campaign missions can feel repetitive after a while, with similar objectives and settings.
Overall:

Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a challenging but rewarding tactical RTS experience for players who enjoy the intricacies of squad-based combat and the satisfaction of outsmarting their opponents. If you're willing to invest the time to learn its ropes and embrace its unforgiving nature, you'll find a deep and rewarding game that offers unparalleled tactical depth and an intense multiplayer experience.

Verdict: 4 out of 5 stars

Recommendation:

Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is recommended for hardcore RTS fans who enjoy a steep learning curve, realistic combat, and intense tactical challenges. If you're looking for a casual pick-up-and-play experience, you might want to look elsewhere.

Tips for New Players:

Start with the tutorials and training missions to learn the basics of the game's mechanics and controls.
Don't be afraid to experiment with different tactics and squad compositions.
Utilize cover to your advantage. Every soldier lost is a valuable asset gone.
Communication is key in multiplayer. Coordinate with your teammates to execute effective strategies.
Don't get discouraged by initial defeats. The game has a steep learning curve, but mastering its tactical depth is immensely rewarding.
I hope this review helps you decide whether Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is the right game for you.",1593768036,1704343816,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

this is one of th most unique RTS games out there! plus its good to boot! ive been playing rts games since return fire (DOS) and this is one of the best ive ever experienced. 

one of the most unique features is the direct control function. most rts games consist of move here, attack this, use this ability. however if th unit performs poorly then ur just SOL. in this game u can take control of th unit and take ur fate into ur own hands! wat do i mean? well if u take direct control of a tank then u drive it (wasd), control its facing with such,and can switch between its weapons while firing them manually which also allows u to see effective range markers and LOF. super frign dope imo.

theres a lot more to this game as well which make it stand out, like being able to look into a units inventory (which very few rts games allow), u can control stances (prone crouch, etc)stripping weapons and items from dead, heal dying units...like theres a lot to this game. the armor has dynamic points that can take damage so if ur tracks get damged ur stuck until u either hop out and fix it OR send a unit over to do th repairs. crew died but the armor is still not destoyed? cool, send a team to repair and recrew it, can even steal enemy armor if th crew is cleared :) infantry units usually have a field medic embedded in the teams, but if he goes down ur gona hafta use a different teams medic to save ur fallen men. ALSO u can mix and match infantry teams however u like! its pretty micro heavy but u can literally pull specific men from their unit. wana keep all ur medics together? pull each one outa their respective teams. want an entire smg squad? more of the same.  u can customize to ur hearts delight. dope


now for the big bad downside. this game offers no comp stomp skirmish. so outside of playing the missions there is no custom game function WITH AI, theres custom mp but for some reason th devs opted to leave out custom skirmishs vs computer. big whiff there. *edit* it exists, but only as a fugn paid dlc, big thumbs down, nearly un-recommended for that nickle and dime bs

also the missions and achievements all follow the same patterns. while each mission is fairly different in its own way (defend, assault, wave defense, elite infiltration and sabotage, etc), each faction has the same exact string of missions. 1st mission is a short defense followed by an all out assault, the second is a point capture assault, 3rd is a wave defense and so on. theres like 6 factions each with unique units which makes each experience unique, but the missions themselves are very cut and pastey.

this game is VERY micro intensive



there are newer titles  from this series like 'call to arms' but this is better even tho it doesnt allow first person which oddly makes this one better somehow

despite its flaws this game is awesome! im still fairly new to it (<20hrs) but am waaaaay psyched on this ish. if u like rts this is a solid add  for the ol library",1702398939,1702589219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am sort of a fanatic when it comes to WW2 era games and pledged my loyalty to Company of Heroes 1 and 2 and swore to myself it is hands down the best of its genre in this age and time. I had been playing CoH for many years(13) on and off. Eventually I got an insane itch to buy a new WW2 era game and came across this one, noticing an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating score while viewing trailers and reading the game descriptions. 

         I have never been so wrong about what I pledged. I purchased and played MoW: AS2 for HOURS. It is a tremendous, colossal, ridiculously good improvement. Albeit, there are pros and cons, but when you run into anything distasteful while playing this game  just exit game, visit the workshop, and turn support the committed MODDING community.

However, this game is has a huge learning curve that I delightfully highly enjoyed in contrast to Company of Heroes 1 & 2 micro-management learning curve is not as intensive as Men of War Assault Squad 2, I feel the players playing Ranked & Unranked online Matches are bit too intense with the tension of wining while forgetting to enjoy this WW2 game as it is because this game's mechanics is one pearl that live beyond ahead of it's time.

The game is a little [i]like[/i] CoH if you've played that.
What I really enjoy is taking over a unit for the kill shot.  Watching that AP round punch through the side of a tank and seconds later the turret blowing off is pretty darn satisfying.
This game runs fine and is stable I would say.  I haven't crashed.
There a few buggy things like some pathing and units can stall a second in single player.   
Graphics, sounds and campaigns are good.  The normal speed seems fast.
I cannot play on normal speed most of the time.  I micro too much and am just slow so no PVP.
It would be cool to FP when you take command of your solder or tank.  MoW2 will have that feature I believe.
I picked a few mods to see how they are and wow, these mod Dev's are something.
The workshop adds so much but you still might want to pick up DLCs.  Personally I would wait for a sale.  
Have had plenty fun in the hours I've played.

• The Graphics is extremely annoying, because they don't offer to zoom the user interface. Therefore, you have to select something like 1024x768 to be able to read the UI texts.
• Of course, you could select a high screen resolution with great graphics, but then, you can no longer read the texts on the UI because it is extremely small.
• The usability is very annoying, because it has only very limited commands which can be assigned to keys.

• The game has no support and the game is often crashing if you try to save the game.

[h2]Rating: ★★★★☆[/h2]

Playing Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is like orchestrating a symphony of chaos where your soldiers are both the musicians and the stuntmen. It's a tactical dance of bullets, explosions, and occasionally soldiers performing unexpected aerial maneuvers that would make Cirque du Soleil proud. Grab your helmet, it's time for a strategic circus!

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

1. [b]Deep Tactical Gameplay:[/b] Men of War: Assault Squad 2 isn't just a game; it's a thinking person's battlefield. Planning your moves is like playing chess, but with tanks, snipers, and the occasional airborne soldier.

2. [b]Realistic Physics:[/b] The physics engine is a comedic genius. It's like watching a physics-based comedy show where soldiers occasionally defy gravity in the most unexpected ways, adding a touch of humor to the battlefield.

3. [b]Variety of Units:[/b] The game offers a vast array of units, from infantry squads to tanks and artillery. It's like having a tactical toolbox where every unit is a different tool for wreaking havoc.

4. [b]Multiplayer Mayhem:[/b] Multiplayer mode is like entering a strategic battleground where every opponent is a cunning tactician. It's a pixelated chessboard where the pieces are armed to the teeth.

5. [b]Modding Community:[/b] Men of War: Assault Squad 2 has a vibrant modding community. It's like having access to an ever-expanding toy chest, where new maps, units, and scenarios keep the game fresh.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

1. [b]Steep Learning Curve:[/b] The learning curve is like scaling a tactical mountain. Newcomers might feel like they're navigating a minefield of buttons and commands until they master the art of war.

2. [b]Occasional Pathfinding Issues:[/b] Soldiers, while generally competent, can occasionally channel their inner clowns with questionable pathfinding decisions. It's like watching a pixelated circus act where soldiers take the scenic route to battle.

3. [b]Graphics Showing Age:[/b] The graphics, while functional, have aged a bit. It's like watching an old war movie; the storytelling is excellent, but you occasionally notice the wrinkles.

4. [b]Micro-Management Intensity:[/b] The game can be intense on the micro-management front. It's like conducting an orchestra, but instead of instruments, you're coordinating soldiers, tanks, and artillery.

5. [b]Single-Player AI Quirks:[/b] While formidable, the single-player AI can occasionally exhibit quirks. It's like sparring with an unpredictable opponent who occasionally throws a surprise punch.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]

Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a tactical masterpiece that balances realism with a touch of strategic absurdity. Whether you're orchestrating intricate maneuvers or chuckling at soldiers defying physics, it's a battlefield ballet that keeps you engaged.

[quote=][i]In the echoing words of a radio operator, ""We need artillery support, over!"" Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is not just a plea for artillery; it's a reminder that in the chaos of war, sometimes you need a pixelated symphony of explosions to turn the tide in your favor.[/i][/quote]",1696268722,1696326628,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a World War II general in charge of a bunch of troops who seem to think grenades are the answer to every problem, this game will give you the answer. It's like herding cats, but the cats are armed to the teeth and have a strong desire to blow things up. First, let's talk about the graphics. They're like a fine wine that's been aged in a rusty tank. But who needs fancy graphics when you can witness the glorious spectacle of a tank doing an elegant pirouette after hitting a landmine? It's like watching ballet but with more explosions and fewer tutus. The realism in this game is off the charts. Your soldiers will take cover behind anything and everything, including the world's flimsiest wooden fence that somehow provides impenetrable protection from heavy machine gun fire. You'll also learn that the quickest way to disarm a tank is to throw a hand grenade at it. Logic? Who needs it? Now, let's talk about the AI. Your troops will either be brilliant tactical masterminds, taking cover and flanking enemies with precision, or they'll decide to go for a swim in the middle of a firefight. It's like playing Russian roulette with your own army. The best part of Men of War Assault Squad 2 is the physics engine. Tanks flip over, buildings crumble, and soldiers go flying like they're auditioning for a superhero movie. It's a physics-based comedy show that will leave you in stitches. And the multiplayer? It's a battle of wits and explosives. You and your friends can team up to conquer the world or accidentally blow each other to smithereens. It's like playing a game of chess where the chess pieces have rocket launchers. Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a game that will have you laughing, crying, and questioning the laws of physics all at once. It's a delightful romp through World War II where strategy meets slapstick, and where every battle is a chance to witness the most improbable and hilarious moments in gaming history. So, grab your helmet, rally your troops, and get ready for a war unlike any other—one where the only rule is that there are no rules, and where the explosions are always bigger than you expect.",1695651817,1695651817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Men of War: Assault Squad 2, developed by Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Entertainment, is a tactical real-time strategy game that places players in the heart of intense World War II battles. As a fan of strategic warfare games, I'm excited to share my review of this exceptional title.

Gameplay (4.5/5):
Men of War: Assault Squad 2 excels in delivering a visceral and authentic World War II experience. The game features a robust single-player campaign that spans various theaters of war, from the Eastern Front to the Pacific Theater. It also offers skirmish and multiplayer modes that provide a wealth of replayability.

The core gameplay revolves around commanding a small squad of soldiers or controlling individual units, each with distinct abilities and roles. The level of detail in unit management is remarkable, allowing players to perform tasks such as loading artillery, repairing tanks, or sniping enemy troops. The emphasis on tactics, cover, and resource management makes for deeply engaging and challenging gameplay.

Graphics and Sound (4/5):
Visually, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 presents detailed environments and authentic vehicle models that capture the essence of World War II warfare. The game's physics engine adds a layer of realism, with destructible environments and vehicles responding realistically to damage.

The sound design is impressive, with authentic weapon sounds, explosions, and ambient battlefield noise immersing players in the chaos of war. The orchestral soundtrack complements the action, enhancing the game's atmosphere.

Realism and Authenticity (4.5/5):
One of the game's standout features is its commitment to realism and authenticity. The attention to historical accuracy, from the weaponry to the uniforms, is commendable. The inclusion of realistic ballistics, vehicle mechanics, and destructible terrain adds depth to the gameplay.

The game also embraces asymmetrical warfare, with different factions and units possessing unique strengths and weaknesses. This forces players to adapt their strategies based on the faction they choose and the mission at hand, adding a layer of complexity and depth to the experience.

Community and Modding (5/5):
Men of War: Assault Squad 2 boasts a vibrant modding community that has created a wealth of user-generated content. Players can find a wide array of mods, including new maps, missions, factions, and even total conversions. This extends the game's lifespan significantly and allows players to tailor their experience to their preferences.

Conclusion (4.5/5):
Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a tactical warfare masterpiece that caters to fans of World War II strategy games. Its focus on realism, attention to detail, and commitment to historical accuracy set it apart in the genre. Whether you're a fan of solo campaigns, challenging skirmishes, or competitive multiplayer battles, the game offers a multifaceted and deeply satisfying gaming experience. It's a testament to the enduring appeal of authentic and engaging real-time strategy warfare.",1695373509,1695373509,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) The editor is great. You can run tons of simulations with different battles over and over, if you learn some basic editor stuff (like endless armies) you can really do a lot. This is probably the best part of the game for how much you can do with it.
2) The base game missions are fairly fun. Admittedly, they can get quite repetitive between countries, but at least your first few are quite interesting and have some nuance to the strategy involved. 
3) When it works*****, the multiplayer is incredibly fun.
4) Mods. They are incredible, with massive variety allowing you to play different scenarios from the american revolutionary war to warhammer 40k
Now on to the cons, of which there are two major ones I'd like to mention here
1) This is likely something you've seen ad nauseam if you've been reading reviews for this game, but a big con is that bots and skirmish mode are not part of the base game. They require DLC. Again, you've likely already seen this but it's scummy enough of a move that I would feel wrong not mentioning it in a review.
2) And 2 is a very big one. While the multiplayer is very fun, it has some extremely significant weaknesses. In order to outline this, I'll go through a typical session of multiplayer for someone new to the game. So, you're new, you load into the lobby selection you get into a game and -you're kicked- you notice a lot of the lobbies don't even let someone in whose at your level. In fact, most of the lobbies you join (70-80%) kick you. You may spend upwards of 20 minutes just trying to get into a lobby at all that doesn't kick you instantly. On a bad day, it can even take 40 mins or more. If you have bad ping (>100 ms) this is even longer and if your ping is greater than 200 ms, you are unlikely to get into a lobby at all. Let's say you're patient enough (or lucky enough) to find your way into a lobby. After 10 minutes, the slots in the lobby get filled and your host starts up the game. You're enjoying yourself and liking game and it's strategy when all of a sudden, your teammate leaves. Maybe they made a mistake and raged, maybe their connection cut. Either way, you're down a player. And another the moment that your other teammate realizes it. You try to stay in order to play out the game, only to get absolutely squashed flat by the combined power of 3 other people with 50x the number of hours you have in the game. Even in games where your own teammate doesn't leave, often somebody on the enemy team will, which ruins the game just as much. Being conservative, I'd say that about 40% of games have at least one person leave, and often more. Sometimes, you'll get that euphoric experience of playing and winning (or even losing) that perfect game where you coordinated with your team and used strategy and had an overall amazing rts experience, but this is not most games, hell, it isn't even a good number of games. This is the rare minority of games if you are a new player.

Overall, there are many reasons to love this game, but if you're in it for the multiplayer in particular, be prepared for what that entails.",1690652160,1690652160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have only played a few single player campaign missions (wtf skirmish mode is paywalled? are the devs call center scammers? no they clearly cared too much because they included weird features) and to be completely honest they are super lazy. Basically two of the missions I played were the exact same mission. There is no loving voice acting or really any sort of tutorial so the entire experience could easily be a turnoff for a player, The missions have cruddy unskippable cut-scenes where normally a tank blows up and you are told to go capture the tank, This seems to involve moving to the tank and using a ""repair kit item"" on the tank, but to be honest one of the tanks I was trying to repair took too long so I just quit and moved to a different mission (did one guy working on the tank slow things down? Should I have found more squads and repair men to repair the tank?). 

This abrasive intro to the game hides some of the bizarre features the game includes. Such as every soldier apparently having a diablo (tetris, dayz, cell based) style inventory that they can use to carry ammo and shells around. Or the fact that each little soldier is their own independent unit that will (so appears to the user) get auto assigned to a squad when selected with other solders or vehicles. One of the really cool features the game has (Direct control of vehicles) is just a feature you have to find by clicking on all the buttons until you find it. All of these features are great for lifeless idiots like myself who would explore them, but really just sort of an annoying waste of time for anyone who's time has value. 

Even as a lifeless idiot I didn't really care enough to see if you could create some bizzare mega inventory by loading up individual soldiers and then combining them into a squad. So while I know the inventory system exists, I don't know how it works. 

Maybe it was me just blindly clicking until there were guys shooting at each other and ending up on a truly pathetic difficulty level but it seemed that the computer opponents in missions were pathetically easy to kill and my own guys would never die if I just kept them in cover. Either way, game appeared super boring because the main challenge seemed to be determining what sort of idiot savant-like brain damage the game devs who made this game (a decade ago it seems?) were coping with. I have read a comment on this game that they attempted simulation over casual enjoyment, I respect the attempt to build simulation but you would think they would have tried to make that evident somehow (""player, please look at these features we included""). 

Maybe I just don't understand the depth of the game, but I don't really want to. If I were even more lifeless than I already I am, I might.
 
I don't regret the purchase because it was a 5 dollar whim. Poor execution, interesting mechanics, sloppy package all together, 1/5 gameplay, 3/5 creativity. 4/10 together.

You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hope and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.

Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.

But this is the year 1944! Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to Victory!

I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory!

Good luck! And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.",1690010180,1690010180,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The devs have tried to recreate the same game in CTA and MoW2, but honestly I really cannot imagine that they can ever top what they did in this game. Its really a perfect mix of everything.

I wont go over the gameplay itself honestly, its just a good RTS game that provides an individual unit management system, and dynamic armor penetration mechanics. Its realistic, but in a way that still maintains a semblance of fun.

The modding scene is mostly active, with the majority of the great mods being made a few years ago, as it goes for older games. My own personal Favorite mod being ""WW2"" by Renya. It adds a dozen of new factions (that really should have been in the game by default to be honest), without changing the gameplay i love so much.

Overall the game is great, the DLC is useless and only serves to lock content behind a paywall for no reason. 

Do not buy the game normally, always buy this on sale, and in the bundle. If you pay $10 for each DLC, I will personally find you and take all of your money.

Otherwise you will not have all the content the game offers. I Hate DLC based games so much.",1484508131,1689861099,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

No building barracks to spawn men who you control as a group and have generic HP bar that you can buy upgrades for etc. No running around trying to secure resource so you can build more building etc. Its just raw combat where every soldier has stats, inventory and a name. You can direct control every unit, pick up guns of the enemy, and so much more.

when it does work, the gameplay is quite good, although the bot enemy usually devolves into spamming one kind of unit and will not try to counter tanks or cars, they instead choose to spam t34s or pz4s. 

multiplayer seems to perform far better than singleplayer, ironically, although the multiplayer scene is very laggy and is usually prowled by 4000 hour pros who have had the game longer than you've been born

You can make use of the multiplayer which is the same as the campaign but instead of fighting the ai you fight other players.  Or you can go into the Editor where you have the freedom to make your own maps or use other pre made maps and form your own battles and scripts as you see fit, although it does take a while to work out how to use fully. There are an abundance of mods as well to use alongside this game, most notably the star wars mod which as oyu might already be able to tell, turns the game into star wars and give you the use of everything star wars based in the editor.

You can play solo or co-op campaigns, skirmishes and missions, or compete online with other players. You can control every unit directly or command large armies from above. You can choose from many different factions, vehicles, weapons and maps.

The game is not flawless, though. It has some bugs, crashes and performance issues. The graphics are outdated and the interface is clunky. The game can be very hard and frustrating, especially for newbies. The AI can be either too dumb or too smart, depending on the difficulty. 

But I still love this game. I have spent 100 hours playing it and I still enjoy it. The single player mode is awesome and a great time waster. The game has a lot of depth and variety and it never gets old. I love commanding my troops and seeing them do what I want. The game also has a lot of mods and custom maps that add more content and fun.

So if you are into realistic and challenging WW2 strategy games, you should give Men of War: Assault Squad 2 a try. It is not for everyone, but if you can handle its flaws and learn its mechanics, you will have a blast with it. It is a good game in the genre and it has a lot of replay value. If you can get it whilst it's on sale. that's even better.

The game features stunning graphics, realistic physics, and a variety of playable factions each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.

One of the most impressive aspects of the game is the level of detail put into the gameplay mechanics. Players have full control over their units, from choosing which weapons to use to determining their exact position on the battlefield. This level of control allows for a highly strategic experience where players must carefully plan out their tactics in order to achieve victory.

The game also has a fantastic variety of modes, including skirmish, multiplayer, and cooperative play. Each mode offers a unique and engaging experience that will keep players coming back for more.

Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is the attention to historical accuracy. The game takes place during World War II and features accurate models of tanks, planes, and other vehicles used during the conflict. Additionally, the game features historically accurate environments, allowing players to immerse themselves in the era and feel as if they are part of the action.

Overall, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is an outstanding game that blends intense strategy gameplay with historical accuracy and stunning visuals. It is a must-play for anyone who loves strategy games or World War II history.",1677607884,1682629067,True,8,0,0.574966192245483398,0,True,False,False

This is my favorite game of all time. Better than Company of Heroes in my opinion. This game represents a good portion of my childhood. I watched YouTubers like Diplexheated play this game religiously until I was able to acquire a laptop. terrible platform, I could barely run the game on the lowest graphic settings at a tolerable frame rate but I still did it. The creativity that the MOW AS 2 community had when it came to mods and designing mission in the gem editor is comparable to next to no other video game franchise. Although I know RTS is sort of a niche genre of the video game industry it will always be my favorite. 

There are very reasonable complaints people have with the game, especially with the dev team and poor communication that is certainly valid. The disgusting amount of greed related to putting AI skirmishes behind a pay wall is something I was not able to afford and because of that never bought it. I pray the devs learned their lesson with the release of MOW 2. I am very excited to see the future. CTA - GOH: Ostfront is a good example of what was able to come from this community.A game that is not without its flaws, but still phenomenal in my opinion.

Anything past Assault Squad 2, is just archaic at this point - it either looks like sh** or doesn't play too well, games like the OG Man of War, Faces of War, Assault Squad 1, etc.

Unfortunately, Assault Squad 2 is not getting any younger by the day lol, while the game is highly moddable, its 32-bit nature keeps it from being TOO modding friendly, as most workshop mods push the engine to the limit, and it sh**s itself when doing anything too intense.

While we do have more modern alternatives running on 64-bit upgraded engine, as say Call to Arms or Gates of Hell, those games just don't have the RIGHT amount of fun on them.
You see, Assault Squad 2 got a lot on the table, the table may be weak, but it's defintely got a lot on its plate - from the vanilla basegame, you can pick whatever major faction you want: germans, japanese, americans, british. Then you can either play the Skirmish maps, which is like a connquer the map mode, as you unlock more powerful units the farther you go, or play matches against the AI (or jump into MP, as well).
On the maps, you have lots of variety: you have french towns, russian villages, industrial complexes etc. Snowy maps, desert maps etc. Something both CtA and GoH lacks, as their maps are rather dull.

And while the graphics may be a lilttle bit dated, the gameplay is both realisticaly complex and smoothly arcadeish - something that the modern alternative, Gates of Hell, unfortunately craves into a more realistic experience, and such, sometimes matches just aren't as fun as AS2.

But unlike other previous Men of War games THE MULTIPLAYER WORKS!!!!..... kinda. And the single player isn't half bad either. It also has a DLC for all the missions from the original Men of War game. (Also runs surprisingly well on the Steam Deck)

 Although the single player missions do at times become repetitive as the map layouts and objectives are usually the same. And the exact same missions from Assault Squad 1 with a shinny coat of paint. However it does come with a handful of the AS1 dlc missions free of charge so that's something. Can even play them online in CO-OP. 

The actual game mechanics are janky but mostly adequate. Vehicles sometimes take less than desirable paths to reach objectives and sometimes there's a brief delay between you ordering your units to do things and them actually doing things. But overall nothing to major. 

All the faction unit diversity is cool. Each of the factions have their own historically accurate Tanks, APCs, infantry squads, artillery and even a few special units with no comparable adversary. For example the UK can call in ANZACs, The Americans have a flamethrower tank, Soviets have penal battalions, etc. It's just super cool how each faction has 5-7 unique infantry squads with skins, weapons and in some cases anti tank equipment. The amount of battles featuring the best of the best or the worst of the worst for these factions leads to some intense gun fights. 

It makes combined Arms warfare fun. Tell your conscripts to get on your tanks, mass a large force of multiple tanks, self Propelled guns, APCs and armored cars, then send  them to a fortified objective and see if you planned well enough to take it. 

Some factions are more ""OP"" than others but the categories of squads, tanks, and guns all make it balanced. Or as balanced as a war can be. The Soviets might have have the most armored heavy tanks but if its under multiple artillery fire from any of the larger Japanese or German guns they'll explode like any other vehicle. 

Multiplayer - lots of game modes and people are still playing. Going head to head with people that put 1000+ in this game can be a daunting task but, his men will die just as easily as yours. And if you don;t want to do that you can join a 6 v 6 and just try to manage your small front. But you can also do the single player campaign missions on co-op so that's cool too. 

It's a bit more technical than company of Heros, also a lot deeper in mechanics.

This game is one of my favorite RTS games out there. The awesome modability mixed with a highly replayable and a quite fun gameplay turns this game into what most people on the RTS community calls it one of the best World War II RTS games out there if not the best World War II RTS game ever made.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
If you're familiar with other Men of War games then this game is pretty much the same but if you're not, The game is basically a more realistic version of Company of Heroes 2 with a plentiful amounts of mods. Although sometimes I get bored by the gameplay pretty easily because the game feels the same as the older men of war games. The same graphics, the same atmosphere, and the same gameplay. I do hope that the upcoming Men of War II would not be a reskin but a whole different game.

[h1] Singleplayer and Multiplayer. [/h1] 
The game is actually still pretty populated for a game that's almost 9 years old by this point. You will find it quite easy to find players to play with. If you're looking to play this game with bots then you're sadly out of luck. The game doesn't have bots to play on skirmish but it does have a campaign. While the campaign isn't as good as Company of Heroes 2's campaign it's still a good addition to the game.

[h1] Modability [/h1] 
This game is like the Garry's Mod of Real Time Strategy games/ There are plenty of mods to try on such as a World War 1 Mod, an American Revolution mod, a Chinese Civil War mod, a Spanish Civil War mod, a Russian Civil War mods and many other awesome mods that you could try on. The game has steam workshop support which makes it very easy if you want to download and install mods for the game. You'll never get bored by the plentiful amounts of amazing mods for this game.

[h1] Suggestion [/h1] 
If you're looking for a decent World War II Real time strategy game to try on then this would actually be a decent choice for you. And on steam sales, most of the time the game's price goes pretty cheap as well. Overall I do highly recommend this game.",1669783798,1676712005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A traditionally WW2-oriented RTS that is rather unique in its formula (at least compared to my experience), more closely resembling tabletop board games with points limits and whatnot.  Gameplay is usually centered more around territory control to win, sans the additional income derived from map nodes from Company of Heroes or Dawn of War, which is the closest comparison I can draw considering standard resource-gathering RTS elements are non-existent here.  If worrying about economy irritates you and you want to get straight into the combat, this is probably a game for you.  Income is a fixed limit, with only some casualty trickle-back, so figuring out your army composition and point effectiveness is necessary so you don't start hemorrhaging resources.

Also akin to CoH is the ability to capture enemy equipment, though I'd argue that it's a much more prevalent in this game and probably one of the things that come to mind when bringing this game up, but there's also veterancy as well.  Unlike CoH, the game is of a less arcade-y nature, fatality rates are much higher here and the game is more brutal when it has the mind to be.  Gone are the days of consistent shell-bouncing (unless you're angling your shot poorly or at a heavily armored location with a lighter than required caliber), taking on a War Thunder-esque armor/penetration model; if you hit a tank in a vulnerable spot with sufficient caliber, expect it to go up in smoke, especially if you hit the engine or ammo rack.  Infantry are also much more squishy and meat-grinders akin to Normandy or Stalingrad can become a common sight unless you take every precaution you can to preserve your manpower.
As a footnote, there's also the option to directly control models, which is also a memorable staple of the game.  Among your other soldiers, now you too can be the tank ace you always wanted to be, which can even turn the tide of an engagement due to more fine controls than the AI. (Not to mention the exploits regarding the aiming reticle, figure that one out yourself.)

The game is excellent in my opinion, though the GEM engine is a bit janky and sometimes the AI-controlled units do questionable things unless you're babysitting them constantly, but what you're getting out of this game I think is well worth it if you can work around this.  Additionally, the workshop supports a wide variety of mods, ranging from; more modern conflicts, a wider array of WW2 factions, earlier conflicts as far back as musket and shot, and fictional universes including but not limited to Star Wars and Warhammer 40k.  There's a lot here for you, and I would've probably paid full price had I not dealt with the earlier two renditions, which more or less was buying the same game over and over with more tinkering done to the engine and mechanics added.
My only outstanding issue with this game is with the Airborne DLC.  Paying for skirmish AI outside of prebuilt missions and whatnot is ridiculous.  Even with as much of a micro-transaction nightmare as Company of Heroes 2 was, it didn't put a paywall on bots outside of the campaign.",1676057107,1676057107,True,2,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

In reviewing that game I compared it to Avalon Hill's original Squad Leader and its best PC gaming inheritor, the Combat Mission series. In that regard, Company of Heroes is very playable with decent AI, but maybe not as realistic in physics and combat resolution as Combat Mission. MoW: Assault Squad 2 is similarly playable, has more realistic physics and combat resolution, but requires almost mind-numbing amounts of micro-management to travel or attack in any kind of formation. Nothing here even resembles bounding in attack move for a platoon. To be fair, that is true with multiple platoons in CoH, but it seems even harder here with even a single platoon, requiring moving individual soldiers like some FPS game! It also has some bugs that I think come with its age, e.g., units getting stuck forever in buildings or being unable to find a path around a rock. That said, it seems to have many more challenging single-player scenarios to choose from with a superb variety of unit types and countries available for less than the cost of CoH2. It's also much easier to get to using some advanced heavy armor in these scenarios than comparable CoH ToW scenarios, other than maybe the limited campaigns. Now for the challenge to both (MoW and CoH) of these platforms: I'd love to see future campaign modes where we can use some better strategic maneuvering on a divisional-level map and then drilling down to the tactical combat. CoH2 introduced that, but it felt too simplistic and more like playing a really weak version of Axis and Allies than a good old AH or Strategy and Tactics game.",1673814602,1673814602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend some mods like: RobZ Realism mod if you want a harsh realistic experience,

#Valour if you think robz is too hard but still want realism 

or UMW40K if you want some warhammer 40k experience, and there still plenty of more.

I can only recommend this game but it is not for everyone.

Okay now the real reason to buy, BUY THIS FOR MODS. I can not make it more simple, I have put in hours with modern armies and creating scenarios like why not make America and Russia be against Germany a third time right?, but modern! Or why not download the awesome Galaxy at War Star Wars mod and send an army of droids to take over Naboo or maybe stop the rebellion, OR OR have clones vs storm troopers?! Maybe you are a fan of Killzone, mod for that, Gears of War? mod for that now (still needs a lot of work), Want to revisit Vietnam? Mod, Shoot maybe you like american civil war history or muskets, mod (I think its on the civil war). I don't recall a Halo one, but I know Call to Arms has one, the point being, mods are where this game shines. Here is a popular example, think of how Fallout 4 and Skyrim are just so much better with mods, THAT IS THIS HERE. Maybe wait for a sale to be honest, because you can snag this for around $12 sometimes and I don't believe you need the dlcs to enjoy mods.

ALSO!! side note: You can also check the workshop out or Moddb to see for yourself, some mods are bare and haven't been updated, some mods haven't been updated but are close enough to be considered ""done"" or ""good enough"", with some still being worked on, others ""TBD"" but who knows where in oblivion they fell.

Explanations for objectives and what you are supposed to do is extremely poor.  Controls are terrible.

No training/tutorial was given.  In the first mission you play as the resistance so you very poorly armed requiring you to kill far better armed soldiers and then take their things.

Sure its old by now, but so is gta 5, and honestly ive had alot more fun commanding my men to victory with the heavy chance of failure than responding after jumping off of a building tired of shooting pedestrians. I give alot of praise to this game, I mean this is the kinda stuff that makes you wanna research more and more of what actually happened on those fields so that you may more accuratly deploy your units.

RobZ Realism mod. 
I will not lie if I open all the cards in front of you at once: this is not even a review of this game. No, it's not. 
This will be a little story about this amazing mod and how it made a martyr out of me.

The installation was not long. I quickly turned on the game and drove the first match with bots. 
And it seemed to me that this was the best thing that happened to Men of War. What delicious sounds. What special effects. Realism. The balance. How many new units. And how tanks began to behave here... mmmmmm... But first impressions, as always, are deceiving. The bots were at an normal level, there were 2 of them. I barely won. But I felt that I had to give it a try something harder.

And I did. 

Three bots on the hardest level. 
I'm smiling like an idiot, because I expect a hard, but victory. And a map with a rather specific relief. In the original MoWAS2 it was just for a snack.
I play for the Germans. And the first infantry battle begins. 
Elite troops ran towards the central point. A bunch of STG44, MG42 saw, and automatic carbines. The elite of the elite. 350 points worth. 
The battle began.  
My idiots hid behind cover... and fell from the delicious headshots of some defective troops for 120 points...
The map is empty from my men. 
I don't understand what happened.
I sent a little weaker infantry, craning my stupid face.
They was not hiding behind cover, but was are already lying down and shooting enemies. Yes, the first rule of the mod - covers here are trivially more dangerous than a bare field.

Okay. Let's go with light vehicles. I took my favorite 222 Sonderkrautzeug with a 20mm cannon, a mobile armored vehicle that scatters infantry in the beginning... 
It was mobile... Now it's a slow piece of shit that runs out of ammo fast...
Btw, I lead it into battle, hide behind a hut and mow down the infantry a little bit. Enemy soldier runs out, fires a AT rifle from 999 km away and tears my 222 to pieces... My face paled.

Here come the tanks. Well, brace yourselves! I'll take a Panzerkampfwagen IV. 75mm gun, good armor. It's beautiful in the original. It goes out on the road... and blows up. Gets blown up by a fucking 37mm Stuart shell. It blows up so that half of the infantry near this tank also goes to the next world...
Seriously, by fucking Stuart?
At these moments, my eye began to twitch slightly, but I still held on, trying to understand what happened.

I decided not to play around and took my favorite Stug III. In the original, this machine of death was an imbalanced - the front armor had a 45-degree slope, so everything that flew into it, calmly ricocheted...
It lived here for 10 minutes... against a fucking Sherman 76mm... got its adamantium forehead armor...
I started to have a lot of questions. 
Infantry are worthless here. Armored vehicles are canned goods. Artillery is a slow shit with 3-15 rounds. Tanks are slow and cardboard shit. How am I supposed to play with all that against a ton of Shermans and Sluggers with 90mm tubes?
 How about something heavier?
Ok, I've saved up for a Tiger Veteran.   
Here comes the American Slugger. 
My Tiger fired. Misses.
Slugger in that moment turns his turret around.
Shot fired again. A ricochet. Bad luck again.
Slugger shots and smashed the tracks of the Tiger and tore to pieces 2 tankmen inside.
I shot again. It's a hit. But someone in there still alive.
Slugger fired a shot and the Tiger blew to pieces...

I got more and more questions, and I tore out most of the hair on my ass.

I saved up points for the KingTiger, the most unbalanced tank in the game. I'm laughing hysterically. Its litterally  a fucking Battlestar Galactica, a fucking Death Star of this game.
I see Sherman on the right. 
Targeting. The turret takes a very, very long time to turn.
Sherman stopped at a distance sufficient for a shot.
The tiger turret is still spinning.
Sherman is turning his turret.
My tiger's still got his fucking turret spinning.
Sherman's fucking up. Tears up a couple of tankmen inside, and cuts the Tiger through like plywood.
My turret's still fucking spinning. 
Sherman fires, and my King Cardboard Tiger gets ripped to shreds. Literally. Something happens that can never happen in the original - the tower flies into space, everything else turns into burning scrap metal.

And this - in all my matches. 

I played with real people and sat around godlessly because of spam Shermans. And they dont give a shit on my Tigers. Flamethrowers. My infantry, 88mm Flak. None of them gave a shit. It was like they ignored me, didn't even notice me. 
I spent thousands of points, used the terrain, but the enemy was open to fuck - he was firing cheap shermans in the forehead and tearing my heavy tanks to pieces.

What had worked before went to hell.

At one point.
I played with bots for the Japanese. Infantry pure nation with sucker tanks. I held my own against 3 tough US. 
I took a line of defense, put a bunch of artillery, infantry and tank fighters. 
And the moment came when the points stopped coming. 
I smiled. Yeah, I can't call in reinforcements, but neither can the enemy. I've got the Mannerheim fucking Line up the hill here, and this AI idiot's got nothing. 

...


Three waves.  I withstood 3 waves with my bare feet without reinforcements... Each of 5-8 tanks and up to a hundred infantry...
I somehow survived by a miracle. 
Wiping sweat from my ass, I still tried to understand what was happening. The game shouldn't work like that. The computer is spending points that it shouldn't have. It sends tanks and people in crazy numbers that shouldn't be there. What the hell? 

Gametime - 90 minutes
I'm at zero. People are out of ammo, tanks have only armor-piercing shells, guns are empty. 
It's only a matter of time
and the infantry spots 12 tanks with a few hundred men coming out 
and just fucking demolish my entire line...

It's hard to say where the smoke from my ass was visible. I've never seen such a brutal rape before. It was so unbalanced, it fucked me up. The computer had infinite points.

I wanna banged the keyboard a couple of times, which I hadn't done in 10 years for sure. Nothing has pissed me off like that for a long time. It's hard to piss me off in general, but this mod did it.

But I was drawn to continue to turn on this piece of crap and play on. And burn with it. I don't know what it is.
And then it hit me.
This game is a friendzone. Yes, you read that right. When she writes you that ""you are a good friend"" and ""that I would like to have a boyfriend like you"", but your head just explodes ""fuck, what her are talking about? How i need to understand that? Why its so painful?"". But you calm down when she writes you ""Lets go to the park"" in next 5 hours and so on for eternity. You are a hostage of this very bad relationships. Like with this game.
It's a mod in which you are always in pain. It has you always and everywhere, your every action is wood in your ass stove. It's masochism in its purest form. 
Before every match, i want call to parents and tell them ""Mom, dad, i love you, farewell"" as if it were my last hour of life.
This mod is a message from satan that we are unwanted God childrens on this Earth.
It slowly drives you crazy. One blown up KingTiger and you remember horrible moments from your life, how you may have been beaten or humiliated. All your infantry fell - and you laugh through tears at the screen. Three Yadpanters were blown up in a minute - and you lie in the fetal position for several hours, not answering calls and messages. If this game were a person, it would be a burly bearded man pissing on you while you cry and call for your mommy.
I don't know what I did to deserve to play this mod. Maybe for some sins. Maybe I didn't give a homeless man a penny. I didn't buy some child an ice cream. 
So if you have lost s&m whip at home, buy and download it
If you hate yourself - download it.
Recommend it to your enemies.

Anyway

MoW is a great franchise.  It's similar to the Company of Heroes franchise, but it's significantly better.  The squad-based mechanics are far superior.  You can get by playing on a macro/squad-level scale most of the time, but there's also the capability to get down to micromanaging an individual soldier down to aiming for him.  The mix of macro/micro is great in my opinion.  I find myself occasionally directly controlling a specific solider, gun, or tank for some reasons, but it NEVER feels tedious.  It's not often, it makes it feel more realistic, and it adds a different feel to occasionally directly do something.  Maps are great, missions are great, nothing to complain about.",1667084320,1667084320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:

- Is pretty good with mods.
- Fun gameplay
- Lots of map variety
- Decent AI

CONS:

- 32 bit engine leads to quite a few out-of-memory related crashes
- Poor FPS most times unless it's 1v1/2v2.

---( Playerbase )---
It's a causal RTS game, nothing really different from the genre other then independet unit control. It's a bit micro heavy at times but nothing hard do to. 

---( Graphics/Animation )---
Due to the game being old and and RTS graphics aren't good at all. From long range it looks a lot better than zoomed in. Mods can improve but since the engine is old it has limitations. 

---( Price )---
Worth the price, it's still around 25£ even though it's an old game but the experiance and playstyle is worth it, compared to COH it's more realistic and micro heavy and compared to bigger battles like Steel Division or Wargame it's a more zoomed in direct battle for you to control. 

---( Requirements )---
Medium requirements since graphics are old and pretty bad, but can be CPU heavy and slow down in larger battles that involves a lot of units. This can be fixed by lowering view range or in mp lower the amounts of units each side can use at once. 

---( Difficulty )---
The vanilla Campaign is easy/medium since the vanilla infantry can tank 20 rounds without dying so you can easily win the assault missions by rushing infantry into MGs or using flamethrowers in the open since it takes a long ass time to kill them with small arms fire. Explosives are also nurfed and doesn't really cause max damage. All damage in vanilla is nurfed and super low. 

Modded Campaigns are in comparison much harder and generally better. Damage and weapons actually does realistic damage in most of these mods. Normal infantry are feel weak in low numbers and you are forced to actually use a larger amount of units to assault a position. Especially in Robz, which you can use in the vanilla campaign. Robz makes the campaign harder and more fun, enemy artillery and MG fire is deadly effective with longer range and is an actually problem you need to take care of. 

---( Grind )---
None

---( Story )---
Campaign is based on different battles and theaters in the war, there's no coherent story. Campaign is fun and the different sections in each campaign mission act as sort of a mini story which is enjoyable. The DLC campaigns are in contrast to the vanilla campaigns actually a coherent story in chronological order. The story is not the best in these neither but it's a fun playstyle that you have to use compared to mp games.

---( Bugs )---
There's a few bugs, mostly old ones that the devs didn't have time or cared to fix. These are really rare in vanilla because of them are funny and not game breaking in any way. When Playing with mods it's another story. When using bigger conversion mods like WH40k you can cause the game to crash due to new models that doesn't like the old engine that MOWAS2 use. Game crashes caused by explosions are more common when using mods and usually happens when you are zoomed into the thing exploding. 

---( Game Time )---
Certain Campaign defense/ hold the line missions demand you to hold the line for upwards of 40-50 minutes which can be a bit boring while assault missions depends more on the player and the effectiveness you have at taking out the enemy capture points until you reach the final command victory point

---( Enjoyment )---
Consistently fun in both multiplayer and campaign. The defense campaign can as I said earlier be a bit boring due to the length. Mods are really the thing that keeps this game alive. Robz and other conversion mods are really amazing and a lot of fun. They add everything from new units, factions, mechanics and more. 

---( Final Score )---

The fact that you can essentailly set your units to automatically move, cover and attack and the AI that isn't too shoddy make it very easy to learn.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my faction and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Throughout the game I also sent miniature remote controlled vehicles packed with 100 tons of explosives to detonate under the tanks causing chain reactions that destroyed multiple tanks at a time. In fact, that reminds me of the previous game where I used 1 AA gun in the back of the truck to drive around to where Big Tony's artillery was positioned and proceeded to absolutely genocide all of his artillery and supply trucks.

Grab Robz and/or Valour mods, get the Airborne DLC and you unlock infinite replay-ability in LAN matches against bots (actual multiplayer is somewhat toxic).

AS for the Ai throwing tanks at you, in the missons right when i start capture a point which will alow me to get AT guns i get hit with enemy tanks, usualy makeing me lose a large amount of my checpoint emplamcents and defenses, before i can destry the tank.

Other mods include but are not limited to:
America Born in Fire (a revolutionary war-american civil war mod muskets and all)
Vietnam '65 (a mod to make the game take place in vietnam)
Star Wars (Clones v Droids)

Not to mention just the base game is a very fun WW2 sim, theres something special about an RTS that runs on physics and not dice rolls.

However what I'm writing this for is actually the most genius thing this game (And to an extent all MOW titles) has is the editor. I love the editor and I've been using it ever since I had the original Assault Squad. Ah those were the days, I'd set up battles with endless generators that would just create more and more soldiers and tanks and whatever else I added in and just watched that for hours, all while listening to Karl Pilkington or SOAD.

I can just picture it, all the bullets and shells flying to and fro blasting every living thing to bits and blowing up vehicles. Then I'd jump in and run someone up to blow up some MG or tank only for him to die and I'd get another man and do it until I finally got the target. All while hearing something like, ""I've always wanted to kick a duck up the arse."" followed by some hearty laughter.

And to think that was where my creative side really started to grow. 10/10 and as a last note I'd like to thank Prince of Macedon who played it and my Mother for getting it for me after I asked for it.",1657839067,1657839067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
-The game has good graphics for it's age and type of game.
-Sounds are decent (not delayed, not static but basic) 
-The unit control it pretty good and is rarely frustrating. 
-Has both multiplayer and single, single has a good amount of content but no story behind it unless you buy the ost DLC.
-Mods can add quite a bit of content but can also not work at all.
-Editor mode is fun if you know what your doing and just wanna f around but its quite hard to make units do what you want them to do (when your not controlling them)
-Easy to learn

Cons
-Bugs (sometimes bugs will appear not that often but they tend to be fixable but annoying af.
-When actually manually controlling units it can be tedious for some but after a bit of practice its OK.
- Dead player base - not a lot of people playing especially on Aussie servers but there is enough to play some multiplayer games (If your going to play this game for multiplayer only don't buy)

Frankly speaking , currently this game is at best great is due to modding / workshop , if not i can't see this game go far as its main game provide. also most players are veteran in the franchise so new players or players seldom join in will suffer greatly.

Coop mission is something i think is kinda okay for those that just join in the club but Digitalmindsoft should expand more in that category.

A very Toxic community tho, here's just 4 reasons why..
1. If you're starting out and low rank you will get kicked from every lobby, if you are experienced with high rank you will get kicked from every 2nd lobby, if your ping is over 100ms you get kicked from every lobby in between (even tho the game won't lag until around 350ms+).
2. Join a match, 3 vs 3 for example, a team mate loses a tank and then quits, the other team mate decides to quit also, you're left alone playing 3 vs 1, (2a). the opposing team ask you to please stay, you stay and lose and then get told by winning team that you are a worthless human being and how they are much smarter, stronger, better looking, richer and generally better than you in life because they beat you 3, 4 or even 5 vs 1..Happens quite often if you allow it by staying.
3. New players may join a match with others who have similar rank and similar amount of games, quickly you learn they are using Steam Family Sharing and have created a 2nd (Smurf) account and they have played on their first account more than 5000 or even 7000 games compared to what their rank states as 100 games played.
4. Playing Combat mode and everyone spams artillery and rockets and then the losing team quit early and (go back to point 2a. of review).
Other than these type of things, it's great fun for the entire family.

So if you are deciding whether to play MOW:AS2 or Gates of Hell, just wait until MOW:II and then see which is more worthwhile.

The netcode is still pretty bad, so multiplayer games will run as fast as the slowest player's PC performance and internet connection. One guy's PC or internet is sh*t and the whole lobby will lag. But if you play with friends this isn't that big of a problem as you can have better control over who makes up your lobby.

I think a new MOW game where you can essentially become a general and decide where to send troops and fight + control single battles like now would make the game super broad and easier to focus on. Also, I think basing the campaigns off of real people like Alexander Patch, Yamashita, etc. unkown/famous generals and making an effort to actually make the campaigns different (all of the levels in every campaign are just the same but reskinned) that wold be cool. Lastly, for the developers, play a game like Easytech's European War 7 (I really like their games btw) and take notes on the way they dealt with online play. An even BETTER way of doing online play would be like in MMOs, where maybe 'generals(the player)' could be paired with other generals and whoever wins, that counts toward their nation's winning chances, and some system where a certain players can become high command officers and tell other officers where to go, like match-making but done by players.

The mechanics in the game are great from being able to fill trenches and order mass charges to commanding a tank yourself and smashing through the enemy lines. My only gripe is that the missions are nearly impossible using the base game when they are set to the hardest difficulty. The game itself isn't bad and does present a good casual game if your not trying to do the hardest possible difficulty on all maps, I'd recommend this to only the most hardcore of achievement hunters if you ever try to 100% this game, good luck. Otherwise the game is historically on point and has some decent moments where strategy needs to be employed or you will lose the battle.

1. #Valour mod: For me the best mod there is. You have many factions, very complete roster and just an amazing mod to play with friends or against AI.

2. Red Rising 3.4: Still new and many minor bugs but I love the idea. The only reason its not number 1 is because of the bugs and weapon and unit variety... other than that, great mod and the visuals are amazing! Cant wait for this mod to be 100%!

- WWII accurate vehicles, Units, settings etc.

- can be hard to manage the UI
- Soldiers sometimes act like idiots (walking in front of enemies and not returning fire etc.)

This has quickly surpassed the coh series in my short time playing.

Only complaint would be some strange physics glitches like the time my tank jumped over a wall and landed near enemy infantry. I get that it’s a ‘light’ tank, but it’s not *that* light

Also...the singleplayer level design is utter shite, the only real difficulty comes from the enemy spamming so many men and tanks up your ass that you just lose. Like, I'm supposed to charge across a river and take a fortified enemy position while they're outproducing me and building tanks I can't even kill with AT rifles on a narrow map stuffed with enemies that are simply impossible to outflank.

Also dirt cheap on sales, DLCs seem like scams though, so be wary of those",1648770693,1650607018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a great game overall. If you like strategy games and games where you're in command of x amount of people, this is one I recommend. It's repetitive enough to feel similar but never gets stale. The campaign missions vary in difficulty and even in style.
However, there is one caveat to this. While it's rewarding enough to keep you engaged, the battles have a very steep difficulty curve and there are controls which are hidden from your view at first sight until you dig deeper. Some of these like double-right clicking to make your soldiers run/vs walk are important to the gameplay and a lot of them don't get explained by the game. It's great that the game assumes you're intelligent enough to figure it out yourself (and you will eventually) but it can make for a frustrating experience.
If, like me, you are new to this type of game, this game will be daunting. I still haven't exited that stage but I assume it's going to happen eventually. Luckily enough for me, this game scratched a particular itch I've had for a long time and it's inexperienced player unfriendliness was nowhere near enough to put me off thus far.

TL:DR, if you're new to this type of game it will take a bit of getting used to. HOWEVER, the gameplay is fun enough even in the noob stages to make for a great time. If you're looking at this game and think that it looks fun, you will probably like it. Try it.",1650262544,1650262544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The price is not what I recommend. I recommend that you buy it on sale. (There is a good chance it will not go on sale.)

The campaign is not good, but not bad. It can be fixed by some mods that add custom units and custom missions.

From what I have heard, multiplayer is not very popular during the daytime, but it may be popular at night or on weekends.

Graphics are still good these days; multiple mods allow you to have better effects and a better lighting system.

The units in this game are not historically accurate in uniforms and guns. (But mods can fix that.)

The AI in this game is not very smart. The story page tells us of AI ""improvements,"" but nothing sadly improves in what I see in the game.

Never buy the deluxe edition! It only gives xp and multiplayer stuff that is completely useless, but the xp boost is kind of good.

I mainly play multi player with brothers or friends, single player is alright i guess.

lots of cool mods, warhammer, vietnam, ww3, ww1, star wars- are some of my favorites ;)

also i recommend the airborn dlc, you can do multiplayer battles with ai if u are lonely wich in my opinion is more fun then the normal singleplayer

If you are buying this game, a little tip for editor missions: Have a team with a convoy of vehicles split up but have the vehicles packed with barbed wire, morphine and medkits, hedgehogs and soldiers, have an officer, radio operator and a ton of riflemen and you can decide the rest.

Then take direct control of that Tiger I and start sniping. Want to fire 155mm artillery? Yep, you can do that too. Ever want to suffer and die as one of the rank and file infantry? Sure.

Men of War squads can be directed to move or attack as a group, but you can independently position the squad members how you see fit; you can even make your own with the options you are given. With mods, you can have access to a greater variety of armor, artillery, and infantry, allowing you to specialize as needed for the situation. If you can't afford a tank, then get a tank destroyer; need mobile artillery? Boom, an SPG.

That being said, it's a good game, and graphically aged well... but is notorious for crashes, at least if you play with mods like me. From modern day mods, to ones set in the Napoleonic Wars, there is no lack of content... but it can, and will crash quite often... so be aware of that as you get this game.

AKA: Things I like, things I don't in my singleplayer experience. 
FYI: Haven't finished the entire game yet! Still playing through! 

Things I Like:
- They've added new levels! At least, in the complete edition they have. Regular version, I'm unsure. But these new levels are cool and more than welcome. On some levels you can even choose when the assault should take place! 
- It's much easier to resupply things now! Previously, you had to resupply each individual inventory with supply trucks whereas now they have a radius around them in which units will stock up what they need automatically! Thanks for saving us time!
- The new levels add more variety to the game now. Something I didn't like was spending hours on one level, pushing forward through the 3 lines of 3 objectives just to be met by another right after. Now there are plenty of stealth and defence levels which are great!
- Some new units on certain levels you can deploy special units to help out (or in my case, create a more realistic battlefield) Officers for example! 
- They've improved upon the UI and graphics a little, adding more options and effects to the game. That said, my computer can't run this as well as the previous one but that's not saying much. My PC sucks. 
- You have a profile rank. So far, I'm unsure if you actually unlock anything from it, but I do like seeing that I'm earning xp. I think it's mainly for show in the multiplayer but you can earn xp in the singleplayer missions too!
- They've kept in everything I loved in the previous installment. I loved some of the old levels. I love reinforcing positions. I love moving up my line of forces and...well...I love this game too! But...


Things I don't like:
- It's Assault Squad 1, but with a few extra things. I'd expect more from a sequel and so should you! A few new levels...a useless rank system...persisting problems...no massive changes...no redone levels...no multiple looks for all those copy and pasted soldiers...more effort next time. This is just AS1.5...not AS2. Disappointed. 
- Choosing when the assault can take place: This is something I only just recently found and it's becase I went off the level and chose it from the menu. You can't do this with every map, which is fine, but had I have not went back to the menu and clicked on it, I would have completly played through the level/campaign without this feature. 
- Some bonus missions from the last game like the christmas one aren't here...what gives? You already have AS1 in here? Why not it's bonus levels?
- The leveling up is cool but you don't get anything from it. It kind of falls flat if I'm earning xp for nothing and I'm 10 hours in as of writing this and haven't notice anything change other than my level. Multiplayer players may appreciate seeing how experienced I am, but I don't play MP. Useless. Give us alternate uniforms/camos/unlockable units etc.
(The following problems still remain from the last game)
- Being thrust straight into the next mission: Completing this mission took me 3 hours. It says congrats, shows kills/deaths for each side, then gives two options. Continue playing the match or load the next level. NO! Give me something for slaying the opposition! Give me an option to go to the main menu and leave!
- I don't feel rewarded by completing missions as much as I should do: In the last 10 minutes of a possibly hour long level, you can just tell you're gonna win. All you get for that is a window saying congrats, with your losses and theirs and some Steam achievements. If I've killed 3 times as many of their units and destroyed 3 times as many of their vehicles, you'd expect more than that! I think this could be improved upon. Maybe a system of upgrades or unlocks for your faction. Maybe this is where they could add those Officers and shotgunners in. 
- Units STILL being locked to what mission you are on: E.g. There is a mission for the USA where it's more infantry focused, airborne to be specific. They allow you to call in officers but they aren't on every mission. I feel like they where more prevelent than some of these tanks. Imagine having more super heavy tanks than officers on the field. It would be chaos!
- Coming back to play the hardest HEROIC difficulty was a waste of time. Damn things stupidly impossible, 

That said, this game is great..because it's the previous game, which was great...but with more stuff. 
I plan on playing a lot more. 
In the last one, I completed the USA missions and tried some of the Commonwealth and Russian missions too. 
I think I'll end up doing the same here. 

Anyway, if you liked Company of Heroes and maybe wanted more depth and a longer experience, or if you liked Commandos but wanted it on a larger scale, then I can definately recommend this to you! 
If you liked the last game and are ok with playing some old levels again to get to the new ones, then go for it. They're quite fun and different from the last game!
And if you're a fan of the snowy battles in Band of Brothers, I'm currently on a mission with a similar feel!",1530668293,1642970250,True,6,0,0.547952651977539063,0,True,False,False

I could never really get into rts games due to the need for clunky micromanagement, but this game is simply fantastic. Units have a little freedom, like they go prone under fire, sometimes throw grenades at entrenched enemies or passing vehicles, they jump away from grenades too (auto dodging AoE is something not even relatively gigantic titles like TWW or DOW cared to implement).

My only issue with this game is some weirdness in pathfinding: e.g. sometimes units leave trenches and go around it instead of just walking through it. Climbing over fences just doesn't work 80% of the times and when it does, units climb over in line instead of spreading out.

Apart from that, the game is really solid and very enjoyable (my personal favorite way to scratch that tactical itch we all have from time to time). Take your time to learn all controls, some tactical basics and train with friends against bots before going public multiplayer.

Note: I highly recommend at least one person from your party to have airbourne dlc, which unlocks bots for custom multiplayer matches. Other then that, the workshop is filled with custom missions, units and even total conversions like Vietnam or even Stalker lol, so you don't need all that much dlc content anyway

I started playing this game originally because of the Warhammer 40k modding scene, but boy, the base game is awesome by itself. My friend and I completed the online campaign for all the forces, and it was usually a good time. The game takes a lot of historical battles from World War 2, and pits you as either Axis or Allies. All the major factions are there to play, although I would have liked to have seen others like the Canadians/French played out more.

Battles usually revolve around capturing objectives if you are the attacking force, with tanks/infantry. You will occasionally have artillery and aircraft support, but its not often. Some of the battles were downright beautiful/ albeit chaotic. Infantry scrambling for cover while tanks advance and fire their guns, artillery raining down on enemy positions, and sometimes aircraft dropping their payloads.  Its get just as fun in multiplayer! Playing COOP is also really enjoyable if you can get a friend to play. Some of the battles are so large in scale that they really affect the performance even on high-end machines (probably due to poor optimization).  There are no resources to speak of, no resource gathering. Its all from captured points or just generated if any. 

The modding scene for this game is amazing. There are many different types of mods which are just awesome. Activating mods from the work shop is very simple, as you just subscribe to them and activate in game. There are a few which require a little more tinkering in the main root folder of the game but otherwise it was straightforward. Starwars / valour / robzrealism are a few good ones that I know. There are also many maps for the vanilla game, which can really add a lot of replayability for the game. As of writing this, I have 439 hours. A lot of that was also spent in the game editor. The editor itself is a bit complicated at first. If you have any design and programming backround, its not to difficult to figure out. You can create your own custom maps and scenarios with various timed events via scripting. The scripting engine was not too bad, I was able to create a few different scenarios where the AI would fight each other, and it was really cool watching them try to flank. Of course, you can also program set tasks / waypoints for the units to take, and its really cool to watch the same battle end differently. 

The game itself does not require a high-end expensive computer, as it is a bit dated. But once you start including mods such as high resolution textures / extra effects and additional placeholders for the game , your system will start stuttering if its not at least 2 GB of VRAM. Its rather poorly optimized when all the effects start hitting the screen, and I don't blame the game, but you should limit these in the settings prior to playing (especially in multi-player, where they will affect your ping and performance.) You should aim for a bit higher than the recommended settings, but as it is, I ran it fine on my old PC with a gtx 770 and AMD fx8370.

Realistic? Probably not. But I had a lot of fun with this. 
Game play is a bit dated, but still fun. You start the mission controlling a few units . Some missions are stealth/commando style where reinforcements are almost none. AI can be very difficult to play against. But I would get this on sale. Def a fun game if you are into WW2 . There are also players and modders in the online community that are keeping the game alive.  If you can wait, get it on sale.",1640184043,1640184043,True,12,0,0.654770851135253906,0,True,False,False

Large battles will start to cause fps lag and it will eventually become unplayable. With a 64 bit version, the game would run better even if it is slightly better. A big issue with a 32 bit application is also memory limitations. Many have and still experience out of memory errors, this is due to the 4 GB RAM limitation placed due to the game being 32 bits. 64 bits would virtually eliminate that issue given you have the resources. The developers don't seem to have any motivation to make this game 64 bit as their previous argument was it would split the gaming community. The reality is most computers can handle 64 bit programs hence why most video games are 64 bit. This game is frozen in time so unless you want to be limited in what you can do I suggest finding another game like this for now. Also I have both AS-1 and AS-2, both games are generally the same thing with some differences that does not make this game worth nearly $30. If you have AS-1 stick with it, don't bother with this one unless you want to toy around with gem editor (which is the only thing I really use in this game.)",1625506919,1640077457,False,37,3,0.697411775588989258,0,True,False,False

The only cons that I can think of is that the basic missions you get from buying this game aren't that good and the orignal mowas had better single player missions but..... you can get better missions with the orignal mowas missions but again you have to pay extra for multiple dlc to get better missions. Even then the dlc missions are ok but they all have the same objectives and I wished they tried to make it a little different with the objectives. The last save and grace is the insane modding community here on steam which make so many high quality mods that you can play with, on hours in end. I bought the game as soon as possible because i wanted to play around with all the mods on the workshop. So the base game you can buy it on sale or base price, which ever you want to choose.

The gameplay is so detailed you can edit individual soldier's inventories and pick up ammo/supplies from fallen friends of foes. Tanks have fuel, and they can get stuck. You can shoot the tracks off a tank, or you can shoot right through it with a Pak anti-tank gun. The realism is really what separates this game from other RTS's, such as Company of Heroes. In COH, it takes about 5-6 shots to kill a single guys at point-blank range. In MOW, it takes 1-2 shots.

However, this game requires CONSTANT micro-management. You cannot send your troops to a position then forget about them. You need to manually put them in prone, crouched, and standing position. You manually must tell them to throw a grenade. With all the mm, it is very hard to manage multiple units.

As a WW2 simulation, this is the closest to reality you can get right now. As an RTS, it is painstakingly tedious to manage every one of your units, it truly is a burden. If you want to truly experience commanding war in a game, this is a great game, But if you want to send about a squad and forget about them, they will die and you will lose. Your units have no AI on their own and can't really do anything for themselves. It is really up to you everything they do.

The micro-management is the worst part about this game, but it's realistic features still make it an amazing RTS that I recommend to hardcore strategy and war game fans.",1637969313,1637969313,True,23,0,0.735424816608428955,0,True,False,False

[b]So what can you expect?[/b]

[list]
    [*]You're interested in WWII.
    [*]You click buy.
    [*]This is where the fun stops and the war crimes begin. 
[/list]
[list]
    [*]There are two factions, Axis and Allies, just like the real World War II.
    [*]Every individual country has a campaign you can play and they vary in number of war crimes depending on which one you play.
    [*]You think that's it? Too bad you're wrong and there's more.
    [*]Hans gets a flammenwerfer, Johnny gets his shotgun, Sir Nathaniel gets his crumpets and tea, and Japan idk, I don't play weeb faction. 
[/list]
[list]
    [*]There is also multiplayer, which is another word for cancer and long matchmaking times but that's fine.
    [*]The singleplayer is extremely polished and has tons of content. 
    [*]I've played this game for several years now and it never really gets old it's quote fun, especially co-op game modes.
[/list]
[list]
    [*]Unlike other trash games, there are no micro-transactions and it doesn't need the other DLC's to actually be playable. 
    [*][strike]There aren't actually shotguns in the game that I know of.[/strike] Correction: There are. 
    [*]That's about it. Congratulations, you have finished playing a session for the day and committing various war crimes across Europe and Asia, it has been a good day. 
[list]
    [*]This game CANNOT take the place of a girlfriend in your life, it is not an FPS.
    [*]When you put money into this game (aka buying it,) It does not try to do good, IT IS good.
    [*]If you play Axis you will be put on a watch list.
    [*]That's all for today folks!

But it has so much potential-work on the sounds (most important),the controls(i think its the reason most Players just quit after like-2-3 hours because the unessecary Micromanaging).I mean it should be there-but there has to be an easier overlay for Beginners,an intuitive UI like in Company of Heroes,but with the potential to control every single soldier,and the complexity for the experienced Players.
This Game scares Beginners easily away...and there is much work to be done,I mean the optic of the Game is okay for me,the physics are a bit...funny? But i could live with all that if they fix the problems i just named.

Its a really good game but the ai is super bad. Their way to fix this is to make the ai summon twice as much stuff as you have even when they control 1 point. Each control point spawns a wave when you take it over for the first time so advancing quickly isnt always a good thing. Vehicles feel super weak and are really expensive especially against AT. AT is super strong and does AOE damage to infantry. Meanwhile realistic is really annoying. Enemy doesnt use smoke grenades at all. Mortars are innacurate(good) but dont feel like they do all that much damage(bad) and are expensive (balanced). The direct control mode feels cheesy but its fun, its like playing foxhole without the camera being a piece of crap. Sometimes your units dont take shots but the ai will.

HOLY FUCK playing as germany i had NOTHING, i had 9 people to clear out 5 FORITFIED AA positions with a FUCKED stealth mechanic that ensured the enemy knew where I WAS at all times, then phase two came, we got off the boats i FINNALY cleard all the fucking ISLANDS, then with phase two all i could do is call in paratroops with a panzerfaust that would just DIE before he could even GET in range to even SHOOT at it... so after just throwing wave after wave after wave after wave of paratroopers into a meat grinder YOU STILL DONT GIVE ME ANY TANKS!!!!!! YOU GIVE THE FUCKING AI TANKS AND THEY LOOK THE OPPOSITE WAY OF THE ENEMY TANKS.... nut not me.... WHY THOUGH? then the part that final made me say""FUCK THIS! i need to quit this game"" is i cant tell you how many times i've KNOWN i clicked on LOAD just to have it overwrite me into a shit position.... so now i ethor have to deal with the 2 tan ks i DID manage to take being MAGIKED off the board or io have to go through the meat grinder again.... and thats not even including how many times you FORCE THE SHOEHORNING of stealtth missions that have NO PLACE in this game, yes you can skip them but thats not the point, you shouldn't be FORCING this game to do things its not meant to, like when you FORCED me into driving a tank that was SUPPOSED to be a HEAVY tank that acted like it had the armor of a stewart, and THAT'S not including the fact you REFUSED to put a first person view in the tankso i can BARELY aim the fucking thing for shit...

edit: okay so it wants me to update my review so i have a question... in tobruk as the british HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DO I HAVE TO KILL THE SAME EXACT GUN BEFORE IT WILL STAY DEAD?!?!?!?!?! I QUIT AFTER I KILLED IT A THIRD TIME FOR IT TO NOT GIVE A SHIT... really why is it whenever i FIGHT something it's n invincible masterpiece of a war machine,  but when i GET something like that it's a wet paper towel with a hole in it? and keep in mind i'm playing on EASY FOR FUCK SAKE",1594962946,1635126713,False,0,1,0.482758641242980957,1,True,False,False

Just noticed, the inventory system has been improved a lot. Now, you only need to select a whole squad and pickup any type of ammo from any type of dead enemy via inventory screen, the ammo, no matter the type, will be distributed to the squad member that most needs it automatically, this really is good news.

You also can pull back your no ammo left squad to air dropped ammo box area (or at the mission start point where there is supplier truck with supply area) to fully re-gain ammo automatically.

How to make a squad: anything you select, anytime you select, becomes a squad or a new squad, no matter it's group of soldiers or mix with tanks, just select it, the relative icon will appear at the left bottom corner, but squad member's number is limited.",1634818938,1634871938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Men of War: Assault Squad 2 goes into such intense depths that each individual soldier has their own inventory system, as well as their own specialties. The level of micromanagement is so detailed that you can not only loot corpses in case your unit is out of ammo or loses their helmet, but you can also repair wrecked equipment and secure enemy vehicles. From smoke bombs, to molotov cocktails, or even being able to switch artillery shells in a tank depending on the armour class you're up against. Soldiers will sometimes throw enemy grenades back if they think about it, which could make or break the engagement. There are so many little things about this game, that despite the limited map pool, there's quite literally infinite possibilities. I didn't even mention the fact you could stealth through foliage and sneak up on enemies, or being able to destroy entire buildings with the use of a large vehicle. Yes, the entire environment is destructible. If this doesn't sell you on the game, I don't know what will.

However, this is also a problem. Men of War: Assault Squad 2 has so many features, so many details, but the main downside is how terrible the engine is. The game stutters if you aren't using very specific settings, I find that the game doesn't use all of my cores either because of the type of system I have. I have an NVIDIA 2070 super and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor, and the game still runs exceptionally awful because it doesn't support Ryzen processors very well. I can adjust the settings to make the game run, however if I want to install a workshop addon, I may as well just play a different game. Be mindful of your system requirements, as due to the age of this game and certain systems being unable to run the game at a decent graphics quality, it's hard for me to recommend this game. I certainly *am* going to recommend this game, but as of 2021, this game still does not have any decent AMD support. It's been 7 years, so you may as well just wait for MoW3. Amazing strategy game, terrible support for my system. 6/10.",1632189603,1632351082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is very difficult to find a decent online match when not playing with a friend. The story mode is rather dull and I quickly lost interest after playing a few of the factions. But with the use of the community workshop, mods can be added to turn the game into what it should have been which is an all out battle simulator.

PRO'S
1.) the game is a decent game, but it gets boring fast (in my opinion.)
2.) has an amazing modding community which makes amazing mods that seriously enhance the gaming experience.
3.) Interesting control scheme which, once accustomed to, makes you 
4.) AI is quite difficult on some of the harder AI levels.
5.) Ability to increase the MP and CP cap is quite flexible and allows for very interesting battles
6:) very indepth in a good way. Able to direct control individual units 
7:) Basic inventory management (if you want to be reallllly inventory clean) but it isn't a necessity
8:) Visuals are okay, not completely terrible but it suits the game well.

Neutral 
Combat could be decent at times although there are alot of problems with AI (see below)
Ai pathing on some maps are very...broken. Some maps have slopes that should be passable and is accepted by the automatic pathing system, so units get stuck until direct controlled away from that specific area. (easy fix, spam mortars and fill the area XD )
Occasionally units ignore commands but its usually easily rectified by getting into the habit of spam clicking to ensure they don't ignore the commands
CON'S
1:) Just before we start with the negatives, the ai. It doesn't come with the game. To be able to have AI, for some reason the developers felt it reasonable to have to buy the airborne DLC just to be able to access the AI. The game should have AI already built in, not have it as a DLC. I feel like that is a seriously unfair money grab. In my opinion
2.) Seriously unstable. I like to play with bots when i play with my mate and we just generally try and have fun. The bots are certainly interesting but we'll cover that next point. Game frequently crashes for unknown reasons. Game frequently crashes for stupid reasons. Usually crashes because the programme is unable to create a dump file for certain files.
3.) AI Bots just spams things. Unfortunately for the game, the AI bots are thick as pigsh*t. The way the AI attempts to beat you is by spamming as many troops as it can at you hoping to do the Russian victory of overpowering with numbers.
4.) AI Bots sometimes breaks itself. Sometimes the AI just breaks, nothing spawns in or is unable to spawn anything in which means you have to go through the effort of going back to the menu and reloading the game, hoping that the AI doesn't break again.
5:) Learning curve is VERY steep at the start, especially when you have no one who is able to teach you how to play 
6:) the multiplayer. If you are looking for a multiplayer game that you play with randoms, i dont think this game is for you, if im being honest. Whenever i tried to join a multiplayer game i just get kicked. I just gave up with randoms completely and stuck to playing chill games with my mate.
7:) the editor seems complicated to use (or atleast i cant work out how to use it) i've watched youtube clips, read up on wikipedias and still cant work it out.
8:) lets cover the campaign, every countries set of missions is literally a reskin of the exact same missions. It seems the developers ran out of ideas for each campaign after completing the USA campaign. Would be nice for differentiating missions from eachother to show off what each faction could do. 
9:) I believe that this game is entirely centred around the multiplayer aspect only. It seems a lack of attention was paid to the the AI controlled bots. 

I seriously love this game but it seems to be waning fast. If you want to make your Bots a little smarter then i'd recommend getting the robz realism mod and getting the RobZ AI Fix, the game itself is beautiful in the way the battles are portrayed. i think i will continue playing just not as often as i used to",1543245031,1632220526,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Each battle plays out more like a sandbox where the enemy is consistently pushing back against your every advance. There is no underlying campaign story, just a series of battles that play out roughly the same. Fortunately, the battles are enjoyable and the environments varied. They feel large and at times chaotic as units die easily and keeping them supplied and in good cover is essential. It's disappointing that this great gameplay isn't really supported by much else. With its limited modes and features, the game feels barebones when compared to other RTS titles. The UI is really clunky and unpleasant to work around and a few performance issues plague larger battles. With all that being said, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 corrects many of its predecessor's flaws and is easy to recommend to fans of the series and RTS games. 

+ Deep, thoughtful gameplay
+ Excellent unit details
+ Good use of terrain and land features

[Feature & Mod Rich]

if you have played the orignals in the series its a big improvement with mod support added giving you countless mods in fact this game is rich everygame in the series has been remade in mods even company heroes 1 its competitor Several Call of duty Games including medal of honor amazingly has all been remade with all the music with a slight limittaion & Voiced acted lines Here its a whole another layer to people it favor rts or want a twist on a classic any war you can think of even the civll war to modern combat lol no other game i've seen has surpassed this it will add more than 10 hours to your game 

[Don't get the rest of the Series]

no need to buy the orignal men of war or any otherones your just going to get a worse experience its been remastered in the men of war origins expansion for this game & masterfully in Mod Conversions on The workshop men of war is one the most realistic complex strategy world war 2 games out their Even the Physics The damage vehicles take the craters in the ground with shells hit Nothing compares to that you will be able to apply real war time tactics in use on the battlefield well worth this is not the type of game you can beat in one sitting if your looking for online or coop people are always on at any given time i would also recommend company of heroes or codename panzers series if you like this style of gameplay.

[Mods ETC]

if you were not a fan of Orgins Remaking the Cutscenes & changing the voice actors theirs a mod it restores that Theirs also another it Sources The orignal unaltered textures.",1530907178,1631978309,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Smaller maps than maybe Wargame Red Dragon but with the smaller maps makes the units more “impactful” where a sole AT gun can control the battlefield where you’ll have to have tons on larger maps. 

More direct control of units which some other RTS have but i haven’t found any with this type of control where you can play it kinda like a FPS. (kinda)

There aren’t really any overpowered units except for maybe tanks but a single squad of infantry can take out your expensive tank if you just rush it to an objective which makes the question if you want an artillery piece to destroy an objective or a heavy tank much more “problematic” or harder to decide. 

As stated on the point above with none overpowered units, since you have fewer units on most maps then losing a unit feels more impactful instead of feeling like you dropped your key and on how it’s just a nuisance. 

Guns aren’t accurate, which makes you want to use burst on an MG instead of automatic fire, the inaccuracy is also a downside since especially when you get taken out by an enemy tank since you missed your shot. 

Mods. Base game is fine but the mods take it from like a 5.5 or 6/10 to a 9/10 or even a 10/10 since the mods are also high quality. 


Cons: 
Pretty stupid AI where they do pretty stupid stuff like running out of cover or missing a grenade throw. 

One of the pros I listed earlier with inaccurate fire can be a massive con like when you line up a shot but miss and get killed instead can be massively infuriating especially if you lost an expensive vehicle/unit. 

TL:DR
Greatest RTS i have ever played and maybe one of the greatest games overall mostly from the mods but otherwise great game and i highly recommend it.

The game can be buggy, and if it weren't for the dedicated modders, the campaigns available would wear thin fairly quickly.

It does need a desperate overhaul and an injection of new missions along with other updates, however the main developers do seem to neglect the wants of the hardcore followers in favour of overblown DLC's.

Because of this it is very hard for a noob to get good. The worst part in my opinion is that you have to pay 10€ to play against bots. In my opinion being able to fight against bots is an essential part of a RTS, it can be used to try things out, or just play a bit more relaxed game. In addition to this the single player missions are rather on the boring side. Still if you are able to ignore all this, the core gameplay is alright. It is pretty fun to take control of you troops and walk/drive them around the Battlefield. But for me the troop selection was a bit weird. It is a cool feature that you are able to select only single soldiers or can split the squad to your liking, but for some unknown reason you can't select several squads.
All in all i would not recommend buying this game. Even though at its core it can be fun, it is not easy reaching this fun and their are better alternatives.",1629659665,1629659665,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now, the bad stuff, the game's single-player is basically an afterthought, it has five campaigns that feel mostly similar, since they may take place in different maps, but they're basically the same, the game doesn't feature the classic RTS Skirmish mode(which would be a mock up MP battle against the AI), the only single-player content is the campaign... UNLESS, you purchase the Airborne DLC, which adds bots... Yeah, you gotta buy a DLC to get more single-player bang for your buck, it's absurd.

you do need a dlc to use bots in single and multiplayer, and the campaign is fun but not noteworthy, so unless you have friends (or want to use the editor) you'll need a dlc for the full experience
mods make the game significantly better, i'd suggest Robz Realism before you play 10 hours of the game
but otherwise, the editor is excellent, and if you have the time and skills, you can make almost any type of mission, and multiplayer is good fun, singleplayer with bots is also a nice way to relax.

       Pros: 

1. This game has spectacular graphics for a game made in 2014. 
2. The movement is great. The AI pathmaking is flawed but functional (some ai seem to be scared of roads but i've only experienced this twice)
3. Gunplay is amazing. Vehicles and Troops are very well balanced, as there are no blatant ""metas"", meaning there are infinite options, this is complimented by the fantastic direct control which works on every troop.
4. Amazing community with an awesome workshop. 

This is where the pros end.

       Cons:

1. The game is still on 32 bit processing which causes extreme frame loss. Some workshop mods are unplayable without a high-end computer.
2. The developers seemingly have abandoned this game. I believe the last update came out in 2019. The workshop is the only thing keeping this game alive. They most likely have focused there developers on Call to Arms, the latest entry to the series
3. The steam workshop is very flawed. After downloading multiple mods, even if you have matching mods with your friends, a very common error you will come by is 
 ""Resource Desynchronization detected. Joining will lead to out of sync error"", which denies you access to online lobbies.
4. AI locked behind paywall... In order to use the AI you have to buy the Airborne DLC. Luckily, you can use AI with your friends with only one person with the Airborne DLC

Summary:

MoW:AS2 is a great game held back by unmotivated developers. I give this a recommended because I always have fun playing with my friends against AI and within ourselves. Some promising mods I recommend are Free for All, Free for All Maps, Vietnam '65 and Vietnam '65 Frontlines AI, Robz Realism, #v a l o u r, ASV Warhammer 40k, Star Wars: Galaxy at War",1626058985,1627223182,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In COH2 you get a way to practice your skills when you buy a game (no DLCs nedeed): you get Bots, which have 4 difficulties, you get Campaing + Training level. Meanwhile in MOW2 you have only 1 way to train yourself and it's Bots, and i would certaintly give this game a thumbs up, buuuttt, well you gotta buy a DLC to unlock those bots, yeah.

244450,96234518,76561198121131076,0,21,4842,0,1422,1658544077,"A classic, long-running and hardcore WW2 RTS franchise which, to me, is the spiritual successor of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/11480/Soldiers_Heroes_of_World_War_II/] Soldiers: Heros of WW2 [/url], a similar classic that came before Men of War franchise. MoW shares a good amount of similarities with Soldiers: HOWW2 due to the fact that both games run on the same engine and thus some assets were reused. But MoW really nailed it with so much more new content and a more modern graphics and compatibility with newer PCs. 

So to start off, this RTS game isn't for the faint hearted, there are more micromanagement than you'd expect in the units under your command. Each soldier has limited ammo that'd eventually run out without resupply, also they can die easily from a stray bullet or a well-placed shot. Each type of armored vehicle has varying armor thickness depending on its type or design, therefore every encounter requires a different approach to overcome, each mission and skirmish match can be a complete chaos, so you need to learn to keep your head cool and thoughts organized if you want to win the war and make your country proud. That being said, this is a RTS game where carefully planned and well executed tactics is rewarded greatly and recklessness or ignorance punished severely.

The game has lots of details that amazed me, the historical accuracy of the units set to show up in different years of the war is spot-on. Most vehicles would change their paintjob to adapt to the climate of the map. However, the biggest selling point for me and probably some other people is the active modding community that pumps out even more content to try out, just in case you already finished the rather short campaign missions. The only major gripe I have with this game is the horrible and borderline moronic AI that's been plaguing the units when I'm not directly controlling them or they're set to fire at will, tanks always prioritize infantry by switching to HE shells which is extremely stupid and pointless. This had always been the issue as well back in Soldiers: HOWW2, so it appears to be a fundamental AI bug in GEM engine. Furthermore, even though the game looks detailed at first glance, there are still some parts that just feels unfinished such as missing unit descriptions and unpolished parts like a few graphical issues with vehicle lights and fire effects. It's also worth noting that the game tends to crash now and then, so don't expect a stable run every time you play.

As retarded as the AI might had been, MoW 2 AS still offers you a pretty solid and hardcore WW2 RTS experience. If you're like me, a huge WW2 history nerd who also happens to love RTS games, this is the perfect game for you. If you're looking for a PTSD level experience, this game is also perfect due to the amazing sound effects and visuals. Just turn the master volume all the way up and let your whole family know that you're busy fighting a goddamn war, so that they'll never ask you to pause your game for a stupid meal ever again. ;)",1627042547,1627042917,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

After countless hours of watching Raptor and DiplexHeated videos, I begged my parents to let my buy this janky yet appealing RTS game on our old shity home computer. About 5ish years later and a total of 1 hour spent in multiplayer, I still (almost) enjoy Men of War AS2 as much as did when I first got it. 

I'd seriously recommend this game to any who's into RTS, strategy, or historically focused games in general. This game to me will and always will be a great time killer; letting me screw around in skirmish mode or the campaign with dozens of tanks, hundreds of infantry, and whole lot of explosives. As previously mentioned I spent hardly any time in multiplayer as it just isn't my thing nor the main appeal for me in RTS games. The real draw and the main reason I'd recommend this game to someone would have to be the mods. I've heard that the modding community for Men of War is not like what it used to be a number of years back, but honestly, that didn't stop me from enjoying the best of what the moding section had to offer. There are some real talented people who've made incredible detailed and highly scripted missions/mods that blows the official game itself out of the water. I've lost god knows how many hours playing through said missions and mods (plus a few years shaved off my life span probably) and have enjoyed myself thoroughly playing them. However, I cannot give an honest opinion about the game without mentioning the bugs. Fuck me the bugs. I have run into all sorts of issues/bugs through my playtime; everything from the blue spider soldiers, to missing textures, to the red exclamation marked ammo  that'll crash the game if fired. Not to mention the error messages you receive when said game crashes. I'd understand them better if they were written in Japanese I swear.  

As with basically any of game, It's most fun playing with a buddy or a group of lads. Grab a friend or two (if you have any) and I guarantee you'll be laughing, arguing, or freaking out about whatever situation/battle you might be in. The peak Men of War AS2 experience is an absolute cluster fuck on screen with dozens or sometimes even hundreds of units firing at one another, with the frame rate kicking the bucket every time something explodes.

Overall, I'd recommend this very entertaining game to anyone who's looking for something to play during this time of ""staying indoors a lot"", and especially to a history buff such as me. I would't recommend getting this game unless it's on sale, as even I think with the amount of hours I have that the price is a bit steep ($32,99 for those in Canada). You really don't need any of the DLCs to enjoy the core experience of this game, though some mods may require one or more to play. Thanks to whomever reads this whole ""review"", as it is my first on Steam.",1625205650,1625205750,True,49,0,0.818207085132598877,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for an RTS game that breaks the standard formula of ""large unit"" tactics, than this is the RTS for you! 

Why? Well, MOW: AS2 allows you to form your own units, made up of Armor and Infantry, that of which is done via binding! Furthermore, you can individual control each and every unit, ranging from Infantry, all the way to airplanes and boats! Hell, every vehicles and infantryman even has their own inventory, where you can change their weapons, helmets, vests, and even their grenades!

If I had to give this game a one word definition, I would use the word ""Dynamic"" as everything in this game has a purpose and is important, as it all comes together to create a game not only fun and challenging, but realistic and focused...

The editor is great to mess around in, I'd set up opposing armies of various strengths and make them clash for my amusement, it's like playing wars with legos as a kid. Made me happy, but I did feel like a bit of a loser after.
The multiplayer is interesting, people seem to be absolutely incredibly at it like with any RTS and I got stomped routinely.

Co-op is also super fun, figuring out ways to tackle the campaign on the hardest difficulty with your armchair general friends and micromanaging platoons at the start of a mission to try and eke out all that you can in those first critical moments to grab a foothold before the enemy crushes you is just a great time.

30 bucks feels like a lot though for the aging engine MOWAS runs on, and it feels unpolished at times, especially with direct controlling units.

Ive had numerous examples of the ai simply failing to execute basic functions. The pathfinding in particular is simply atrocious often having to take direct control of support units as they don't know how to cross bridges. Or units getting stuck on random objects. Additionally collision physics appear broken on ANY vehicle in this game ive noticed that if they collide with an object that is too strong for them to break through (eg. a support unit colliding with a tank), your vehicle will get stuck and spin in place near indefinitely until eventually finding a sweet spot to reset and allow you to give it orders/be able to take manual control again this can take a significant amount of time and sometimes render the unit useless as it does sometimes just get stuck disabling the unit and occasionally the vehicle it got stuck on again it just feels unpolished. Playing this game makes you feel more like a caretaker to your mentally challenged soldiers than a General directing an assault.

As an example for the ass pathing just play a game of skirmish or multiplayer on Shattered, spawn on the right side of the axis and order a support vehicle over the small hill down to the control point youll find your support vehicle will stop short just as the hill ends no matter where you told him to go the only way you can get him to move his broken ass is to take direct control of the unit and drive him manually to your designated point which is incredibly fun if youre in the middle of a fight trying to have your heavily suppressed units take down a tank while they are running out of ammo just because the unit got stuck.",1616040103,1622721600,False,3,0,0.520210862159729004,0,True,False,False

The main reason i won't recommend it is as follows.  
-Most players are toxic.
-The multiplayer lobby is broken more often than it's working.
-There is a persistent desync error that will close a multiplayer game, mid game, rather than allow the game to catch up. (as much as there are online threads to fix it, they don't actually work, I've encountered it many times over the last few years, nothing fixes it)

So when the game works, it's fine. When it doesn't, it completely destroys your desire to play. Buy it when it's on sale, not full price, the game has been broken for a long time now and doesn't look like it'll be fixed any time soon",1541073156,1622699900,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mostly got it due to the amazingly done Warhammer 40k mod to play with friends and I like tactics games more than traditional RTS, HOWEVER, this game has a HUGE issue. This game is only x32 bit, what that means is it can ONLY USE 4GB OF RAM. If you use a program called ""Large Address Aware"" it allows it to use more than 4GB but it doesn't help much. What this means is this game will chug, get FPS laggy (it's not actual FPS drops), and eventually crash. The issue is the good mods ask too much of the game and it can't handle it. I suggest people get Call To Arms over this game, it is made by half of the same dev team and it built much better and for modern PCs. It also has a WWII DLC coming out C.T.A-Gates of Hell - Ostfront. C.T.A. is a much better game even though it's modern themed, it also has tons of workshop mods. If you want to risk it and see how well it runs for you, go ahead, but I have warned you. It runs like complete shit in MP. I have a Ryzen 5 3600, 1650 Super, & 16GB DDR4 @3200MHz.

The campaign requires good strategies of your planning if your on harder difficulties. PVP requires good planning as well and learning the enemies tactics. At first its tough to play the game and no one wants you on there team because your a noob, slowly but surly you rank up and learn off your enemies and allies to become an amazing commander. Got to say it requires a lot more strategy than most games like Company of Heroes etc. All and All wonderful game should make a new one with more units and maps.

Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a fun game that I have thoroughly enjoyed throughout the years, and was the main device for me to switch from an Xbox to a PC. After ""pirating"" it (downloading demos, I thought I was so smart as a 9 year old), I finally got it on steam.

Encounters are truly unique. Yeah, that's a dead term. The Division has ""truly unique encounters"" because it has the same 4 looters spawn walking menacingly down the street, but they're randomly ranked different. Assassins Creed Odyssey has ""truly unique encounters"" because the bounty hunter system has different character levels. What makes Men of War different?

The AI in Men of War, while not the best thinkers sometimes, can operate in any environment you give them. They are dependent on nodes or zones, only a proficiency that you give them (in speaking for the editor.) They will move to a cover, and if there is none available, will do all sorts of things to get to a state where they can have cover. They're very good in that aspect. The best thing I've enjoyed though is that they will not react with one set way. They will flank, suppress, mass charge or retreat purely by their choice, and while I'm not even sure this is intentional, it's a very interesting enemy to fight. It creates a very unique circumstance where I can remember what the enemy sends at me, but not how it will utilize it.

Controlling the units themselves is a lot of fun too. Setting up barricades, establishing front lines and preforming your own daring tasks against AI or your friends is a lot of fun. I remember using the KV-1 Heavy Tank to brutalize my friends Insolidious and TorpedoBob in a frontal assault, only for them to flank around me and capture my zones. Still haven't forgiven them for that one. It allows for a lot of options to play with.

Mods are great for this game, don't buy the Cold War DLC. I don't care how good the ratings get, the health bars alone make it doo doo",1564718695,1621023464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only major gripe is that the base-game campaigns are all copy-paste. All follow the same pacing, mission type, etc., which is a bit boring. Unit pathing can also be an issue, and may lead to the death of a squad.
