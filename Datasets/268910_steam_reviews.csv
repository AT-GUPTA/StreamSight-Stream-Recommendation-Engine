A mix of all good elements that a action-like game have to have. Challenging, joyfull, rewarding and most of all: an epic experience.

Since the first boss you can feel how hard the game will be, however, it keeps getting more and more hard, but never let that be over the fun and enjoyment that each gunshot and ""knockout"" screen have. There is, for sure, other games like this around there, but i just cant think of another one doing difficulty and enjoyment being this close to eachother.

Above all the rage and maybe the quity ones, there is a beatifull game with such perfect details. The soundtrack looks like you are in fact in the 30's; and what can we say about a game that is totally painted, drawned and animated on paper? That's crazy, nothing more and nothing less

As i completed the game with all bosses on A or better rank, all i can say is: go for it.

I love good challenge and I didn't know that some sort of ""boss rush"" games exists. So it is crazy that one of the best games ended up in my library as my virgin's first time. 

Bosses are about 2 minutes long on average if I remember correctly but it feels so LONG! This game is full of adrenaline, you keep shooting, you are doing your best and BAM next phase of boss that you do not know what to do because it's your first time and you have one last heart and oh my god your IRL heart is also pounding AF and you do not know which one you will lose first..

then after several attempts (20x 30sec runs) you start toying with loadouts. Yeah like ""please somebody save me!"" you keep rotating between the loadouts for another attempts (20x 1minute). You go back to your first loadout and after 3 attempts, you kill the boss.

""Okay, let's see the next one and quit the game.. Just see the next boss nothing more""

And you do well, you go to 50% of the level and the cycle continues until the CUPHEAD is full of your tears and you do not care about the bosses anymore and quit.

Then you start it up again after 10 minutes because YOU HAVE TO F KILL THE BOSS!!!

This game is FAIR! And this is the reason why some type of people just won't be able to put this game down for a long time (until they try DLC and back the F out as me and go back after half a year when their therapist said YOU CAN DO IT)

I can't stress this enough! this game is FAIR!! Not like Dark Souls and its ""friendly trolling"". Yeah it's fun to fall into dev's trap, but having a feeling of ""ok I have to be careful because developer do not want to challenge me but just troll me"" is too much.  Cuphead DLC has only one ""trolly"" thing but it was so cleverly done that I went from Happiness to shock to laughter to saying GOOD JOB loud for developers to hear.",1708594009,1708594009,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike other well known difficult titles that reward your persistence this is jumbled carnival sideshow nonsense, it isn't fun, only frustrating.

Don't be fooled by the art direction, people only beat this to brag about doing so, and post glowing reviews as a form of boosting ego afterwards.

I'll probably push through to the end to justify my wasted money, and boasting of my accomplishment like everyone else, but I will hate every moment of it and forever spark unnecessary arguments if Cuphead is ever a topic of positive discussion within earshot.

Cuphead isn't just a game; it's a meticulously crafted work of art that transports players into a mesmerizing world of 1930s animation and challenging gameplay. From its stunning hand-drawn visuals to its toe-tapping jazz soundtrack, every aspect of Cuphead exudes charm and creativity.

One of the first things that strikes you about Cuphead is its breathtaking art style. Every frame feels like it's been plucked straight from a classic cartoon, with vibrant colors, fluid animations, and expressive characters that burst with personality. It's a visual feast that pays homage to the golden age of animation while still feeling fresh and innovative.

But Cuphead isn't just about looks; it's also a test of skill and determination. The gameplay is tough but fair, with each boss battle presenting a unique challenge that will push you to your limits. Mastering the game's precise controls and learning the attack patterns of each boss is immensely satisfying, and the sense of accomplishment you feel after finally defeating a particularly tough opponent is second to none.

Beyond its challenging gameplay, Cuphead also boasts a killer soundtrack that perfectly complements the action on screen. From upbeat jazz tunes to haunting melodies, the music sets the mood for each encounter and adds another layer of depth to the overall experience.

But perhaps the most impressive thing about Cuphead is its attention to detail. From the smallest background elements to the elaborate boss designs, it's clear that a lot of love and care went into every aspect of the game's creation. It's the kind of game that invites you to explore every nook and cranny, uncovering hidden secrets and marveling at the craftsmanship on display.

In conclusion, Cuphead is a true masterpiece of game design that deserves all the praise it has received and more. With its stunning visuals, challenging gameplay, and infectious charm, it's a must-play experience for gamers of all ages. Whether you're a fan of classic animation or just love a good challenge, Cuphead is sure to delight and entertain from start to finish.

[i]Oh boy, I LOVE it.[/i]

This game was crafted with love, and not a single soul can make me think otherwise. The characters are designed masterfully in such a way that I started wanting not to finish the game at some point near the ending.

Also, many define the game as quite hard, but if you have the patience -- and you're not insane enough [spoiler]like I am[/spoiler] to start a 100% achievement run, I'd say the game is not THAT hard and I really think it's balanced enough. 

I like games that kick the player in the ass often, that might be why I think that way, too, of course.

The gameplay variety (I believe there's [b]more than enough[/b] of it for a game of this length), the design choices, the easter eggs, the ~fire~ jazz soundtrack, the feeling of ""'adult' game sugarcoated with goofy cartoony style"" it gave me for some reason... Finishing this game gave me a partition of my old admiration for video games back to me.

As I'm commenting this, I'm pretty much in the beginning parts of the DLC (which a dear friend gifted me <:), I'm hoping it is as good as the main game, too, because I think the Netflix show (which is another part of the franchise established years after the release of the game) cannot even get near this game in many aspects. At least, that's what I saw from watching it partially.

I just beat the game and I feel such a rush.  It's extremely satisfying to struggle with a boss fight, but to gradually see yourself improving after each attempt, then finally seeing the boss go down and the celebratory music and sound effects.  So good!!

The level design is fantastic.  The devs clearly put a lot of thought into boss attack patterns and teaching the player how to play without too much of a tutorial.  You learn mostly through trial and error once you're taught the basics.  You'll see yourself improving each time and you'll know you did it yourself, no hand-holding!

Very good game, story is interesting, a challenging game, but it’s not too hard when you get used to the 
mechanics (26 Nov 2021)

(34.1 hrs at time) 
Edit: I like the expert mode, it's a nice challenge when you finish regular, At the time of when I did the review I didn't know about expert (27 Dec 2021)

(53.7 hrs at time)
Edit 2: I finally got every boss S-Rank as well as all the Run'N'Gun Lvs P-rank (10th Feb 2022)

(61.7 hrs at time)
Just beaten the Delicious Last Course, it's awesome, very tough even on the normal difficulty. GOOD GAME Applause to Chad And Jared (16th July 2022) And everyone at MHDR 

(62.8 hrs at time)
I don't know why I kept the dates of different points in the game but oh well, I still haven't even attempted expert for the DLC or even got every item such as the cursed/divine relics, might try and get it soon (13th january 2024)

(64.8 hrs)
I did get the cursed relic (same day I said I might try and get it), the demon and angel fight was so difficult considering I was rusty by a year and half. The cursed relic is a cool feature, would have loved to use it against every boss on expert mode during my prime but oh well.
Might try and get the rest of the badges in cuphead at some point in the future to get that 100% (or should say 300%). 

(66.5 hrs)
Well I played almost every boss again for nostalgia again on a new save on regular mode thinking it would be easy having gotten S-rank on every boss. But it was surprisingly challenging...

Each character and fight feels memorable, and the journey to beat the devil feels earned after all the trials and tribulations that the player goes through. Its soundtrack is also a bop to listen to, which always earns points.

Can't say I'm a big fan of the Run & Gun levels though; while they're still good, I found they don't ever really reach the highs that the boss fights do, and they kinda bring the game down a bit because you're really only going through them for the coins rather than the level itself.

I actually purchased this game back in 2017 when it was launched. Tried playing it and realized that it was crazily tough and refunded the game. Fast forward to 2023, it was the annual Christmas sale and I decided to give it another go after playing another platformer Kaze and the wild masks. This time round Cuphead seems to be more manageable. I believed it was after having gone through the final lame boss of Kaze and the wild masks that the change happen. Try playing an easier platformer game before cuphead, it will help eases the transition into the game.

Cuphead is definitely a good buy if you want a challenge to your platformer game. It is crazily fun, very challenging and you are going to die God knows how many times. I died a total of 396 times before i completed both the main game and the dlc. 

With Cuphead, there will be time when you feel like breaking your controller. But if you stick to your gun with the game. Eventually you will kill the boss. Give it a shot especially if tough platformer game is your cup of tea. Just don't expect to breeze through the game. Definitely highly recommended for fans of platformer games with fantastic 1930s cartoony graphics. 

Just bear in mind, if you are going to buy cuphead. Buy it together with the dlc. Ms.Chalice do makes a big difference. So if mugman or cuphead is not your cup of tea. Try the playstyle of Ms.Chalice. God knows one of them might be the right fit for you.

PS : To be honest, i have always suck at platform games. So if i can finish cuphead and the dlc, so can you!",1704590660,1705631361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay and the difficulty absolutely shine in this amazing piece of art, and the different kinds of weapons you can use, charms, etc - they add some nice variety to the game. Also, of course, the old-school artstyle and soundtrack set it apart from other games and make me love it even more. 
I highly recommend Cuphead for everyone who likes a difficult platformer, as it won't hold the player's hand at any point, while giving a tremendously rewarding experience whenever you beat a new boss, achieve something new, etc.

Finally, the DLC is awesome in every regard. I love the new gear, levels, and playing as Ms. Chalice is really cool, too.",1705431981,1705431981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MDHR Studio's art is stunning and completely conquered me, and it reminds me of when I played Super Mario with my brother 20 years ago. It realy is an excellent game in recent years that reproduces the technology of 1990s in both visual and sound effects. The interweaving of visuals and musics makes it feel like there is no different from old-fashioned animation. The design of Bosses is also perfect. Every boss has his or her own character, scene, and attack method.
There is nothing to be picky about, Cuphead is a MASTERPIECE!!!

The difficulty this game is notorious for all to often comes from roadblock stages and bosses which contain patterns (see the cloud spawn patterns of the dragon boss as an example) in which random chance often leads to you being unable to avoid being hit. This game is very much style over substance in my experience. The art style is great, but there are only a handful of well designed boss fights.

Hit boxes are a discovery process, they are often nothing like the shape you would expect (a great example is stage 1 of the blue blob boss, in which it seems to be impossible to be hit by the boxing glove if you duck, even if the fist is covering almost your entire body).

The controls do not feel tight to me. I am a big fan of platformers and metroidvania style games, and either this game drops inputs like crazy, or the timings of parries (for example) are unintuitive. Either is bad. Speaking of unintuitive, I can't imagine playing this with the default control setup.

Run n' Gun stages are legitimately awful. There is not one Run n' Gun stage which even comes remotely close to being fun. Mercifully, these stages can be skipped if you don't mind not buying upgrades. Fortunately there are not many upgrades which are worth buying in my experience, as (for a casual player such as myself) the auto aim and shotgun guns were the only ones other than the regular gun I found useful, and the smoke bomb is the only upgrade I can even imagine using.

The new character added in the DLC feels legitimately terrible to play.

This game's got me duking it out with some serious challenges, but boy, it's one hell of a ride. The vintage cartoon vibes and those snazzy tunes, they've got this magic touch that keeps me grinning, even when I'm getting schooled left and right. I've danced with defeat more times than I can count, yet it's like a never-ending carnival of fun. No matter how many times I've bitten the dust, the charm of Cuphead still has me hooked. It's nothing short of swell.

But let me tip my admiration to those hard-working devs who went through the wringer to birth this masterpiece. I can't help but salute their sheer grit and gumption. Cuphead's visual pizzazz and tough-as-nails gameplay are a testament to the devs' dedication and artistic chops, earning them a truckload of respect from me. The blood, sweat, and tears poured into this indie gem by Studio MDHR shine through, turning it into not just a game but a love letter to the passion and skill of its creators.

If you haven't jumped into the Cuphead fray yet, I strongly reckon you give it a go. It's a real knockout; trust me, you're in for one hell of a time playing this game.",1704995946,1704995946,True,26,3,0.765040934085845947,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1704570862,1704570862,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, I want to point out that I spent a whopping 165 hours in this game, learning every mechanic and achieving every achievement. And I couldn't be more enthusiastic about everything that ""Cuphead"" represents.
The developers of this game simply did a great job with every detail. Their dedication and creativity shows in every texture and every unique character animation. They spent many years creating a universe that truly lives and breathes its own rules.
Not only the visual aspects of the game are admirable, but the musical accompaniment is so high quality and beautiful that it is simply amazing. Gorgeous melodies that fully match the atmosphere and action on the screen, create a unique atmosphere and add depth to the gameplay.
And what’s even more amazing is that the developers didn’t limit themselves to just the original game, but released an update in the form of additional content. New bosses, a compelling story, and other improvements that rival the quality of the original game show that the development team truly cares about its players.
I especially want to note that the game ""Cuphead"" was so successful that Netflix released an animated series based on this game. This is another indicator of how ""Cuphead"" has become a true cult phenomenon and will find its fans not only among gamers, but also among the general public.
Overall, Cuphead is a game that is simply breathtaking. It combines stunning graphics, mesmerizing music, addictive gameplay and an endless number of levels where every obstacle you overcome brings incredible satisfaction.
If you want to be completely immersed in a unique gaming world, feel the drive and experience real pleasure from the game, then ""Cuphead"" is exactly what you need. Prepare for a fabulous adventure that will captivate you from the first minutes and won't let you go until the very end!

    The loading times are barely noticeable. You can boot it up and play within thirty seconds.
    The bosses are amazing. The ground bosses are easily the best. the aerial bosses are great as well, but you lose a lot of the choice in what weapons you can use. There are also some other challenges that you can play to get new weapons/charms. The run'n'guns are definitely the weakest of the bunch, but they get better as you get further into the game. There are also the mausoleums, which are short parrying challenges, that you play to unlock ""super arts"", but there aren't many of them and they're pretty repetitive.
    Aside from the levels, there's also a world map to explore during your down time with characters to talk to and a few side quests here and there. I only wish there was more.
    Though the weapons are well balanced, the charms (buffs and abilities) could use some equalling out. Half of them are what I'd call training wheels. They're nice when you're starting out, but once you're good enough at it, they're not worth the charm slot. And some of them become practically useless in the aerial bosses. The ""whetstone"" charm represents the huge missed potential of them.
    The final boss fight of the game though decently difficult, isn't anything particularly hard compared to any other boss in the game.
    I hear people complain about the RNG, but I don't think much control is taken away from the player.
    If you're not able to keep at something until you get it then this game isn't for you.

Visuals & Audio: Inspired by 1930's rubber hose animation, the graphics in this game are beautiful. I can't say anything that hasn't already been said.
    All the characters speak in speech boxes, so there isn't much more than some grunts and other sounds. The music is where the audio truly shines. Again I can't say much that hasn't already been said. The soundtrack is just spectacular.

Story: The story is simple, but charming, which fits with the over all theme of the game.

Final review: After 100% completing this game, I have concluded that it is a flawed, but lovingly crafted, masterpiece that takes time and practise to master. Studio MDHR put their heart and soul into this game.

Game play: 4.5/5
Visuals & Audio: 5/5
Difficulty: 3.5/5

Total score: 4.5/5

The base game provides a really good amount of content - I spent about 25-30 hours to 100% the base game. The DLC added a healthy chunk of additional content, with another 10 hours or so to 100% that as well.

Pros:
+ Simple to pick up, difficult to master.
+ Nostalgic art style inspired by cartoons of the 30s. For those who are into Cuphead's art design, there is an official art book named The Art of Cuphead which is absolutely gorgeous and a must-have.
+ Great animation details. (However, you won't be able to pay much attention to them since you will be too occupied by the bosses!)
+ Great variety of level design: the bosses, their patterns/moves, etc. Just never feel repetitive.
+ Jazz soundtrack (3 hours of original recordings, wow!) also à la 30s, which is really rare these days.
+ Sweet visual and auditory bonuses. For visuals, you can [spoiler]unlock the 2-stripe and the black-and-white filter[/spoiler]. For sounds, you can [spoiler]choose between big bang or piano solo for the map background music[/spoiler], and you can also [spoiler]unlock a vintage filter, which makes the music sound like coming from a gramophone[/spoiler].
+ Upon beating the game, Expert Mode unlocks, reserved for those who think this game is not challenging enough.
+ If even Expert Mode is not hardcore enough for you, there is a local co-op mode for two players (needs at least one controller). You and your friend can fight hand in hand against bosses that have double health!
+++++++ Great plot: [spoiler]Having gambling issues, you, Cuphead, have lost all your money in a casino. Now you owe your soul to the devil, and you have no choice but become his debt collector. So you beat up every other deadbeat on the isle. On a whim, you also beat up the honest casino owner and even the devil himself. Thanks to you, debts are forgiven, and all deadbeats live happily ever after.[/spoiler]

Cons:
Not that I can think of. However, just a little caveat for casual players: this game is hard. Like, really HARD. As an average player, I have died 500 times during my first playthrough which lasts around 15 hours. However, most levels last less than 2 minutes, so you don't lose much dying. Just press on, practise more, and you will steadily progress through the game.

Verdict:
Absolutely recommend. It is such a pleasure to look at the animation of this game and to listen to its Jazz soundtrack. You surely shouldn't be daunted by its difficulty and deprive yourself of this unique experience!

Audio- and visually-wise, the game is quite literally peak and there is no debate to be had. MDHR cooked one of the most delicious meals out there among bullet hells and it'll stay at the peak for a long time.

Gameplay-wise I felt like the parry-timing was a little bit clunky (in terms of having a delay between the button press and the actual parry), perhaps that's only a mouse'n'keyboard issue, cannot say for sure. Also, it really isn't as difficult as it is often pictured, unless you are a game journalist, of course.

Overall very much worth playing (bring a friend too!) and totally worth 100%-ing, since it doesn't take this long.

I got A's on all bosses on island 1 and tried a couple island 2 bosses then stopped playing because of how boring it is considering you will keep doing the same rinse and repeat for 15+ hours of gameplay and the game isnt even hard its just repeating learning bosses moves and countering over and over and over,1703221544,1703868300,False,1,2,0.387475520372390747,5,True,False,False

Expect an ass wooping, but at least you'll have fun in the end. And the fact that the devs made DLC AND a cartoon series for this?! Amazing!

The art style is very charming and looks great. There is quite a bit more content after completing the main game. For example expert mode which adds more hp to bosses. The difficulty definitely ramps up after the first 2 bosses and the first run and gun which are more tutorials than anything. The DLC provides a couple more weapons, charms and Mrs Chalice along with 6 more bosses and a gauntlet however it doesn't add any more run and guns.

If your looking for a challenging but fun game I would definitely recommend Cuphead as well as the DLC too go along with it, its definitely worth it in my opinion. Anyone who is fairly familiar with video games should be able too beat this games main story. I would recommend using a controller ( like an xbox controller ) instead of a keyboard. Its worth all the money down too the coin in my opinion. Fun game play and a brilliant art style combine too make in my opinion one of the best indie games and also one of the best games too be sold on steam.

Hello,I love this game and i would recommend to  buy this game as it is very fun and it isn't a short game as it is quiet a long game with 3 isles and a DLC.  I view this game as a fun and interesting game made to have fun. I would comment that even though i have only played for 3 hours its very fun and thrilling to beat bosses and unlock new and more powerful weapons to fight and conquer the stronger bosses as you venture through isles 1-3. I would also recommend buying the Delicious Last Course (DLC) as it gives a slight advantage as you unlock a new playable character Ms. Chalice, she has 4 lives rather than the originally 3 you start of with and she has and ability that makes her able to perform and invisibility roll that when done it will not take any hit points (HP) for any enemy that could have been in front of her.
Overall, I would say that this game is very enjoyable and should be played a lot more due to the creativity and the hard work put to create this beautiful game

I hope you hear what i have wrote about and i aslo hope you enjoy the rest of your week.

Fights are connected via a top down hub world (similar to Donkey Kong Country 3) in which you meet oddball characters and discover hidden secrets. 

The visuals and sound design blend together to improve the game’s flow and sell the old school animation style. The jazzy soundtrack guides the gameplay into feeling quick and bouncy. The juxtaposition between the hand drawn foreground and watercolor background allow the levels to be incredibly detailed without distracting from stage hazards and intractable objects. 

I wouldn’t consider Cuphead to be an “easy” game, but I would argue that it is not as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most bosses can be beaten within 3 to 4 minutes, so the penalty for dying is more of less nonexistent. Rather than relying on quick reflexes to beat levels, you can progress through the entire game just be familiarizing yourself with the enemy attack patterns. And if a boss phase feel too unforgiving you can customize your build to accommodate for a different play style.",1703443052,1703443052,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It is quite hard, lots of trial and error should be expected. However, every loss feels like you have just made some progress. It never quite feels frustrating. If you like tough games, especially platformers in the fashion of Celeste or Super Meat Boy, you are likely to love Cuphead. Even someone who doesn't enjoy the genre so much, or gets frustrated easily, would probably find the game amusing. It is specifically centered around boss battles, so you can expect lots of that, as well as a few actual standard platforming levels. This is the definition of a game that is easy to learn, hard to master, and even harder to fully complete.

I found the game amazing, and I managed to do everything, even the DLC and expert mode. Overall, Cuphead is a nice, enjoyable game that I would recommend to nearly anyone. 9.5/10",1703375796,1703375796,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not just one of the best indie games ever made but one of the strongest artistic visions ever presented in any video game. It is difficult and very challenging (especially those DLC bosses) however I don't really feel like I am frustrated with sections of the game. Every boss/level can be completed in about 2-3minutes but that doesn't mean that every level will take that amount of time. I think my playtime on just Inkwell Isle 4 was roughly 6 hours. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good challenge or solid bullet-hell type gameplay. Such a great price for tons of replayable content whether it's on sale or not.

268910,153790919,76561199046539807,0,3,4536,0,4534,1702823253,"   Cuphead is a incredibly iconic game that is brought up time and time again, I started playing it around 5 years ago on Xbox and since then have bought it on switch and now steam. It is a brutal game that is satisfying to conquer and is very fun to play. I would recommend anyone to play it Cup head is worth the money 100%

   Cuphead's unique art and visual style sets it apart from other shoot'em ups and platformers. It has a stunning 1930's cartoon style and is completely hand drawn. The game also makes use of watercolor backgrounds clay models and a in studio symphony to create a perfect atmosphere of music and visuals.
  
   The game itself is very hard but after some time and a few playthroughs you can learn the rhythm of the bosses and it becomes much easier. I personally have beaten cuphead probably 50+ times, it works well as a co-op game with friends. As much as I love cuphead one drawback about the game play is that some bosses attacks just don't really work right in multiplayer particularly homing attacks become completely unfair as they just randomly lock on to a player so you cant know its coming for you.

   The game has a wide variety of weapons charms and supers to mix up the game play and let you create the perfect load out to suit your play style or to body a boss. For the most part no weapon is objectively better than any other giving the player lots of options for their load out. The charms are balanced well also however at least for me and people I've played the game with the supers aren't balanced well with the first one being far and away the best.

    The boss fights in the game are impeccable, instead of having a series of levels before a boss fight Cuphead opts for non stop boss fights with the occasional mausoleum or run in gun. The bosses are fast paced and brutally hard, however if you can learn the fights it becomes super fun to fight them being able to quickly take them down without to much trouble. Cuphead works very well for challenge runs by restricting load out options for this very reason as it lets you truly put your knowledge of the bosses to the test.

   Cupheads DLC is also worth buying it adds a whole new isle with new bosses and a parry themed gauntlet the new bosses are harder than old ones but follow any thing stated before. The main drawback to the DLC is that the new weapons are somewhat unbalanced especially compared to the old balancing of weapons crack shot is well cracked making several shots obsolete.

    100% this game drove me crazy in particular S-ranking all the DLC bosses but it was worth it and I would still replay cuphead any day. It is definitely worth buying for it stunning visuals, amazing music and great game play. Cuphead is an easy 10/10",1702821105,1702821105,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Game requires a delicate balance of quick movement, bullet hell dodging, but unloading damage into the boss. June 2022 can't come quick enough!


Edited Post-DLC: Still an amazing game. Repetition and learning is rewarded, the feeling of learning and progressing is perfectly matched with how brutal each boss can feel on the very first try. Each boss once again has incredible music, attacks, animation, and everything else.

RNG. You're handsomely rewarded for getting good luck and punished for having poor luck. It's an issue that 
persists throughout the entire game unfortunately, particularly when boss phases overlap. Having said that, 
Cuphead is still overall skill based and memory/experience intensive. The Shmup bosses also aren't balanced as well as they should be. Getting every achievement was a frustrating experience tbh, some bosses (particularly the Shmup bosses) can be genuinely un-fun. Still glad i experienced it on expert difficulty tho.

The difficulty level is very on point in such a manner that the game doesn't feel infuriating or too easy, even though the simple mode exists, which I guess is for the casual gamer, the game doesn't feel too difficult at any point.

The only complain I'd have is that it quite feels... 'short'. No, I did not beat it in 6 hours, more like 12. I just pressed the quit button in the main menu and the hours refused to register even though my internet is on, I'd assume that is a bug by the game, perhaps it was registered as a crash instead of quitting by steam which resulted in my hours not saving.

Sure, you can go and 200% the game, beating every boss with S rank which is quite difficult, considering there is the junkyard robot which would be the worst thing imaginable, but that feels dreadful and non-rewarding.

Leaving all of those aside the game has a great art style, great story telling and very well polished mechanics. It is definitely worth buying at full price ( You don't really have a choice, it barely goes at 12 euros when on sale ).

Though i feel like i really need to highlight something that ive noticed while playing.

Every now and then bosses seem to sometimes dish out RNG attacks at you, which artificially increases difficulty. 

While there obviously are attack patterns for each boss and memorizing them certainly helps, every now and then you'll scratch your head wondering why the boss did some attacks twice or even something completely different at that point in your run, which really just ends up feeling cheap and unfair towards the player. 

Again, after many hours i am quite confident in saying that it really does the aforementioned every now and then, just to give you a hard time.

It's BS but im willing to look past that because i love the unique art style and i appreciate the amount of effort and dedication that went into the game.

I must stress that I was 100% keen for this game for a long time. However, I was never going to buy it if it had that rotten Denuvo crap, which is the devil's stinky excrement. Luckily, it doesn't!!!

The game itself is grueling, but in the most delightful way. You will die many, many times. But if you're like me, you will find this entertaining. You will see some people complaining that it's to hard; I don't like this criticism!! 

It's sad when Devs buckle under preassure from your Candy Crush sookie la-la type panzies asking to make the game a walk in the park. Brigador faced a lot of criticism for the game being to hard, now it's so ridiculously easy, it's not really fun. But Cuphead did not buckle under any talk of it being too hard, which is great! It's actually not really [i]that[/i] hard, it just requires patience, but this trait is lacking in dimwitted people who want things quick and easy. At the end of the day, the difficulty of the game has been designed masterfully.

The graphics are amazing. There's no other game that does what this game does graphically. I don't know why Disney isn't paying the devs $10 Billion to work on some games using a similar animation style. 

Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this game at full price!! The Delicious Last Course, exceeded all my expectations, this game is one of the greatest ever made :cuphead:",1532095549,1700904472,True,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

I'm a quarter through the main game in about 3 hours. I'd recommend this game if you like a game that is difficult but reasonably so. One thing I really like is that when I get hit or die, I always feel like it's my fault and not some unfair mechanic or bug. So take it slow and don't get frustrated, and you'll be fine. If you can't handle a fairly difficult game or dying a lot or not getting frustrated, this game probably isn't for you although there is an easy mode which I haven't tried.

The controls are tight and Cuphead is very responsive to inputs. I press on the jump button, he jumps. There is no input delay what-so-ever. The level design is creative and thanks to the colorful art, is more memorable.

Cuphead is split into 3 worlds that get progressively harder (or 4 if you buy the dlc), but there's a catch: This game is also quite tough starting in the very first world, which is not necessarily everyone's cup of tea, but I like it this way. I don't think the base game is too hard either. Now, trying to obtain every collectable and maxing out the rank of every level, that's a whole other story.

If you have never played an action game, let alone a sidescroller, before or you have some sort of disability, (since the game requires high reflexes and attention) I can't really recommend it to you, but in general the game is fantastic and is worth every cent from my own personal experience.

From the stunning visuals, the old cartoon art-style, the fluid animation, the music, the gameplay that's simple to learn and hard to master, the location variety, the bosses, and the good amount of length it has. This is far from one of the best games I've played in my life, literally everything in this game is amazing. I can't think of a single flaw that destroyed my experience with it. Because this game has a lot of replay value, in which you learn the boss and approach said boss in the most optimal way you can. Sure some of the weapons and charms suck, but again, you can approach the game however you like! It's such a blast to play through, I recommend this game down in my heart, it's so good!

Firstly, Cuphead has a unique visual style that certainly attracts attention. The graphic design of the game is completely inspired by the classic American animated films of the 1930s, created manually using the techniques of cartoon animation of that time. This creates a unique atmosphere and a feeling as if you are playing a cartoon. High-quality animation and detailed characters and levels raise the bar for visual performance to a new level.

Secondly, the game offers insanely complex gameplay that requires skill, reaction and strategic thinking from the player. Cuphead is a classic platformer with elements of ""bitmap"", where players have to go through a series of difficult bosses, battles with which require high speed, accuracy and memorization of enemy attacks. However, even despite its complexity, the game remains fair, giving players a sense of satisfaction and achievement at the levels passed.

In addition, the game offers a great soundtrack that perfectly matches the visual style and gameplay. Music in the game is a characteristic feature of each level and boss, and it helps to create an atmosphere of trial and tension. The soundtrack, recognized by experts and players, allows you to fully immerse yourself in the game world of Cuphead.

Finally, the game also has a great co-op mode that allows you to play with a friend or family member on the same screen. This is a great opportunity to spend time having fun and intense, along with the possibility of solving complex tasks and challenges together.

Summing up all these aspects, Cuphead stands out significantly among other games and deserves the ""Game of the Year"" award at the ""Favorite Child"" award. It offers a memorable visual style, challenging and addictive gameplay, a great soundtrack and the opportunity to play with friends or family. Cuphead is a game that is not only technically outstanding, but also leaves the feeling of a true work of art in the world of video games.",1688149331,1700624532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't want to know how much time and pain it took to hand-craft every one of the incredible animations in the game. The high difficulty of the bosses give you the chance to digest and scrutinize every animations and appreciate how well they telegraph attacks. The animations are so over-the-top, and you'll never expect what these 3 to 5 phase bosses have in store for you. The OST is also one of my favorites in video games, a ragtime jazz ensemble that nails the aesthetic and just sounds awesome. Boss fights are usually about 2-3min long, and each track is nearly 5 min. That's how much extra effort they put into the music.

You'd think a game with such a high focus on artistry may falter in the gameplay department, but holy hell, this game is a blast to play. The general concept of the bosses and levels is they have a set of moves that are simple to avoid, but what makes it so challenging, fun, and exciting is how all these moves layer on top of each other during the fight in creative ways. For example, one boss has a rollercoaster cart that appears in the background before running across the screen as an attack. You have to keep track of the cart and dodge the boss, who launches balloon dogs at you. It's all crafted in a way that is difficult but not unfair, and its so rewarding and enjoyable to dissect and manage all the things on the screen going on at once.

Öncelikle oyun harika. Çizimleriyle, müzikleriyle, atmosferiyle, yaratıcığıyla tamamen mükemmel. Nadiren gelen mücevher oyunlardan birisi.Oyunun sadece bir sıkıntısı var, o da zorluk dengesi. Bakın tekrar ediyorum, oyunun zorluğu değil, zorluğun dengesi. Şu kısımda detayları var isterseniz diğer satıra atlayabilirsiniz.

[spoiler] İlk olarak oyunda 3 ada var ve her adada bosslarla dövüşüyor ve en sonunda şeytanla yüzleşiyorsunuz. Oyuncu ilerledikçe ordan burdan topladığı parayla ekipmanlarını geliştirebiliyor ve açık ara bazı ekipmanlar sizin favorileriniz oluyor çünkü ciddi manada güçlüler. Mesela ben bosslar ufak şeyler yolladığında crackshot silahı, kendisi geldiğinde charge silahı kullanırım. Bu kombo ile yapamayacağınız şey yok. Bu demek ki ilerledikçe düşmanlar daha zor olmalı ama maalesef pek öyle işlemiyor.
İlk adada Hilda Berg korkunç derecede zor bi boss. Oyunda uçak kullanmayı ilk öğrendiğimiz bossun hilda berg olması çok yanlış bir seçim. Aşırı fazla dikkat dağıtıcı etken var ve yeni oyuncuların çoğunun tıkandığı yer orası. Ondan sonra ikinci adada gelen Djimmi the Great (Alaadin kılıklı adam) ondan çok daha kolay bir boss. Aynı durum da Ribby and Croaks'da geçerli. İkinci Baroness Von Bon Bon bile bu kurbağalardan çok daha kolay.
Üçüncü adada Dr. Kahl's Robot'u var. Allahın belası boss. Geçtim ama tamamen tesadüfen geçtim. İlk aşaması korkunç uzun sürüyor ve bu da sadece ilk kısmı geçmeyi bile imkansız kılıyor. Ama şöyle bir durum var ki ikinci ve üçüncü aşaması aşırı kolay. Tüm oyun boyunca en zorlandığım kısım bu bossun ilk kısmı oldu.
Tl;Dr İlk karşımıza çıkan bosslar sonradan gelen bosslardan daha zor olabiliyor, bazen de tersine 2 ve 3. adadaki boss anormal derecede kolay olabiliyor. [/spoiler]



İkinci zorluk problemi kesinlikle final. King Dice boss tasarımı berbat. Sizden zar atmanızı istiyor ve bu zara gelen boss ile savaşıyorsunuz. Mevzu şu ki 1,6 ve 9. boss tamamen canınızı yemek için tasarlanmış. Oyunda rastgele bu 9 bossun üçüne ekstra can atıyor ve oyunu resetleyip o kalplerin saydığım üç boss dışında bir bossun üstüne gelene kadar restart atıyorsunuz. Eğer iyi bir şeye denk gelirse kalperin hepsini toplayın çünkü şanslı değilseniz ihtiyacınız olacak. Bitirdiğiniz vakit king dice parmaklarıyla %50 şans ihtimaliyle sağdan veya soldan kart atmaya başlayacak. Bunları parrylemek korkunç derecede zor bu yüzden çoğu kişi benim yaptığım gibi en sağa veya en sola gidiyor. Orda durduğunuz sürece %50 şansla kurtuluyorsunuz. O kartları sizin ters tarafınıza yollarken siz zıplayıp saldıracaksınız. Bu kadar basit. Şansınız yoksa her seferinde kartlar size gelecek. King Dice'ı bir şekilde yenince karşınıza şeytan geliyor ve şunu söylemem gerekiyor ki şeytan fazlasıyla kolaydı. King dice'a saatlerimi gömdüm, robot bossu da aynı şekilde. Ama şeytan çok tahmin edilebilir basit saldırılara sahipti. Bu kadar kolay olacağını düşünmemiştim ve bu kolaylık beni tatmin etmedi doğrusu.

The most important thing that makes Cuphead special is its unique art design, which is extremely rare in video games. The cartoons of the 1930s are the inspiration for this artistic design, which is both simple and beautiful just like them. This rare beauty is mixed with a simple and smooth gameplay that makes defeating the bosses a very special feeling of triumph; A victory that can only be achieved by putting in effort and precision. Although Cuphead is only an hour long, the game's difficulty ensures that it takes more than eight hours to finish the game; And this is not a problem because difficulty never gets monotonous and boring. Also, apart from the visual beauty of Cuphead, classical music is another reason that makes Cuphead an exciting and enjoyable game.

Beautiful art design like 1930s animations, both characters and environments

PROS:
-The entire presentation is incredible; one of the best looking and sounding 2D games ever made.
-Very fast and snappy controls.
-Fun and rewarding game play.

CONS:
-Some of the weapons/charms suck balls and are useless. The smoke bomb is OP.
-While most of the bosses are 100% fair and challenging, some are complete horseshit that barely telegraph attacks.
-Difficulty is not evenly distributed IE some Isle 3 bosses are easier than Isle 2 bosses.
-The non-boss-fight stages are just okay.",1699648549,1699648549,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Released in 2017, Cuphead captivated players with its unique art style, captivating soundtrack, and intense gameplay. In this review, we'll explore the key elements that make Cuphead a true artistic masterpiece and an unforgettable gaming experience.

Artistic and Visual Splendor:
Cuphead's hand-drawn art style is a true testament to the dedication and craftsmanship of its developers. Inspired by the animation styles of the 1930s, the game's visuals are a nostalgic throwback to the golden era of cartoons. Every frame is meticulously designed, with vibrant colors, fluid animations, and attention to detail that brings the game world to life. Cuphead's visual splendor is a feast for the eyes and a true work of art.

Immersive and Nostalgic Soundtrack:
The game's soundtrack, composed by Kristofer Maddigan, perfectly complements the visual style and enhances the overall experience. The jazzy, big band-inspired music transports players back to the era of classic cartoons, further immersing them in the game's world. The lively and energetic tunes add an extra layer of excitement and nostalgia, making every boss battle and level feel like a thrilling adventure.

Challenging Gameplay and Precision:
Cuphead is renowned for its challenging gameplay that requires precision, timing, and quick reflexes. The game is filled with intense boss battles and platforming levels that test the player's skills and patience. Each encounter presents unique patterns and mechanics that need to be mastered in order to progress. While the difficulty can be daunting at times, the sense of accomplishment upon overcoming a challenge is immensely rewarding.

Cooperative Multiplayer:
Cuphead features cooperative multiplayer, allowing players to team up with a friend and tackle the game's challenges together. The cooperative mode adds a new dimension to the gameplay, requiring communication and coordination between players.

PROS:
 - Unique visual style (hand-drawn) and music (jazz).
 - No bugs.
 - Good and fun game, some bosses (about 4-5) are really cool.
 - Local Co-op.
 - Really low requirements (I can run it on my work laptop).

CONS:
 - Short (8-9h for the average Joe). No replayability.
 - Too difficult to play co-op with casual gamers.
 - RNG bullshit (winning should depend on skill, not luck).
 - Parry needs refining (I keep feeling cheated when timing the parry and still getting hit).
 - Things that spawn and are currently out of screen hit you if you're also out of screen (this adds to RNG bullshit, if I NEED to be there because of RNG, why do I have to randomly get hit?).
 - NO online co-op (In 2020? Seriously?)

All in all, it has 19 bosses (4-5 really cool, 3-4 are bullshit), 6 platforming levels and requires a good deal of pacience and luck (some bosses take about 20-30 tries).

Paid full price for this game on steam and i am glad i did not skip over this. After hearing a lot of things about this game i decided to look into it. This game is quite challenging but it makes you want to continue playing and see what is next even if you have to do it over and over again.

The control is pretty good and you move well even with a mouse and keyboard. I beat the game using mouse and keyboard, a controller is not necessary but it probably might make the game slightly easier or a lot. I was able to beat Expert Mode with a Keyboard so for people who just want to use keyboard, it is doable.

The music is great and fit the game beautifully. The design of the bosses and worlds really does make the game stand out. I don't write reviews much but i did it because this game really deserve recognition. Also i needed to write a review for the steam awards badge. I am a casual badge collector, I like badges.

• [u]Art and Animation[/u]: Cuphead boasts a visually stunning hand-drawn art style inspired by 1930s cartoons, creating a unique and charming aesthetic. The animation is fluid and brings the characters to life in a captivating way.

• [u]Innovative Boss Battles[/u]: The game features creatively designed and challenging boss battles that showcase a variety of patterns and phases. Each encounter feels distinct, offering a fresh and engaging experience throughout the game.

• [u]Jazzy Soundtrack[/u]: Cuphead's soundtrack is a standout feature, featuring an original jazzy and big band composition that perfectly complements the game's visual style. The music enhances the overall atmosphere and adds to the retro feel.

• [u]Cooperative Gameplay[/u]: Cuphead supports local cooperative play, allowing two players to team up and tackle the challenging levels together. The cooperative mode adds a layer of strategy and coordination, enhancing the overall fun.

• [u]Attention to Detail[/u]: The game pays meticulous attention to detail, capturing the essence of classic animation and creating a cohesive world filled with imaginative characters, environments, and subtle nods to pop culture.

• [u]Fair Difficulty Curve[/u]: While challenging, Cuphead maintains a fair difficulty curve. The game gradually introduces new mechanics and boss patterns, giving players the opportunity to learn and adapt without becoming overly frustrating.

[hr][/hr]

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
• [u]High Difficulty Level[/u]: While the difficulty curve is fair, Cuphead is known for its high level of difficulty, which may be a deterrent for some players looking for a more casual gaming experience.

• [u]Limited Exploration[/u]: Cuphead primarily focuses on boss battles and run-and-gun levels, limiting the exploration aspect. Players looking for a more expansive world with exploration elements may find the game somewhat restrictive.

• [u]No Level Variety[/u]: The levels, while visually distinct, often follow a similar structure of boss battles or run-and-gun sequences. Some players may desire more variety in level design and objectives.

[hr][/hr]

[h1] The Ugly [/h1]
• [u]Repetitiveness for Solo Players[/u]: Solo players may find certain boss battles repetitive, as the game's true charm often shines in cooperative play. The experience might feel less dynamic and varied when played alone.

• [u]Occasional Hitbox Issues[/u]: Some players have reported occasional hitbox issues, where it seems like they should avoid an attack, but they still get hit. These instances can be frustrating, particularly during challenging boss encounters.

• [u]Limited Replayability[/u]: Once players complete the main campaign, Cuphead's replayability may be limited for some, as the primary focus is on mastering boss battles. Additional modes and content updates could enhance long-term appeal.

**Positives**
-Difficult at first but becomes easy once mastered. When starting the game there will be MANY frustrating moments that feel out of the player control but each fight is premade so the more runs you play the easier it becomes. If you cannot handle losing a few hundred times then this game will not be for you. 
-With friends the bosses gain a bit more HP but the attack patterns are the same as single player. Allowed with infinite revives as long as both players are able to parry each other's ghost. If you are very experience in the game then you can bring a friend and constantly revive them while they scream ""please stop let me die"". The most memorable moment for me and hopefully for many. 
-Fun+All different abilities/powers allows the player to cater toward their specific playstyle.
**Neutral**
-Run and Gun sections is my least favorite part of the game. Some will enjoy this mode but for me I love boss rush type games more than platforming. 
-No punishment for losing. There is no insensitive to not constantly run your head into a boss until you randomly win. 
**Bad**
-Many of the abilities and weapons are clearly outclassed. The balance could use some work in my opinion.
-The difficulty increase in the game is somewhat artificial as there will be slight changes to the boss attacks such as, more projectiles, faster movement, etc... it's ultimately the same boss with the same attack pattern with the same playstyle. Better than 99% of other games that only increase dmg and hp but still disappointing for this game.
-Low Replay value. There will be no new content and no reason to start a new save unless you want S+ and P ranks that won't affect the game.",1698020107,1698020107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nothing can ever compete with the dedicated craftmanship that went into each and every frame, which btw was hand drawn and hand inked before being scanned into the computer. Regardless of the rest of the game, the visual spectacle alone is worth twice the money. 

The game is known for being brutally difficult, but not in a punishing way. No significant progress is ever lost (except fighting King Dice at the very end). Also, the game does very well at feeling like it is beatable, and every boss can be overcome with enough sheer patience and practice. 

The difficulty is a significant downside for me, however. I was forced to use a mod to artificially change the game's difficulty, even beyond Simple mode, to the point that it felt more enjoyable for me. 

The default control scheme is also fairly horrendous. Changing controls on PC is an absolute necessity, as nothing is mapped in any intuitive way. Also forces use of the keyboard for everything, never using the mouse at all. Probably this is because the game was made for Xbox and haphazardly ported over to PC, but still... could have used some more forethought. Some keyboards have built in fail safes that prevent too many keys to be pressed at once... which becomes a serious issue with some bosses.",1697945755,1697945755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But anyways if that's not your thing. Do you just wanna complete the game without doing anything else later on. This game is gonna be a creative choice for you. This game contains a lot of new fun bossfights with cool mechanics and physics. The game got me wondering a lot on how you could ever beat hilda berg on expert mode or finding all the hidden coins in the map without searching it up on youtube.

The game has it's own Netflix serie, you should go check it out ""The Cuphead show"" the series and the game have a story and it's more detailed watching it on Netflix, but it's about Cuphead and Mugman on an adventure to compete and win against their enemies to get their way over island by island until they arrive at their final destination called the devil. The game does also contain a dlc called The delicious last course it's very out of sync with the inkwell isles. But it's still fun and contains a lot of new gameplay and functionality to the game.

This game has given me mixed emotions, sometimes I can rage the crap out of the game and wanting to smash my controller and sometimes I get motivated to workout and doing 10 pushups when I win on expert mode.

If you buy the game to 200% you are doing something that you'll regret. I wish you could luck and hopefully you will controll your anger better than I do.

Should you buy this game? Absolutely no matter what. Love it and the gameplay and style of the level is underrated and I think much more of the games should have this old style. 8/10!",1697925465,1697925465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To your surprise, it's a run-and-gun boss-battle game! The animation helps sell the bosses' movement and helps you predict what they're going to do. ""Wow, this is so much fun!"" You fight the vegetables, do the first run-and-gun stage, everything's great.

And then somewhere along the way, it'll hit you.

This game is hard. REALLY hard. This game will destroy you frontways and back. It won't be the same bosses as everyone else--maybe you'll beat a boss in a half-dozen tries that took your friend scores of attempts--but somewhere along the way, you'll hit a hard boss, and then you'll realize this is just Island 1, and there's still two more to go. XD

But don't let the difficulty hold you back! Once you get to the end, lose to the Devil fifty times, and then FINALLY kick his kiester, you'll feel like a god among mortals.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

From the very first glance, ""Cuphead"" captures the essence of a bygone era, presenting itself with the allure and charm of a 1930s cartoon. But don't let its vintage appearance deceive you – this is a game that demands precision, patience, and perseverance.

The art style is breathtaking. It's clear that the developers, Studio MDHR, poured immense love and dedication into recreating the look and feel of old-school animations. Every frame of the game feels like a moving work of art, with intricate details and fluid animations that are a treat to the eyes. Complementing the visual treat is the jazzy, upbeat soundtrack that sets the perfect tone for Cuphead's adventures.

Gameplay-wise, ""Cuphead"" is no walk in the park. It's a challenging run-and-gun platformer that demands quick reflexes and a sharp eye. The boss battles, which are the highlight of the game, are varied and require players to learn patterns and tells to come out victorious. This might not appeal to everyone, especially those easily frustrated, but for those who appreciate a challenge, it's immensely rewarding.

Co-op mode brings another layer of fun and chaos, allowing a second player to join as Mugman. The cooperative gameplay does not necessarily make the game easier, but it offers a different dynamic that can be a lot of fun with the right partner.

A few minor gripes include occasional difficulty spikes and the desire for even more content. But these are small criticisms in an otherwise masterful game.

In conclusion, ""Cuphead"" is a masterpiece that bridges the gap between the past and present. It's a loving tribute to 1930s animation and old-school gaming challenges. It might test your patience at times, but the satisfaction of overcoming its trials is worth every ounce of effort.

Disclaimers aside this is a very solid title for what it aims for. Nothing I could say will be anything new or unsaid considering its popularity and ratings but there is always some room to praise the craftsmanship of the old-school, hand-made animations and graphics. The game itself doesn't stay behind - bosses are varied, cartoonishly goofy and very difficult. I was very pleased to see how well balanced it is, that is I could almost never say that something happened and it wasn't my fault or my lack of positional awareness...though guess I could complain about sometimes way too much on the screen but apparently bullet hell is part of its design especially with the DLC now being out. But in short - game is refined well enough that skill issue is more often the actual problem than the game itself. Which is excellent, wish more games had this level of polish...but then considering I failed to beat it makes me feel very old ^^""
Not that there aren't ways to make it easier as there is ""simple"" mode and game genie to boost our HP (although that trick seems nigh impossible to do on keyboard) buuut it cripples the end score (and achievement possibilities as consequence) which thus seems to defeat the purpose as challenge is all the game is about. There isn't much reason to cheese a boss this way as there isn't much story to pursue - there is only as much of it to justify some boss rush so it's not like there is some epic story to conclude. It's simply the skill galore thus if someone's not up for the challenge then there isn't much reason to get the game.
I did take it to try to Complete it to see do I still ""got it"" [strike]but I guess I don't...I mean I probably could if I grinded harder against my better judgement but I also can acknowledge my limits and pursue something else instead. It sounds wise but sure makes me feel so old, but then sacrifice for bragging rights is a poor deal ^^"". But babbling of some wimp aside - [/strike]
[strike]Edit: I did beat it all on A rank in the end after a longer break, not all-achievements kind of thing but done most.[/strike] Edit2: Nevermind, got them all. After a time I don't think it was a matter of ""still having it"" but pushing myself into a genre/playstyle I never liked/been good at in the first place and there is no point pushing a challenge of which structure and principles I dislike.
Anyways if you pick this is up just remember to take breaks and know when to stop. Playing tilted is never healthy and may lead to both anger or depression and make you write gibberish philosophy like I did here before editing it... But yeah if it's too hard no shame in dropping it and it's nobody's business if you do. It may just be not quite your cup of tea and you don't realize it like I didn't for 20 hours.",1688906455,1697139670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously though, it really is on the same level as Dark Souls when it comes to boss design and gameplay. Not so much on the world design! However, not every game needs to be a metroid-vania, so it's fine that Cuphead's world is in the same vein as 2D Mario games with an overworld you can freely travel along.

Cuphead has been in my backlog for years at this point. Now that I've taken it out, I'm baffled that it collected dust for so long. Truly one of the greatest modern video games I've played.

You can't review Cuphead without talking about the art. It's 11 out of 10. It's just off-the-scales excellent.
The gameplay is tight, the weapons are varied enough not only to lead to different play styles, but also to add replay value, the levels are intriguing and challenging (all while being fairly simplistic on paper), and it's a blast in 1 or 2 player modes.

The levels start out pretty easy, but they escalate quickly. The bosses are the old-style of bosses where you need to memorize their patterns to avoid being hit.

Lastly, the ranking system also allows for a lot of replayability as you'll want to not just beat the levels but do so more perfectly :-D",1697036716,1697036716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lets break it down into a few parts:

1. Music
    It's no surprise that music is a talking point on why this game is so heavily favored. The jazz brings the game to life and make the player feel it in real time. Every boss, level, and map area has their own theme. For a game that has little dialogue, it sure says a lot through its music.

2. Gameplay
    The second talking point is about the gameplay more specific to the first playthrough. If your at all aware of the game, then you probably know that it is known for being exceedingly hard. And I completely agree. On the first playthrough, most bosses took me 20min-1hour past the first isle. I think this adds on to the game. Not only does it give the player something to really focus on, it feels so rewarding when the KO pops up. If you plan on buying the game, please don't rage quit. The reward is so worth the grind.

3. Scenery and Design
    I mean, what do I need to say, the game is beautiful. The 30's cartoon with the watercolor backgrounds is just amazing. The bosses, levels, and isles are extraordinary as well as things like the sounds and effects of weapons and bosses.  

Overall the game deserves its 96% positive rating, I believe it is a 10/10 and everyone should at least give it a try and beat the game at least once (on regular). I currently speedrun the game in free time and once I mastered every boss it is really relaxing to just chill through a run. Expert mode is a whole can of worms that should only be touched once you really have a grasp of every boss.

Side note: The DLC is the same experience, King's Gauntlet is pretty fun and the bosses definitely step up from the main game. I'd give the DLC an 7.5/10 but still solid.",1696647703,1696649513,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cuphead blends a smooth & fluid control scheme with stunning 1930s animation inspired art into a flawlessly executed video game experience for me. The game is your simple classic platforming genre with a twist: Instead of journeying through the multiple linear levels in an area to fight a boss - the boss fights become the main focus with only a few of those original ""Point A to Point B"" style levels. This is a welcomed change - a games that are a constant wave of boss fights is becoming one of my favorite genres (Titan Souls, Shadow of the Colossus are my favorite but there are also games like Elden Ring/Bloodborne).

If your a fan of retro classic like Super Mario Bros. and shooters like contra - this is for you. You can sink a handful of hours into it at a time trying to learn boss patterns and become victorious. You can buy and upgrade weapons for a different approach - it's just wonderful. It's refreshing but somewhat nostalgic. I couldn't recommend this game higher.

My only suggestion is when you complete the game, you should be able to easily access boss fights and see their information within a menu instead of having to traverse in the over-world and walking to each level/fight. It's great for the first play-through when you discover coins, NPCs, etc. - but when I boot the game again to play more I'm just trying to get to these levels and go for  higher scores/achievements.

Today I thought I'm gonna see if I was just retarded back then, maybe I'm gonna make it today. Nope. Still can't do it (cuz repeating gets boring). Game looks beautiful and honestly it's such a shame it's so hard, and it's hard in a bad way, because it's one of those games in which due to constant level restart after a while you don't want to try beating the same level from the start anymore and die at the very end anyway. This makes it muscle memory game instead just fun game. I am not a super great player, but I am not a bad player either. For better picture of my gaming background; I usually finish games on higher difficulty level than normal, for example Witcher on Blood, Sweat and tears. SW:FO & SW:JS on Jedi Master, GOW & GOW:R on Give me no mercy. I also loved Valheim which was universally touted as an unforgiving game and had no frustrations with it, etc etc. 

So maybe not my type of ""hard"", but I honestly can't recommend this game. Maybe for you it could be fun, fellow player, but not for me.

The game's art style draws inspiration from the 1930s cartoons, featuring hand-drawn animation and character designs reminiscent of classic Disney and Fleischer Studios animations. Every frame is a work of art, and the attention to detail in replicating the era's aesthetics is simply astounding.

2. Catchy Jazz Soundtrack: The game's soundtrack, composed by Kristofer Maddigan, is a toe-tapping, jazzy masterpiece. Each level and boss battle is accompanied by a unique, period-appropriate musical score that adds to the overall charm and atmosphere of the game.

3. Challenging Gameplay: Cuphead offers a refreshing and challenging experience. The gameplay is a throwback to the old-school run-and-gun shooters of the past, with precise controls and a variety of weapons and abilities to master. Boss battles are particularly memorable, offering intense, pattern-based challenges that require skill and persistence to conquer.

4. Cooperative Multiplayer: Cuphead supports local cooperative play, allowing two players to team up and take on the game's challenges together. This cooperative mode adds another layer of enjoyment, as players work together to overcome the game's toughest obstacles.

5. Variety of Bosses: The game's boss battles are a highlight, featuring a colorful cast of quirky and memorable characters. Each boss presents a unique set of challenges and mechanics, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting from start to finish.

6. Progression and Upgrades: Cuphead offers a sense of progression through the acquisition of new abilities and upgrades. Players can customize their playstyle by purchasing different weapons and charms, allowing for strategic choices and experimentation.

7. Respect for Tradition: Cuphead pays homage to the history of animation and gaming with great respect and attention to detail. It's a love letter to the past, and this passion is palpable in every aspect of the game.

8. Fair Difficulty Curve: Despite its reputation for being challenging, Cuphead strikes a fair difficulty balance. It's tough but not unfairly punishing, encouraging players to learn from their mistakes and gradually improve their skills.

9. Regular Updates: The developers have continued to support Cuphead with downloadable content (DLC), adding even more content and challenges to an already excellent game. This ongoing commitment to the player community is commendable.

In conclusion, Cuphead is a true gem in the world of indie gaming. Its stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack, and challenging gameplay combine to create a one-of-a-kind experience that pays homage to the golden age of animation. It's a game that not only captures the essence of retro gaming but also pushes the medium forward with its innovative artistry. Cuphead is a testament to the power of creativity and dedication in game development, and it's a must-play for anyone who appreciates the art of gaming.",1695526435,1695526435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was really impressed with the game’s challenge and how difficult it was to complete some of the levels. The game allows you to choose from a wide variety of boss fights and platforming sections, giving the player the opportunity to change strategies and learn from mistakes. The game’s art style and music are fantastic, and I consistently found myself drawn in by the atmosphere of the game. The bosses are incredibly well designed and require the player to think outside the box and use strategy to defeat them. The game also features a two-player cooperative mode, which allows you to complete levels together with a friend.

The only nit-pick i can find is probably to do with the shop, there are just blatantly average charms and most of the time you will go with smoke bomb, and sometimes the heart one. Weapon variation is very great though and atleast if you are completing the game on Expert, you certainly need to switch weapons quite often as the levels play very differently.

This review is based on completing the game entirely on normal and then expert difficulty before the DLC, which i have yet to play, but am very excited to! I will update this review once i have played through that also.

EDIT:

I have now completed the entirety of the DLC and i must say it just adds to the adoration i have for this game. The new powers fit in really well and the addition of Ms. Chalice adds some new mechanics and strategies. My only criticism (Which didn't bother me at all) Is that you get quite a strong sense that some of the levels were designed for Chalice, which is to say it is ""normal"" or harder depending on whether or not you use her for that level, which is something that wasn't able to be a problem when there were just 2 coloured cups who had the same abilities.

The bosses were also very cool and i can confirm that the DLC has just as much care put into it in literally everything, as the base game. Cuphead will always be one of my most favourite games and i give glowing recommendations to both the base game, and the DLC",1681749700,1695145851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have gotten this game on every single platform and beaten it, it is literally my favorite game of all time. Where do I even start with Cuphead? This game has a beautiful HAND DRAWN rubber hose (1920’s cartoon) style which it nails perfectly;  The characters are all incredibly expressive, each boisterous boss is loonier than the next, with absurdly clever movesets and mind bending animations. I frequently found myself laughing at the absurdity of the bosses, some even making me pause the game because I needed a moment to process them.   Visually, this game is a 10/10. I can say the same for the soundtrack- It's literally the best soundtrack I've ever heard composed for a video game. Each boss theme adds a new layer of personality to the bosses, giving the game a much more immersive feel overall. Coupled with the game's tight controls (change your control scheme first lol) and simple yet fun mechanics, Cuphead sets you up for an unforgettable experience that no other game can or will ever even come close to. I don't mean to oversell the game with that statement, I'm trying to say that with all the hard work the devs, animators, and musicians put into the base game and DLC the game provides such a uniquely satisfying experience that I really don't think any other game out there offers. There will never be another Cuphead. I have no complaints about this game. Though it can be extremely frustrating at times it becomes an incredible experience when you master it. You KNOW it’s gonna be hard. Have some patience and give yourself enough time to learn each level. Let it fuck you long enough, and you’ll gain enough skill to dominate that shit. In other words, have sex with the game. Incredible gameplay, graphics, and some fantastic jazz music all wrapped in an incredible rubber hose asthetic. Why not give it a try?

I decided to go for a 100% (or should I say 200%?), the thing is, on my second run on expert, I felt the bosses a lot easier, except that damn robot, but after 20 attempts I managed to kill him by staying on the left on its third phase (a little tip for ya). It was a more relaxed run because I had already gone through all of them, and I knew exactly how they attack and was able to see the changes in their expert counterparts. 

But your first run is going to be hard, I'm not going to sugar coat it, so believe me when I say that it requires commitment, concentration and will. (Remember to never rage, and if you feel you are losing very often, just leave the game for a few hours and get back to it cool headed).

Управление 8/10
Задумка 10/10
Сложность 10/10

Подробнее про игру:
Мне нравиться задумка так называемого ""Старого Диснея"", очень сильно понравились анимации, каждая из них разная, так же хотел сказать пару слов про музыку: она великолепна... у каждого босса, карты, магазинчика есть своя музыка, она прекрасна, из за музыки добавляется сильная атмосфера, это наверное самое главное что есть в игре.

It's 'regular' in the same way hair loss is 'regular' for chemo patients.

This game is harder than quitting cigarettes.
And not always fair. 

Sometimes the controls don't work right. 
And just because you've memorized a boss' patterns doesn't mean you will beat them any time soon.

Cuphead has as much balance as a toddler on a tightrope. 
and the difficulty does not scale well. Sometimes a level can be finished in one try, followed by another that takes at least an hour
 
They should fire the person who made the dragon level.
And blacklist them from game development.
and blacklist their descendants from game development, too. 

Is the game pretty? 
Definitely.
But would you sleep with someone who has herpes just because they're a 10?
If you said 'maybe', I think we're in the same boat.

I love and hate this game at the same time.
The same way I feel about some of my family members. 

The gameplay is simple, but sometimes janky.
I completely gave up on the 'parry' system.
The game may as well have told me to block bullets with a flyswatter.

Some of the upgrades are total garbage. The kind you incenerate because it isn't good enough for a trashcan. 
And maybe it has the plague in it.

I'm not convinced that anything does more than .001 damage, even the kamehameha ripoff posing as a 'super' move.
It's about as super as peter parker before the spider bite. 

I pray that an asteroid hits the earth so I don't have to suffer through any more of this mess.
I can't quit. This game is addictive. 

Every time I finish a level, I feel a slight sense of satisfaction, followed by abysmal dread. Because I know I have to fight some other monstrosity from a prohibition-era cartoon.

Get ready to be stomped on by everything from sunflowers to candy corns to the devil himself.

I recommend you take beta blockers before each session to keep your heart rate under control.
If you're a recovering/recovered addict, this game may induce sudden urges to relapse.

You have been warned, and good luck.

I'm gonna beat it. 
I'm gonna win. 
Because this is America.
And I smash cups when I get angry.

However, if you're not interested in tricky gameplay, don't let the captivating art style fool you. After dying countless times, I can safely say that I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Cuphead.

The game also works perfectly on a steam deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSn7XxYqcCs

It will not escape anyone's attention that Cuphead as a game throws itself over a somewhat unusual tack.
The bleed-through of colors on the screen, the crackle of an imaginary vinyl record, the standard controller controls that are compatible in every era.
Skillful thought has gone into giving everything as nostalgic a twist as possible.
Over the course of the game, you will unlock different types of weapons, such as a weak but auto-seeking shot or a short but strong shot.
In addition, you also unlock certain items that give you small advantages, such as an extra heart or a faster charging super meter.
Cuphead has a parry move that lets you hit anything pink without getting hit yourself, plus your supermove meter grows faster.
You can also unlock various super moves, such as a fighting spirit of your own.

In addition to a solo adventure, Cuphead can also be played with a friend. One then plays as Cuphead and the other as Mugman.
This gameplay is fun but it does come with some problems. If the two are not roughly on the same level it can be a lot of frustration for the weaker player, but you also have this with super mario co op game sessions of course.
It always has to be saved or you have to wait for it, but it's about teamwork, isn't it?

Cuphead is a pleasure for the eyes and ears and the game is full of challenge. It is for a very specific target group, namely go-getters. The smallest mistakes can be punished harshly and this can be very discouraging. However, for players who don't give up after a few failures, the gameplay is excellent.",1693235436,1693235436,True,29,0,0.724295139312744141,0,True,False,False

Let's talk about that jaw-dropping hand-drawn artstyle that's a pure masterpiece in itself. Cuphead transports you into a whimsical world straight out of a 1930s cartoon, with characters and environments that burst with life and charm. Every frame is meticulously crafted, oozing with personality and paying homage to the golden era of animation. It's like playing through a living, breathing work of art – a true testament to the love and dedication poured into every single pixel.

But hold onto your seats, because the gameplay will knock your socks off! The level of creativity and variety in Cuphead's boss battles and run-and-gun stages is nothing short of mind-boggling. From dancing flowers to ginormous zeppelins, each encounter feels like a unique and exhilarating challenge. The adrenaline rush as you dodge, jump, and shoot your way through waves of colorful chaos is pure gaming ecstasy. And don't even get me started on the upgrades and power-ups – they're like the sprinkles on top of an already delicious cupcake!

And speaking of love, it's abundantly clear that the developers poured their hearts and souls into making Cuphead a labor of love. The attention to detail in every aspect of the game, from the subtle animations to the witty dialogue, is astounding. You can practically feel the passion and dedication radiating off the screen. It's as if they took all the fond memories of their own gaming experiences and combined them into a single, perfect package for us to enjoy.

But the love doesn't stop there – the soundtrack is an auditory delight that will have you humming along even after you've put down the controller. The jazzy, toe-tapping tunes perfectly complement the zany visuals, creating an immersive experience that's a feast for both the eyes and ears.

In conclusion, Cuphead isn't just a game – it's a work of art, a love letter to gaming history, and a testament to the power of passion and creativity. The hand-drawn artstyle, the heart-pounding gameplay, and the sheer dedication poured into every facet of the game make it an absolute gem that deserves a place in every gamer's collection. So don't just play Cuphead – savor it, cherish it, and get ready for a gaming journey like no other!",1584699356,1693228443,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Em si, o King Dice (Rei Dado) é mais difícil do que o The Devil (O Demônio), o que é decepcionante quando se trata de um Final Boss. 
Entrementes, o jogo é muito bom.

Sobre a DLC, não tenho nada depreciativo a dizer. Por se tratar de uma DLC, normalmente, são alguns bosses (relativo ao número do da DLC de Cuphead), e não várias ilhas com vários bosses. Sendo assim, achei excepcional a DLC.
Aguardo a próxima!

It all starts pretty harmless. You'll just start the game and will get your a$$ handed to you the first couple tries. Then you'll learn the ropes and get better. You'll feel kinda comfy around and think ""it is not THAT bad"".

Congratulations! You fell for the trap. NOW the real pain and your eternal suffering will begin. You will forever be in pain trying to get those A, S and P ranks.

It's a unique blend of old-school run-and-gun action, a 1930s cartoon aesthetic, and an adrenaline-pumping sense of difficulty.

One of the first things that strike you about Cuphead is its visuals. The game is an absolute work of art, paying homage to the classic cartoons of the 1930s like Betty Boop and Mickey Mouse. Every frame is hand-drawn and meticulously animated, creating an immersive and nostalgic atmosphere. The dedication to this style is remarkable and sets Cuphead apart as a visual masterpiece in the gaming world.

However, Cuphead isn't just about looks; it's also about challenging gameplay. From the moment you start, you'll be thrust into a series of increasingly difficult boss battles and platforming levels. The game doesn't hold your hand, and you'll likely die countless times as you learn boss patterns and level layouts. This level of difficulty can be polarizing; some players revel in the challenge, while others might find it frustrating.

The controls in Cuphead are tight and responsive, which is crucial given the precision required to conquer its many challenges. The game encourages experimentation, as you can choose different weapons and abilities to suit your playstyle. This adds depth to the gameplay and ensures that no two players will have the same experience.

The soundtrack in Cuphead is another standout feature. The jazzy tunes perfectly complement the 1930s theme and add an extra layer of immersion to the experience. It's clear that every aspect of this game was crafted with love and attention to detail.

While Cuphead's difficulty can be a bit overwhelming, it's important to note that it's not insurmountable. Each defeat feels like a learning experience, and the sense of accomplishment when you finally conquer a challenging boss is incredibly rewarding. The game's pacing, with its variety of boss battles and platforming levels, keeps things fresh and engaging throughout.

In conclusion, Cuphead is a gaming gem that's as beautiful as it is challenging. If you appreciate hand-drawn art, classic animation, and a stiff but fair challenge, it's a must-play. However, if you're easily frustrated by tough games, it might not be your cup of tea. Regardless, Cuphead is an artistic triumph that will be remembered as a unique and innovative entry in the world of video games.",1658795300,1692579126,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cuphead has redefined my breakfast routine, turning my cup into a survival tool and saucers into deadly frisbees. Just yesterday, I tried to parry a flying insect thinking it was a pink coin. The game's so charmingly ruthless that I now negotiate with my boss using only platforming moves. ""Listen, boss, I'll jump over this pile of paperwork and parry your unreasonable demands – deal?""

Who needs caffeine-induced jitters when you can have the Cuphead-induced shakes? It's like an adrenaline-pumping dance recital with bosses who've overdosed on espresso, and you're their partner with two left feet. My reflexes are sharper than ever, but my mug collection has never been so shattered. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack – it's like Louis Armstrong and a kazoo had a lovechild, and that child learned to play jazz on a xylophone made of cartoon anvils.

If you're up for a challenge that makes skydiving into a pit of crocodiles sound reasonable, then grab your favorite beverage (probably in a plastic cup for safety) and jump into Cuphead. It's the only game that makes a teacup's quest for justice so ridiculously, frustratingly, and fantastically entertaining.

Now, don't let this old grandma's lack of gaming skills fool you – Cuphead's got a grip on my heart like no other. It's like trying to knit a sweater blindfolded, but with each stitch, I'm weaving a tale of determination and dreams.

From the moment those jazzy tunes start playing, I'm whisked into a world that's part cartoon, part carnival, and all sorts of devilishly difficult. Those bosses! Whew, they've given me more gray hairs than my grandkids ever did. But there's something about the challenge that keeps me coming back, like trying to catch fireflies on a summer night.

My fingers fumble on the controller, and I'm not quite sure what all those fancy moves are supposed to do, but there's hope in every misstep. I'm like a grandma determined to bake a perfect pie, even if it takes me till the cows come home. Every time I manage to land a hit on one of them ornery bosses, I feel like I've won the county fair pie-baking contest!

Now, I may not have mastered this Cuphead business just yet, but mark my words, one day this old gal is gonna dance through those levels like nobody's business. I'll dodge those projectiles with the grace of a waltzing couple, and I'll give those bosses a run for their money. And when that day comes, you can bet your bottom dollar, I'll be the proudest grandma in the gaming world.

So, my dearies, if you're looking for a game that'll test your patience and tickle your determination, give Cuphead a whirl. It's a bit like knitting a scarf with three hands, but oh, the stories you'll tell when you finally unravel the mystery of that devilish challenge!",1692374964,1692374964,True,1,0,0.513974547386169434,0,True,False,False

When I was first introduced to this game, it was through a really close person in my life, and when I said I was so frustrated with how hard the game was, I wanted to break a screen...

But the more I played, the more I fell in LOVE with the game. The fact that you can tell how much love was invested into this game, made the playing experience that much better.
It is a challenging game, but it is SO MUCH FUN! Single player OR multiplayer! 
It quickly became a comfort game for me and honestly it just warms my heart every time I rage now with the game.

A fantastic game that adapts old cartoon style art design, excellent music, and episode and boss designs.

The game is quite challenging, and that's what makes it good. Every boss you defeat gives you a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. I can't say the story is great, but it serves the purpose of this style of game. It was truly a unique experience, even though it can get on your nerves at times, you feel good when you discover the weaknesses of the enemies and defeat them using this knowledge.

In the game, the bosses' health increases when you play with two people, but despite this, we played this game with two people and had a lot of fun... A five-star game.

And by the way, the story of the developers quitting their jobs, going into debt to make this game is a great example reminding us to pursue our passion and that we only have one opportunity to live life and to do what we really want to do.",1692091589,1692091589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I intend to beat this game in less then 30 days so I can return this dumbass PS5 controller.

I am dying alot, finding myself truly contemplating at times if I am okay or if I am way too damn old to be doing this when I got so many other plans and shit I wanna do. 

But I owe 16-17 year old me this experience I am getting now. I need to finish main Cuphead and the DLC so I can finally be at peace.

This shit isn't hard, it's meticulous. Take breaks and come back, bump some music to get into the zone if you really don't want to immerse yourself into the game with the beautiful soundtrack and sound design. 

Edit: Beat the main and DLC game. Haven't done much of the expert or other extra stuff. Returned the controller, as I can always get a new one whenever I want to play this game again.

Beautiful masterfully made game. I loved every single second of it. 

Idk man. I love games like this. I can barely play any AAA games because all my die hard favorites of the past few years  (enter the gungeon, nuclear throne, fall guys) have been casual indies.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I'm so glad that I finally buckled down and bought this game (along with the DLC - which really is essential especially since it's so cheap). 

Cuphead is probably everything you've heard - a gorgeous action-platformer that is uncompromising when it comes to difficulty, but it absolutely got its hooks in me and wouldn't let go. Beating the game for the first time is satisfying, but where I didn't expect to go was getting an S-rank on all the bosses. This is totally optional, and you have to beat the bosses on expert mode to get these S-ranks, but there have been few gaming experiences that I've had that have been as satisfying. This became the only game I really wanted to play as I moved every closer to getting a perfect rank against the bosses and levels. It can be extremely frustrating at times (like all difficult games) but the game is just so flat out fun and satisfying to play that I couldn't put it down.

I would highly recommend this game even if it wasn't one of the best-looking games ever made due to it's immaculate controls that only get more and more familiar and feel better the more you play and it's incredible design. However, along with all of that, it does happen to be one of the best looking (and sounding) games ever made due to the incredible 1930's aesthetic.

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Review:

Cuphead is an extraordinary and visually stunning run-and-gun game that pays homage to classic 1930s cartoons while delivering an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience. Developed by Studio MDHR, this indie gem has enchanted players with its unique art style, addictive gameplay, and memorable characters.

From the moment I entered the whimsical world of Cuphead, I was mesmerized by its hand-drawn animation, vibrant colors, and jazzy soundtrack that transport players back to the golden age of animation. The painstaking attention to detail in every frame showcases the immense love and dedication poured into this labor of love.

The core gameplay of Cuphead revolves around intense boss battles and run-and-gun levels, each offering a distinctive and imaginative design. With a variety of unique bosses, each with their own set of challenging patterns and attacks, every encounter is a thrilling test of skill and reflexes. Learning the attack patterns and mastering the timing is immensely satisfying, turning each boss defeat into a triumph of perseverance.

Cuphead's challenging difficulty level is one of its standout features. While it can be punishing at times, the game never feels unfair. The sense of accomplishment that comes from overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds is unparalleled, making it an incredibly gratifying experience for players seeking a genuine challenge.

The game's co-op mode allows players to team up with a friend, adding an extra layer of fun and camaraderie. Playing with a friend can make the game feel less daunting while still presenting a formidable challenge that requires teamwork and coordination.

Moreover, Cuphead's unique world map and branching paths add a sense of exploration and non-linearity to the gameplay. This feature encourages players to revisit levels, discover secrets, and unlock hidden content, extending the game's replay value.

While Cuphead is an exceptional gaming experience, it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its high difficulty level. Players looking for a more relaxed and casual experience might find the intense challenge to be overwhelming.

In conclusion, Cuphead is an absolute masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of what an indie game can achieve. Its hand-drawn animation, delightful characters, and challenging gameplay make it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. If you're ready for a visually striking and adrenaline-pumping adventure, Cuphead is waiting to test your skills and deliver an unforgettable journey into the world of classic cartoons and unforgiving fun!",1690866726,1690866726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

“Sure gramps!”
*Immediately sell their soul to the devil*[/b]
[i]-The entire plot[/i]
[hr][/hr]

[b]Cuphead[/b], from a bygone era a very simple action game that spots incredible rubber-hose style animation inspired by the very fist cartoons to great effect, a smooth animation galore where also design was adapted to make it all work.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As I said, from a gameplay perspective the game is simple, that isn’t to say it’s easy.
A run and gun game more focused on boss battles, it leaves some room for costumization with projectile patterns and special abilities but stays simple enough to not overwhelm the player with useless menus and builds for a game that has to be felt rather than calculated.

[h1]X-Factor[/h1]
Amazing animations from the olden days of Disney applied to great designed characters and enemies, it also doubles to clearly foreshadow the various kinds of attacks that will require you to either be quick on your fees or know where to stand to avoid them, sometimes both on some stages however, you might get hit through sheer bad luck because either something appeared to the side of the screen or projectiles lining up in a way to cut any chance to continue unscathed.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story is simplistic, the titular cuphead blinded by greed makes a pact with the devil, and now has to collect souls in his place if he wants himself out of the contract.  

[h1]Downsides[/h1]
Some bosses get frustrating, and especially walking stages where bullets can spawn from the sides of the screen without warning for a cheap shot
[hr][/hr]

SUMMARY

Never before have I had such a good time playing a game that I wanted to throw against a brick wall. Cuphead is a delight, with fantastic visuals, fun sounds, and a grueling gameplay loop that manages to just barely avoid being too frustrating to play. The reward for pushing through this game's persistent difficulty? Immense satisfaction, delivered through deft maneuvers and well-timed jumps that the game teaches via trial by hellfire. Let's do a pro/con/neutrality list, shall we?

PROS:

Cuphead aimed to capture the rubberhose feel of early cartoons, and in this attempt, Studio MDHR knocked it out of the park. From little quirks inherent to older-style humor to the old-timey sound, this game is a work of art even beyond the beautiful hand-drawn animation this game plays in. It's a stylistic choice that really paid off.

The controls are precise, which has been as much a boon to me as it has a bane. This game punishes misinputs really hard, but, at least in my case, I was only really upset at my own skill issue.

The bosses are tough as nails, but fair. It often feels like perhaps they might not be, since some of their attacks are not easily anticipated at first, but the game is trying to teach you to keep going no matter how hard it gets. Every attack from a boss that would be a problem is well-telegraphed or slow-moving.

The multiplayer aspect feels well-balanced. I don't have much else to say about it.

The level design of the run 'n gun levels tends to be visually interesting, despite their scenes remaining relatively the same throughout.

Gosh, the character design. I loved just about every one of them, with enough exceptions that I didn't really mind what didn't sit well with me.

CONS:

More of a nitpick, but the run 'n gun levels don't really have that well-telegraphed feel, in my opinion. Granted, they are outnumbered by quite a bit by the bosses, and you can always do another run, but I have generally felt more frustrated by sudden projectiles or gaps from these platforming sections than anything the bosses through. They are still solid levels, so I feel this barely counts as a con, but let's list it anyway.

OVERALL:

Cuphead is a fantastic experience that fans of cartoons, hardcore gamers, and more cooperative sorts should definitely try. It's hard in all the right ways, thematic, and simply a delight to behold. Bravo, MDHR, bravo!

The art is amazing, especially considered that its supposed to be based off of 1930s art which I thought I wouldn't like as much as other modern games' art, but its definitely one of my favorite styles. As soon as I played the first level I knew I would love this game. The bosses are super fun, and the art, sounds and gameplay are all EXTREMELY satisfying. The movement is kind of like hollow knight (the dash, and the snappy, responsive movement.) which is a movement system that I think should be in every 2D platformer. It's pretty challenging, but I'm not sure if I accidentally enabled a ""hard mode"" option or something, since when I completed the first run & gun level for the second time, it changed my health to three instead of six.

The visuals are undeniably beautiful, and the music is also stellar. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I can say about it.

For those of you who haven't yet heard, this game is hard. Unreasonably so. And no, I don't consider that a good thing.

Some will respond by simply saying ""get good."" Well, I did. I played the game, faced it's challenges, and even beat the final boss. And I hated every moment of it, so you're going to need a better counter to my argument.

As I went through the game, driven by bitter resentment, determined to prove I can beat a game and STILL hate it for being difficult, I couldn't help but nitpick every minor detail, looking for more reasons to hate it.

In hindsight, I may have been a bit harsh. But I will still stand by my opinion. This game is grossly overrated at best.

If you are like me, if you don't find joy in excessive difficulty, if you actively hate the phrase ""get good"" and all who have utterd it. Then STAY AWAY from Cuphead!

If all you want is to experience the old school cartoon style, I genuinely recommend that you go to YouTube and watch someone else play it. Otherwise you might get so sick of the art style that you contemplate building a time machine to go back in time and strangle Walt Disney like I have.

After beating the game I swore to never touch it again, I have no reason to. I won't play the dlc, nor will I play any sequels that might come out.

From the moment I laid eyes on its hand-drawn visuals, I was really intrigued by its unique and stunning art style.Especially since it's the first of it's kind I've personally ever seen. It's like stepping into a living, breathing cartoon world, where every frame feels carefully crafted with love and care. And despite my relatively low playtime of 15 hours I enjoyed it all the way through. And I'm excited to try out the DLC and possibly update my review to include it too.

But don't be fooled by its charming appearance; Cuphead offers a tough ass challenge that demands precise timing, lightning-fast reflexes, and strategic thinking. Each boss battle is a light show, testing your skills and pushing you to your limits. And while the difficulty may seem intimidating at first, the immense satisfaction that comes from overcoming each hurdle is unlike any other.

One aspect that truly stands out is the game's unique and beautiful soundtrack. The jazzy tunes perfectly complement the frantic action, further immersing you in the 1930's era. Every track is catchy, lively, and expertly composed, enhancing the overall experience and adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the gameplay.

The attention to detail in Cuphead is astounding. From the wacky character designs to the imaginative boss encounters, it's evident that studio poured their hearts into creating this artwork of a game. The game is a true labor of love, and it shines through in every aspect, making it an unforgettable journey from start to finish.

I also really enjoy the idea of being able to work together locally to beat bosses as not only does it allow for room for replayability but it also gives you a new way of fighting bosses and new strategies depending on who you play it with and how you go about it. Fighting the same boss is a different experience on your own than with a friend. Definitely a top tier game for me and I can't wait to try out the DLC. I'm sure i'll like it just as much.",1689226029,1689226029,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As someone who initially struggled to conquer its formidable difficulty but eventually triumphed over every boss and collected every achievement on Steam, I can confidently say that Cuphead is a masterclass in perseverance and rewarding gameplay.

The first thing that strikes you about Cuphead is its breathtaking art style. The game beautifully captures the hand-drawn, 1930s cartoon aesthetic, with its vibrant colors, fluid animations, and imaginative character designs. Every frame is a visual feast, bringing to life a world filled with zany characters, imaginative landscapes, and a delightful sense of nostalgia. The meticulous attention to detail is evident in every aspect, from the smoothness of the animations to the lovingly crafted backgrounds. Cuphead's visuals are truly a work of art and create an immersive experience that feels like stepping into a classic animated film.

However, beneath its charming exterior lies an immense challenge. Cuphead is notorious for its difficulty, demanding precision, quick reflexes, and strategic thinking from players. The game is a series of exhilarating boss battles and intense platforming sections, each requiring careful observation and mastery of its mechanics. From the outset, Cuphead can be incredibly punishing, with each defeat feeling like a setback. Yet, it is precisely this difficulty that makes each victory all the more satisfying.

Cuphead's controls are tight and responsive, allowing for precise movement and the execution of intricate maneuvers. As you progress and become more adept, you start to uncover the game's depth, discovering new strategies and techniques to overcome each encounter. The learning curve is steep, but the sense of progression and growth as you become more skilled is incredibly rewarding. Overcoming the seemingly insurmountable challenges becomes a testament to your dedication, patience, and perseverance.

The boss battles in Cuphead are the highlight of the game. Each boss is unique, with their own distinct patterns and attacks to learn and counter. The variety of bosses ensures that every encounter feels fresh and exciting, keeping you on your toes throughout the entire adventure. Each victory feels hard-earned, and the rush of adrenaline as you finally overcome a particularly challenging boss is unparalleled.

Beyond its difficulty, Cuphead also offers a fantastic soundtrack that perfectly complements the on-screen action. The jazz-infused tunes are catchy, energetic, and add an extra layer of immersion to the game. The sound design, too, is top-notch, with each hit, jump, and explosion fitting seamlessly into the overall audiovisual experience.

While Cuphead's difficulty can be seen as its greatest strength, it can also be a double-edged sword. Some players may find the relentless challenge frustrating and may feel discouraged at times. However, the satisfaction of conquering each obstacle far outweighs the initial frustration. It's a game that rewards determination and persistence, and it's a testament to the developers' commitment to delivering a truly memorable gaming experience.

In conclusion, Cuphead is a remarkable game that marries stunning visuals, challenging gameplay, and an unforgettable atmosphere. As someone who initially struggled but eventually conquered its demanding nature, I can attest to the immense satisfaction of mastering each encounter and achieving every achievement on Steam. Cuphead stands as a testament to the joy of overcoming adversity and showcases the beauty of persistence in the face of daunting challenges. If you are up for a thrilling and visually mesmerizing adventure that will put your skills to the test, Cuphead is an absolute must-play title that will leave you with a profound sense of accomplishment.

With this difficulty in mind, I don't really think there is any boss in this game that I truly hate.

I was both delighted and frustrated, laughing and swearing all at once. But in the end, I found immense joy in the challenge it presented. Visually, it's an absolute stunner, with its 1930s animation style and hand-drawn characters. The music perfectly complements the action, immersing me in the game's surreal world. However, let's not forget that Cuphead is insanely difficult. It's unforgiving, with no checkpoints and no way to regain health. The boss battles are intense and require precision and pattern memorization. The game's structure is linear, divided into worlds and levels, with each boss encounter bringing its own unique twist. The randomization of certain elements can sometimes feel unfair, but it adds a layer of unpredictability. Despite the challenges, every victory felt incredibly rewarding, making me feel like a better player. Cuphead is not just a visually stunning game; it's a test of skill and determination.

I love how they made REAL 3D sculptures for backgrounds for some of the amazing bosses.
Its the fact that everything was hand drawn. Not to mention the Cuphead show which was well-animated, very funny, entertaining etc. 

Even the DLC was amazing, again, the story was fascinating and the bosses were outstanding. This has been my childhood game since release and I thank it all to my sister for introducing this game to me. I am so grateful about this game and I thank everyone who has worked on the team. Even the music is amazing and really help me feel better about it because I DO think you will rage if started / not very good at the game. Such an amazing game and DLC both for good AND reasonable price.

""Cuphead"" is an absolute gem of a game that captures the essence of classic animation and delivers a thrilling and challenging experience. The gameplay is fast-paced and addictive, requiring precise timing and skill to overcome each boss encounter. It's also recommended to play with controller so the movement and platforming are more optimised.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

-The artstyle, diffuculty type, level design was great and expert mode did really good, incresing minions amount, faster attacks and a little more boss health?(not sure)

-DLC expert mode is mostly bosses being fast, it does its job and there are little differences but its mostly feels like its just faster.(Soo i say its a 6/10)

-Weapons are pretty normal and fitting (other than the dragon boss fight) and just a few unbalanced,
Ex.attacks are also pretty good, super arts attacks not really good but ms.Chalice super arts are pretty good tho.

-MAIN'S & DLC'S achievements are pretty nice and challenching there are things you can achieve though its not a steam achivement like:
Golden Ms.Chalice, filters and more than needed S-Grades

-There is local (sadly not online use remote control)co-op bosses get more health theres nothing really more to tell.

-also, you will meet this dice guy every once a while and when you do, stay a little and listen to that song and o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0hhhhhhhh~ its such a banger.",1687693771,1687693771,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art and animation are real feast for the eyes and keep better and better. Everything about it - from character design to environment design - is truly impressive. I love all of them.  The story is pretty straightforward: based on the game's description, you play as a debt collector for soul contracts to repay your own gambling debts. Nothing exceptional here.

The gameplay? It's brutal and humbling. This was the first game that made me realize my dodging skills while attacking enemies is pretty sucks especially on normal mode. Honestly, I had to opt for the easier levels to finish this game. However, it's still entertaining and  keep things fresh throughout all the levels and boss fights. Speaking of bosses, their unique mechanics are particularly notable - I absolutely loved them.

The soundtrack is quite good too. While I'm not exactly a jazz fan, I found myself enjoying every second of music while playing this game.

In conclusion, I would recommend Cuphead to anyone who enjoys cooperative and casual gameplay, without much focus on the storyline. If you're looking for an immersive story, you might want to give this one a pass since it's not the selling point of this game. But in terms of art, gameplay, and music, it's definitely worth a shot!",1687086620,1687159285,True,12,2,0.56016087532043457,3,True,False,False

Without hesitation, I endorse this game for its remarkable combination of art direction, audio design, and a captivating soundtrack. The challenges it presents, especially with its bosses and intense 'run and gun' stages, are tough but predominantly equitable. These elements, along with others, have given me an unforgettable journey, a testament to the game's excellence.

Everyday when I come home from school, I turn on the television and head straight to Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, or any other family-friendly channel airing cartoons at the time of my viewing. Do keep in mind that this was in the early 2000s, which were, in my opinion, the ""golden age of cartoons,"" with classic after classic being produced constantly. Each and every channel is an accumulation of its own magnum opus, laying the foundation of what they represent as family-friendly channels with visions to inspire and, most importantly, entertain the youth with joy and laughter. Cartoons like Spongebob Squarepants, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and Hey Arnold, to name a few, helped me get through tough times at school and inspired me to be a happier person. I like to think of them as filters of joy. Every time I get home from school feeling stressed and overwhelmed, watching cartoons can instantly turn all that around. It was truly one of the most memorable times of my life, and I am eternally grateful to the studios that took the time to contribute to many people's childhoods, including mine.

Flash forward to 2017, a game called Cuphead was released. The first time I saw the gameplays on streaming platforms, it instantly transported me back to the early 2000s.I suddenly remember the good times that I had while watching cartoons. I felt like Ego when he first tasted Ratatouille. Although the game was not inspired by the cartoons of my time, I still feel like this game was a sincere love letter to all the people who grew up with cartoons. Each era had its own unique cartoons to look forward to, but they all shared the same vision: to spread the word of joy and laughter for children all across the world. I was not in a favorable position in life before this game came out, but when it did, I was again reminded to become the joyful person I once was. The game reminded me what to cling onto when things get awry. Although I am still struggling, at least I now know that you can always cling onto something, even the smallest of things. So thank you, Studio MDHR; you guys are legends!

That being said, don't play this fucking game. This game is as evil as the words coming out of the mouths of your asian mom's siblings at a family reunion. I fucking warned y'all.",1670091404,1685134779,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
