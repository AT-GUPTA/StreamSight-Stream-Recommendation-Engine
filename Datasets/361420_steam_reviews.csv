Platforms are strewn all over the place at odd angles because we can't have flat ground or foundations to build on. It's just so frustrating.

The storage system is unique and honestly pretty cool, except for the fact that it is wholly inadequate. Eight slots on a ""medium"" storage unit is less than what we can fit in our backpacks, so the base ends up being more than half storage.

The game is very cute. I love the lil character models and the poly style graphics. I played this several years ago and wondered today why I had stopped playing. Now I remember why.

This game gives me some very heavy motion sickness. The player camera goes all over the place and it's very hard to control. I'm now taking anti-nausea medicine after playing for only half an hour.

Exploring gets boring pretty quickly. Planets are all ascetically different and have different resources, but much of the same. Hazards are trivial being that all of them can be defeated by taking a few steps back and digging them up. Storms were a key motivator for choosing a good base location as well as giving a challenge in exploring, and I will never understand why they were removed with no option to reenable. 

Speaking of base building, coming from other games it feels very limited and clunky. No platforms or structures to build on or grid to snap to, and is overall very 2D for a 3D game. It makes the manufacturing chains tedious.

Speaking of automation, IMO it is very basic. Each step is 1-2 inputs, 1 output, and rates aren't important or even mentioned. It's very accessible but difficulty could scale at least a little. Seasoned factory enthusiasts will be disappointed. Even the automation you set up, since you build at such a relatively small scale, is only good for building more automation or just duplicating your base on another planet. You never have a use for massive quantities of items for anything other than goofing around with friends, blowing stuff up, or messing with rovers, but to be honest there are more fun games to do that in.

As far as exploration goes, finding research becomes a chore once you know where to look, and after grinding through it, there isn't that much of an incentive to do it anymore. The small points of interest like capsules and debris never really give anything worth your time. Although did like the addition of the snails and the later lore missions. IMO they are one of the more fun sets of missions and did get me having fun and exploring again. They also made seed automation useful. But activating all of the gateways for the ending is grindy and not really worth your time. The teleporters they give just aren't that convenient.

Microtransactions were slapped on to make some extra dough, which I'm never a fan of, but at least cosmetics are the only things paywalled. The FOMO from limited time events is annoying, and they are much better suited to be a toggleable gamemode. Modding is against the EULA (my only guess is out of fear of bypassing MTX) which is a shame because this game needs it desperately.

TLDR It's unique and still a decent time waster, but just play Space Engineers. It's a learning curve but has leagues more play time, infinitely larger modding community, PvP, complex automation, and is $10 cheaper. It's a no-brainer.",1691709472,1708830248,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beautiful, great game. One of the best co-op's I have played. Very good game to just chill with your friends, explore some planets and watch gorgeous views. There may be some fps problems but it's not a big issue. There's easily content for at least 50h of playtime. I absolutely recommend to test it out.

Achievements are quite easy, u need to do almost every activity in the game which may come just by playing and do some easy minor things. To know exactly what to do just read steam achievements' descriptions. U can probably also use some guide ( I personally didn't use any ).",1625783871,1708792808,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Controls are functional, but:
When dragging objects or the camera, there is significant smoothing that makes things lag far behind the mouse and frequently not reach the intended location before you try using them.
All UIs and interfaces are physical objects than can and will clip through and over each other and the player character.
Some things are bound to the same keys and cannot be altered, e.g. scrolling through items to craft in the backpack is either physical buttons or the arrow keys, and the arrow keys are also secondary walking controls, meaning you have to WASD in the other direction at the same time to avoid falling off ledges.
When mining (with the mouse), you are still able to click on and open the backpack (and everything attached to it) in a third person game where the camera will often be directly behind it.

Technical issues can be serious:
On some PCs the uncapped framerate in the main menu will crash the game (and sometimes your PC) which can be fixed from the outside using a settings .ini file.
There is a bug known (to the community AND devs) that means an objective vital to an entire mission progression branch does not spawn in your save, meaning it simply cannot be 100% completed - not to mention it's the mission(s) that leads to the best mobility unlock in the game. It can only be fixed by someone with the capability to edit saves, i.e. the only 'fix' for the average person is literally sending the save file to a dev. This has existed for years, even after a supposed fix was added. I have had it happen twice, the second time being exasperating enough for me to finally update my review.
Updates are primarily to add limited time events or new (paid) cosmetics.

This issue is apparent from the very beginning, although it starts out much smaller of an issue, it grows to be a massive hindrance to the enjoyment of the game. The missions are fairly pointless, and nothing more than a checkbox, even the rewards are boring. Oh another qt-rtg... neat, add it to the pile (no pun intended).

After our playthrough, we only felt it needed to make bases on 4 planets total, and the 3 aux bases are quite small and very utilitarian. Pretty much every unique thing we found, ended up being just research or something to throw in the shredder. The game sort of dabbles in automation with its grabbers and trains, but for what reason, there is none. Its pretty sad that such a good foundation of a game, can be stuffed with the same stuff, and end up feeling so empty, for example, if you travel down into caves, such as the mantle, you have 9999 capsules for event drops, why... its so littered with them that its hard to navigate through the caves. Oh and the ""mysteries of the solar system"", yeah its... [spoiler]teleporters. Everything we did, we was so underwhelmed we didn't even desire to finish activating the cores, so I looked it up and after activating all the cores, what do you get? A cutscene and credits.

To start, there isn't really any story to the game. There are things called ""curiosities"" and other items that hold pieces of lore, but they are something that you can ignore entirely. The main appeal to this game is its gameplay, now i think this is something we can relate to in real life. We aren't told what to do and we have to figure it out ourselves.

This game is really fun with friends and not so much alone. This is what we are doing in our government. They have control over us and we can't do anything about it. We will crumble and that's the sad truth.

The graphics are also very attractive, just like the government tries to make the military attractive. They want you to be their slaves, don't give in. This is corruption in our government.

My friend's save no longer loads with 8 gb RAM, so you need at least 12 gb. I'm THIS CLOSE to changing this review to negative. Every update breaks something and you hope that it's not your savegame.



This game initially released with quite a lot of multiplayer bugs and even some single player ones, but I still totally recommend it. Especially since those bugs are being rapidly fixed. Single player is already perfect. Multiplayer is getting there.
It's a really zen make-your-own-adventure-sandbox type of game with no fauna or weapons and exploration of most planets being repetitive, but entertaining nonetheless. Adventures include, but are not limited to:

- Building a really neat optimized base on terrain that is not level and managing it's power levels... that is until you get an RTG;
- Exploring a vast planet with only a compass in hands to find all structures and [Collect all the garbage!];
- Optionally digging your rover out of a newly discovered 30 meter deep trench in the middle of said exploration;
- Trying to guess which items to bring to a new planet to optimize base building time. Spoilers: don't worry about that too much, the game is forgiving;
- Exploring the technology... tree? More like list, actually. All items unlock independently;
- Drilling straight down for 3 minutes in a large expensive vehicle that you intend to return to the surface;
- Optionally building an underground base and returning said vehicle to surface in the span of 2-4 hours (depends on whether you have a trailer);
- Frantically looking for your own dead body or nearest tether line in some spooky unfamiliar caverns. Seriously, they shouldn't add a map, we would lose half the fun;
- Making a makeshift rocket league field;
- Oh, and actually attempting to finish the game. Supposedly it has an ending.

By the way, the whole experience is very reminiscent of LEGO™, you should totally try it out. Can't wait for the Wanderers Update for even more content.

Beyond that though, there isn't much to the game besides the progression system. Don't get me wrong, Astroneer's progression is by far the best of any game I've seen, but once you've got every resource, and practically unlimited power there's not much more you can do. I've replayed this game 5 times now, and it's fun but it does get boring after 300 hours. The game is just too easy, there's no force pushing you back so you're almost guaranteed to to beat it. Sadly, I believe this is due to updates. Before 1.0 there were sandstorms that could kill you if you got caught them and didn't find/make shelter, which have now been removed. You can get unlimited oxygen by just sacrificing 2 slots on your backpack. Tethers would still be useful to not get lost, but then they added a compass to always tell you where you are. There aren't any moving enemys in the game (like zombies, or aliens) which I do support, however the lack of almost any challenge besides fall damage (which can be countered by a jet pack) is too much of a weakness for the game. I'm not some hardcore gamer either, I play Minecraft bedrock for crying out loud! 

So couldn't it just be a creative game that's not about surviving? Maybe, but the game wasn't made for this, and you are almost forced to play along with the progression system, even after you've beaten it (it's weird) 
There is a creative mode, but it is only good until you've made the best rover, and crashed the game every way you can think of. Almost no one builds in creative mode like you would in Minecraft do to how infuriating the transforming system is.

Fun game, but if you expect to play multiplayer get ready for a bad time. Initially it will run fine, but over time when you actually get into it you will no longer be able to do anything because of frame rate issues and general lag.

Me:  40 plus years as a gamer as I am 57.  Starting with Atari 2400

Review:  

-  Time slips by.  I look up and an hour is gone
- Fun without being overly complicated
- Challenging but not frustrating
- Very repayable
-  Bought on sale, but not overly priced.

What are you waiting for?

I haven't played single player but playing multiplayer, as we progressed the game got more and more buggy to the point of being unplayable. The first glitch that happened was one of our large storages clipping through the ground while we were away from it. We never found it. Next, occasionally when drilling, if I release the mouse button it just keeps digging for several seconds, making it impossible to reliably dig in a tight spot. Next, I'd jump and then freeze in mid-air. After a few seconds I would slam back down to the ground and die from fall damage. Next I couldn't walk at all (even after relogging) and had to wait for my friend to get past the oxygen tethers i was near so i could disconnect them and force a death (because I didn't want to respawn at the home world). The rover frequently gets stuck and you have to get out and dig under it to get it going again - this makes sense in some situations but most of the time it's just sitting on flat ground. The gravity flips near the core are not fun and the camera is pretty awful even before the majority of the bugs start happening.",1707025842,1707032158,False,4,0,0.526418805122375488,0,True,False,False

When you harvest resources they freely flow into your inventory with a distinct auditory signal for each type of resource. Everything in this game has a tactile element to it there are no 1 dimensional menus no png resources on a 1D inventory everything feels as if you could touch and interact with the objects you interact with. The soundtrack is very simple and relaxing as well as the visuals of each individual planet.  The voxel artstyle is very intuitive making the game appear more friendly.

Astroneer is an amazing game with a unique set of modular base building that's intuitive, but allows for longer term complex automation. However, I don't feel this game adequately respects your time. Sylva, the first world, is amazing. It's exciting to explore, looking for new resources, salvaging from wrecks, disarming the dangerous fauna, and unpacking the mysterious gateway portals. Soon you run into the issue of new resources that cannot be found on Sylva, so, following the helpful quest guide, you set out among the stars, venturing to new planets... that have mostly the same resources, similar dangerous plants, and wrecks that sometimes have slightly different stuff than the wrecks on your first planet. 

At the core of each planet is possibly the most beautiful structure I've ever seen in a video game. The power generation and management, 3D printers, and soil centrifuge are all awesome mechanics. However, I think this game would be better if it was just one world. Needing to set up a separate base on most or all of the planets is a huge time consumer that has you doing the same thing over and over. Once you complete the first planet, you travel to all of the other planets and do the exact same thing. It doesn't add anything new to the game. 

The quests for starting out do a great job at guiding you through the beginning of the game. However, I don't feel the other main questlines: train depo, galastropods, and little prince, really add anything to the game. They often just deal with some clunky building through caves in glorified fetch quests across different planets. The trains are cool, but I don't really have any need to set up a dedicated travel system between points on a planet, I have a rover for that. The galastropods are cute, and have some unique functionality. Their quest is okay, it just pads runtime. At the very least, your little sister will probably love them, as mine does. 

My favorite part of this game is the custom start and world modifiers. Once you've played through the game, trying to play the start without a starting base is a totally unique experience. Going from having nothing to getting an oxygenator takes about 15-30 minutes and it is a desperate scramble to find the resources you need to progress while maintaining your ever-dwindling supply of oxygen packs. After you get the oxygenator, it's largely the same game other than not being able to get any quests because you need a starting base without an oxygenator (all fabricated bases will already have one). I wish that pre-req was removed because it's weird how it can stunt your non-traditional runs. 

Overall, I think this is a great game and I love it's base-building and finding new resources. However, I think you could play the game for 10ish hours, fly to other planets and grab their resources, and complete Sylva, and have seen all that this game has to offer. I don't think it is worth it for 30$, but reasonable for 15-20.",1706811767,1706811767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I only made it through because I was playing with a friend, who also only made it through because he was playing with me. The controls and camera are clunky and difficult to use, and also make up the biggest challenge of the game, which provides little other challenge in terms of survival, resource management, combat, problem solving, or really anything else that one might expect out of the game. Exploration makes up a considerable chunk of the game, but it mostly consists of climbing up and down cliffs in a barren landscape. After the first few hours, I had seen pretty much all there was to discover beyond new color palettes and differently shaped resource deposits. While there is a story that is moderately compelling, it doesn't unlock until you've played through most of the game - for me, about 50 hours in - and the gameplay associated with that story quest, like most other quests, consists of carrying items from point A to point B and following markers on the compass. The thing is, this game does have some interesting sandbox potential, providing an assortment of tech which you can fit together to do surprising things, but the game doesn't incentivize you to play with it almost at all, outside of a couple of achievements. And the galastropods are cute - I'm quite fond of them.

To start, there isn't really any story to the game. There are things called ""curiosities"" and other items that hold pieces of lore, but they are something that you can ignore entirely. The main appeal to this game is its gameplay, not the tiny bit of lore that can be found here and there.

As for the gameplay, it's pretty good. However, one major issue I need to talk about before I gush about the gameplay is that the start of your first playthrough is absolutely miserable for the first hour or two. The game has a horrible way of explaining what to do, how to control certain things, and more. The controls feel absolutely clunky, and you will struggle to do a lot of basic tasks. My friend and I genuinely disliked the game at first due to its inability to show the player how to properly do things, so you pretty much need to discover most of what the game has to offer via trial and error or just looking it up (which we did for a lot of things). There is also a mission system present in the game, but that didn't really help us much, either. There is just so much going on in the game that it acts as information overload.

Thankfully, once you get over that learning curve, the game starts to become really enjoyable. There are plenty of things to build, discover, and experiment with. The availability of resources makes it so you need to explore pretty much every planet and moon, allowing you to experience all the different planets that Astroneer has to offer. While some may think this leads to an exhausting grind, I feel like this allows for you to enjoy what a planet has to offer, and then once a planet/moon starts getting boring, you're able to go to the next planet/moon for a whole new environment. I also like how building automatic machines isn't a necessity. This isn't an automation game, but it certainly has the functions to turn it into one if you would like to. 

Also, while playing this game in single-player could certainly be enjoyable, I believe the best way to play this game is in multiplayer. Things like dividing tasks and exploring different areas make the game significantly less grindy and more enjoyable, as doing things with a good friend is always nice. 

The graphics are also very attractive, as the poly-style graphics are fully embraced and are an aspect of basically everything in the game. The sound design is also wonderful, as sounds like placing items onto storage platforms are very crisp. The background music doesn't really stand out much, but it adds a nice touch to the atmosphere, especially deep within cave layers. 

All in all, Astroneer is a rough gem that is clunky in some areas, but overall, it is a pleasure to play. While I wouldn't really want to play this by myself, I found the game to be quite enjoyable with my friend, and I recommend giving this game a try :)",1706740989,1706740989,True,17,0,0.704174220561981201,3,True,False,False

I disliked this game because in the very short time I played, the controller support felt abysmal. Sometimes I would be looking at one object, try to grab it, and somehow grab an object off-camera, behind me, on the other side of my base, requiring me to walk all the way around to put it back before repeating the process.

Visual bugs were not fun to watch. Objects clip through eachother like mad.

The exploration seemed enjoyable enough, but the progression of the game is an increasingly complex linear set of fetch quests.

This would be okay if the fun exploration and the grind were accompanied by a story...  but there is none.

At least with games like Factorio, the endless grind is addicting because its's a reward loop of fixing one problem which reveals more and more problems, until you say screw it and scrap your old factory in hopes of creating a much larger and more capable one.

There have been improvements, the ""exo chip disaster"" has been mediated. It isn't rubbish anymore. Since they implemented a way to trade for exo chips things got balanced towards fun again.

and when the update with custom starts hit, people finally got a way to challenge themselves without resorting to mods. So creative potential is again possible.

I would now give Astroneer a passing grade now that some of those mayor issues of mine have been adressed. Starting a new game with noting from Atrox is fun. I would not do it ""hardcore"", but it is still challenging to find everything and get your starting setup none the less.

The Sandbox feels like a sandbox again. Astronium trades and custom starts ftw ^^

Update:
We decided to 100% the game, since then it has had immense troubles allowing her to join my world. In the last 3 or so weeks, we have been able to connect maybe once, with trying almost every night.

This fluke thing happens quite often in many forms, you exit a vehicle to be put in a cave underground etc.  If they can't make a game that works they need to make a game that saves more than 1 corpse, just poor development.

I asked myself ""What do I actually want to do here?"" around the two hour mark. I refunded the game when I couldn't answer that question.


Controls (Keyboard + Mouse)
This is one of those third-person games where you have to control the camera at the same time as your character, which I personally dislike. I constantly found myself disoriented due to the camera's controls. The settings didn't offer me a better experience. It would make much more sense to me if the camera was locked behind your character or if this was a first-person game. I was hoping to find an accessibility option that would lock the camera but one doesn't exist.

The Tutorial
The tutorial was pretty passive. You're prompted to complete different quests and you're rewarded with some materials and more quests. The tutorial experience feels less educational and more like a series of fetch quests. After you're done with those, there's no guidance in terms of what to do next. I was imagining a Minecraft-esque game set in space where I go around, explore the world's secrets, and eventually travel to other planets (which is what late-game entails, judging from other reviews), but the beginning is so slow and misguided that not only did I have questions about what to do on the main planet, but I had absolutely no idea how I would eventually leave to see other planets. I felt no encouragement to continue. That brings me to...

Tethers
Tethers are the main way you explore the world around you. In order to breathe, you need to place tethers to connect you back to your home base, otherwise you'll gradually lose oxygen and pass out. This makes sense, and I initially liked having a breadcrumb trail back to my base, but the execution is so poor. You literally have to place a tether every five steps your character takes. Later in the game you can make a buggy which eliminates the need for tethers, but the reliance on tethers early-game killed my motivation to explore the world and discover what it has to offer. I didn't feel like I was playing to explore, I felt like I was playing to make more tethers so that I could explore. What started out as a pro turned into an insane setback.
Again, EVERY FIVE STEPS. 

Building and Comprehension
A big part of early-game is building different machines. The game uses technical language that is still accessible, but I can see ESL learners struggling with comprehension. I'm a native English speaker and sometimes had to reread directions in order to understand what I had to do / where something had to go. I did have to turn to a wiki within the first half hour of game play because of this.
The buildings themselves are occasionally a bit confusing as well. The printers are straightforward enough (put in materials, out comes a structure). I think there were some generators that I left alone because I didn't know how they worked. The main point to make here is with the resource collection machine. You find these large hunks of material throughout the world, and they can be broken down (supposedly) by this machine. The tutorial instructed me to build the machine, place it, and put some of this specific material inside of it. I did that, and the machine started moving... and nothing happened. For the whole two hours of game play. If I was doing something wrong, nothing about the machine itself nor the tutorial told me I was. Being confused is a huge deterrent for me in video games.

Loneliness
When playing in single-player, this world is very lonely! I expected some passive and / or hostile creatures somewhere. I don't know if I just didn't get far enough into the game to find them, but I never encountered any. The lack of life on these planets creates an insane loneliness. Sure, it's set in space and there wouldn't be / maybe couldn't be Earth life forms, but I see a huge missed opportunity to create alien life forms that the player can encounter. While I didn't try it out, I understand that multiplayer offers a better experience, but I don't want to spend $30 on a game so that I can tell my friend to spend $30 on a game so we can have fun together.

Farming
This is a smaller point, which is why I put it near the end of this review. You encounter plants occasionally when you're moving around the planet. You can harvest their seeds and then re-plant them at your home base. Many of these plants are dangerous (they explode, they hurt you if you touch them, etc). I realized pretty quickly that there's no real reason to re-plant them unless if you want to put dangerous things near your home. Maybe they're used later in the game for excavation? For defense in a multiplayer world? I wish I could answer these questions.

Conclusion
All of the reviews I saw where people had several hundreds of hours sunk into the game encouraged me to give it a try, and I suppose I encourage you to do the same. What annoys me might not annoy you, and I don't want you to pass on the game just because of my opinion, especially since I didn't get far beyond early-game. If the game offered more freedom and a more story-driven tutorial, potentially with NPCs to help you out and make the world feel more alive, it would have met my expectations. As of right now, I don't regret refunding the game.",1706017791,1706017791,False,1,2,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

creative is all about practising for survival, building goofy vehicles and most importantly,
SLIDES. SLIDES AND SLIDES AND SLIDES. But honestly, when you have no friends (relatable) You should just chill on creative.
- Cosmetics
I have never payed for a single Micro-transaction. you can get everything you need by just playing through the game and going on adventures to different planets. My poor butt could never afford Transactions anyway, so there.
- Survival
Playing survival is great with friends. this isn't a guide so I won't tell you what to do, but always remember to mess around and have fun. be stupid and try and trap your friends in a hole and suffocate them. cause' that's what friends are for.

Lądujemy na planecie Sylva, nie znając naszej misji. Z czasem jednak odkrywamy tajemnice układu słonecznego, w którym się znajdujemy. Gra posiada bardzo przejrzyste i jednolite mechaniki. Od razu wiadomo, co jak działa i do czego służy. W połączeniu ze spójną grafiką robi to dobre wrażenie. Do dyspozycji mamy mnóstwo pojazdów, narzędzi oraz struktur, które pomogą nam w podbijaniu planet. W grze czekają nas różnorodne zadania, dzięki którym zgłębimy historię świata, w którym się znajdujemy. Jeśli chodzi o aspekt wieloosobowy, gra sprawdza się doskonale, zapewniając mnóstwo zabawy. Jedyne, do czego można się przyczepić, to nagrody za wykonywanie misji, które zbyt łatwo ułatwiają grę, oraz brak endgameu po wykonaniu wszystkich zadań -no chyba że ktoś chce bardziej zająć się automatyką i zbudować imperium przemysłowe.

We land on the planet Sylva, not really knowing our mission. But over time, we uncover the secrets of the solar system we're in. The game has super clear and straightforward mechanics. You instantly know how everything works and what it's all for. Combined with the cohesive graphics, it gives off a good vibe. We've got a ton of vehicles, tools, and structures at our disposal to help conquer planets. The game throws various missions at us, letting us dive into the story of the world we're in. In terms of multiplayer, the game is a blast, providing loads of fun. The only complain would be the rewards for missions, which make the game a bit too easy, and the lack of an endgame after completing all missions—unless someone wants to get more into automation and build an industrial empire.

The challenges help you learn and are progressive.  Once you've sort-of mastered things, you realize the reason for automated systems.  It allows you to really get creative.  There isn't much you can't do in this game.  Building with others is a blast, and allows for things you didn't think of.  Just remember to respect each other, and allow areas for each other; or planets for that matter since everyone likes the differences of planets to work from.  My only request of the designers is to allow for weather, planetary events, NPC's, and an actual goal to accomplish.  Seems the game is kinda of lacking without the occasional random event that forces you to react.  Unfortunately, once you have reached a certain level, the game becomes repetitive.  I would suggest for the continuation of success of the game the developers come up with a story line, and an actual goal to complete.

It takes a different approach than the usual loop of killing stuff and leveling - like probably 95% of other games. It's more about exploration, creativity and discovery. It's very relaxing but somehow still manages to be always fun, exciting and build up tension. There is definitely the ...just 10 more minutes effect and trying to build some crazy automated system becomes your new life goal.

What I really don't like are the microtransactions. It's just for cosmetics and they are optional (that's why it doesn't affect my opinion of the game too much) but I passionately hate them and the prices are ridiculous and unfair. I just wish developers would stop doing this sh*t. On the positive side they are constantly improving the game and adding free content, so I guess something for something.
Another (minor) negative point are the controls, which can be a little bit annoying and confusing at times, but nothing too bad.

You can hear that something is happening but can't see it. You know that you miss out on something and that is the first thing that happens in this game. Why the manual doesn't pop up after this animation is beyond me.

Then the manual explains some stuff. But not how to do the first things you encounter. So I go to the task list, it says to unpack the backpack. Where is the backpack? No clue. I search everywhere, in the rocket, in the debris that is around the landing zone. I look again in the manual. Nothing. I search again the whole landing zone, look at every object lying around. I had to look up a video, it turns out that you need to accept the first task that you completed to get the backpack. HOW SHOULD I KNOW THAT? Then you need to collect Reisin. How does it look like? Where can you find it? How do you collect it? No clue. Why is there no tutorial that explains the first things you need to do in the game. I had to rage quit.

Will try to keep the below as spoiler-free as possible.

[b]Pros:[/b]
 - Very satisfying exploration / production gameplay loop.  The environments are all interesting, and the risk of death / danger is always there, but not in an intrusive way. The fundamental themes of my experience were awe and curiosity.
 - Well-constructed Solo campaign leads you through a good experience feeling out all of the games features and ideas in a way where it always feels like there are many things to do and learn and see.  It's also not overly long to the point where it feels grindy or infinite; there is always a goal and it's always within reach, right up until everything is done.
 - The types of automation you can accomplish (while very limited, see below) do feel very cool to do.
 - The research bytes mechanic is a neat way to incentivize and reward exploration.

[b]Cons:[/b]
 - The controls are clunky, unintuitive, and awkward; even after dozens of hours.  I find myself still mixing up Q, E, and F even now after 90+ hours played.  In hindsight, I think they are as good as they could be, so it's not a bad implementation -- it's just difficult to get used to.  There is a lot of functionality smashed into basically 3-4 buttons which you use for everything. This ends up being a nice thing at times too, so I don't disagree with the design choice; but I do see this could be a barrier to enjoyment for some players.
 - There are hints of automation throughout the game, but they never end up feeling like a ""closed form solution"" to me.  I went into it with an expectation that while I, the player character, will have to do a lot of the ""work"" necessary with my own two hands, eventually some of the more common tasks I would be able to automate away.  This ends up being only partially true, but almost always in the form of making the manual process [i]easier[/i], and not making manual processes [b]unnecessary[/b] (which is what I was hoping for).
 - Quite a few of the element behaviors are really unintuitive (repeaters, the crane, sensors, anything with a Reaction Pin); once you understand them they do all make good sense, but trying to discover them without any external guidance sometimes felt frustrating and unrewarding.
 - Some of the gameplay elements are just sandbox fun gimmicks more than functional tools; while I don't have an issue with this in general, I do wish I could clearly tell which things were meant just for fun, and which were meant to serve a purpose.  Sometimes you see something in the tech tree and you form all sorts of ideas about what it could be or what you might do with it, then you finally build one and it's basically a paperweight.",1704653856,1704653856,True,22,0,0.701191127300262451,0,True,False,False

But one problem still persists: the camera. It's moving too much, it's too close or too far, your char/vehicle is obstructing what you want to see, etc.
One simple thing would solve this: a toggleable first person view.

https://imgur.com/a/WBJnVtW this is an unchanged screenshot from the game. notice how some letters are completely illegible. this is only 1/3 of the screen. so if you look at this fullscreen, it's 3x as big
yes, this blurry, frizzy pixel mess is 4k ultra on almost everything (except shadows are high). this looks like a bad screenshot from a 2000s game. the font itself is already borderline illegible - typical apple like style over function font, pure hell for people with dyslexia (which I don't have, but I feel how much effort I have to put in to even read it)

what's worse is that every text fizzles and transforms around for 2-3 seconds until letters don't overlap any more every time you see a popup in the game world.
you can't read anything until you literally give the text time to render in a barely legible fashion, which is most of the time still blurry, frizzy and illegible. it almost looks like it is coming apart at the seems. (I run everything on ultra and 4k and have a 4090 and a 7950x3D)

it is incredibly annoying and off-putting. it feels like the dev went to a considerable amount of effort to make *everything* with numbers or letters in this game awful.

this isn't a bug on my end. this is, according to searches I did in the comments, an issue that has existed for years. yet the dev refuses to fix it.

that's why I believe there are a lot of reviews for this game from a time where it was in early access and people assumed it would get fixed. but it didn't get fixed.

sure, after like 50h, you probably do not need to read anything anymore, so it won't upset the die hard fanbois that are convinced this open world survival craft copy paste #87562786 is the best game ever.

but being unable to read popup windows in a game that refuses to follow normal control schemes and common game logic is infuriating.

it's the typical ""dev tried to reinvent the wheel"" syndrome. 

when you open the game, you get an uninterruptable ad for the ""support packs"". the game tells you you can hit esc to quit out of it, but it does not react to hitting that key until a few seconds have passed. I'm sure that's just a ""bug"".
speaks volumes about what is going on with this project.

this is another case where the steam ratings are dubious... I'm sure you can have some fun in this game, but there's dozens of games like this out there that do not actively try to piss off newcomers with font and a text rendering method that can't be read and weird game logic that's very unique to this game and feels wrong",1704380862,1704559845,False,0,0,0.338894695043563843,0,True,False,False

Several parts of it do feel unfinished/unpolished however. It does seem kinda annoying that you have to pretty much max your tech tree to get the a vehicle that can do both actions needed to build a road at the same time. It basically meant that by the time I could build roads I already had trains going to everywhere I needed to be.

I definitely did a lot of things out of order and there are several glitches to worry about including a persistent issue of items clipping through the ground and disappearing and it seems like I'm not the only one for whom the Wanderer refuses to trigger. Good news is they aren't gone forever and even if you lose items in the planet's core you can eventually get them back.

I wish that the dedicated server provided was slightly less completely broken so that I could host a dedicated server to share a persistent world with my friends. I have a literal server rack in my basement and it won't run stably enough for me to be worth it and it can only be run on linux if you disable encryption which... no

The seasonal events are a fun little bonus on top, but the cosmetics and emotes feel mostly like a reminder of the fact that I'm playing alone. There mass item storage canisters are super useful but by the time I got to them there didn't seem to be enough stuff left to build that needed mass resources for their to be a call for them. Maybe if I wanted to farm Scrap for an event or something?

Speaking of Scrap it's also pretty unclear through normal gameplay how you are intended to collect and scrap all of the destroyed gear that you find that's too big to fit into your inventory. It's a hassle to lug around manually and doesn't snap to anything and packagers seem like a waste. It wasn't until much later in the game where I though about adding a whole extra rover to my train just to drag a shredder around and using it is really power hungry so that feels like a dumb way to go about it.

Overall it's cute and worth your time, but it feels like a late-stage beta that needed some rework that it isn't going to get because it got pushed to prod and it's already making money.",1704322248,1704322248,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It features terraforming mechanics and the ability to travel from planet to planet via spaceship.  Items to collect and discover in the game present logistical challenges depending on the storage and transport technology the player is currently utilizing.  This gives progression in the game a more meaningful purpose.  Power and oxygen distribution are also key elements that the player needs to manage in order to safely traverse the various environments/biomes.

There are plenty of gadgets, buildings and vehicles for the player to unlock and use to continue their quest of progressing technology and uncovering the lore of the universe.  What's particularly satisfying is the capability to make a mobile base such that vehicles and ships aren't simply a faster way to traverse the planets you explore.  Not to mention the fact that you can fit ground vehicles with mining drills allowing you to excavate tunnels and collect resources at a much faster and efficient rate.

The cartoony art style and color palate might be a turn off for some players, but the content and gameplay loop of Astroneer is certainly top notch, especially for players that want a more chill exploration and survival flow to the game that isn't constantly bombarding them with enemies to kill or raids on their base(s).

I say that because after playing for a while i finally researched the small shuttle and printed it once I outfitted it with a oxygenator and thruster I flew it up into orbit and zoomed around the planet a few times then landed back at base. Soon after I decided it would be cool to go to a new planet. So I launched off to Glacio, I had not yet realized how thrusters fuel worked so once I landed I quickly discovered that my thruster only had enough fuel to get into orbit. So I was stranded. I also soon found that Glacio has no ZINC! WHICH MEANS NO BATTERIES!! I did find one battery I some debris so my whole flippin base ran off some wind turbines a small generator and ONE battery. After a few days of trying to build a new thruster I couldn't find any ammmoniem. So I kept trying and eventually researched a soil centrifuge. Then I got a thruster and flew home!!

Dev there is a difference in telling me to do something vs how to do it, tutorial is supposed to at a bare minimum teach you to use the controls right? Maybe all these games I play got it wrong? Nope, this game is just terrible. I thought it was going to be like No Mans Sky just a little more chilled, Nope! The controls are crazy, there are no instructions about how to use anything! I've played less than 2 hours and that is not straight, I played for a minute got frustrated said I'll come back when I'm not so ____ (fill in the blank with anything!)  I came back 4 more times (I seem get frustrated with this game super quick).

1 example: Fill the soil canister with soil, sounded like an easy task, until you have no idea where to put the canister, how to get the soil in it and what do you do after (beside click the big green button) you've collected this sample. After about 20 minutes I finally figured out (not really I was just click on stuff hoping it would work) how to fill the canister.

I usually don't like combat and try to avoid it in games that I can, but I will do a better job (I'm not a gamer, programmer by trade) in No Mans Sky combat than this supposedly calm exploration game that makes exploration next to impossible.

This is why I like to invest in EA games, at least then if you tell the Dev 3/4 of the controls/game makes no sense things can be changed but games like this, you can only warn others that this game is not what you think and it don't work like you think it should. (controls are not intuitive at all)

Now could this just be a me thing, No I asked an actual gamer to try this game out and they said the controls are just terrible. Some of this is probably just me I like software/games to just work, shouldn't have to go watch Youtube vids just to figure out the basic mechanics (controller usage) of the game.

Two things that need fixing:

It was one of the best chill sandbox gaming experiences I've ever had. The game is gorgeous, base building is amazing, it feels very neatly packed and cozy. I am heavily considering re-playing the game at this point but with someone else.

My biggest advice if you play is, make sure to read the in-game wiki to see where you can find certain resources, and if you struggle read the outside-the-game wiki, it helps a lot.

But, it could be so much better and cooler if the devs had looked to Factorio or Satisfactory regarding the base building and automation possibilities. It felt in the end as a personal grind where automation is only possible in a limited scale or quite buggy. In which Sci Fi automation game you need to fly resources between planets yourself? That should be possible to automate. Also automation of certain production proceses where you can split or bundle production streams. This is all not possible...
Also whenever you dig deep and suddenly fall cause the controls glitch and you loose all your late end game items, the search for your body in the hostile environment with your basic suit is a nightmare and very time consuming. 
I really hope they are going to develop a Astoneer II where they will have a close look at competitors who perform better on the automation side of the game which for me is always the most fun.

Now that we are over it lets talk about the positive.Fluid game mechanics that bind well with the aesthetic of the game and its overall feel making it seamlessly transition from one activity to the next.
The building aspect  is based on a system of modular platforms,each item occupies a certain amount of space(small mid large slot) requiring a simple drag and drop top assemble making the building easy for a newcomer but it also offers logic blocks[strike] in case you are not content with your daytime engineering job[/strike].
The resource management can be automated  with the help of various machinery as mentioned before but in order to unlock it you must explore multiple planets  trying to balance your power an oxygen while finding various treasures making it highly addictive.

I have carefully followed its rough early development and played this game since the pre-alpha in 2016.
(R.I.P Paul Pepera)

To put it lightly, the game has changed SIGNIFICANTLY since the 2016 release date.
Almost every facet of the game has been improved significantly.

[h2] ALMOST. [/h2]

[b] This game is SO CLOSE to perfection it's insane. [/b]

[olist]
[*]The visuals are pretty, stylized, and performant on most mid-range to high-end hardware
[*]Progression is straightforward and easy to follow thanks to guiding missions
[*]Building is simple and versatile, very similar to Legos™
[*]Item/Inventory organization is very intuitive and visual
[/olist]

I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world space exploration games with deform-able voxel terrain.

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, there is one major shortcoming (at least in my personal opinion).
This section is the main focus of my review of this game:

[h2] The Story [/h2]

[b] *DISCLAIMER* [/b]
Please DO NOT read further into this review and/or click on the blacked out text if you want to experience the current in game story line yourself or don't care about the story.

[spoiler] 
Ok, I'll keep this as short as possible: 
Writing that the entire game world is ""in a simulation"" is really lazy writing in my personal opinion. 
It completely annihilates the requirement of following real science or realism, and allows for writers to write literally anything into the story without much effort or thought. 

For example: Fortnite Battle Royale
Fortnite Battle Royale's story at one point devolved completely into [i] oooh wow there's this thingy called the ZERO POINT that is canonically linked with every universe in existence so we can now write literally anything from anywhere else into the game because we can[/i] Sarcasm aside, it really sucked to see the writers get this lazy to add such a crutch for extra content.

Ok, enough about Fortnite, this review is about Astroneer.
The only part about the main simulation focused story line that I find compelling is the whole point of the player progressing and exploring to restore the lost memories of a missing colleague in the EXO Dynamics company. I think that that's an interesting way to spin the status quo, however, it really limits the creativity of the writers in terms of what they can do next in the story. [/spoiler]

Now onto my final point of the review:

[h3] Good Video Game Lore Isn't Told Directly To The Player. [/h3]

There.
I said it.

A game's lore is at it's peak when the entire community has different ideas about how it's structured, each with their own nuance and opinions on interpretations of subtle clues left by the developers to gently nudge them in the right direction.

This is called ""Quasi-Lore"", and the hit game Minecraft has probably the best implementation of this in the entire gaming industry by far.

To help explain, here's a YouTube video I found about it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KDybLytYtk

The old versions of Astroneer actually had this style of lore in it, with a bunch of wreckages and dead players scattered underground on each planet and moon, indirectly communicating to the player that there have been many previous failed attempts to colonize the system you are currently exploring.

This made the mood/atmosphere of the game feel a lot more dark and dystopian, like you were EXO Dynamics's last hope in making a successful foothold in the system for the company, 

or even for your entire race.


The newer versions did away with this entire narrative, instead going for the lazy approach of [spoiler] retconning the whole universe you explore's origin for being from an EXO Dynamics company simulation computer that is trying to recover corrupted files. [/spoiler]

I sincerely hope that this review doesn't steer you away from the game, rather,
I want people who read this review to the end to understand my disappointment for the current story and play it anyway!

If you don't understand my point on the story, that's okay too.
You have a right to disagree with my review, and criticize it as you see fit in its comments.

[h1] TL;DR: [/h1]

[h3] The game is amazing, but don't play if you care about unveiling a great story while you play. [/h3]

Mid-game is basically just early-game but you have to travel more.

Once you reach the end of mid-game, your end-game begins, by which point you already have everything you need to finish the game, even though NOW is when you can most efficiently collect materials and travel around planets. But finishing the game doesn't require huge sweeps for materials at all, instead it's just tedious busywork copy pasted dozens of times. I genuinely don't know what the devs were thinking here.

There is no post-credits game.

A few rough edges, but not enough to drag it down. If the aesthetics and feeling that the trailers and screenshots give off hooked you, then you won't be dissatisfied, these are the main catches of the game. Plus, custom difficulty options can help you if you feel things are too hard (or too easy).

Somewhere, I wish this game had more. A more throrough crafting system, with longer production chains and stronger automation. Exploration with more side objectives other than ""find nexus, reach core, collect resources"".

But I'm glad the game is what it is. It stays on the simple side, and that's where its strenghts lies. Similar to how Minecraft is visually simple to understand (one of its main strenghts), both in aesthetics and mechanics, Astroneer is visually simple in a way that is relaxing and easy on you. It does a great job of minimizing UI, since you can see suit power, suit oxygen, and what you're carrying directly on your astronaut. Everything is direct, simple to see and understand, and straightforward.

In mechanics, learning the crafting resources is simple, and the game even has a built-in guide, so no need to open a wiki because you forgot where to find Hematite, or which mineral refines into Zinc. Exploration is only hindered by oxygen, which is dealt with placing theters that bring oxygen (which is done with one button press, easy). Traveling between planets can be done with resources found on all planets, so there's no risk of getting stranded (but do carry an extra thruster with you, in case launch bugs out and burns the thruster or you select the wrong destination). There is no set order to explore, and you can decide where to go by checking the recipes unlocked and decide what you're working towards.

Enemies are a bit of a problem. One plant in particular shoots a homing bubble of gas even through terrain. You'll learn to hear it and immediately go into panic mode, trying to find it and uprooting it as soon as possible. Others, you'll learn what they do when you step on them, and by then it will be too late. The sound design on these ones is awful, the sound is sharp and immediate, without any fade in, which gives them a audio-based jump-scare factor, since the music and other sounds are so muted and calm.

The game got missions sometime after launch of 1.0, which are kinda nice in giving pointers on what to do (and pieced a nice narrative), but also kinda detracted from the free-form exploration. The rewards from them are quite nice, and serve as good kickstarters. Don't feel tied to them if that's your thing. You can ignore them and then just pick up the rewards later for just playing the game later (or don't pick up the rewards at all, no one's your boss).

The music ties the whole package perfectly. While it's unlikely you'll have a favorite track, none of them will ever feel bad, out of place, or inappropriate for the setting.",1550274008,1703310700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

    Gorgeous visuals and art style
    Creative and sandbox gameplay
    Engaging cooperative multiplayer

Drawbacks :

    Occasionally encounters minor bugs 
    I would like to have an other type of structure to collect bytes and research craft

The sandbox nature of the game allows for endless creativity and problem-solving. Building and customizing your base is a joy, and the sense of accomplishment when you see your structures come to life is unparalleled. The resource gathering mechanics are well-balanced, encouraging exploration without feeling overly grindy.

From the outset, the game greets you with a visually stunning and vibrant open world, inviting you to embark on a journey of discovery across diverse planets.

The sandbox nature of Astroneer allows for a personalized adventure, encouraging creativity and ingenuity as you shape the environment to suit your needs. The joy of terraforming, molding the terrain to uncover resources, and constructing intricate bases is immensely satisfying, fostering a deep connection between player and planet.

The cooperative multiplayer aspect of Astroneer enhances the enjoyment, allowing friends to join forces and collaborate in shaping the cosmos. The seamless integration of multiplayer into the game's core mechanics ensures that teamwork not only feels natural but also exponentially amplifies the fun factor.

Astroneer's art style is a testament to its charm, with a delightful mix of minimalist aesthetics and intricate details. The soundtrack complements the serene yet adventurous atmosphere, creating an immersive backdrop for your cosmic escapades.

One of the standout features is the absence of a traditional narrative, allowing players to create their own stories and goals. The sense of freedom is empowering, and the game's commitment to player agency is a refreshing departure from more linear gaming experiences.

In conclusion, Astroneer is a triumph in the exploration and survival genre, seamlessly blending creativity, cooperative play, and stunning visuals. Whether you're a lone astronaut carving your path through the cosmos or part of a team shaping entire worlds, Astroneer promises an enchanting odyssey that celebrates the spirit of limitless discovery.",1703216779,1703216779,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If the game seems interesting to you, I'd say to give it a shot - but for me, it lost that cool discovery vibe it had when I got it so many years ago.

Ever since they added missions, the game's progression has been thoroughly ruined.

You now get most of the essentials within the first few hours, and it makes research feel kind of redundant due to that.

Sure, there's a lot more stuff to research - but most of it is variations on stuff you probably won't use, and it feels nicer to get a neat small unlock every so often vs. some big one after 10 hours.

Some updates have tried to fix it, but the best way in my opinion is to remove blueprint rewards from missions, and have them give either resources or a small amount of bytes.

You can really feel the difference if you're able to play a pre-missions build of the game vs. a post-missions one. Progression is just following the linear quests the game lays out, and it detracts from an otherwise unique experience.

The mission system itself is also quite handholdy and just feels kind of condescending at times - like the devs think you're so stupid you can't figure out the basics of a game.

Some updates have tried to rectify a few of the more annoying aspects of the game (such as transporting more than 8 items out of a cave at a time), but it's still not quite as good as it needs to be imo.

The repetitive events are also quite draining. It'd be nice if you could get some of the cosmetic shop currency at the top reward tier, but as-is you just kinda get random items you can already get fairly easily by just playing the game. When combined with how samey all of them are (plop items onto a unique building and click ""send""), it makes all of these events blend together in your head while also making them rather unfun.

I don't wanna say Astroneer has fallen to rock bottom or anything like that, but it definitely left my favourites list quite some time ago. I'd rather get no updates than constant recycled events clogging up my feed that barely give you anything, so why would I reinstall the game just to play them?

As I said at the start though, it is worth playing if it looks interesting to you - but I'm disappointed they didn't stick with the more Terraria/Minecraft-style approach of ""here's some cool shit, play the game and find out how it works""",1562991098,1703203709,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

A few things I liked:
- Beautiful graphics
- Nice soundscape
- Relaxing and ""cozy"" gameplay
- The lore is pretty good and engaging
- SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
- galastropods are cute
- The final questline was a nice resolution to the game

A few things I didn't like about it,
- A few of the quest lines felt tedious towards the end 
- Not very much of a incentive to keep going on the same save after you beat the game
- Camera controls can feel a little finnicky at times
- No linux binary(though proton came in and saved the day).

From the moment I stepped onto an alien planet, I was entranced by the game's vibrant colors, imaginative landscapes, and the sense of wonder that permeates every corner of its vast, procedurally generated universe.

One of the standout features of Astroneer is the sheer freedom it offers players to shape and mold their surroundings. The terraforming mechanics are not only innovative but also a testament to the game's commitment to letting players forge their own path. Whether it's crafting intricate structures or reshaping the terrain to suit your needs, the possibilities seem almost limitless.

However, Astroneer does not hold your hand, and therein lies its charm. While it may take some time to grasp the intricacies of resource gathering and crafting, this learning curve adds a layer of depth to the gameplay. The satisfaction that comes with mastering these mechanics is unparalleled. It's a journey of trial and error, discovery, and ultimately triumph as you begin to harness the full potential of your astronaut's capabilities.

Resource management is a key aspect of Astroneer, and yes, it does take some patience to gather the necessary materials for more advanced constructions. But this slow burn only enhances the sense of achievement when you finally unlock that next technological milestone. Each step forward feels earned, making the game a rewarding experience for those willing to invest the time and effort.

The multiplayer aspect of Astroneer is another gem in its crown. Joining forces with friends to explore the cosmos, collaborate on projects, and overcome challenges adds a social dynamic that elevates the overall gaming experience. The sense of camaraderie as you work together to establish a thriving base on an alien world is truly special.

In conclusion, Astroneer is a stellar exploration game that beckons players to embrace the unknown and revel in the joy of discovery. While it may take a bit of time to fully grasp its mechanics and gather the resources needed for certain advancements, the payoff is well worth the investment. Dive into the captivating world of Astroneer and let your inner explorer soar among the stars.",1702758790,1702758790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

so yeah. great game we got here lads. specialy when your friends join in and you end up retriving the truck you just made from the atmosphere cuz for some reason when they drive in your world. lets just say some intresting ""phenomoneons"" tend to happen. 
moving on, it is in all a great game to be in EA. could use a few tweaks here and there. looking forward to seeing a full game :D
10/10 would retive trucks from space again.

Back again after 2 years of devolopment, i can say i enjoy the huge increase in stuff they added and bugs they fixed. The game looks the same, but it is also just to vastly different from when i started playing Dec 2016. 2019 just began and i can say i am looking forward to the full relase with my friends. 
Now i have praised the game, i will admit the game kinda dies after like 20h in a world. The goal of discovering more stuff and trying to get even more effective dies. there is no ending, however, this games does deliver the nice take away from everything else i play. The game is so cute and innocent, the only violence is you massmurdering plants to get further down your cave. It is a nice game, mostly every bug i encountered with orbit launched rovers have been resolved and hence i can now say it is (to mostly 90%) a certain degree a stable mulitplayer experience!",1495046675,1702400497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First things first, so many of its features feel incredibly disconnected, there are like 50 different things to do and it never feels rewarding or necessary to do 45 of them. 

Secondly it really feels like the game has no respect at all for the time you put in. You can spend hours prepping for a trip to the most dangerous planet, Atrox and upon landing your ship instantly gets blown to smithereens by a single explosion, not only killing you, but also destroying all the gear you had stored on that ship and sending you back to the starting planet, without your ship

It does not matter how much time you spent preparing, you will loose it all in a near unpreventable way without warning. The best strategy for that Planet isn't to go in as prepared as possible, but to throw yourself at it with disposable gear as often as  possible until you retrieve what you need. But even that isn't really possible, because you need to [spoilers:] [spoiler]Bring three items to the planets core[/spoiler] to unlock the games ending. doesn't help, that without a drill mod you cant dig there at all, so have fun needing to replace that too

This is a pattern the game repeats again and again. Without warning it throws you into a situation you couldn't prepare for, takes away all your hard earned gear and throws you back to square one. 
There is no reason to remove your items if you die retrieving them, but the game does it anyway, just to slap you in the face.

This is repeated again and again, the game really punishes you for engaging with it

If i weren't such goddamned completionist and hadn't already exceeded refund time on this game i would not open the game again. This game feels insulting to play.

Edit: scratch that last part, im just gonna remove it from my account anyways, after playing a bit more and getting spat in the face a few more times i decided its not worth it. There are 2 games that achieve everything this game does, but better. If you want the exploration and at least slightly less clunky gravity, play outer wilds.

I started playing this game long before full release, in 2016 right when it was public access. the atmosphere and game play loop captivated me. the music was beautiful, the graphics were low poly and had a cute sort of design, with the peaceful and low risk exploratory nature of the game.

but the bugs were the highlight for me, tinkering on how to break the game in the funniest ways, to cheese gameplay mechanics and to break the physics engine to bring my computer to a crawl.
the game is more refined and no longer has such extensive bugs, but i still manage to find them and the challenge to find them is my favorite aspect. maybe not the thing the devs want to hear, but it is true. the most recent exploit I had found, that only one other person that i know knew of was one to ""trade scam"" where you take the scrap from the trade platfrom as it leaves to get resources. i automated it with the arms and made a resource factory giving me infinite everything. they patched it, haven't found anything since, except minor glitches here and there.

1. The camera controls on keyboard and mouse are needlessly terrible.

This is not the case on controller, where you hold a button down to unlock the cursor. Absolutely baffling design.
2. The camera smoothing and automatic rotation of it is nauseating, and has been an issue for a long time, to the point that if you want to not deal with it, you have to download a dll on Github and inject it into your .exe just to change something that should be a setting.

[b]Understand this is a pre-alpha game, it will take time to get good[b]

Don't buy it expecting to get a fully complete game. But if you want to support a dev team, go for it.

With procedurally generated planets that pop like confetti, visuals so vibrant they'd make a disco jealous, and an interface friendlier than a cosmic kitten, this game is the life of the gaming galaxy party.

But hold your jetpacks, because what truly sets Astroneer apart is its groovy emphasis on collaboration. It's like a multiplayer dance-off where players share resources, and together, they build a cosmic tapestry that's more psychedelic than a neon rainbow.

Now, grab your Fanta, because as we sip on that fizzy delight, ponder the nomadic vibes of Mongolia, and throw in some communism for good measure, Astroneer becomes a party that transcends pixels. It's a celebration of unity, cultural richness, and exploration that's wilder than a unicorn riding a skateboard.

In conclusion, Astroneer is the cosmic rave that keeps evolving with updates and community shenanigans. It's a journey that tickles the imagination and unites players in the joy of discovery.

1. If the creators want the game to be explored as it sits, great, but once you beat the game. It should give you an option to restart with knowledge. 

2. A building aspect seems the only natural route this game is going to take, but understandably you want it to stand out. So maybe have a building aspect, after someone has beaten the game. Restart with or without technologies, but allow building, so people can build entire communities. A method to reset a planet would be cool, like a ""reset charge"" (Marvel's Loki Series) that can be set by the owner of the server or host, etc... This way, if a moon has been hollowed out, or a planet, it can be periodically reset but it literally wipes it clean. Be cool to see it randomize resources, but that's a 2025 problem. 

3. Add weapons, allow pvp, so people could host capture the flag worlds, or hunger game worlds. Hell, imagine building an entire fortress world then having to defend it from attacks. Or even maze worlds, or different pre-generated worlds for stories, pve or pvp. 

4. Can we get a slingshot pod or something, like a deployable life boat that literally shoots you from one planet to another, you have no choice where you land. This would be cool just so we don't have to build an entire shuttle if we get marooned, I got the inspiration from the TV show Foundation when they use ""extraction packets"" to escape planet and get back into orbit.

As mentioned this game is great, I would and will always recommend people buy it. Who knows, maybe we will get the dev's attention and some of these suggestions can be implemented. Always down to share more ideas, obviously its a great game, but I could see this game taking over Steam with a few changes.",1701401291,1701401291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think it's terrible to try to play the missions alone though.

There are aspects of the game that require strategic planning or you will get stuck, even up to getting stranded on another planet. Hopefully you have a friend to play with, because they can rescue you if you mess up. I accidentally mouse-clicked the wrong planet one time and my rocket was out of fuel, if I had clicked on the right planet, there was fuel waiting. Yay my hubby rescued me lol.

The camera takes some getting used to and there are some glitches. For instance one of our tractors shot through the ground down several layers into the planet, and was stuck in the void; just because I bumped the tractor walking too close. This time I was able to rescue hubby.

To counteract that I've been playing on windowed full screen to have the computer's taskbar there as substitute for a fixed UI and with the camera super far back to avoid looking around too fast and making myself sick.

BUT: It also makes many many mistakes. After 8 Hours of game play I still fumble with the controls. And that's not because I don't play many video games, I have over 1000 hours in quite a few games. Its because they are clunky. Buttons are seemingly randomly assigned to functions, depending on context. 

The game dose a bad job at explaining itself. Not the basics. The tutorial is quite good, but when I want to know how to enable the drill-mod for the tractor, I have to try buttons, or google it. 

The ""grid align"" block is absolutely useless, because ""grid aligned"" means something really technical, that changes depending on position on the planet. This is never explained, nor is it intuitive. Just give me a block that is always perpendicular to gravity. Its not that hard. 

The menu, especially the printer and research menu is structured like a shelf. Neat idea, but a pain to use. No search function. Even tho there are 100s of buildings in the late game. Scrolling with WASD is ok, but you cant scroll while the animation is running, meaning that when I know that I want to switch items fast, it doesn't let me. 

The ""printer"" in my backpack is a pain to use, because all items are arranged so that I have to click through all of them to find the right one. Late game this is a pain.

Speaking of which, your main tool throughout the game will be a giant brush with which you can edit the terrain however you like. Aside from the production devices, there are no preassembled things, you have to brush your house yourself if you want one.

[h3]Short elaboration[/h3]

To sum this entire review up, The game lost its satisfaction and charm due to how easy it became.

[h3]Long elaboration[/h3]

In the good old days, the feeling of finally grinding enough bytes to unlock the RTG and getting all the resources required to obtain the nano-carbon alloy required to craft the RTG was unmatched.

Nowadays, all you have to do is research 5 items commonly found in forests, and there you go: a mini-RTG, zero effort, zero grind. The worst thing being that the mini-RTG is even better than the normal one as it works in the exact same way but can actually be equipped in the player's inventory or the buggy, with the only downside being that it produces less energy (maybe?).

The same is true for many other items, which in the good old days you'd have to spend hours grinding for; now you can basically obtain them within 10 minutes of creating your world.

I wouldn't have an issue with this if it was just a one-off thing (you get 1 mini-RTG and that's it), but the thing is that you can get dozens of them within just a few hours (me and my friend played on our co-op world for maybe 5-10 hours and already had like 4 or 5 mini-RTGs alongside several other end-game OP items just laying randomly around *).

This brings me to my next issue. Since the game started spamming the player with so many OP items, in most cases they'll either be put on a storage slot, placed in some random corner of the base, and completely forgotten, or they'll just be randomly thrown around the floor, cluttering the base.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

[b]Would I recommend the game?[/b] - Absolutely! Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing but will get extremely boring and repetitive after 5–10 hours (before it was more like 100–200 hours). If that is worth $30 ($12 when on sale) to you, then get it! Otherwise, think about it.",1564400355,1701035759,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

UPDATED REVIEW

HELP I'VE CREATED A MONSTER! I convinced my wife to give this game a try...over 100 hours of co-op play later and she won't let me sleep or eat! Help me!!!

Seriously, it's a very addictive game. Once you start finding you're way to other planets, get the special resources back and learning about the automations you can put together. Something about the resource management and gadgets had really hooked my missus on this game. We put in about 15-20 hours together in a single weekend alone. 

The gadget selection device where you choose which gadgets to research and ""purchase"" is still the biggest annoyance, even after 50 hours of gameplay it's still a pain to find the exact gadgets.

==============================


In essence you get dumped on a planet with a few pieces of kit and your job is gathering resources, building more useful tools and exploring. Love the graphics, I'm sucker recently for cartoony style graphical games like this and Raft, there's already way too many games chasing realistic graphics and sacrificing gameplay.

If I had to pick on two negative points, the first would be the intro/tutorial or complete lack of one. This game could really do with a much better intro. The comms device with the missions kept telling me to research and make XYZ but didn't make it clear that I needed to pull out the research pad on my backpack, earn the bytes and then buy the plans. Second negative would be research pad where you find new devices to learn and make is not very intuitive and I find myself constantly scrolling through every single item on every list trying to find what I'm looking for, that gets very tedious, very quickly due to the navigation.

Outside the two negatives it's really fun game, quirky style, a little grindy but getting to the really rare and valuable resources takes some skill with the ""terrain vacuum"" tool, one false move and you slip away from your tether line and you have just a few minutes to get back or reload from last save point, gives it an edge. 


I do like the relaxed game play style, nothing nasty really gets you other than falling into a ravine and then suffocating is generally the worst that will happen to you.

Astroneer is a very interesting game, at the start. You land on a planet, collect the local resources, construct buildings, upgrades, and research new buildings and upgrades, while collecting more resources. You balance out your power usage, make sure you have enough oxygen, and you can run about doing what ever you want. It is a very creatively made sandbox game that looks great, plays great, and has a ton of charm in the music, graphics, sound effects, and more. 

However, it is not complicated, it will not challenge you in any way. when I say that you need to balance out power usage and oxygen, I don't mean to compare it with something like, Factorio, or other more complex games. In this you just build a single Oxygenator, do some quests to get generators that provide free unlimited power and run on nothing, and you are good to go for the game.

Ultimately though your goal is to *spoilers ahead* activate a strange structure you find on the surface of the planet, which allows you into the core. By doing this: activating a structure on each of the different planets in the system and digging down and activating the cores, you open up a sort of fast travel network. However, by the time you are able to do all of this, you will have already unlocked and done everything there is to make and do. There is no need to travel to other planets for their metals and gases through this portal network, because you have already done so via regular space ship, and have copious quantities.

To entice you into playing more, you are given further things to do. Unlock EVERY strange structure on every planet and moon (6 structures per planet, 2 per moon, for a total of 34), and collect a hidden probe on each planet and moon in order to get a hidden message... and that is about it. Suffice to say, I did not do these time killing tasks. Even while listening to podcasts and watching videos etc. while playing this game to keep myself entertained, I was still getting bored. Maybe it would be more fun with friends in multiplayer?

If you are looking for a VERY uncomplicated sandbox game where, ultimately, you cannot die and there are no real consequences to any actions, where there is no real story, and the true gameplay is the grind, this game will suit you just fine. I kind of wish I could give it a mixed review; but ultimately I was able to get it for a decent price on sale and played for about 70 hours, so I guess ultimately I would have to go with a thumbs up.",1700779763,1700779763,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

#2 Understandable Roadmap.

Do you want exploration? Astroneer has it. Do you want automation? Astroneer has it. Do you want mining, sculpting, completion, lore, multiplayer, all at the same time? Welcome home.

And on the subject of multiplayer, I couldn't imagine a better game to play with friends. And not only that, but it is ridiculously easy to set up, with just 4 inputs, to open up your world to your friends through Steam. Of course, there is the occasional bug, and unpolished item (I'm looking at you, winch), but when encountering them, and this is difficult to explain, truly understand why they are there. You can feel part of the game.
Just like Minecraft commonly is, this game can be a tool for other tasks, like building computers and great monuments to the stars, but in this game, you actually can build to the stars (for practical purposes anyway, there is a hard-to-reach height limit).

And finally, what is the killer for many games, there are no greedy practices by the devs. The most they ask, anywhere in or out of the game, is A: To purchase the soundtrack, which is a work of art in its own right, and B: Cosmetic items, which in no way are essential or affect gameplay, and are very clearly there to support the developers and maybe have some fun in multiplayer.

In summary, this game is the best you will find in the industry, especially with greedy dev practices growing more common. I wish naught but failure to those who might pirate the game like any other, because unlike most, this game deserves to be bought. I thank you for your time reading this.

With the new updates it became much more dynamic and less labor intensive to play, I made all the trophies without the paver and it was a lot more complicated.

Como podem ver pela minhas horas no jogo eu gostei bastante do game play, apesar de ter alguns bugs, o jogo te envolve numa ideia de que tem de conseguir pegar recursos para evoluir e coletar recursos para construção. Em suma é um jogo de coleta e construção espacial que te faz viajar entre planetas de um sistema solar e coletar recursos únicos em cada um deles para evoluir e viajar pelo sistema com uma mecânica envolvente e direcionada para evolução e com um índice de periculosidade resumido a ""se o ar acabar você morre!"" é um jogo que te faz gastar horas sem notar em exploração, escavamento e ativando portais.

Cons (depending on viewpoint):
The game has a tendency to grow repetitive with no campaign.  There are some objectives to help point you in the right direction but it's entirely open worlds.

This game is just so much fun to play when you need to wander and explore. The building mechanics and research options are intuitive. The different planets in existence are fun to explore and they have enough hazards to keep you on your toes. Soundtrack is peaceful and fits beautifully to the environment.

Tried to do objectives, went into a cave, accidentally fell and died from suffocating trying to find a way back to surface.
Went to recover corpse and items, (corpse is not marked in any way), got lost in darkness in huge underground cave system, stepped just a little bit from tethers to collect some resources, then couldnt get in proximity in time > died from suffocating. Corpse is not marked.
Got full bag of tethers, placed literally everywhere, couldnt find my corpses in ~3 hours of running around caves, because there is no map and corpses arent marked in any way, so I lost everything several times.
I already got a refund for this game once, I suppose giving them a second chance was a mistake.
Game may look fance, but after several hours its nothing more than a grind.
They got an ingame shop though, where we can buy an emote for 5 bucks.
Game has access to my friend list, I dont remember giving them permission to read that info.
Why its called 'ASTROneer', I literally spent all my first (and last) playthrough underground, trying to get my stuff back after I died.

Despite all the interesting logistics/automation tools the game provides, there are no interesting solutions to create.  The game is balanced to be incredibly easy, which means that just doing everything manually is far more optimal.  Even if you do want to explore the automation possibilities, you quickly become totally constrained by the game's mechanics (and not in a fun way).  

Because there is no depth to the crafting/automation content, the ""end game"" is just slowly driving to a bunch of locations and powering them.  Super exciting.

The game is constantly slightly frustrating due to poor UI, camera controls, vehicle behavior, and essentially every single mechanic.  It's not terrible, but I can't point to a single thing that I feel it did well.",1698204290,1698204290,False,3,0,0.450867056846618652,0,True,False,False

It would be okay if these were separate DLCs that could be bought on Steam for real money. However, the developers use predatory monetization by replacing real money with an imaginary currency.
Either make it possible to buy cosmetics for real money on Steam, or give the opportunity to earn QBITS by playing the game.

You can build bases, explore planets, scavenge and build contraptions for what ever your imagination comes up with.
I have built automatic byte farms, Hydrazine factories, alloys factories, sorting machines that can pick up your cargo straight from the tractor when you come back home, a moving train synchronized with the sun to capture light 24/7 and power my base.

Early Access actually felt like a game.
Then they added a mineral doo hickey and you can just spam your way into the end game with this machine instead of exploring.
Ruined it

Since this review I completed the game and changed this review to a positive one
The soil centrifuge is not as issue, you can still go out and collect your resources if thats what you prefer. I did like having full soil canisters from a large tractor going to the core - and this allowed me to in a pinch when I didnt want to fly somewhere/waste hydrazine for resoucres.

There's probably a solution. Haven't found it yet. But, it's still sorta fun. Some day I'll find the umpteen backpacks that I've left lying around. Backpacks that will happily fall down a hill or into a hole, but you can't pick them up to carry them back up.

(edit): mostly solved. Drill can make ramps (LeftCtrl). Just need to have small canister to store the soil required.
An enjoyable game so far.

(edit at 71 hours): Have noticed a number of... issues.

1) Camera is janky as heck, especially if you're near *anything*, or trying to pave+drill at the same time, many times you'll not be seeing anything except the back of your own head or vehicle. 

1a) The lack of first person view, especially when driving/paving/drilling, makes the game insanely annoying at times. I can totally see people quitting the game over it. But I've put enough hours in that I'll probably work through it and try to ""finish"" the game.   

2) Cannot earn store coin by playing the game, can only purchase with actual money. Not happening, and that they've done this is another point against them.  

3) Can't control paver and drill separately on the front of a large rover. All or nothing. Pity. One wag even recommended having them on opposite ends of the rover, which I found to be a hilariously poor mechanic.

But I've spent my money, so will continue through at least one playthrough. I'm not really seeing the potential for a 2nd one, but the game was cheap enough, and generally fun enough (with some exceptions, see above) that I'll still recommend it. Really wish they had a 1-5 scale instead of a yes/no. Game would get a 3.5 or so.

AAAND rage quit. Stuck on edge of core with large rover. Every time I try to move, the gravity shifts around. Even when I carefully aim AWAY from the core, or at a tangentf, the gravity shifts and flips and generally makes the rover useless. BUT, what makes it REALLY annoying and makes me rage is the LACK OF BLOODY FIRST PERSON VIEW. Instead, every time I get flipped around I can't see anything because I'm close to a wall so I basically go blind. Every time I try to move the rover I can't see because it puts the view BEHIND the thing.  90% of the issue could be resolved if I could SEE. But I can't, because they decided not to allow first person even when every other vision is blocked.

Might come back. Might not. I'm not having fun any more. All because devs were too stubborn to put in a much requested feature, even just for driving.

(after a sleep...) And.. back. Solved the issue. Wasn't at enough of a tangent to the core, and was too close to one of the ""strands"" that merges with the rock and bends gravity around itself. Still the MOST aggravating thing, all because of devs are stubbornly refusing to put in any first person view.

All that said... yeah, I had some fun. Incredibly frustrating at times, yes, but it can be fun too.",1696011210,1697058203,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Introduction:
Welcome, space pioneers and interstellar explorers! If you've ever dreamt of blasting off to the cosmos, donning an astronaut's helmet, and forging your path among the stars, ASTRONEER is the game that promises to make your dreams come true. But beware, it's not all serious space science here; we're about to take a cosmic rollercoaster ride with a dash of humor!

Graphics: 5/5 - ""When Space Looks Like a Whimsical Art Gallery""
Imagine a world where Picasso and Van Gogh decided to team up and paint a galactic masterpiece. That's precisely what ASTRONEER's visuals feel like. The planets are vibrant, the landscapes are surreal, and everything sparkles like a space disco on acid. It's like Salvador Dali and Hubble telescope had a baby, and it's beautiful.

Gameplay: 4/5 - ""Making Astronauts Look Like Construction Workers""
In ASTRONEER, you're not just an astronaut; you're a cosmic construction worker. Build bases, extract resources, and shape the terrain as if you're playing with cosmic Play-Doh. The gameplay is as smooth as a moonwalk, but at times, you might feel more like Bob the Builder than Neil Armstrong. Nevertheless, it's a blast to create your own little space empire.

Exploration: 5/5 - ""Lost in Space with Style""
ASTRONEER's universe is vast, and it's filled with the wonders of the cosmos. Discover mysterious alien artifacts, uncover hidden secrets, and roam the procedurally generated worlds like a kid in a candy store. And don't forget to bring a friend; exploring these quirky landscapes is even better with company.

Multiplayer: 4/5 - ""Space Adventures are Better with Buddies""
ASTRONEER is the best kind of party game—where the party is in space! Team up with your pals to build epic bases, race rovers across the terrain, and embark on hilarious misadventures. Just be ready for the inevitable arguments over who gets to drive the spaceship. Hint: It's always the pilot's call!

Soundtrack: 4/5 - ""Space Jam for Your Ears""
The music in ASTRONEER is like an otherworldly jam session. It sets the mood perfectly and keeps you grooving while you build, explore, and conquer the universe. Just remember to turn up the volume when you're about to blast off; your rocket launch deserves an epic soundtrack.

Conclusion:
ASTRONEER isn't just a game; it's a comical, colorful, and creative journey through the cosmos. If you've ever wondered what it's like to be an astronaut with a sense of humor, this game has got you covered. So, buckle up, fellow space cadets, and prepare for a wild ride through the galaxy. And remember, in space, no one can hear you laugh...until now!",1696676680,1696676680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i didn't have the highest hopes getting into this because it seemed so built around multiplayer and kind of smoothed over, but i haven't been able to put it down. collecting and sorting and smelting and automating is just so mesmerizing.
the sound design is a real stand out feature here. everything feels so tactile with its own unique material sound. it feels more like an immersive sandbox toy than a game to me, and i love it

the physics feel rough around the edges. the voxel system is finicky and unfriendly to build with. items are always clipping through the ground into the cave below. you can get stuck in midair from touching a generator at the wrong point. most structures don't have collision. i end up running a meter above the ground sometimes.
but it feels like a toy coming apart in your hands in a way where it's easy to just push whatever separated back together and it's fine. it's never anything irrecoverable.

This includes: pepper, sea salt, soy creamer, chopped garlic, dried rosemary (crumble into a powder), harissa, vinegar, remaining EVOO, 2 cups of the purple kale, white rice, saffron, mushrooms, vegan sausage, vegan bouillon cube, water, corn/peas, carrots, nutritional yeast, tomato/pepper and remaining veggie broth. Optional sweet potatoes and veg cheese can go in as well.

Bring soup to a bowl, stir well, cover and reduce heat to a simmer for 20 minutes. This will allow the flavors to merge and the rice to cook.

After the 20 minutes are up, add in the pasta and remaining kale. Cover again and cook on medium heat for ten minutes. You may want to add in another cup of water- only if too much steam has reduced the soup too much.

Do a quick taste test and adjust salt/pepper as needed. Pour steaming hot soup into bowls and garnish with fresh chiffonaded arugula or chopped parsley on top. Side of spelt toast.",1696506740,1696506740,True,0,0,0.450064301490783691,0,True,False,False

[i]*""Written"" in [u]JAN 14 2021[/u] with [u]45.2[/u] hours played. Made minor changes and corrections, 2023, still playing and loving it! One of my favorite games ever since the beginning for sure.[/i]

Firstly, of course I recommend playing it with friends, it's still an experience playing it solo, but it can be even better with friends, great potential there. One of the pros of playing with company is that you'll advance faster and adquire even more resources. 
[i]*Just note that multiplayer can be a little ""heavier"" to run.[/i] 

I love how there's no pressure on you in this game, it's extremely relaxing and pleasing to play it, the exploration, research and crafting systems only makes it better (among pretty much everything else). You can take your time for literally everything and just chill, no need to rush for anything, simply enjoy the beautiful planets and their varieties as you discover how things work. Talking about it, it's truly an experience to discover how everything works on your own, at certain point you'll need the Astropedia (in-game wiki), highly recommend using it from time to time to remind you how to plan things, which planet to go for (since there's different main resources in each planet, but the basics are shared among all), etc.
 
There's a lot of content and [i]a lot[/i] to discover, so if you don't like exploring the game, maybe that's not for you. Though you can call some friends to do that part while you take care of crafting and base building or something, it's an idea, did it myself some times. It's important to mention it since you'll [i]need[/i] to explore. But don't you worry, because it's so damn pleasing to keep finding more about the planet/moon you're in, marking important spots, getting to know where you are, everything really, it's beyond fun.

You might be lost sometimes, since the game don't give you directions, I personally enjoy that kind of thing in games, it really inspires you to go out and check the universe for yourself, you're meant to explore and test, study everything.
[i]*Friendly reminder of the in-game wiki, it'll always be handy![/i]

Also the progress is [i]so[/i] satisfying, to see you and your ""bases"" growing both in size and technologically. As you gather and research specific objects you'll find around the planets/moons and their underground, you'll get some kind of research currency called ""Bytes"", you use them to expand your crafting options along with new technologies. 
[i]*Tip: Don't scan things if you can carry them home to research them in the Research Chamber, that way you'll get more Bytes![/i]

It would be a crime not to compliment the visuals and art overall as well, the entire game is simply gorgeous (as the review states up there), from each planet/moon that really feel different from each other and unique (and believe me they are), to the different machines and suits you can use. They did an amazing work there as well. Also: Space.

I don't enjoy such experience in a really long time, I seriously loved this game, been playing with my partner and it's been perfect, we found another favorite! What a gem. Plus you can play it infinitely, during the quarantine it's been a dreamy experience.

If anything mentioned interests you, go grab this game, you won't regret it. I feel like more people should recognize it and how great it is.

1) It has micro-transactions through a predatory store which obfuscates the cost of items with a secondary currency. So you must purchase the secondary in-game currency with real money, and that in-game currency is used to buy the store items to make it much more difficult to understand how much real money you have spent. I will not purchase microtransactions. Whilst I'm fine with a game offering up purely cosmetic items for additional money (this game is offering purely cosmetic items) I object to these predatory tactics. I personally am not okay with micotransactions, and it's particularly galling to see in a game which is clearly geared towards a young target audience. In my opinion it's not responsible or ethical of the game devs to engage in this behaviour. A simple design choice which make this much less egregious would be to at least put an up front real currency price tag on each item.
2) The camera movement makes me feel motion sick. I can't play this game. It is simply unplayable for me. I'm very surprised that in seven years the devs have not yet introduced the simple option of locking the camera to prevent extraneous movement.

[b]The UI:[/b]
It appears to be slick and intuitive, until you try to actually use it, then it all falls apart. You grab a resource stack but as you're placing it the camera shifts slightly and instead of placing it on a storage wall/unit/thing you've just dropped it. This is the same for placing buildings and whatnot.

[b]The Camera:[/b]
Oh the camera! Our wonderful view into this little world! If only it could actually be controlled in any meaningful way! For those of us playing with a keyboard and mouse, you have two options.
1. Hold the right mouse button whenever you want to move your view around. If you aren't holding the button, it'll generally, slowly, oh so very slowly, drift towards whatever you're trying to do. You can move your mouse cursor around freely without controlling the camera and do things off to the side of you if you want. If you're like me, or any other sane individual, you probably want the camera to face, you know, what you're actually doing! Which leads nicely into option...
2. Set the camera movement to toggle with the right mouse button, this way you can set it and let it move around wherever you're pointing. Great! Well no, it's not. You see, wherever your mouse cursor is pointed on the screen when you toggle camera movement is where your cursor is going to stay. Did you toggle when your mouse was in the bottom left corner? It's stuck there until you toggle off the camera control. You can easily toggle to where you can't reasonably aim your tools. And it's even worse when you're trying to place objects. Oh and you want to access the stuff on your backpack? Well you have to toggle it off to free up your mouse cursor. So have ""fun"" with that.

[b]Exploration:[/b]
Exploration problems come down to, well, the camera again, and your character's ability to navigate terrain. The direction your camera faces is NOT the direction your character faces. So if you're in a cave and would like to, oh I don't know, look around and see what's there, or maybe look for how to get out and back to the surface, your camera doesn't control where your flashlight is pointing! Instead of simply looking around, you need to move the camera then move your character, and you better hope you don't walk off a ledge you didn't see because again, you can't really look around with your flashlight. As far as your character's ability to navigate terrain, it seems that they don't very much like walking up any sort of incline. The thing you need to walk up to get out of caves. The thing hills and mountains are made of. I could walk down it, no problem. I could stop and turn while on them, no problem. Can I walk up a gradual incline? It's like walking on ice!

[b]Terra-forming:[/b]
Looks nice in the videos. In reality, the voxels are enormous, and the ability to match elevation is not accurate. It always seems to create slight inclines. And I know my character just can't handle those. Nevermind that other than attempting to make ""flat"" ground you can't even make smooth ground! Dug down and found a cave? Well the path there is going to be bumpy and you might not be able to jump up the steps you had no choice to make.

[b]Using Structures:[/b]
To use a structure, be that a printer, the mission board(?), your habitat, or anything else I didn't bother attempting to get to before requesting a refund, you need to walk within range, put your mouse cursor over it, and press f. Sounds pretty simple. Well your mouse was one pixel off so instead of selecting the research lab, you've unlocked the platform it's on. Try again. Oh! Close again, but your camera was unlocked and it decided to move when you pressed the button.

[b]Instructions:[/b]
The tasks you need to do don't really give you any direction. ""Research and apply a drilling attachment to your tool."" Okay, I've never done that before in this game, how do I research? ""Collect 4 of [resource]."" I don't know what that is, nor do I know how to collect anything yet, maybe a short tutorial screen would be nice.

[b]Forum Nonsense:[/b]
Nearly every problem this game has comes down to the decision to make it third-person. People on forums say the devs did it that way to set it apart, and that, ""it's actually very intuitive. You see, in real life you'd be grabbing stuff from your backpack to put into the printers."" First of all, this isn't real life. Secondly, when I take something out of a bag and put it on a table, I can turn my head without moving my hand. I don't suddenly miss the table. Also, how is having to pull up the backpack to move items around any different from a standard inventory menu? And lastly, if your argument really is that it's like real life then why the hell is it in third person?

[b]Fixes:[/b]
The camera, handling items, and using structures, would be fixed if it was in first person, you're aiming where you're looking and you're looking where you're aiming. Fixing walking up inclines is solved by doing it the way hundreds, if not thousands, of other games have done it. Heck, making a character walk up an incline was done better on the N64 and PS1! Instructions and tutorial moments are part of making a video game accessible. Greater options for terra-forming would go a long way. And the backpack just being a simple menu instead of this drag-and-drop items thing would make actually using it so much cleaner.

[b]Closing Remarks:[/b]
Overall, it's just a big case of form over function. And I want to play a game, not fight a game.",1696218470,1696218470,False,6,0,0.492057502269744873,0,True,False,False

Now that I have the time, I have been missing out. New Items and tools, new vehicles.
I have been playing Solo so far and have been back to the addiction.
To bad the weather was taken out and never brought back. That I actually liked, I know a lot of people did not since it would kill you instant if flying debris, mostly boulders, would hit you.
I recommend the game. It has a lot of cool stuff. and also the fact you can travel to others planets in the area for other resources.
Multiplayer is also fun.





I been eager to buy this game for sometime and finally did.
I must say, I was not disappointed. This game is what No Mans Sky Should have at least been.
I have yet to try out Multiplayer so I am currently on single player. This game has sucked plenty hours away from me.
Very fun and addicting and so far I been having a blast figuring things out and learning how things work.

If you enjoy Crafting, learning and exploring the world or worlds, this game is for you.
So far I have started over 5 times due to some planets are harder to find resources since its random.
Had to start over once because I had no fuel for my ship and got stuck on the moon.

Remember., this game has a work in progress and by at your own Risk. Currently their are no aliens or creatures. Dust storms and falling down, sufficating and all will kill you.

Enjoy if you buy! I did!",1482948906,1696213830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, you need a platform for your machines to work, which means a lot of grinding just to have every single one of them sit on an otherwise useless item. With all the machines you'll need, and maybe a few autoarms, thats an easy 30-60 platforms

Second, forming terrain for your machines to sit on is a NIGHTMARE
By default your terrain tool can 'flatten' terrain, except its not actually going to be flat because of rounding errors, which is going to make it impossible to not put random bumps into your surface
Then this is further complicated by the fact that there is a mod that aligns your flatten tool to the curvature of the planet, or so it says, but it doesnt work and it just creates random elevations of terrain everywhere, creating even more and more pronounced bumps.
Then you try the 'levelling block' the game has, and you'll immediately realize that the block that's supposed to create actually flat surfaces, can only do so around gateways, which make it impractical for you to build around them because of how much space they take up and if you flatten the terrain around them, then your surface is going to be hanging 15 meters in the air and getting up there with land-based vehicles is going to be ass
Maybe you arent an ass about having an actually flat surface, i'd be willing to settle for a surface free of bumps that curves according to the planet, but i cant do that because the alignment tool mod is jank and wont actually align it properly

This game is also obscenely grindy with the amount you'll need just to finish the game, and both inventory management, and base management with the layout of the things is stupid.

Oh, and they have an expensive as hell microtransaction shop in a singleplayer/coop game. Absolutely disgusting.

THE clunkiest UI in probably any game EVER. 
Inventory management on the actual 3d backpack on your character? Yeah, good luck dragging all the items and tool upgrades between the slots on an in-game 3d object when you're trying to get stuff off your corpse.
Research menu on some weird grid on a cylinder? Ooof, good luck trying to find the one thing you need to research amoung 100 other things, by rotating through each column and row, one by one, like with some sort of a wheel cypher.
Crafting menu on your character only navigatable by clicking through left/right arrow buttons on the UI screen? (Not even the left/right buttons on the keyboard!) Good luck going through a list of 30 things when trying to find the one you need.

And the gameplay is no better.
The only way to kill a hostile thing - is to dig a hole under it.
The only way to gather a resource - is to dig a hole under it.
One tool for every job, and this tool just digs holes. And then you keep falling into the holes you yourself made, and keep dying from lack of oxygen because you tried to dig yourself out and instead fell into an even deeper hole that happened to be under your hole. What a !@#$hole.

What about building/crafting? Everything you build has to sit on its own platform. Need a printer? Print a platform first. Need a forge? Print another platform. Need a reasearch station? Print another platform. Before you know it - your base is just a gigantic messy cluster field of platforms and electrical cables between them.
The only real challenge is having oxygen supply. THIS game should have been called ""oxygen not included"".

Maybe you'd love it if you were 10 years old and just wanted to dig holes everywhere. Otherwise - stick to survival craft games that are actually worthwhile... Like... Subnautica, Valheim, 7 Days to Die, Raft, Medieval Dynasty, Don't Starve, Minecraft, Terraria, Starbound...

Pros:
- The Devs Update the game pretty often, adding content/fixing bugs
- Have experienced very few bugs
- Easy to learn even if you don't go through a tutorial
- Beautiful voxel art planets and caves

Cons:
- Needs more external threats to the player character, whether that's aliens or weather to spice up the game a little
- Late game is pretty bare, other than exploration, but as said an enemy/obstacle could fix that


I'd definitely recommend you pick it up though, its worth the money.",1524468865,1695251987,True,3,2,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- Base building
- Art style
- Vehicles
- Crafting, plus Crafting Progression
- Automation
- Continuous free updates and events
- No real-time events, as in you can leave this game running in many situations without anything negative happening to you
- Controller support is good, mouse + keyboard is still better but that's normal

Cons:
- Base building - No grids + generally not much order to placement of objects

I like this game but I feel lonely (I don't have friends to play) please make a public game option to go on the server list so players from all over the world can join a remote game without having to be on a list with friends. It would be nice if we also have NPCs to help and engage us in independent play or pets.

[b]Second Review - 2021[/b]

I like this game, and I like the progress that the creators are making. The game is relaxing. The developers really listen to their players and fix bugs in the game, accept ideas. Three years ago, I asked them to add enemies to make the game a little more interesting, and they did. Unfortunately, I have more games offline than online, I have no friends who play this game, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. I'm glad they added an option for dedicated servers; I slowed down slightly with this, but it better late than never. 
What made a negative impression on me was the store they created. The idea of virtual currency and items bought with real money is a normal practice for any company, which is completely understandable. The problem with everyone is that they make their virtual currency too expensive and some items. I would be happy if the developers focus on paid items as long as they do not exceed the game's price. In my opinion, if the prices are reduced by at least 10-12%, there will be people who will contribute even more with funds!
[b]Dear creators of Astronneer, there are so many options for displaying a list of servers; please add it to the menu. Why should we look for a server on the Internet when it can be registered and displayed in a list as in most old games? [/b] 
- Thank you so much!

You're planted onto a foreign universe with the mission of exploring, gathering, mining, and vacuuming up soil like there's no end! [u]Astroneer[/u] is easy on the eyes and is truly beautiful in its simplicity. At early access I highly recommend it.

[u]EDIT[/u]: After [u]Microsoft[/u] got their hands tied with [u]Astroneer[/u] in the form of the [u]Microsoft Store[/u]; the game has received a myriad of new features, buildings, mechanics, resources, planets, goals, and quality of life improvements. It has a lovely, yet simple graphical style that can easily run on outdated hardware. Play solo, or with friends as you vacuum up soil, dig massive tunnels, gather the resources necessary to travel interplanetary, secure oxygen, explore monolithic structures, investigate scientific specimens, and bore to the mysterious cores of planets. I cannot recommend this game enough, for players seeking a relaxing, yet rewarding planetary crafting game.

For all it's beauty – there is barely any game here. It's just one fetch quest after an other without even the decency to add a zombie or two.

There are only three ways the player can die – falling damage (extremely buggy), running out of oxygen or getting hit twice by a hostile plant (which don't move and are out-ranged by the player). Getting into a vehicle makes you immune to all three and also saves the game.

Players in the community seem to keep focusing on efficiency, but this is a casual game with no loss condition. This isn't Factorio, where being inefficient leads to getting mobbed by environmentalist natives. Worst thing that can happen to you in this game is dying while running back to your corpse, but even then – that doesn't despawn your dropped gear – it just causes the map marker to vanish.

Half the game is wrangling with the terrible floaty third person MMO-type camera in extremely narrow spaces, where your character takes up the entire screen, hoping to escape to a wider area before you run out of oxygen.

The inventory system is interesting, but it takes way too many clicks to do what you want to do, making it inferior to just a simple crafting sheet. Crafting from the inventory is a particular note of complaint, because every time you click ""next"" and land on a recipe you have resources for, they get automatically swapped out of your pack/utility/tool slots, messing up the established order.

Items often glitch through the ground. It's especially bad if the game's running at higher FPS. Even vehicles are subject to this.

The soundtrack is unexceptional and uninspired.

The best part of the game are the singing pet snails, but they also give overpowered buffs to the player if fed. The buffs include infinite oxygen and invincibility, and last ten to thirty minutes. The food is also easy to get – they eat any plant you come across.

Overall, a brainless pseudo-logistics sandbox without any leviathans. Fun enough to mess around in when stressed, but will also bore in the long run. At least a third of my playtime was literally being asleep at the keyboard.",1694403016,1694403210,False,12,2,0.499351620674133301,1,True,False,False

It is a perfect balance of challenge and fun. This review does not do this game justice. I don't even know who to even describe how amazing this game is. I don't think I've ever played a game so beautiful, so perfect before. It's like re-living the best day of your life over and over again.

I first ventured into Astroneer's world during its alpha stage, and I was captivated by the promise it held. However, as time went on, I found myself increasingly let down.

The game I initially fell in love with has transformed into a buggy mess. Oddly enough, it seemed to have fewer bugs during its alpha phase. To make matters worse, many features that made the game enjoyable were removed, and microtransactions were introduced.

I must admit, I'm one of those 'cry babies' who strongly dislikes microtransactions when they are essentially abandoning content for the game. In my opinion, this game had already generated enough revenue to avoid such practices. It's disheartening to see a game with so much potential take this route.

While some argue that microtransactions are necessary to support ongoing development, Astroneer is rarely updated with new features. So, the argument that they 'need it to update the game' or 'to support themselves' doesn't hold much weight here.

I genuinely loved and enjoyed Astroneer in its early days, but sadly, it now resides in my pile of uninstalled games, unlikely to be played again. I'd rate it a 5/10, mainly because the developers seemed to turn their back on the community, leaving numerous bugs unresolved and resorting to questionable practices.",1572356446,1694358088,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are simplistic, yet cute. Gameplay is interesting, exciting and addicting.
I must admit I was a bit skeptical at first and I've had this in my library for years, until recently I gave it a try. Wow, this game did not disappoint! Highly recommended!

GOOD
- Digging for resources is satisfying, and it goes deep!
- Crafting is done through the use of printers. Interesting game mechanic.
- Modularity of the equipment is so cool. It's kinda like Legos.
- Automation systems gives lots of possibilities.
- Planets are really round. If you walk/drive in one direction, you will eventually come back to where you started. They are decent size btw.
- Travel between planets.
- Several types of vehicles, incl. a train.
- You can now start a custom game with your own planets.

BAD
- Planets are fairly empty and lifeless. Could really need some wildlife, more things to explore, more threats/challenges, etc. This is my biggest complaint. Gameplay gets a bit stale after 50+ hours.
- Camera angle can be quite clunky, especially in caves or near other objects. I wish there was an option for 1st person view.
- UI is not the best, could definitely need some improvements.
- Platforms locks/unlocks with one touch of a button. Very easy to accidently unlock.
- [spoiler] Pets are way too OP. It ruins the balance of the game. Pets as just pure companions would be much better. [/spoiler]",1694341407,1694341407,True,45,0,0.809022426605224609,0,True,False,False

Players take on the role of an astronaut who must explore and collect resources to survive and thrive on alien planets. The game features a variety of tools and vehicles that can be used to build bases, vehicles, and other structures. Players can also explore caves, underwater areas, and other hidden places to find new resources and challenges.

Pros:

Relaxing and creative gameplay
Beautiful and varied environments
Lots of content to explore and discover
Easy to learn but difficult to master
Great for solo or multiplayer play
Cons:

Can be repetitive at times
Some technical issues
Lack of a clear story or objective
Overall, Astroneer is a great game for players who enjoy exploration, crafting, and building. It's a relaxing and creative experience that can be enjoyed solo or with friends.

Here are some specific things that I liked about Astroneer:

The gameplay is very relaxing and creative. There is no pressure to do anything in particular, and you can just explore and build whatever you want.
The environments are beautiful and varied. There are a variety of planets to explore, each with its own unique look and feel.
There is a lot of content to explore and discover. There are over 100 resources to collect, and many different items to craft.
The game is easy to learn but difficult to master. There is a lot of depth to the crafting system, and it can be challenging to build the most efficient and effective structures.
The game is great for solo or multiplayer play. You can explore the universe on your own, or team up with friends to build bases and explore together.
Here are some specific things that I didn't like about Astroneer:

The game can be repetitive at times. There are a limited number of things to do, and you may find yourself doing the same things over and over again.
There are some technical issues. The game can be buggy at times, and there have been reports of crashes.
The game lacks a clear story or objective. There is no real goal to the game, and you are left to your own devices to figure out what to do.
Overall, Astroneer is a great game with a lot to offer. It's a relaxing and creative experience that can be enjoyed solo or with friends. However, the game can be repetitive at times, and there are some technical issues. If you are looking for a game with a clear story or objective, then Astroneer may not be the best choice for you.

Space Madness: Where Friends Become Frenemies
Astroneer is the game that took my friendships to new, interstellar heights! After 37 hours of playing with ""the boys,"" I can confidently say that this game is a delightful mix of teamwork, chaos, and accidental rocket launches.

Pros:

Endless Laughs: Astroneer turns grown adults into giggling school kids. Whether you're accidentally launching your buddy into orbit or suffocating because you forgot to bring oxygen, you'll be laughing so hard you'll wonder if you've been hit by a laughing gas meteorite.

Base Building Bonanza: You can build bases on alien planets, and it's like playing with intergalactic LEGO sets. Just remember to check with your buddies before you expand the base into their personal space or bury their rovers in a mountain of dirt.

Resource Hunting Shenanigans: The hunt for resources can be an adventure. You'll be digging deep, chasing elusive resources, and yelling at your friends to stop stealing your precious, hard-earned stuff!

Cons:

Resource Mismanagement: Expect your teammates to ""borrow"" your stuff without asking, leading to disputes fiercer than who gets the last slice of pizza.

Rover Racing Fiascos: Ever wanted to race rovers on an alien planet? Well, you'll quickly learn that it's a terrible idea. Your once-beloved vehicle will turn into a runaway lawnmower, causing havoc and hilarity.

The Great Oxygen Conspiracy: Accidentally running out of oxygen while exploring the deep caves is a rite of passage. You'll learn to appreciate the sound of heavy breathing more than ever before.

In summary, Astroneer is the perfect game for friends who want to test the limits of their friendships and space exploration skills. Whether you're constructing elaborate bases, engaging in epic resource battles, or just trying to survive the harsh alien landscapes, this game guarantees unforgettable adventures and non-stop laughter. Just remember to bring your sense of humor along for the ride, and may the oxygen be forever in your favor!",1694206226,1694206226,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The devs have added a ton of depth to the game relative to how it used to play, while maintaining the charming atmosphere and without putting too much pressure on the player to get super deep in the nitty gritty. I got all the achievements and 100%'d the game outside of hardcore mode and had a blast doing it!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 
----------
ASTRONEER is not the biggest and most impressive game that you're going to play in your life. 

Great, now that that's out of the way, I can tell you that despite my statement above, I believe ASTRONEER to be one of my favorite games of all time. There are few games I have played that have such wonderful atmosphere. It's one of those games that does offer hardships, but no matter what it just makes you happy to play it (only other game I can think of that gives similar feelings is Stardew Valley). I've had this game for quite awhile now, and I've been following the progress through early access to 1.0 which dropped list night. At first, the game was beautiful and fun but buggy and somewhat scarce where content was concerned. People voiced those concerns and guess what? The devs listened! They have put in a lot of hard work on a game I can tell they really love and believe in, end the results soak for themselves. If you're looking for an incredibly fun, co-operative, low-stress and entertaining space-sim/sandbox game, look no further! 

Devs I'm not sure if you guys read all of these reviews, but I just want you to know how gratifying and refreshing it is to have a team of developers who seem like they're totally in love with the game they're making, and who follow up on the promises they make. I really appreciate all the work you guys have put in, and just wanted you to know that I think you've made a really wonderful game. Thank you!

[h1] Replayability? 9/10 [/h1]
It's a sandbox game, so it all depends on how much you are willing to do with what the developers gave you. This game offer a good amount of freedom to express your creativity using automated devices and modulated vehicles. I restarted world at least 10+ times and still feel very fresh.

It is still updating, so I often come back to check them out.

No status from the developers this is being worked on. 

I would maybe recommend staying away from rail systems until you hear things are patched. 
Avoid running the rail missions until confirmed fixed.  You can play the game without those missions. 

Overall great game
hope they fix things.

I have been following this game since early access, and i have a lot to say about it. Thankfully, most of it is positive.
This is a very unique game. I have seen only a small handful of games that have the low-poly terrain structure that Astroneer has. It feels like you are inside of the imaginative space universe of a child when playing this game. Once again, a very unique feel. But i can't just list the uniqueness of a game forever. There are many other aspects, such as the very calm play style, and the greatness of multiplayer. I can't really further describe how good this game is. The only way to find out, is to play it yourself. I am aware that Astroneer currently costs 30$, but i have seen it go on sale before.

I'd give that a pass if it had a decent tutorial to get you up to speed, though.  Instead, what you get is essentially a list of goals and a set of Ikea-like instructions for how the game works.  So you go to your mission computer and it has a rewards entry saying you've been awarded an oxygenator and printer and then a mission of unpacking it.  I've no idea what an oxygenator looks like or whether the doors on the capsule you've just landed in can be opened to unpack things.  First 20 minutes were spent looking around for what I was supposed to hook up only to find that you have to accept a reward for having landed, which then beams the oxygenator in.  There's a page halfway into the instruction manual that says you have to click to get the reward but who thinks to go to the instructions for literally the first step of the game?  Wouldn't it have been pretty easy to just say ""Click x to collect reward"" on the rewards screen?  The rest of my time so far has been trying to figure out the mess of controls from goal prompts like ""Fill container with Soil"": Try sucking up soil with the gun, that doesn't do it.  Do I have to get more soil?  Do I have to hook up the container I picked up somehow?  Do I have to change a setting on the gun? No idea and the manual doesn't help.

Otherwise... Extremely fun, but hard to leave a positive review due to the issues described below.

----

Oh my god, oh my god, I want to be able to give this game a positive review. I wish I could... But I can't, and here's why.

Don't get me wrong. I love the game. I love the concept. It's really fun to play. But...

The game has been in early access since 2016 and was fully released in 2019. It's now 2023 and holy cow are there still bugs that I know have been there since day 1 (some reddit that has researched how to fix most of them will give you that info) and the devs seem to be completely neglecting it.

Super buggy. I'm talking SUPER buggy. To the point where the game can literally break and cause you to lose your mind. Here are just a few of the things my boyfriend and I encountered while playing together (as only 2 people)...

1.) He couldn't even play the game to begin with on the first install. There was an infinite loading screen issue that took us 2-3 hours to figure out how to fix the issue that required changing the game files. This has been a known issue since the release of the game and it still happens...

2.) Abundant sound, light and camera malfunctions

3.) ""Losing"" objects into the underground space (for example, placing an object on the ground and it sinks into the ground and is permanently lost).

4.) Bf was using a tractor + trailor when he was randomly launched into the air (almost into space), the tractor + trailor disappeared and landed on the other side of the planet and died and could not recover his belongings.

5.) Lots of visual glitches (for example, one of the thrusters of each other's rocket is constantly spewing fire, an enemy facility is there for one person and not for the other but still kills both people).

6.) Automatic collectors that collect things from a node where it is not placed directly (for example, the resource node from copper and resin was found and collected only resin).

7.) After activating a door, our characters start randomly scrolling (on each other's screen, but not on our own screen) and we die for some unknown reason.

8.) There are numerous performance issues on both our sides. He has a ~10 year old top-of-the-line hardware, while I have a ~2 year old top-of-the-line computer, and we both have similar issues. To solve this, we both need to turn off his fps at 60 while we both need to turn down a lot of graphics attributes and rendering attributes for the game to run properly, and I need to turn off my fps indefinitely (otherwise I get really bad FPS drops and vice versa...).

9.) Forget about using this with a controller... even though it has controller support...

10.) Automated stuff that blocks other stuff... (for example, we had a centrifuge on a platform next to the research labs. Clay nuggets were automatically placed in the research labs and could not be removed). This would be a loooot literally to everything and everything.

And soooo much more... Honestly, I'd be here forever to explain everything. Also keep in mind that the more people you play with, the more bugs increase 10x each time, and just playing by yourself has bugs like crazy.

Overall the game content is quite plentiful and quite nice, but there are some serious quality issues with this game that disappointed me, which are worth pointing out...

1.) The beginning is rough. There is very little explanation of what to do or how to use the game's controls or literally what you are doing there, why you are doing it, etc. I'm not for hand holding games but this game is definitely something else.

2.) Feels... Incomplete? I can't say for sure as I'm not 100% complete with everything (we're quite a distance away though!), but there are many things that make me go ""Hmmm""... Why didn't the developers include this?"" (e.g. more lore and handling for lore-based objects with 0 purpose or more underlying creation logic/elements).

3.) There can be no real automation masterpieces in this game. Unless I'm missing something, there are a lot of limitations on how you can automate your bases and resource gathering which is a bit frustrating.

4.) The flow of missions feels very clunky - it just feels like random ideas from the developers that were shoved into the game.

5.) Again... there are a lot of vague things in the lore.

6.) A lot of things are mislabelled, which kind of makes a difference, especially when looking for resources (for example, one planet had a resource 'in the mountains', but there were no 'mountains' on that planet).

7.) Camera control is a nightmare to learn and I still struggle with it.

And of course, there is much more in this respect too.


But yeah... I'll still play it because I want to finish it and I've paid for it, but that's something else.",1679742549,1693137843,False,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

Welcome to the mesmerizing world of Astroneer, a game that beckons adventurers to embark on an interstellar odyssey like no other.

 As the celestial curtain rises, you find yourself standing on an alien planet, its landscapes both awe-inspiring and mysterious. Towering mountains composed of iridescent crystals pierce the horizon, while luminescent flora cast an otherworldly glow across the untamed terrain. The very air crackles with a palpable sense of anticipation, daring you to venture forth and unravel the enigmas that lie hidden beneath the surface. 

Armed with your trusty astral suit and a multifunctional tool, you take your first steps onto this uncharted realm. The atmosphere hums with a blend of both trepidation and excitement, for every decision you make, every resource you gather, shapes the destiny of your voyage. The terrain manipulator in your hand becomes a beacon of progress, allowing you to sculpt the land itself to suit your needs. With every dig, carve, and reshape, you unearth a symphony of minerals – from precious ores that glimmer like stardust to exotic elements that promise untold power.

 Yet, as with any grand endeavor, challenges and mysteries abound. The very ground beneath your feet quakes, revealing underground networks of caves and tunnels teeming with danger and intrigue. The harsh elements of the alien world test your survival instincts, pushing you to adapt, to improvise, and to conquer. Mighty storms, both beautiful and terrifying, sweep across the landscape, challenging your ability to weather the cosmic tempests. 

But you are not alone in this cosmic ballet. Friends and fellow explorers, near and far, journey beside you, their astral suits glinting in the distant horizon. Collaboration becomes the key to unlocking the universe's deepest secrets. In your shared quest, you traverse the planets, each with its own breathtaking vistas and unique challenges – from desolate moons draped in ethereal light to verdant landscapes teeming with flora that pulse with life.

 The allure of discovery is matched only by the promise of innovation. As you unravel the planet's mysteries, you unearth blueprints for wondrous contraptions and vehicles, each offering a new perspective on the cosmos. The journey to the stars becomes a symphony of engineering, as you construct intricate bases that stretch their metallic arms toward the heavens, establishing beacons of humanity's indomitable spirit against the celestial backdrop.

 Astroneer is more than a game; it's an invitation to become an interstellar pioneer, a dance with the cosmos that blends breathtaking beauty with heart-pounding challenges. It's a tale of exploration, survival, and the unquenchable desire to reach beyond the stars. So, don your astral suit, wield your trusty tool, and step onto the alien stage.

Not in a bad way, This game makes missions just another way to play the game, you get rewarded heavily with schematics, utilities, anything you may need to progress in the game. An extensive amount of items you can collect, form just raw ores, to atmospheric resources.
Automation can even be interesting to get to with the update. You can get hundreds of ores to then process.

Though like any other game.. There are some things about the game that may be somewhat frustrating, First is bugs. I will say, anyone knows that bugs are not uncommon in videogames. But it seems punishing in this game. With the new update of automation came, Lots of bugs. The update could've gone through more bug fixes as auto extractors, something I found very useful using once until I found that when the extractor is done, and you pick it up, it crashes your game.
And with that, saves. You need to go in a shuttle, shelter or vehicle to save your progress. And that is something I don't do often after obtaining the portable oxygenator. I'm not close to any of those. When I pick up the extractor.. Half an hour of work dries out.

I'm not saying that saves are done wrong in this game, to the opposite. I think it's a nice detail, but it would be nice if every once in a while we had a backup when we're near to one of those things, or just idle..

Fun game, extensive (haven't been able to finish it yet), Rewarding and interesting. Though with some major impacts in progress talking about bugs.

I'd recommend this game to those who would like to find a game to play when you've got nothing else. There's lots of other things you can do, explore planets, research, obtain new resources, and etcetera. Not going much into detail of how extensive it is.

It is fun though if you do appreciate having a backup, or not losing your progress, I think you could find something similar.

The game's sandbox nature lets me shape the world around me, creating bases, vehicles, and structures as I see fit.

In the vast universe of gaming, few titles manage to capture the spirit of exploration, creativity, and cooperation as effectively as ASTRONEER. Developed by System Era Softworks, ASTRONEER presents a mesmerizing sandbox adventure that invites players to embark on an interplanetary journey filled with wonder, challenges, and limitless possibilities.

[b] Unparalleled Exploration: [/b]
ASTRONEER's greatest strength lies in its ability to foster a deep sense of exploration. The game's diverse and procedurally generated planets are a playground for discovery, each offering unique landscapes, resources, and mysteries to uncover. Whether you're spelunking through intricate cave systems, scaling towering mountains, or traversing vast deserts, every step in ASTRONEER's world is a chance to stumble upon something new and intriguing.

[b] Creative Base Building: [/b]
At the core of ASTRONEER is the art of base building. The game provides players with a wide array of modules and tools to design and construct their very own interplanetary bases. The modular nature of the construction system encourages creativity, allowing players to customize their bases to match their preferences and adapt to the challenges of each planet. From efficient power generation to resource refinement, the satisfaction of watching your base grow and thrive is immeasurable.

[b] Resource Gathering and Management: [/b]
Resource gathering forms the backbone of ASTRONEER's gameplay. The thrill of unearthing rare minerals and harnessing them to expand your base and create new technologies is a driving force that keeps players engaged. The game's resource management mechanics add depth to the experience, as you'll need to strategize and prioritize which materials to gather and how to utilize them effectively. This aspect of the game fosters a rewarding sense of progression as you unlock new technologies and capabilities.

[b] Cooperative Multiplayer: [/b]
While ASTRONEER can be enjoyed in solo play, its cooperative multiplayer mode takes the experience to another level. Joining forces with friends to explore and build together enhances the gameplay's social and collaborative aspects. The synergy of combining each player's expertise and creativity can lead to awe-inspiring bases and expeditions that are far more ambitious and enjoyable than what you could achieve alone.

[b] Charming Aesthetic: [/b]
Visual design plays a crucial role in making ASTRONEER an enchanting experience. The game boasts a delightful, low-poly art style that's not only visually pleasing but also contributes to the sense of wonder and discovery. The planets' vibrant colors and distinct biomes make each new location feel like a painting waiting to be explored.

[b] Regular Updates and Community Engagement: [/b]
One of the hallmarks of a successful game is the ongoing support from its developers. System Era Softworks has demonstrated a commendable commitment to ASTRONEER through regular updates, bug fixes, and new content releases. The developers also maintain open communication with the player community, actively seeking feedback and ideas to further enrich the game's experience. This dedication to improvement ensures that ASTRONEER remains a relevant and enjoyable title long after its initial release.

In conclusion, ASTRONEER is a captivating journey into the realms of exploration, creativity, and collaboration.

This is a good example of what early access games should strive to be, building upon the ideas and concepts along the way until it's a functional released game and barely recognizable to those who last played it in its early stages. It's a neat little game where you run around and build upon your base by getting more and more resources by pushing further and further out of your oxygenated safe zone. 
Along with Subnautica, this was one of the first games (and the 2nd of two early access games) I've ever played on my PC. I've been around since the days when the hissbines looked like weird cauldrons with glowing green stuff inside, the cables were thick pipes, and sand/duststorms raged across the planets. While it has its bugs and glitches, it's a very solid experience you can pour countless hours into, since each planet has something you need to do there. However, I will say that Vesania (OGs know it as exotic) is still lacking, since every resource you can get there is easier to obtain elsewhere. The new(ish) mission log is definitely a good addition, giving those who aren't ancient veterans a decent idea of what they ought to do next, and providing incentives for doing the things they should be doing anyway. 
I do wish there were improvements for your backpack, since you're limited on space later into the game when you're carrying pretty necessary equipment with you at all times. The same goes for the Shuttles. 
I also wish I could access the older versions through the steam properties tool, to both compare the game in the beginning to how it is now and show my friends who helped me 100% the game.
I watched the min-documentary on youtube when the game officially released in 2019 (R.I.P. Paul). At the time I got my PC and this game I had no idea what happened and what was happening to the game's team.

Gameplay loop was boring: find materials to craft oxygen poles to gather more materials to craft more objects.

Player progression: 1) advanced items were in the list of early-game unlockables, which added to the overwhelming amount of options and made it more difficult to understand the crafting system and progress through it as searching for rare materials without knowing they were rare lead to confusion in how to find them. 2) The UI was poorly designed, it separated crafting information into multiple tabs and menus, most of which were displayed on a small in-game digital encyclopedia with low contrast between the text and background

Notes:
1) The crafting system should've organized it's unlockables into simpler tech trees the started with the simplest objects to build, the easiest materials to find and the most important for player progression

2) Astroneer's gameplay should've been much less sub-terrainian: Astroneer's space-exploration theme felt poorly done as gameplay was mostly mining underground in dark caves; it's concept would have worked better if it were either a horror game or something more like deep rock galactic

I'm the type of person who will turn off hunger and thirst in survival games if possible and if the game can still be a challenge without those stressors always on your mind (like Subnautica). Was very happy to see that the only needed resource to survive is oxygen - mixed with the ability to avoid a few hostile plants and not fall to your death off a cliff/crevasse.

Where you begin with just an empty backpack and a shelter, eventually you will be flying around with jetpacks, you will be able to survive without oxygen tethers with a portable oxygenator, and you can maintain power in your backpack with a QT-RTG that provides unlimited power (eat your heart out, Palpatine). All of this makes exploration, completing your goals, and finding rare resources a lot easier. It takes a few hours of gameplay to hit that self-sustaining point, but damn, the feeling is so rewarding when you get there.

There is a very light story involved, and most of the time I saw it more as mission-to-mission instead of seeing an over-arcing grand plan. And I like it even more for that! You can approach missions in any order you want (lightly funneled through various technology tiers and unlocks) or just say ""screw it"" to any story and build the system you want. My friend and I had a blast (yes, co-op multiplayer!) getting our base as automated as possible, and no mission really makes you do that.

Overall, I recommend Astroneer.  It's worth the full price; definitely get it if it's on sale.  It is a truly relaxing and rewarding experience, both solo and co-op. The only points of frustration were if I happened to die very far away from my base while carrying valuable or rare resources. But even then, you can find your death site to reclaim the resources, and you'll learn to find ways to avoid dying (mostly).

It is a difficult game to describe being part survival and part exploration and entirely sandbox. There is a great deal of fun and satisfaction in building your base and then reaching other planets and exploring - and constructing bases - there as well. However, base building is limited to just putting together machines outside, constructing any sort of building for your machines is exceptionally hard. Missions are a nice addition both to guide you initially and to provide something to do later in the game. 

While it is still a lot of fun and there is plenty to do the game still feels incomplete despite no longer being early access. There are various types of mysterious objects lying around that have no discernible use but are clearly there for some reason - either something that is intended to come later or an ideal that was scrubbed without removing the objects.

Building on this feeling of incompleteness is the fact that there are still serious bugs with objects falling through the terrain. This seems now limited to areas where you have filled in yourself but it is beyond frustrating to have important resource canisters or storage modules just disappear from your base by falling into the caves below. Finding them can be hard to impossible and sometimes entire rovers of equipment and resources can just disappear. This has been a long standing bug and really should have been fixed by now given how frustrating it is and you cannot undo the effects of the bugs using creative mode since this blocks all achievements forever in the save which is understandable but they might want to say that BEFORE you click on it (it is very simple to do) on rather than afterwards!

Still, overall it is a fun game but the continuing serious bugs limit your fun.",1553304300,1692110461,True,0,0,0.490196079015731812,0,True,False,False

Interface is opaque, basic resources are hard to find, radius on tethers is comically low (it takes 2 packs of tethers to go more than 20 steps from the landing pod), the mission structure is frankly bizarre -- after a fairly short time you get a mission that's 'unlock smelting then smelt aluminum' with no guidance about what the unlock requirements are or where aluminum might be found, so you're just wandering around your pitifully tiny oxygen radius vacuuming up planet in your boring terraform vacuum looking for aluminum that you can't smelt because you can't unlock anything (because nobody is telling you how). Base building is completely unexplained, everything has to plug into a platform (the game does not tell you this, you just kind of have to know), and there's no way to rotate things before placing them. In a game where power cords have a fixed length, not being able to rotate things to minimize cable travel distance is just maddening.

It's a shame, because it's reasonably pretty. But pretty isn't enough to carry this sort of game.

+ Better with friends
+ Open world
+ Creative setups and base planning
+ Lots to do in the start of the game / explore & research etc.
+ Unique visuals, designs and experience playing

- After completing the game it offers very limited replayability
- Very severe stuttering
- The game is simply badly optimized

Essentially you have to drag and drop the items (or full canisters of resources) to slots on the suit or the slots on the harvester then drag it from those slots any slots on the printers or other buildings, or space capsule in order to do something with those devices. 

I built a ton of tethers like 100 of them and started snaking them all over the planet because the tether is supposed to provide oxygen while you explore the world. But even with these tethers I still suffocated to death even when I was attached to them. I couldn't understand why this kept happening losing resources each time I died. The game didn't explain that you need to snap something called an oxygenator to the tethers to make oxygen. 

In the item crafting menu I eventually found the oxygenator to build, but it requires some advanced resources and structures in order to make it. I spent a good chunk of time searching for components to build the structures that were needed for the oxygenator, turns out that my starter planet didn't have those resources available. I only found out that my starter planet didn't have the resources because a screen that I somehow got to pop up that told me what the planet had. After that first time the screen popped up, I couldn't figure out how to get it to come back up.

Eventually I found out that the first Oxygenator was something you claimed from the launchpad. And I must have missed the prompts that explained that. I only realized in my last 40 minutes of play that the launchpad is where the mission come from and that you claim the completion rewards from it. I spent most of the time between starting the game and the last 40 minutes vaporizing the terrain with Terraforming tool. It was some sort of cathartic fever-pitch kind of fun until I ended up in a cave with no way back up apart from suffocating to death.

Rather, plants that are stationary that present hazards to be wary of. Combat is not part of the game as a result, so the main draw is its stunning environments. They are very relaxing. 

A lot like Terraria in the sense that the beginner's experience is really confusing and there is little to no lore at face level until the VERY end of the game. After you learn the game though, it really sucks you in. 

Took me about 50 hours to full complete the game and get the achievements, but could probably be done faster.

Control is easy to understand even though it's a little annoying when you click LMB your character will stop moving and pointing and the direction you were clicking but overall pretty good control

Resources and Crafting may difficult to understand at first but when you're used to it it's actually very easy and for some reason I find it pretty fun

There's a lot of glitches, lag, and desync issues. Most of the time it's irritating but manageable, but there's one specific thing that has completely broken the game for me multiple times.

One of the most fun and useful modes of transport is to build railway systems. It lets you transport power, oxygen, and cargo long distances, as well as automate resource harvesting. But there's a severe glitch in multiplayer where all the rails will randomly vanish and pylons will no longer connect together, making your rail systems completely unusable. You can't even start over and place new rails, as they will permanently suffer from the same issue for that save file. I've lost so many hours of building and harvesting materials to this glitch.

Developers briefly acknowledged this glitch nearly a year ago when trains were first added, but since then there's been no mention of it or any efforts to fix it. Since then it seems like they've shifted their focus towards adding more stuff to the game, which I normally wouldn't complain about, but it comes with the cost of leaving this glaring issue unfixed.

If you're only interested in playing singleplayer, you can ignore everything else I've said in this review.  It'll feel a bit lonely, but otherwise you'll have a great time.

But the middle part is fun.

The onboarding is really terrible, I wish the developer would stop to take feedback only from veteran players on discord and sit behind a new player for 5mn to see their first-contact experience.
You're welcomed to the game with a simple screenshot of a manual page, showing you the basic commands (WASD to move, F to interact), and then you're asked to ""use the terrain tool"". And then, either you close the game and launch google to find how to use a terrain tool, or you go in settings/keyboard/mapping to discover there's a E key to open the terrain tool.
It gets even worse later in the game, when you want to put train tracks, and you need to google to understand the very obscure way: put the track in the upper slot of your backpack, and use C key if it's in the upper left slot of V key if in the upper right. Of course nowhere in the game is that explained.

But once you overcome these first inconveniences and start to master the commands, the game is actually fun to play. The missions have the exact right pace, that always give you this ""let's do one more task"" that will make you play many more hours than you initially intended.

And then at some point you'll encounter a bug, that will cause your canister full of hard earned resources to just disappear when you travel, or you'll come back to the home planet to find that your vehicle disappeared, or you'll unboard the train to be stuck inside the wall and have to respawn and loose all your equipment.
At which point you'll probably rage-quit and stop to play ;)

So all in all, a game with lots of potential, but held down by very simple details that the developer could have fixed easily.",1691405550,1691405550,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You collect materials to craft into your base and progressively work towards a bigger base or go do the main objective as you discover it. The main difference is base components are less blocky with modular platforms, you can quickly move parts around your base for efficiency or to set up automation or just build up as you go and keep up with energy demands. Another major difference, in Minecraft the main theme is being free to mine anything and set your own objectives, you look for iron to keep your tools sharp and grind certain enemies to unlock paths to the main boss. Astroneer is all about exploring, setting a number of missions you can work on at your own pace, and makes you feel powerful with your tools. The terrain tool isn't a pickaxe but a full terraforming vacuum, it needs a few upgrades underground or to make rocky mountains easier but with a soil canister it can carry you all the way to the core of the planet. After setting a basic base it's all about meeting goals to upgrade your capabilities, field bases on other planets and finding more resources and land on increasingly hostile environments. You're free to approach challenges how you want, land on a desert planet with nothing and scavenge for resources from scratch, set up a basic base like you start with on the safe planet, or drop in with a full canister of a ton of one resource missing, a variety for anything you need in a storage silo, or a shredder + trade center to cover anything you'd be missing.
It's fun to explore, lets you set your own goals and rather than just set you against difficult goals it makes you feel powerful and just need time or some strategy.  The base building isn't very pretty but it lets you set up however you want at your own pace. I think one main problem is managing electricity and oxygen which just get tedious. Set up more solar panels to do work, more batteries for when sun and wind aren't working, more solid fuel generators to jumpstart objectives, and always need compound just for a ridiculous line of tethers while you carry half your base of batteries over. It gets a little silly how much freedom you get but I do think it's fine and lets you feel very capable, do you want to set your base close to a node to get it done quicker, build generators close by, or drop in a large rover with the generators so you can ride between all the nodes quicker and use them as fast travel?",1691394200,1691394200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Had a great time exploring with my fiancee and discovering ways to customize vehicles and the base using the system the devs created. Obviously good enough to keep me coming back as long as I have, though I wish they had gone a bit further with some ideas (overly verbose thoughts on this below).

Really enjoyed feeling the thrill of managing oxygen in a custom game without the starting shelter, but not having the shelter throws off the quest progression (almost all quests are gated behind one that requires the shelter) in custom games which is unfortunate.

Automation was an interesting problem (kinda clunky system compared to Factorio's circuit system that I'm used to, but I eventually got something limping along), but also didn't seem particularly necessary? The neat way the printers attach their inputs is also a limiting factor on how many resources are required to make things, which means you really don't need a whole lot to complete the game. Exo Request rockets are another story, but are a tangential side quest from how the rest of the game plays.

The buggy things:
* Some multiplayer issues encountered, especially around one of us trying to use the crane on the back of a rover while the other was driving
* Camera gets wonky in tight spaces
* Paver only seems to work reliably with the large rover, often didn't actually create terrain with medium rover
* After permadeath game was converted to creative mode, fiancee could no longer join, so we had to completely abandon that save altogether.
* Flight paths of shuttles are, ehm, immersion breaking. Would be great if my shuttle doesn't fly through the core of the planet to reach its destination.

Other thoughts:
* Once we got to the large rover, the most efficient way to play was to just bring the rover, an RTG, drill, paver, and a pair of soil canisters to each planet, drive straight to the core, activate it, then move on to the next planet. In our new play-through we decided to ban that in favor of getting there on foot / train, and we're finding so many cool things that we missed on the first go around. There's so much exploration potential here, but the game gives you this nearly instant win button that is really hard to ignore.
* Paver attached to crane should be able to align to surface with control like terrain tool does normally. Kinda unusable pairing as is
* Would love a setting to disable vehicles providing unlimited oxygen
* Really wish that different amounts of fuel were required to get to other planets/moons, depending on distance and size of rocket. Carrying a huge payload with the large shuttle should consume more fuel to launch to orbit than launching a small shuttle, going to Desolo from Sylva should be easier than taking the flight to Desolo, etc. Aluminum and Ammonium are present on all planets so you're never truly stranded, but it's odd that a solid thruster is a round trip regardless of size of craft or distance to target. I think there's some interesting room for choices here. Possibly including booster segments that the shuttle can be attached to give you more single use lift to reach distant locations pre-hydrazine thrusters.

Large scale wishes:
* Wish there was a reason to care about shelters. Environmental hazards on planets like Atrox (radiation storm?), Glacio (some sort of deep freeze?), Calidus (sand storm/ heat wave?), etc that would require you to evacuate via shuttle if you don't have a shelter available, otherwise you would die. Admittedly not a huge penalty unless playing permadeath, but still. Would obviously need some sort of indicator that a storm is brewing with enough lead time to let the player escape or find their shelter.
* Wish Oxygen management were more interesting even once you get out of the early game. As it stands, oxygen becomes nearly irrelevant once you get vehicles, oxygenator, etc. The oxygenator should at least require power to function, vehicles could maybe have an internal oxygen tank to fill up similar to the astroneer's, but then adding tanks allow it to hold more for longer trips, or you could just bring along an oxygenator - but then it'll suck up power. Basically I want some interesting tradeoffs here, not just have the problem solve itself.",1691370314,1691370314,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Similar games I've played through that I would put on a relatively similar playing field would be Raft and Astro Colony, and while it is by no means a perfect game, that is an accolade that is very difficult to come by. In the end, I've thoroughly enjoyed playing Astroneer, would play it again, and if a sequel was ever released, I'd happily pay full price for it since I know the reward would be there and it would be (for me) money well spent.

-Seriously, the ""space"" theme here is just an idea, a minecraft modpack with dimension hopping that requires tools to merely exist without dying in said dimensions is equivalent to this game's need for oxygen. At some point I said out loud ""I need a diamond armor with feather falling III""

-This is absolutely grindy as hell, I spent way too much time just preparing the preparations to make sure I had the exclusive materials of a planet to start a base on another planet so I could prepare the next planet ""quests"" and materials to take off to the next planet, rinse and repeat sometimes in a loop back and forth if you don't materials
-If you don't have the materials to setup the scrap trading for the materials you don't have then you are stuck unable to progress on that planet and have to grind slower to get your rocket to work again to go back to starter planet. The basic thruster only has exactly 4 uses and it takes 2 to fly+land on a different planet, so one misclick and you're stuck.
-The big points for me were actually the absurd amount of bugs, client side desync that rendered tools and objects inoperable/uninteractable/invisible. Playing multiplayer made the grind slightly less but only when we went separate ways to fulfill different chores, playing together like coop should be just makes the chores harder to manage like having to keep a storage slot occupied with a Rover Seat for the other player. And sharing mission rewards (mainly the precious small RTGs) was also incovenient at times.

-Several mission trackers were not tracking correctly depending on which player fulfilled it, at the final slug mission where you put them all together the game started the long winded cutscene, it was kinda ok but then I realized that only counted 4/7, removing and re-adding a slug caused the entire cutscene to repeat AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO SKIP IT, it locked my controls, dragged my camera and forced me to watch them ""sing and dance"" all over again, and it wasn't even the correct bugged slug, as I had to unplug them all and shuffle until it counted 6/7 and then I had to watch the whole thing one more time.
-This is not a one time issue, but things that affect you player state can be game breaking, when I got the third slug for the first time I arrived in a rover and left JUST AS I GOT INTO RANGE of the interaction ritual, did the emote and captured it (""Befriended it"") and the cutscene that drags your camera and locks your controls absolutely made my rover stop working and even changed how the drill direction worked (I could somehow turn it with A and D without moving the rover as if it was in operation but couldn't actually drive it) which I fixed that weird limbo player state by restarting my whole game.
-One time I was trying to make plastic and got my chemical machine to somehow showed me ""RESOURCE1 RESOURCE2 FUEL1"" and the output was ""CARBON FIBER"", I could press the arrows and I could see the real items shuffling on the outside so the host had it working fine and my commands were working as intended, which meant only my own client side UI was messed up, I could select the correct craft by looking the ingredients on the hologram outside but I could not start it since I couldn't see the green button light up, re-joining fixed it..

-Trying to power the radioactive planet, the highest power requirement of all planets, I did a trick I read online about using the VTOL to winch a rover and drag it in the air, the thing physics was slapping my own ship, spinning violently, it constantly made the VTOL slow garbage speed even slower as it cancelled the straight forward speed buildup, it even somehow parked in midair once due to a collision from below. This was the only viable way to traverse the radioactive planet decently fast enough, after a most boring 40+ minutes I powered them all 6 and finally went to the core. Doing that for every planet quite sucked.
-There is a cash shop on this game for cosmetics, somehow, quite surprising, but at least the achievement base skins look decent enough to tell your friends apart from each other (after all of you played for long enough hours to deserve different looks).

-Everything in the game is janky, and you can feel the pure jank with physics, as every action you take is slippery, unwieldy, unstable, imprecise, and you think the endgame upgrades would make it better but no, the VTOL is pathetically slow, the land Rovers constantly get stuck on surface debris and terrain geometry, and that's it, every vehicle with sockets is just Rover with different things attached.
-Whoever designed this game deserves some praises at the bottom of this review but right now I want to talk about despawning debris, right, so, when you are driving a rover with a drill active for some reason it does not destroy some of the decorative physics props that become loose, they COMPLETELY PHYSICALLY BLOCK YOU AND CANNOT BE MOVED OR DESTROYED UNTIL THEY DECIDE TO DESPAWN ON THEIR OWN a few seconds later, and depending on the planet/cavern layer they can be massive or just very numerous to the point of incapacitating your ability to move with your rover until they despawn. (The biggest example in my mind is trying to make a surface path in Desolo (the moon), but there's just too many rocks...)(Removed ""review too long error""). Not to mention that your caravan of connected rovers always gets stuck on the smallest thing and prevents you from backing up, you would expect them to implement something to help that but no, everything is individual physics pieces, deal with it...

-When it's not an absolute frustration this game does provide some casual chill almost mindless distraction but that is only because of the ""Cracktorio"" effect, which is not a positive once you realize the game is shallow and the effect has nothing to do with the game's design intention as it was just an emergent property of my own as a player, the realization of the shallowness made all my effort feel worth less than I felt building up, 
-What drove me to play so much was the initial feelings of exploration and wonder coupled with the expectation of a factory game with a space exploration theme, but what I got was a repetitive inventory management hell. 
-At this point I only play to be a company to my friend easing his experience and preparing stuff for them, and a sunken costs of trying to finish the solo playthrough just to get to the end, as I feel ""morally obligated to finish the game to give a 'proper' review"", my friend quite liked the game though but somehow only wants to play when I am available, I wonder why /s.

+The socket system feels great design, everything is visually represented in sockets, good sounds for picking and placing things in sockets, it's awesome, but
-There are no hotkeys for inventory management, you have to click and click FOR EACH ITEM you want to move, every single time, there is no easy way to dump your inventory anywhere, shift clicking only takes TO your backpack, 
-And the snapping sometimes goes freaking bonkers all over the place EXCEPT the very top socket you are mouse over, you need pixel perfect precision sometimes, for example when having a slug in your backpack with a seed on top, you can't easily move the slug without taking the seed instead, you have to carefully pixel by pixel move the mouse to the edge where it raycasts to the hitbox of the slug AND THEN you can pick up the slug terrarium.

+(Deleted, ""review too long error"")
-Sometimes I wish a machine wouldn't just swallow an item automatically and hold on to it like a cat biting a bag of bread meme but it isn't  a problem most of the time, the only one I got mad was a research lab automatically bitten and was eating my ingots twice when I was shuffling medium storages around...",1691013861,1691013861,False,3,0,0.491691380739212036,0,True,False,False

There are a number of bugs I encountered that honestly ruined the game. But other than that the sound track is amazing and the game has beautiful graphics. The single player has no bugs at all but the multiplayer had many problems. 
The Bug List: 
Regenning walls 
Disappearing items/ lost entire inventory three times
Items in backpack overlapping
Not being able to get some achievements 
Winch not working for other player/ winch will break when I get in the rover
Player would appear in a small figure when they left the planet
My character was sent back to space losing all of my stuff about five times. 
Insta killed after falling down one foot (this happened for me about thirty times)
Space travel caused the game to lag and freeze taking the time to travel between planets take almost up to five minutes at times. 

I spent around thirty hours on this game, and every minute of multiplayer was painful...but at least I got 100%...
Update: A while back I had to log on for another two hours, just to complete two new achievements they added for it to be a perfect game again. Horrible experience.",1564453755,1690823827,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would recommend anyone to give it a shot as it's unbelieveably addicting.
There always is a sense of exploration and the unknown, being able to visit every planet in this star system to gather new resources just adds to that.

The only ""fun"" you will probably have is with the Earth-Gun which has no limit in digging and you can make some funny figures with it, that is all the fun. 
The principal is this, you dig for something 
- find that something 
- find more than you need and your finite (and not extendable) inventory space will allow you to carry (literally like 8-9 stacks max) 
- use the ones you need and just let the rest lay around to rot (the storage system is practically non-existent, and if, it is the most tedious system, mostly drag and drop) 
- then you get to the top, notice you are missing a specific resource 
- get back down, repeat. 
The only difference that can occur is that the crucial resource you need is on another planet, so you can do the same thing as above but instead of digging you sit in a spacecraft that is one miss-click away from ruining the whole game.

The crafting is boring as hell, because you don´t, you get printers which can print the needed things, this seems logical until you have so much useless stuff you simply do not need anymore to craft in the hud system and you can then sift through all of them for the desired one. 

The camera movement and placement need you to stay calm at times, because they simply don´t want to work, you will often have to twist the camera to simply load stuff onto something or worse you want to ""quickly"" get your fallen backpack so you can continue were you left. 
The biggest enemy is the oxygen, it is not challenging but a chore again, you will have to bring ""tethers"" which connect you to your oxygen, they take up a whole space in your bag and they get annoying quick. 
the camera/viewing mechanic is simply just there because they wanted to be different, allowing a 1st person view would already greatly improve the game. 
Having to click and drag to make the camera turn is so annoying, turning it off makes it worse, what was so wrong with the standard ? (you know, ego shooter standard,  WASD + mouse, if you need a cursor to click at stuff, let us use ALT or SHIFT to allow a cursor)
IT IS BORING, for that price there are so many other games out there that do a much better job at exploration, resources, crafting and interaction
I can not recommend this game at all, if you hope this is a good multiplayer game, i have to disappoint you too, you can not see anything the other does, sharing resources is tedious, and multiple people do not change the flow, dynamic or anything, the whole job is designed to be finished solo and you feel it, no sense of reward.

You are literally a garbageman in space trying to build your useless homeless shelter, which doesn´t even look good or can be customized, you will have to be happy with this very linear, unrewarding, boring, single-play game that has the character depth of a puddle.",1690742300,1690742300,False,4,0,0.463333338499069214,0,True,False,False

But the core of the experience is pure exploration - let your childlike curiosity loose to uncover the mysteries scattered across vivid alien worlds.",1690641625,1690641625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Too much clicking around on the backpack, please give me a hotkey!
Please give me an overview of the research or at least a search function!
Too few explanations, too much tabbing and google searching.
Some huge buildings you can lift, other smaller ones you can't, like a small trailer. Is it unpacked, it just stays there, it has to be connected to a rover.
I lost a RTG Generator because I put it on the slot of a drill, as soon as it starts drilling the generator gets replaced by the material. The generator gets deleted from the game. It should be possible to program in a way to that the generator just gets thrown out and falls to the ground.
Most annoying: This is a chill crafting game, survival part hardly plays a role, so why the **** is it with forced save game!?!? You cannot go back, so if you get stuck, have a bug or most typically fall in a cave, too bad!

To begin, we have the music, I think its one of the best parts of the game, it doesn't seem to play often, mostly because its action based (for the most part) but there's just something about the music, when it plays, how its made, and the setting, it all just fits together in such a perfect way. I would say I could never cry and to a soundtrack, but something about knowing this game for such a long time, being able to watch what comes out of it and see the growth, and the strength of the community, and the simple beauty of walking around the planet with such a pretty soundtrack coming through my headphones just makes me so happy and feel something else that no game I've ever played can make me think

The second reason is, the gameplay (Grinding) is something else, this game has lots to do. Sure! Go out and get minerals from the depths of the planet or find some stuff from the surface OR spend some time and automate it, speaking of as well, the automation update made everything in the game feel this much bit better than it was before. You get to choose how you wanna play the game, slow, fast, long, and now you can even make a challenge for yourself!

-Spoilers- (But also facts)

And lastly, the *ascetic* and features. The game just all fits together from the lore to the cool things you find, you could go from being on the surface just getting some resources like resin or compound, then stumble upon what you could only think is a weird purple thing, then you realize you can go to different planets! Now you found that, you try digging down a bit further than before ""Oh, theres a whole new biome and stuff down here!"" Dig further and you find the core... Leave the planet and Oh? theres a 'mysterious satellite' above the sun and hell why not be able to go into the sun, and you can! Its just so charming

I know I said lastly in my last reason, but this isn't a reason, its a thanks. From all the insperations, motivation, and all those other goofy times, whether its the cute little creatures you find or the minerals you mine. From the depths of my heart and soul, I want to thank all the comfort I have felt from playing Astroneer, its something no other game can do.

The poly art style is very cute, and the soundtrack is very mysterious and foreboding, immersing you in the adventure of the game very well.

I have owned it since 2018 and the game has gone backwards. All of the meaningful features were created back then, and nothing good has been added since.

There are no enemies or environmental hazards at all. There used to be storms like No Man's Sky, but they were removed. They used to blow loose resources around unless you had them in proper storage.

They have increased the grind by increasing the amount of resources, and putting them on different planets.

They have added features like trains and automation, but this isn't Dyson Sphere Program, or Factorio, so I don't know why you would ever need them. It's just pointless. You don't need that many resources for anything, and research points are all over the surface now, so no need to even go underground.

Keyboard/mouse controls have been sacrificed in favour of gamepad. Lots of ""Hold F"" to do anything instead of clicking an in-world button like before.

They won't add anything to the game that negatively affects Nintendo Switch performance.",1689958700,1689959064,False,28,1,0.651572227478027344,0,True,False,False

[strike] I really like this game but at some point it gets really repetitive, you dont have many dangers to keep you worried... the main danger beeing the oxygen and stationary plants, makes the gameplay style one that very ""safe"" and thus slow, and beeing honest with the imprmentation of the portable oxygen generator, pocket infinite power sources and a snail that literally gives you inmortality all of the challanges that the gameplay offered are now over and compleatly safe.  still its preatty solid; sadly the main problem is that it gets really repetitive once you completed everything; yes its fun to improve, automate an dkeep improving but thos emechanics can get really messy and your fps will suffer for that. thats another issue, the bad optimization is getting on my nerve an dthe content updates are dissapointing at best, i feel like they dont try new stuff anymore. other thta that is a very solid game with impresive graphics and honestly really fun.

i first come across astroneer in early access watching a dev VLOG on youtube, i decided to buy the game as the game seemed to have alot of potential the devs seemed really friendly and was focused on building the game from community suggestions, 

after joining the discord i soon realized the devs are incredibly friendly often reaching out to user about bugs and suggestions, 
after posting some cool screenshots in the discord the devs reached out and gave me early access to creative mode, and here i was thinking only proper content creators would get that kind of treatment. i am now moderator on the discord. 

a few years later, the game has come a long way and the devs have delivered, the game still gets updates and they are driven by community suggestions

The game doesn't allow you to host a world locally without running the server in a separate window and port forwarding... Is this not 2023? This is some playing minecraft in 2012 stuff...

Not only does it not allow you to do that, the server itself even when hosted off a 3rd party dedicated server platform is unstable and needs to be restarted once every 1-2 hours in order to stop vehicles from just glitching into the center of the planet when you try to get in it...

I've spent maybe half of my game time just re-doing things that were lost because for some reason the server decided to not save, or the autosave interval was 5 minutes before one of our vehicles flew into the stratosphere and disappeared.

Its just insane that I can't fire up a world and have my friends join me off steam in a game thats been out this long. MP was a clear afterthought, and I'm sure people are going to say ""oh well it wasnt intended to be a MP game"" well, then dont release a half-baked version of MP...

in the 5 minutes since i posted this review, my game crashed because i tried to get out of my vehicle while moving... I literally am never touching this game again after im done with this session.

From the moment you crash-land on a colorful and alien planet, you'll find yourself digging, building, and exploring with childlike enthusiasm. The game's beautiful art style is like a breath of fresh oxygen in space, captivating your imagination as you uncover the secrets of the cosmos.

The gameplay mechanics are as smooth as a zero-gravity float, allowing you to shape the terrain and uncover valuable resources. However, there are moments when the controls can feel a bit clunky, especially during precision placement of objects or maneuvering complex machinery. A little fine-tuning in this area would make the experience even more enjoyable.

You'll dig through caverns, searching for those sweet, sweet bytes to unlock new technologies. It's like being a space-faring Indiana Jones, except with fewer boulders and more adorable space rovers! However, the progression system could benefit from more clarity and guidance, as it can be overwhelming for new players to understand the optimal path forward.

Speaking of rovers, you'll have a blast constructing vehicles to traverse the treacherous terrain. It's like being a futuristic stunt driver, performing flips and tricks across the craters. Just don't forget your space seatbelt—safety first, even in the vastness of the galaxy! However, the vehicle physics can be a bit wonky at times, leading to unexpected flips or getting stuck in the landscape. A touch of refinement in this area would greatly enhance the driving experience.

But Astroneer is not just a solo adventure; it's a cosmic party waiting to happen. Grab your friends and embark on cooperative missions together. There's nothing like laughing together as you accidentally launch each other into orbit or get tangled in a mess of tethers. However, the multiplayer experience can suffer from occasional lag and synchronization issues, impacting the overall enjoyment. Some dedicated attention to optimizing the netcode would make the cooperative play even more seamless and immersive.

In conclusion, Astroneer is a stellar experience that catapults you into a world of adventure, friendship, and laughs. It's like a moonlit picnic with a side of interplanetary exploration. While it has a few rough edges that could benefit from some polish, the overall experience is still immensely enjoyable. So buckle up, grab your jetpack, and get ready to reach for the stars!

Rating: ★★★★☆
Astroneer is a launchpad of joy and hilarity that will keep you entertained for light-years to come. With a bit of refinement in certain areas, it has the potential to become an intergalactic masterpiece.""",1689459005,1689459296,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Astroneer is a wonderfully tranquil game that offers simple mechanics while still presenting enough complexity to keep players engaged. Its development tree is impressively deep, providing a stimulating sense of progression. Despite the absence of NPCs, stories, guests, or enemies, there is always something to do.

The user interface can be a bit frustrating initially, but once you get used to it, it proves to be practical. One notable drawback, however, is the difficulty in smoothing the terrain. It would greatly benefit from a tool or mode that allows for the construction of floors with different colors and textures, aligning seamlessly with the planet's curvature.

One of the game's strengths lies in its diverse range of planets, each offering unique challenges. Occasionally, more helpful information or guidance regarding specific objects or machines on these planets would be appreciated.

Adding a touch of lore to the experience could further enhance the game. While the absence of traditional storytelling elements is intentional, a bit of background narrative would add depth and immersion.

The game's assortment of vehicles greatly contributes to its overall entertainment value. Similarly to the terrain, having the ability to construct pathway blocks that conform to the planet's circumference would be a welcome addition.

TL/DR: Astroneer is a relaxing game with simple mechanics that still manage to provide a satisfying challenge. Although lacking NPCs, stories, guests, or enemies, it remains engaging with a deep development tree. The user interface can be frustrating, particularly when trying to smooth the terrain. More assistance and lore would enhance the gameplay. The variety of planets and vehicles keeps the experience enjoyable. Overall, Astroneer offers a tranquil yet stimulating gaming experience.

But it's also very tedious.

Every task involves so many steps and fiddling around that it felt like chores. It almost appears that the game was designed to make most basic tasks as hard as possible for the player. Each progression step will only give the player a possibility to make it just a [i]tiiiny[/i] bit easier, while introducing new hurdles at the same time.
Then there are literal setbacks, e.g. when you're forced to travel to a different planet for obtaining a new resource and start a new base from scratch. With the tier 1 rocket it isn't even possible to attach any built machines or even travel with a coop buddy. And the limited fuel (which requires resources to craft) pretty much eliminates the option to make multiple trips back and forth.
While the UI is very beautiful and immersive/consistent, it is extremely cumbersome. Finding a specific machine inside the four different printer categories and indistinguishable sub-categories is pure torture. Why they haven't even designed different category icons (like ""Power"", ""Vehicles"", ""Storage"", etc.) is beyond me. Every sub-category is just a generic dot with no label or tool tip.

The final nail in the coffin for me was when I figured out how limited automation is in Astroneer. For the longest time I thought that eventually I'll be able to eliminate most of the tedious tasks, like constantly searching and collecting natural resources, by building automated factories. After failing to figure it out I looked up some automation guides on YouTube and was disappointed how even the jankyiest automation builds still required some manual input (like collecting soil for the Soil Centrifuge).

I could go on an on with these minor annoyances: Small inventory sizes, lack of proper resource storage, fiddly building, long printing times, machines requiring additional base platforms for placement, no UI to see power consumption/generation...

Most of these can't even be considered design flaws (except the UI sub-categories), as they all follow this consistent concept, which is probably what the game is all about. It's just not for me.

If you like to spend dozens of hours farming resources in beautiful, calming environments and slowly build up bases piece by piece, this game might be for you, though.",1688569228,1689196666,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The terraforming mechanics have the potential to hold a creative individuals attention for quite awhile.

A mediocre mish-mash of Satisfactory gameplay, DRG graphics, and Outer Wilds exploration, this game does all of them poorly.

There is nothing redeemable about this game, and nothing fun. It is a complete chore to play. Every single quest felt more like a chore rather than something that really leads into something else. There is a severe lack of meaningful progression. A severe lack of a focused style. A severe lack of ANYTHING. Not even the music was good.

Every planet and celestial body you encounter is a visual feast, with a remarkable attention to detail that makes you want to explore every nook and cranny.

Exploration lies at the heart of Astroneer, and it's an absolute joy to traverse the diverse landscapes, uncover hidden mysteries, and unearth precious resources. From vast desert terrains to eerie underground caverns and even the vast expanse of space, each location is filled with surprises and challenges waiting to be conquered. The sense of discovery is truly enthralling, as you never know what wonders or obstacles lie just beyond the horizon.

The game's emphasis on creativity is truly commendable. Astroneer offers an impressive array of tools and gadgets that allow you to reshape the environment to your liking. Sculpting the terrain, building intricate structures, and setting up sprawling bases becomes an addictive form of expression. The sheer satisfaction of transforming a barren landscape into a thriving outpost is incredibly rewarding, and it fuels your desire to push further and unravel more of the game's mysteries.

Astroneer's cooperative multiplayer mode adds an extra layer of excitement and teamwork to the experience. Collaborating with friends to explore distant planets, coordinate resource gathering, and construct ambitious projects amplifies the game's sense of camaraderie. The shared journey becomes an unforgettable bonding experience as you conquer challenges together and celebrate each triumph.

What truly sets Astroneer apart is its sense of wonder and limitless potential. Whether you're constructing intricate machinery, establishing interplanetary transportation networks, or unraveling the secrets of the universe, the game constantly pushes your boundaries and encourages your imagination to soar. It beautifully captures the essence of space exploration and leaves you in awe of the vastness and mystery that lies beyond our Earthly confines.

In conclusion, Astroneer is a remarkable game that excels in every aspect it sets out to conquer. Its mesmerizing visuals, captivating gameplay, and unbounded creativity make it a true standout among its peers. If you're a fan of exploration, resource management, and the wonders of space, Astroneer is an absolute must-play. Prepare to embark on an extraordinary astral journey that will leave you enchanted and longing for more.",1688668517,1688668517,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Pros: Solid game, can run on a wide variety of machines. Most space exploration games are gritty and dark (nothing wrong with that, just not my preference), but this has bright colors and cute slugs, making it more appealing to a wider audience. I’ve played since Early Access—the game hasn’t changed a lot, but it was already good at its core. Cave system is easily a 10/10.

Cons: More fun as co-op than single player.  Certain tasks require special tools and an excessive amount of time—this, as well as certain controls, have to be explained by another player (which somewhat undermines the broad appeal). The tutorial could use a lot of improvement.",1688619569,1688619569,True,45,1,0.790725409984588623,0,True,False,False

He was always busy with work and I felt like he didn’t care about me. I grew up resenting him and avoiding him as much as possible.

But then I discovered this game. I decided to give it a try and invited my dad to play with me. He was hesitant at first, but he agreed to give it a chance.

We started playing and something amazing happened. We started talking. We started laughing. We started bonding. We learned more about each other and we realized that we had more in common than we thought. We shared our stories, our dreams, our fears, our hopes. We became friends!

We played the game every night for a month. We completed the main story and all the side quests. We explored every corner of the game world and we enjoyed every moment of it. We had fun.

My dad got sick and he passed away. It was sudden and unexpected. It broke my heart.

But I’m grateful for the game. It gave me the opportunity to reconnect with my dad before he left. It gave me the chance to say goodbye and to tell him that I love him. It gave me the best memories of my life.

This game is more than just a game. It’s a gift. It’s a miracle. It’s a masterpiece.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a meaningful and emotional experience with someone they love.

Everything in the game has a sort of feedback to it. Every step has some sort of animation or sound or SFX that really makes you feel like you are involved in what is happening. It all feels very satisfying.

The voxel digging is smooth and leads to really cool building (once, built a sky-bridge completely around the equator of a planet). You'll probably smile when you learn you can slide for the first time, and then realize you can build a huge ramp for a fun time.
The game really expands from there. Every step in the game leads to another step and another goal, which is amazingly well puzzled together.

As you get further in the game and start to unravel the mysteries, you really start to experiment and try new things. More often than not, you are validated with a success.

The major updates since 1.0 have only made the game better. Missions and creatures are amazing and really help fill up any minor empty space in the progression. Also, the new compass was the greatest thing to ever happen to this game!

My only gripe is the UI is a little hard for people to learn for the first time. However, once you have played for any amount of time, it does start to become second nature, and makes a lot of sense.

There is something so immensely satisfying with how tactile everything is.

The art design... what can I say.... It's some of the finest work I've ever seen in gaming. Simple yet, jaw droppingly gorgeous. I gotta give homage to the original art designer Paul Pepera, may he rest in peace and his beautiful imagination be immortalized within this game. 

This game has something for everyone really. From exploring and navigating dangerous environments. to building your base and maintaining your resources. Building and driving wild exocraft, or shooting off into the stars to explore a new planet.

Having spent 117 hours navigating through the different celestial bodies and innovating within the vast sandbox it provides, I can wholeheartedly recommend Astroneer as a must-play for any fan of exploration, survival, and sandbox games.

Astroneer plunges you into a vibrant and richly hued universe filled with distinctive planets to explore and mysteries to unravel. The serene yet captivating beauty of these procedurally generated environments makes the exploration experience truly immersive and awe-inspiring. From the green plains of Sylva to the desolate landscapes of Desolo, each planet holds its own charm and unique set of resources and hazards.

The core mechanic in Astroneer revolves around terraforming - the ability to alter the environment by digging, elevating, or flattening terrain. This mechanic is not just a tool but an integral part of gameplay, allowing you to shape your surroundings to your will, whether you're digging for resources, building a base, or sculpting a mountain just for the sake of it. This mechanic is incredibly satisfying and grants players an enormous amount of freedom in interacting with the world.

Resource gathering and crafting play a central role in Astroneer. Resources are plentiful, yet are spread out and often hidden beneath the surface, prompting you to venture out, explore, and extract. The game's crafting system is both intuitive and expansive, encouraging you to progress by building increasingly complex items and structures. This progression system, though not explicitly defined, guides you naturally towards expansion and technological advancement.

Base building in Astroneer is an exceptionally rewarding experience. There's a wonderful sense of accomplishment that comes from transforming a small landing pad into a sprawling, resource-processing, research-generating facility. The ability to design and organize your base layout as you please adds an additional layer of personal touch to the game.

One of Astroneer’s strengths lies in its multiplayer functionality. Teaming up with friends to tackle projects or explore uncharted territories adds a new layer of fun and camaraderie to the experience. Cooperation becomes key, turning complex tasks into fun, group activities.

The game's art style is refreshingly unique - a beautiful blend of stylized visuals and vibrant, saturated colors. This, combined with the serene, ambient music and satisfying sound effects, creates a whimsical atmosphere that still feels intrinsically sci-fi.

The controls and interface of Astroneer deserve praise for their simplicity and ease of use. However, like many sandbox games, Astroneer has a learning curve at the beginning, but once mastered, the controls feel intuitive and responsive.

On the downside, there can be occasional performance issues, especially when exploring large, complex caverns or running a heavily developed base. However, these are relatively infrequent and, given the game's many strong points, are minor drawbacks.

Astroneer is a game about exploration and creativity. It doesn't rush you with timers or overwhelm you with threats. Instead, it gives you a set of tools and systems, and then sets you free in a universe filled with possibilities. For its rewarding exploration, its unique and satisfying terraforming mechanics, its vibrant and relaxing atmosphere, and its well-executed multiplayer mode, Astroneer is a truly exceptional game that I highly recommend to other players.",1545778747,1687931933,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

one thing keeping me from playing is the fact that i cannot drive tractors. regardless of what i do, if i press a button to move it, it instead starts doing backflips in the air. if it flips over, i press the flip button and watch as it flips me back over, shakes a bit, and then launches me in the air. if this was to be fixed, i would have no complaints about the game.

You have a tech tree you need to advance up, and exploration you need to do, but you generally don't need to mass produce anything.  Your bases usually end up with one or two of each building type, with the one exception being storage but storage buildings are relatively cheap to construct.

This is in notable contrast to most building games where advancing through the game usually means producing many orders of magnitude more resources, and often without significantly better tools to do so.

EDIT: Was a kid when I reviewed this game here is something more appropriate.

Back in the day (Around 2016 or 2017) This game was released onto steam for early access. Although there was not much to do in terms of progression and story. The game was certainly interesting because of how it created a unique system of exploration and crafting in a simple form. 

The game now is fully released and is still be updated with new features. Obviously at a slower pace than what it used to be. There's plenty to do and theirs now a story to follow. Over the years of changes the game is a bit more complex yet still manages to keep its simplicity over the years. There's finally a goal within the game and there's so much more to do. the game focuses more on survival within the planets themselves. Each planet having unique resources and different gases from one another. Some may have the same while others would be unique. Exploration is a key component in the game rather than focusing on survival. if you like environments and easy going game play as well as just the game being Sci-Fi then this might be an easy grab for you.

Very fun - the biggest factor I believe is that the game is on the easier side. Overall very chill, if you don't want to fight something you can just run away as all enemies in the game are plants, and generally not too hard to defeat.
Having a lot of fun with friends on it right now.

Sometimes this game can be a buggy mess, though, especially on one of my older save files, where I constantly get stuck on absolutely nothing on certain planets (atrox, glacio)

Be warned that when underground this game is a permanent fight with the camera, and the rover jank... Well, you'll have to see.

Trains are 10/10 btw. Very smooth and well done.

You will get high-centered in rovers. A lot. And your tractor will be stuck hanging off a cliff.

Mining is fun and a lot of visual elements are absolutely beautiful (Cores and Sylvia deep underground to name a few)

As others have pointed out, one of the biggest factors especially in all parts of the game is storage capacity.

#Slow map rendering. (Falling through the map again)
#Items and buildings flying up to the air at random or bouncing.

And the biggest one for me, every vehicle jumps in the air or flip on its head when you enter or leave them.

I do get new content in the game is great, but please fix the bugs first. Nothing will ruin a great gaming experience more then, bugs that halts your progress by bugging out.

Its unique art style and immersive gameplay mechanics offer a refreshing experience, although a few minor drawbacks prevent it from reaching its full potential.

One of the standout aspects of Astroneer is its breathtaking visual design. The colorful and vibrant landscapes of various planets are a treat for the eyes, and the attention to detail in the environmental design is impressive. The game's art style strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and depth, creating an otherworldly atmosphere that draws players into its vast, uncharted universe.

The core gameplay mechanics in Astroneer are engaging and offer a sense of freedom and creativity. The ability to shape the terrain, gather resources, and build intricate structures fuels the spirit of exploration and provides a satisfying sense of accomplishment. The inclusion of cooperative multiplayer further enhances the experience, allowing friends to collaborate and tackle the challenges together.

However, Astroneer does have a few minor hiccups that can occasionally detract from the overall enjoyment. One such issue is the occasional lack of guidance or clear objectives. While the game encourages exploration and discovery, some players may find themselves unsure of what to do or where to go next, leading to moments of confusion or aimlessness. A more structured progression system or additional in-game hints could help alleviate this potential frustration.

Another aspect that could benefit from improvement is the game's performance and optimization. While Astroneer runs smoothly for the most part, there are instances where frame rate drops or occasional glitches can momentarily disrupt the immersion. While these occurrences are infrequent and don't significantly impact the overall experience, they are noticeable enough to warrant mention.

Despite these minor shortcomings, Astroneer remains a captivating adventure that offers a unique and immersive gameplay experience. Its stunning visuals, open-ended exploration, and cooperative multiplayer make it an excellent choice for those seeking a tranquil and creative journey through the cosmos. With continued updates and refinements, Astroneer has the potential to become an even more remarkable and polished experience in the future.",1686955022,1686955022,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b]Gameplay: 1/5 [/b]
Exploring the landscape, collecting resources and crafting new equipment is initially very fun although quickly becomes repetitive. Mechanics (such as carrying large items) are interesting at first but unfortunately become mundane and irksome as the game progresses. The main aspect in which the game falls down however is the story (or lack thereof); there aren't really any clear goals to progress towards. I suppose that makes the game ideal for players that prefer sandbox but isn't suited to me personally. 

[b]Graphics and Atmosphere: 4/5[/b]
Aesthetics is one aspect in which ASTRONEER excels. The environment is bright, colourful and endearing. The planets feel unique and full of life due to the lively colour palettes - even when playing alone.

[b]Performance: 2/5[/b]
When playing I have encountered some bugs. Most don't have a large impact on gameplay but are nonetheless bothersome (e.g. weird item physics and equipment clipping through the ground). Optimisation was unfortunately not great either, with FPS falling considerably during multiplayer. With that being said, it has been a while since I've dedicated any real time to the game so some of these issues may have been addressed.

[b]Recommendation: Not worth the price point.[/b]",1619551617,1686787869,False,3,0,0.506922423839569092,0,True,False,False

Player can almost skip medium modules because in few hours he will be able to afford big ones. And there is almost no threats to the player.

Edit:
Had to change my vote on this game for two reasons:
1) After playing some more it looks like automation has no real uses in this game, especially that devs keep adding quests and not reasons to automate stuff. The only thigs that you need automation is to sort items but it is way overcomplicated just for that task (and even then it's not fully automated) and second thing is that you print items just to scrap them to get other resources from shop. It's just bad. 
2) Pride month. Keep this in your pants and away from children. Tolerance does not mean that you have to tolerate everything, especially things that you don't agree with and know that are bad.",1684067583,1686483760,False,0,0,0.477815687656402588,0,True,False,False

But after the Xenobiology Update; the Galastropods makes only one player op with all of them equipped, but requires plant seeds in order for the effect to go on (unless applying their ""favorite food"" to their stomachs to extend the duration) so that it could make the game more easier for some reason...

But however; If you really want to enjoy this game, better try doing a solo run instead of having to look for people. (Trial and error exists)

Edit a few playthroughs later: This game is so fucking jenky and not in a good way, it genuinely takes from the experience. There have been bugs that I constantly run into that have been in the game since I got it (check review date).

Astroneer held a two week long in game event for cosmetics.  Imagine my surprise when AFTER the event had concluded they post on their Discord asking players ""Why you decided to skip the event?"" which ran from March 15 to June 1, 2023.

The only Steam community post prior to the event running was on March 13, 2023 for patch notes which had no mention whatsoever of an upcoming event.

Honestly if the developer is going to treat their customers like this, save your money and spend it elsewhere.

Edit:  On June4 , 2023 the developer had their Discord Administrator delete all valid criticism about their handling from Discord.  The complaints were valid and civil yet this developer has chosen to delete and hide issues instead of admitting fault and planning to do better.

I love this game to bits but it's the most visually messy experience I've ever had.
And I'd like to start with the bad before I get down to the good about this game.

Unlike other ""factory games"" this one neither has a neat grid nor any type of foundation to snap to.
Best you can do is place a bunch of tables next to each other in a gridlike pattern, but even then what you end up seeing is various sized and shaped tables with all sorts of mess on top.

The backpack is small, and there are no chests. There are only tables, which add to the mess when you try to store unique or rare items, and silo containers which can store a lot of a single resource but that still means you need to have at least one if not many for each item you have. Essentially I'd describe the capacity of a single silo storage container as what you'd get in a single stack in a single inventory slot in any other game.
(A little exercise: Imagine your typical inventory laid out in front of you as a large tower of resources for each inventory slot you have. Messy, isn't it?)

Late game is especially hard to me for that reason, whenever I think up what I need to pick up I end up forgetting halfway through my way down the factory. It's pretty discouraging to me and the best way I can deal with it is to play coop and have people do some things or bring me stuff before I forget.
(I would assume this game might be a pain to people with OCD too but I wouldnt know about that)

Also, even the list of minerals and resources looks like pamphlet art rather than just a list of available stuff. Terrible.

[h1]Actualy non-ADHD bit you might be looking for[/h1]
Aside from that complaint the game is a lot of fun. It creates its own challenges and limitations for you to go around.

The automation kicks in pretty late in the game so you usually end up automating the simple things through the early and mid game, unlike Satisfactory or Factorio where it's the core gameplay. Main focus is on manual harvest of resources. Actually a little problem I have with the game, once you can finally automate mining the resources tend to dry up a little too fast to make it worth all the setup. Then again, that could be on account of everything taking a little too long for me since this game is excellent at jamming up the executive functions.

This game is more aimless than other factory games but it tries to give you options via the constantly updated quest system and interactive objects found throughout the planets. There's no clear end goal or milestones, you just do stuff, always being one step further than the moment before, until eventually you get an idea of what might have to be done. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who you are.",1684911854,1684912026,True,36,7,0.733555078506469727,0,True,False,False

First, who in their right mind thought holding down rmb to spin the camera, instead of just moving the mouse, was a brilliant idea? Well there must've been at least one person working on the game that thought that, because there's a toggle for it, except the toggle is just as bad. Why? just f'ing why?! honestly. seriously. Almost every third person game operates the same for the same reason that wasd does, it's time-tested. To make matters worse, my damn cursor disappeared and I couldn't interact with the damn mission log thing. And the ""tutorial"" let's not even talk about the fact it tells you to connect the power to the oxygenator. You look around the stupid base to find a power cable, and think ""Ok great, I found where the power cable is, I just now need to hook it up to the oxygenator."" Nope, you slot the damn thing into the base's cut-out. Brilliant. Just brilliant. First the wording: ""Connect the oxygenator power to the shelter"" Not ""Connect the shelter power to the oxygenator"" then there's no real cable connection done, it's just plug the damn thing in. *slow clap*   How in the hell did this game ever get the traction it did?? Maybe I'll try giving it a second chance at some point, but wow that first 16 minutes was a SERIOUS struggle that shouldn't have been lol     I should've known something wasn't quite right about the damn game when the menu interface was designed the way it was and then find out that it the very first icon on the menu is to a store to buy outfits.... get fucked SES. seriously.

Initially discovering it on Xbox, I quickly developed a deep affection for the game, leading me to purchase it on Steam as well.

Astroneer's unique and captivating gameplay provided me with a much-needed escape from reality. The game's premise revolves around space exploration and colonization, allowing players to embark on exciting interplanetary adventures. The freedom to shape and mold the environment, uncover valuable resources, and build intricate structures offered a sense of accomplishment and creativity.

One of the aspects that struck me the most was the game's charming visual style. The colorful, minimalist graphics combined with the whimsical character designs created a visually pleasing experience. Exploring the diverse planets and encountering their distinct landscapes was truly awe-inspiring.

The cooperative multiplayer feature of Astroneer deserves special mention. Being able to collaborate with friends or other players online enhanced the enjoyment even further. Together, we embarked on daring expeditions, shared resources, and tackled challenges as a team. The sense of camaraderie and shared accomplishments added depth and longevity to the gameplay.

The game's progression system was well-balanced and rewarding. As I expanded my base and acquired advanced technology, new possibilities and opportunities opened up. Unveiling the mysteries of the universe and unlocking new abilities kept me engaged and motivated to keep exploring.

The atmospheric sound design of Astroneer was another standout feature. The tranquil background music, coupled with the subtle ambient sounds of the planets, created a serene and immersive experience. It added a layer of tranquility and relaxation to the gameplay, allowing me to unwind and find solace during a challenging time.

In conclusion, Astroneer has been an incredible companion and source of joy during a pivotal period in my life. Its captivating gameplay, delightful visual style, cooperative multiplayer, and soothing sound design all contributed to its appeal.

I highly recommend that people try this beautiful game out
Some people who have played this game might disagree on some points, although I will address my reasoning.
Graphics:
The graphics isn't anything like 4K or that, but the way it is formed is exceptionally made.
The way the game is randomly generated through out every single save just amazes me.
I just genuinely love the way the game uses triangles so nicely to fit the ground, mountains and the uniqueness that the buildings look from the nature and caves.
Gameplay:
The gameplay can mesmorize You for hours at a time, I often remember playing this game when I was younger and just enjoyed the game. Exploring, trying not to die from suffocation and playing it the basic way.
Audio:
The music in this game is extremely well to fit with the space theme and just the fact that it sounds so simple but yet so elegantly with the game amazes me.
Audience:
I played this game when I was really Young and I was able to get quite far, and now me being quite far into my teenage years I am still able to enjoy the game as it is. The game fits for children, teens and adults because I know a lot of people who play this game for what it is. It is simple yet elegantly set up to work for young people and decently old people.
PC Requirements:
You dont need a good computer to play this game, it is simply made but as I have stated multiple times it is simple but elegant. The game uses the most of what little it has and has different settings for different computers. Even customisation options for FOV and different stuff like that. (Which most games have)
Difficulty:
It is not hard to learn the game. (Especially with the new'ish ""tutorial"" they've set up)
They made it so that You can go through the game with an idea of what You have to do and rewards You for doing so which is nice for the newbies. (Although I kind of liked it before)
Grind:
I wouldn't call it a grind but in certain cases You just have to work to gather some extra materials for something You wish to build. You could also do a lazy method which is really easy for experienced players but I'm not gonna go into that.
Story:
I'm not gonna reveal that, play for Yourself to find out. But I wouldn't call the story THAT important to the gameplay.
Game Time:
The game time to ""complete"" the game is average although the enjoyment of using new tricks You found out is immeasurable to what You did last time.
Price:
Get, it good
Bugs:
There aren't any really noticeable ""bugs"" but clients sliding really fast forcing the host to load the area can take some time and therefore make the client no-clip into the ground causing You to die and probably lose some decent/good stuff. Some mild bugs but they are not game-breaking or anything like that but mildly annoying.
? / 10:
I genuinely love this game; Go get the game and try it.

Other notes:
I got this game within the early Pre-alpha release and the game has grown TREMENDOUSLY. The devs in System Era have been hard-working since the start with no signs of slowing down! They have fun events that rewards You for doing what You maybe could call ""mini-games""? Well anywho, this is the end of my review and You should get it.

The ONLY thing I dislike is the shop feature where You can purchase skins. Other than that, this game is lovely.",1572538288,1684511913,True,2,1,0.53436809778213501,0,True,False,False

 Camera is there to make your life miserable. Controls doesn't make any sense, we have many keys on keyboards, why can't they use different bindings for different things? It feels like a console port that shoves gamepad controls down our throat. Same thing with vehicles, why do I have to aim with camera? How does that make any sense?? I can't see where I'm driving because I have to clip camera through the containers in my trailers, did they even test this?

 I thought game would get more enjoyable as I progress, but it just became bigger chore. I have to travel to other planets just to get 1-2 materials that can be gathered there. You'll have to keep doing this, or trade for ridiculous rates. It turns out to be an awful grindfest. Besides, you'll just keep doing same things  on each planet, so traveling to other planets doesn't feel like a new experience, they are all same, only change is terrain, how you get energy and unique materials. 


 You can't make proper shapes with your tool, so you'll most likely just make a flat ground and dump everything there. You won't have rooms or cool buildings. There is almost no room for creativity. Storing materials is a challenge, you might easily give up on it and just leave everything on ground, which will just escalate the problems you are having already. I have to put 32 materials by hand in one container, alternatives are not really great. Like I said, automation doesn't work in this game. You are going to clean your own mess, swapping storage are fastest method usually.

 Crafting is a chore, since automation sucks balls in this game, you'll prefer to do most things manually most likely, which comes with tons of waiting. Btw, why the hell every auto arm can use my inventory? Why there isn't any option to turn that off? Because there is no UI in this game, they forced so hard to leave UI out of it, game became unplayable. There is a reason why every game has a UI, this game is absolutely not an immersive one either, so I don't have any idea. I'm sure it cost them a lot, leaving UI in an 'automation' game. It's hard to call this an automation game, but it's hard call this anything other than too, it's just doesn't fit any genre properly. Lack of UI and the camera is biggest downfalls of this game, along with slow and linear gameplay.

Game especially feels like a joke after you unlock Large Rover and attach Drill+Paver. It's obvious they didn't think this through since you'll constantly have swap drill with paver, to do this you'll have to get of the rover and switch their places, get in, put down some pavement, get out and switch again. Exploring with vehicle feels punishing, it's not even slightly enjoyable. Not to mention you'll get motion sick while getting in and out of vehicle since it keeps rotating the camera EVEN THOUGH I'M TRYING TO CONTROL THE CAMERA MYSELF, which makes camera spin. Why my controls doesn't prevent camera from automatically trying to adjust?? Camera is the worst enemy.

Another thing is, while I'm collecting materials, if my inventory is full, material ejects itself out of my characters ass(which is the lowest point on player inventory), which usually clips through the ground if I'm on an angled surface, which causes it to go down until it finds a space in the terrain, and it ends up in several layers below from where I'm standing. We can say it just disappears, that is so stupid. Did you open your inventory while collecting materials? Excessive materials will shoot through the camera, land on a random spot behind you. Fun times.

Having no UI will result in randomly opening your inventory and your inventory getting stuck in terrain in tight spots. Your inventory has lesser priority than terrain, how the hell does that make any sense? I'm stuck in a hole, I can't use my inventory, I can't see anything, all I can do is randomly dig, hoping to make a room for my camera and inventory.

This game need tons of QoL updates before it becomes playable in long term. Please, please please just go play Dyson Sphere Program, since there is almost no survival elements, just play a perfect automation game with interplanetary resource transfer system and much much more. They should remove other planets, they are just there to add grind element. In any case this game doesn't deserve this price. I bought it on %55 discount and I still regret.

Pros:
 I really like the exploration/resource collection loop
The story quest: I waited until recently to finish the main story goals. Doing everything at once after knowing so much about the game; it was actually pretty fun and wasn't as much of a grind as It seemed from what I read in the guides.

Cons
The tech tree is a little short, since all you need is a small shuttle to go to the outer planets and get infinite research points and any resource you need in the game.

The whole system of resources and research isnt documented and you end up needing to go to wikis and YouTube every few minutes to search for any little nugget of info.

Servers: Never played in multiplayer yet. I don't like collecting friends on Steam and don't have any regular players I communicate with outside of other games with dedicated servers. Speaking of which, I have attempted several times to connect to dedicated servers and its just not worth the trouble of finding a list, it being outdated and there being no matchmaking system to find servers that are open to the public and actually online.",1554574909,1684468591,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game gives you a great sense of progression, yet the feeling of not even have scratched the surface of discovery at the same time. The only downside is that the game is quite grindy to progress, as I have spent at-least 15-20 hours alone farming and grinding materials, research, and exploration, BUT have never gotten bored and always look forward to it again.

Then you get a vehicle than can dig tunnels, but the direction is controlled by where you are looking. Now  you have to drive blind because, once again, the third person camera means that your view is entirely blocked by objects that are not in front of your character's face.

Every problem with this game could be solved by making a first person/third person toggle key and allowing the player to choose which is right for them based on context. Instead, the developers adamantly refuse to add a first person capability, no matter how broken that leaves their game.

Думал, что это хорошая идея, даже отличная! Мы начали подготовку. Это чудо-хуюдо летало и постепенно переносила наши вещи на другую планету. Вдруг, я слышу громкое ""БЛЯТЬ"". Думаю, что все не так плохо, но этот хуй мне серьезным голосом заявляет: ""нам пизда"". Тут я понимаю... конец.  Оказалось, что этот осел промахнулся и полетел на совершенно другую планету в 1488 световых лет от нашей. На подготовку к перелета ушло 3 часа, на конец игры понадобилось 3 минуты
Так же,мы с другом сделали бур, отличный, прекрасный бур. Мы в нем души не чаяли. Но в один момент, это существо обезьяннего происхождения заявляет, что бура у нас нет. Я медленно, пытаясь оттянуть момент гибели моего друга, подхожу к месту, где стоял бур. Мое сердце остановилось, ведь я увидел, что вместо бура  была огромная дыра, соразмерная с дырой его покойной матушки. Я говорю ему, пусть умрет от СПИДа, не ожидая что он сделает это в игре. Через мгновение, это чудо появляется у меня за спиной. Я говорю ему:""где наш бур?"" Он ответил, что бур теперь крот, что живёт у ядра. В этот момент я понимаю, пора что-то делать, либо с буром, либо с этим австралопитеком. Мы, без сомнения, берём марсоход, и резким нажатием педали, летим прямо к нашему заветному буру. ""Нашли"" подумал я, даже не догадываясь о том, что ждёт нас впереди. Найти бур было легко, как 2 пальца обоссать, но донести его до дома было целым приключением . Сначало все шло гладко, как по маслу, но потом, услышав очередной вздох. Вздох этот означал, что бур упал в одну из шахт, которую прокопал этот черт ещё перед нашим подземным шествием. Он говорит мне, что сейчас спустится и принесёт его, но все не так просто как нам казалось. Через некоторое время стонов и резких вздохов появляется мой друг с буром. Он радостно заявляет, что это конец, подумав что это конец, я тоже начал радоваться. Это было так, конец путешествия, но совершенно не весёлый и добрый. В этой истории был марсоход, который мы взяли под землю, дабы не задохнуться. И что вы думаете? Марсоход остался там, где раньше испорожнялись динозавры, то есть в месте падения бура. Сначала, от недостатка кислорода умер мой друг, отправив тем самым бур обратно, то есть нахуй, затем, пытаясь спасти свою и так рваную жопу, я побежал что есть мочи к марсоходу, но, не добежав буквально 10 метров, умер той же участью, что и мой дорогой друг. 
Мы так и не знаем, что сейчас с буром. Возможно, марсоход нашел его, завел семью, детей, у них появился дом
Думаю, сейчас марсоход подбрасывает попутчиков до ядра, а бур зарабатывает на жизнь семьи добытыми из земной коры рудами. После смерти, мы с моим другом обезьяной запечатали эту яму, дабы не повторилось случившееся, и деты бура и марсохода не вылезли на поверхность

Otherwise... It's extremely fun, but it's hard to leave a positive review due to the issues explained below.

----

Oh man, oh man do I want to be able to give this game a positive review. Oh so do I wish that I could... But I can't, and here's why.

Don't get me wrong--I love the game. I love the concept. It's really so much fun to play. However...

The game was in early access since 2016 and was fully released in 2019. It's currently 2023 and holy cow are there still bugs that I know for a fact have been there since day 1 (some reddit searching on how to solve most of these will give you this information) and the devs seem to completely neglect it.

It's super buggy. I mean SUPER buggy. To the point where the game can literally break and it'll make you lose your mind. Here's just some of the things my boyfriend and I have encountered while playing together (only as 2 people)...

1.) He wasn't even able to play the game to begin with upon first install. He had the infinite loading screen issue that took us 2-3 hours to figure out how to fix which required altering game files. This is has been a known issue since the release of the game and yet it still is occurring...

2.) Copious amounts of sound, lighting and camera glitches

3.) ""Losing"" objects to the void underground (e.g. placing an object on the ground and it sinking into the ground and permanently disappearing).

4.) The bf was using a tractor+trailor when he was randomly launched into the air (almost into space), the tractor+trailor disappeared and he landed on the other side of the planet and died and couldn't recover his stuff.

5.) Lots of visual glitches (e.g. one of each other's rocket's thruster is constantly spouting fire, an enemy plant being there for one person and not for the other but still kills both people).

6.) Auto-collectors collecting things from a node that it isn't directly placed upon (e.g. found resource node of copper and resin and it only collected resin).

7.) After activating a gate, our characters randomly start sliding away (on each other's screen, but not our own) and us dying to an unknown cause.

8.) Lots and lots of performance issues on both of our ends. He has a ~10 year old hardware top-of-the-line PC while I have ~2 year old top-of-the-line PC and both of us have similar issues. To solve this, both of us have to lower lots of graphical qualities and processing qualities for the game to even function correctly while he has to cap his FPS at 60 and I have to cap my FPS to unlimited (otherwise I get really bad FPS drops and him vice versa...).

9.) Forget about using this with a controller... even though it has controller support...

10.) Automated things blocking other things... (e.g. we had a centrifuge on a platform next to research labs... The clay nuggets were auto-put into the research labs and could not be removed). This happens a loooot to literally anything and everything.

And soooo much more... I would honestly be here forever to explain it all... Just also note that the more people you play with, the more bugs increase 10 fold each time ontop of just playing by yourself having bugs like crazy.

Overall the game content is pretty bountiful and it's quite nice, but there's some serious QoL issues that make me frustrated with this game that is so worth noting...

1.) The beginning is rough. I mean ROUGH. There's very little explanation of what to do or how to use the game's controls or literally what you're doing there, why, etc. I'm not for hand-holdy games but this game is certainly something else.

2.) It feels... Incomplete? I cannot say for sure as I haven't completed everything 100% (we've gotten pretty far, though!), but there's a lot of things that make me go ""Hmmm... Why didn't the devs include this?"" (e.g. more lore and use to lore-based objects that have 0 purpose, or more base-building logic/items).

3.) True automation masterpieces cannot exist in this game. Unless I'm missing something, there's a lot of limitations to how you can automate your bases and resource collecting which is kind of frustrating.

4.) The flow of missions feels very clonky--just feels like random ideas from the devs shoved into the game.

5.) Again... lots of unclear stuff in lore...

6.) Lots of things are labelled incorrectly that kind of make a difference, especially when you're scavenging for resources (e.g. one planet had a resource in 'mountains' but no 'mountains' exist on that planet).

7.) The camera controlling is a nightmare to learn and I still struggle with this.

And there's, of course, a whole lot more in this aspect, too.

To me, it's just really sad that there are so many issues with the game and it feels completely ignored by the devs for so long. I understand the game is $30 USD, but it feels like a quality of between $10-$15. I wouldn't pay more than that for this, to be honest. It truly feels like the devs did a half-pint job on everything (which is appalling since of how long the game was in early access and how long it has been out since).

But yeah... I'm still going to play it because I want to finish it and I paid for it, but it's something else.

This space exploration game is perfect for anyone who loves digging holes, collecting resources, and discovering weird alien artifacts.

The graphics in Astroneer are stunning, with colorful planets and cute little characters that look like they belong in a Pixar movie. But don't let the cute visuals fool you - this game can be challenging. You'll need to use your wits and your tools to survive in the harsh environments of outer space.

One of the best things about Astroneer is the ability to customize your base. From solar panels to wind turbines to oxygen generators, there's a wide variety of tools and structures you can use to build your perfect space home. And let's be honest, who doesn't love a good home renovation project?

Another great feature of Astroneer is the multiplayer mode. It's the perfect way to explore the galaxy with your friends, whether you're working together to mine resources or trying to sabotage each other's bases. Just be prepared for some friendly [spoiler] (or not so friendly) [/spoiler] competition.

Of course, no game is perfect. Astroneer does have its fair share of bugs and glitches. Sometimes your rover will get stuck in a hole, or your character will inexplicably start dancing. But hey, that just adds to the fun, right?

Overall, if you're looking for a game that's equal parts charming and challenging, then Astroneer is definitely worth a try. Just be prepared to lose track of time as you explore the vast reaches of space, and to come across some truly bizarre alien creatures.",1683826671,1683826692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

These sort of issues should have been fixed before it was released.

On top of all that, the camera mode needs a lot of work to make it properly useful. Would cause motion sickness in a lot of people and is useless for digging tunnels.

One of the things I love most about Astroneer is how it balances both a relaxing and engaging gameplay experience. I can easily lose track of time while exploring new planets and discovering hidden treasures, while also enjoying the freedom to take a break and watch a TV show or browse YouTube without feeling like I'm neglecting the game.

The game's graphics and art style are also incredibly impressive, creating a vibrant and immersive universe that feels alive and constantly evolving. I especially enjoy the way the game blends science-fiction elements with a sense of wonder and discovery, making every new planet feel like an adventure waiting to be explored.

While the game's overall mechanics are intuitive and easy to learn, there are still plenty of challenges to keep players engaged and invested. From resource management and base-building to dangerous environmental hazards and alien creatures, there's always something new and exciting to discover in Astroneer.

Overall, I highly recommend Astroneer to anyone who enjoys a mix of exploration, creativity, and survival gameplay.

It has interesting gameplay, from what it looks like (about 15 hours played, last save file was from 2 years ago) there's a story now and the game is fun to mess around with, explore the world, go to different planets and trains / automation have been a nice add especially since the deeper cave systems are impossible to traverse by road vehicle.

However, it does feel like the game has a bit of an identity crisis, the automation isn't in-depth at all, the only threat the flora delivers is a heart attack when you get jumpscared by the tall plant on some of the other planets and exploration is pretty boring since all planets kind of look alike, especially the cave systems.

And this is where the review turns a bit negative, you see, old Early Access Astroneer din't have the weird artifacts, automation and the crafting was less in-depth, but in my opinion, it had better world design, the upper caves could be cramped, there were dangerous plants that would impale you if you came too close (these plants can now be seen on other planets as a ""threat"") and if you got down in the lower caves there were massive caverns you could drive the biggest rovers through. The surface wasn't safe either with sandstorms blasting rocks, if you were hit by those you would be done for and you better have stored your resources or they would be blown all over the place.
And other planets had something actually unique to offer, mines hanging from the ceiling of a tall cave, unable to find iron ore just to look up and see a good vein in the narrow tall cave

Only a few situations can get your heart pumping a little, and they do add to the fun!

The interface is not the easiest and takes a little getting used to, but after a while, it starts making sense and you discover things you weren't expecting or that were staring you right in the face all along.

Love the fact that you are not harassed by things other games so often include these days: raids/purges or other threats to you and or your base/resources. 

This game does it differently, its mostly zen and chill. However, the biggest threat to your life is you. Plenty times you will die from lack of oxygen or fall damage. There are plants that can harm you, but they dont really pose a threat. If you pay some attention in general, you wont die, and it leaves you to enjoy the world and build and explore as much as you want. 
It's a beautiful game with a unique style.

Controls are ok, but at certain moments a little finicky (in the rover in a tunnel).

Your shuttle lands. Your basic base is set. The game actually starts and off you go to explore, collect, craft and complete missions objectives if you feel like it. You'll eventually get far enough along to travel to another planet. Once you arrive at planet 2 you'll start building another base and collecting resources to bring back to your original planet while noting what resources ""planet 2"" doesn't have so you bring them with you next time. Rinse and repeat for several planets. It's one long grind fest but that works for me.

For me the hardest part of the game is simply the controls though that may be because I prefer the controller. When your menu system is not typical and thus your buttons do different things in different ""menus"" it can be interesting. That said I actually like the non-typical menu system they have for your backpack/log/store.  While not super efficient/user friendly it is rather engaging.  

If you don't use the compass it is quite possible to be come lost. I know, I forgot the compass existed and had a LONG adventure trying to get back to my base. Sadly it isn't because the worlds are huge but rather because that so much of the world looks the same. There are different biomes but close to no distinct landmarks.

However, there is one thing I dislike, and that's the quest system.
In my opinion, quest systems are at great odds with open-world survival sandbox games.
A constrained progression structure in an open exploration survival game just don't work well.
And worse still, you get rewards for completing quests which further force you in the direction the quests want you to go in rather than allowing you to go in your own direction.

I suggest you take a look at the Youtube channel Game Makers ToolKit and in particular a video about how rewards can backfire

Do you not trust us to figure our way around your game?
Are you worried we'll get lost and need to be guided?
You made an exploration game, so let us explore, besides, anyone who is playing this game more than likely has an idea how to get around from previous experiences in other similar games.
And it's not like we can get irreversibly lost, the only thing you'd stand to lose is a bit of time and possibly some tools.

Sorry, this is just something I feel strongly about and I apologise if I seemed to be too hard on you.

- Open World: Yo can come and go as you please. There is no clear objective, but there are plenty of missions and seasonal quests if you like to follow a story.
- Survival: You need oxygen and energy to survive. Can be acquired easily but requires a bit of logistics and you can be fully autonomous on the end game.
- Craft: You will need to craft everything, using printers and gathering/combining resources from different planets and biomes. There are plenty of categories of ""stuff"", from hand tools to vehicles, automating options and large facilities.
- Exploration: If this is your thing, each planet have different biomes both on the surface and way underground, even at the core.
- Story: You can follow the mission log and uncover the hidden history and the lore behind (the last awakening update adds an interesting conclusion to the overall story)
- Sandbox: Terrain is all yours to destroy (with hand & vehicle tools). Also the tools and tiered.
- Co-op: You can collaborate with your pals working toward common objectives or activities.
- Vehicles: Decent varieties, from buggies to big rovers, hovering ones (including hover-boards! and jet-packs)",1682960203,1682960203,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I used to love this game, but now I hate it more than Mondays. Why, you ask? Microtransactions, my dear friend. Those devs completely ruined the game with those microtransactions. They're selling suits for $5-15 each! That's more expensive than a Basic plan Netflix subscription, and don't even get me started on the ridiculously high price of the paid items. Simply buying all the suits and nothing else would end up costing over twice the price of the base game. Who do they think they are, Gucci?

And the worst part is, I had unlocked all the achievements just days before they added the in-game shop (on a different game platform). It made all the effort I put in to get the golden suit palette feel completely worthless. It's like when you're in school and you work your butt off to get an A, but then your teacher tells you that you can buy an A for $100. It's cheating!

I know some people will say, ""Oh, they're just cosmetics, you don't have to buy them."" But come on, we all know that's not the point. Those cosmetics used to represent our progress and act as trophies of our achievement. Now, they're just items that can be bought with a credit card. It's like if you were a kid and you collected Pokemon cards, but then some rich kid comes along and buys all the rare ones. It ruins the game.

And don't even get me started on the backpack system. It's like they took realism to a whole new level. You can only carry so much in your backpack, so you have to use a vehicle to transport more items to your base. But the vehicles are clunky and slow, and they make you feel like you're driving a grandma's scooter. Plus, sometimes your equipment or vehicles can randomly fall through the ground and into the void. It's like playing Jenga, but instead of pulling out blocks, the blocks just disappear into thin air.

The game also wants you to ""explore"" all the planets, but there's literally nothing interesting to find. The planets are empty. It's like going to a buffet and finding out that they only have plain rice and water. Boring!

I really wanted to like this game. The art style is beautiful, the music is great, and the terrain tools/inventory system is very unique and fun to use. But there's just no depth to the game. It's like swimming in a kiddie pool. Everything you craft in the game is for the same bottom-line purpose of gathering resources. That's it. It's like they're preparing us for a future where all we do is work and gather resources for our robot overlords.

So, if you're looking for a game that will make you feel like you're working a 9 to 5 job, then Astroneer is the game for you. But if you want a game that's actually fun and entertaining, then I suggest you look elsewhere. Maybe try playing Jenga, at least you'll get the satisfaction of pulling out blocks instead of watching them disappear. Or just watch LetsGameItOut play Astroneer, he makes the game more fun to watch than it actually is.",1652931506,1682564162,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I finished the game's main plot before reviewing.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Fun, relaxed experience. It reminds me somewhat of Subnautica and Outer Wilds.

It lacks mystery, plot and puzzles of Outer Wilds, while also lacking the survival and sense of danger of Subnautica.

It retains space exploration and resource mining as well as crafting ever more expensive upgrades to help you explore the solar system, so it's still similar to both games, just doesn't reach the full potential that they had by focusing on a single style.

I enjoyed it, but I only recommend it on a sale.

[h1]Description[/h1]
In Astroneer you play as a space-suit-man who mines resources on an alien planet to build up his base and explore for alien technology while making more and more upgrades to his base and gear.

Game has a land morphing mechanic. Your main tool can suck the earth, rock and resources straight up to your backpack. If you store earth in a special capsule, you can also spit it out to create bridges or platforms.

Your basic survival needs are air and power. Both are provided by staying connected to a power lifeline. Air is produced in unlimited quantities by your base, while power must be maintained by means of different generators. A wind turbine may be providing a lot of power, but when it's not windy - you get 0. Similarly for solar power. Combustion engines provide power from resources. Batteries can be used to store excess power to keep the base running when wind stops and it's nighttime.

You will complete missions, which usually make you research, build or use specific equipment. Research is done by means of points you get by scanning alien stuff.

You will unlock gadgets like items that provide you with emergency fuel, upgrades to your sucking-tool and vehicles, including a handy tracktor with trailers for transportation and several types of spaceships for traversing to other planets. You cannot fly them yourself though, unfortunately, you just pick destination from the map.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Relaxing[/b]
This is a slow-pace game. There are very few hazards to watch out for.

[b]+ Landscaping[/b]
Tearing down hills as well as building ramps and bridges works well. You need to utilize the flatten feature a lot - you are looking for a piece of land that has the angle you want and then by flattening you extend that piece of land at the same angle. I had fun creating passages, tunnels and bridges to connect different areas.

[b]+ Progression[/b]
You start with walking around, but progress to riding in a tractor, using trailers to transport stuff quickly from your mining sites to your base, or making use of your vehicles to bring power-generating equipment to machines you need to power up, etc.

Then as you unlock better items and vehicles you will be able to easily drive through difficult terrain and explore freely.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Inventory space[/b]
Not enough, and isn't upgradable. There should have been upgrades that increase it somehow.

[b]- Uninteresting ""plot""[/b]
It's nice that the game tries to give you an ""end goal"" of sorts, but it's unfortunately not very interesting. I wish there was some more stuff to uncover, like in Subnautica or Outer Wilds.

[b]- Not fleshed out enough[/b]
The way it is, the only real exploration you do is to find resources. Everything else is highlighted for you be it on compass or somewhere else. Since there is little in the way of hazards, the game does not feel very ""exciting"", but also doesn't have enough depth to be a more cerebral experience like Satisfactory - a game that's only about gathering resources, crafting and automation, and yet makes those concepts fun because of how much stuff there is to do.

[b]- Minor bugs[/b]
If you mine resources when your backpack is full - you will drop them on the ground. Thing is sometimes those resources will fall through the floor and land somewhere below in some cave or such. It can be annoying. It can be avoided if you stop mining when you have full slots already.

Other bug I found was floating resource nodes that I could not mine. I fixed it by first building a column of ground underneath, and then flattening that column - the resources were mined as well.

Your tracktor with trailers can get stuck on sharp inclines or peaks of hills, etc. I just got out and sucked some earth from underneath it to free it and move on.

So all in all - bugs I found were fixable by using the game's base mechanics, so it wasn't a big deal to me.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
A little bit of Subnautica, a little bit of Outer Wilds, a little bit of Minecraft, but doesn't focus on anything to the degree that these games do. I enjoyed it well enough, but wouldn't be excited for a sequel unless many more features were added.

I'd give Astroneer a
[h1]6/10[/h1]

It hurts me so much to give this game a thumbs down because it's an awesome cool little game. Unfortunatly the game's early access state means it's preformance sucks. The game randomly freezes and crashes for me making it unplayable.

Losing your gear by suffocating is annoying because you need to build an Oxygen Tether all the way over, espacially annoying underground. Overall, though this Game is still really fun. Unlocking a new thing is really exciting and the late game machines are crazy cool. The Byte system can feel Grindy if you focus on it too hard.

The game is really fun for the first 1-3 hours.  REALLY fun.  It's a survival exploration game that takes a nice easy pace, feels rewarding when you find a new resource, and honestly looks pretty nice.  

And then the next several hours are exactly the same thing...

You found another vein of minerals!  
- But that last vein you found is enough to hold you over for the entire rest of your time on this planet.  

You ""completed"" a planet!  
- Now go do the same thing 6 more times, with useful, but ultimately unnecessary improvements in technology.  

They added automation!
- but there's no need to mass produce or automate anything in the game (except for fueled power, if you don't want to use renewable).  You can make a gigantic, crazy base, but it doesn't do anything a bare bones base does already.

Cool worlds to explore!
- But there is an AMAZING lack of threats.  You have air, falling, and a variety of dangers that you need SLIGHTLY more than one hand to count, all of which are stationary flora that you mine out the ground its attached to from a safe distance.

The devs are still updating it!
- The devs just seem to be adding cosmetic real-money  DLC/microtransaction hats/color palettes/emotes.  

There are several irritating, infuriating, or game breaking bugs!
- hmmm, this one is fine as-is

After ""completing"" a few planets, I pushed through to the end simply to see what the ending of the game would be (and to the game's credit, it isn't a bad ending at all.  Nothing spectacular or WOW! about it, but it was a nice ending).  Other than that, my hours in the game are frequent start-overs (because the beginning of the game is the most fun and the least ""same-y"" and playing with a friend to mess around and help him see the end.  

I absolutely wouldn't recommend this game as it is for it's full price of $30.  I would even be hard pressed to recommend this game at 50% off. My best advice would be to buy it on an EXTREME sale, and/or to stick it on your wishlist and see if the game actually goes somewhere - but i wouldn't hold my breath now that the company has started adding real-money microtransactions to the game for cosmetics and rolling them out as ""updates.""


Edit 4/10/23:
They added a moderate amount of content and clarified many of the goals and steps for progression along the way.  The initial comment of 1-3 hours of really fun content before it gets really tedious is now....say 2.5-6 hours.  Definitely an improvement, and some games would definitely get a thumbs up for 6 hours of quality, awesome content....

...but Astroneer still falls short of what it seems to try to be.  
- It's an exploration game where the planets are VERY similar, and the underground biomes look nice, but they don't DO much of anything for the player...they're just pretty scenery as you travel past them.  
- it's a survival game with no challenge at all.  EVERYTHING is easily doable with the most basic of equipment.  Sure you can streamline progression and do things much more efficiently...but if you don't...they still get done just fine...just slower...and you have all the time in the world.
- it's a base builder game but even with the added complexity from automation, there's almost nothing to DO with that automation.  You can make a super-mega-ultra crafting base at endgame to churn out top tier power generators....but you already have all the power you could even need long before that.  Anything else you build is much the same.

I give the creators credit that they're adding some more content and not JUST microtransaction cosmetics, but it still hasn't helped astroneer to realize the potential of what it's trying to be...whatever that may be.",1613515492,1681179318,False,18,0,0.616453051567077637,0,True,False,False

When I circled back to it, things started to -click-  [spoiler] *pun intended* [/spoiler] and I noticed quite a bit of charm. It started making sense.

 I realized that this game is less about how difficult surviving is, and more about learning the multitude of ways you can go about solving problems. It's about learning that there's always an easier way. 

There is not much combat or action, the only fatal things in the game are your oxygen supply, gravity, and a few carnivorous plants. However, those 3 things are enough... Accidentally falling into a deep cave can be anxiety inducing once you realize you're nowhere near your tether network. 

The planets are finite, and their names and resources are scripted, so not as massive as No Mans Sky, but it doesn't need to be, each new game feels like a new seed.

It doesn't have much in the way of base building unfortunately and you're mostly restricted to putting down prefabricated modules and platforms, and the industrial and automation parts aren't anywhere near as comprehensive as games where that's the focus, but there's a decently large world to explore and a whole bunch of missions to gently nudge your progression along. It does start to drag a bit later in the game when you're constantly being frustrated by inventory limitations and having to fly between planets to collect resources which you can't automate the transport of, but for the most part it's a nice chilled out exploration game which you can easily get absorbed in and lose track of time for hours on end.",1680948889,1680948889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoy how you must travel to many different planets for many different resources, but that is literally where the space exploration ends. You literally go to a planet fucking once for a certain resource and you NEVER return to it EVER unless you need more of that specific resource. Also, there are basically no real threats in this game. The only threat in this game is oxygen and plants. Oxygen is really easy to solve by just placing tethers or making an oxygen tank for very cheap. Or, just staying next to a vehicle, they provide infinite oxygen. And the second threat, the flora, are basically negligible in difficulty. And here is where I get a little upset. The caves are BEAUTIFUL. There are so many different awe inspiring biomes, and beautiful spaces. However, there is literally no reason to go these absolutely beautiful locations because there is NOTHING UNIQUE about them except that they look cool. DOZENS of amazing biomes have no purpose other than to be pretty, and chances are, you will NEVER see these biomes unless you specifically look for them.

One of the only open-world survival games that I actually enjoy playing. Progression can be about as slow or fast as you want it to be. There's lots to do, even if you don't follow the mission objectives. It's fun to learn about how certain things work and how to maximize resources and power as you play. 

Game runs really well even on my laptop. The lack of a HUD makes the game feel crystal clear and not cluttered by information. The game itself is simple looking but still very pretty. You can seamlessly move from menus and make saves/back-up saves while you play. The multiplayer experience can be frustrating as the game saves every time someone enters a shelter/vehicle, pausing the game for a second or two.

More for some of them, less for others.

But it is otherwise a good game.

---Old---
I like this game alot. It was chill. Simple. No real enemies. You can build your base like you wanted to. Then came the limited time events, the later ones requiring far too much time. A lot of grinding. For a game that is played privately by most people. Either single player, or with known friends. Not cool. And you can miss out. Or just be late the to party. Didn't play until know? Too bad.

And now, microtransactions.

Now, I'm not against charging extra for DLC, when they update the game for free, with new mechanics. But the price per item is way too high. It usually is for cosmetic content. Especially for a game that costs money upfront to play.
For reference, I'd pay at most 2 or 3 Euro for a complete skin set, helmet, suit, coloring.",1593197230,1680706976,True,0,0,0.502698957920074463,0,True,False,False

It has many things needed to do in order to progress, mostly gathering resources from different planets. For some things it is great to think and plan, such as when building a factory for Nanocarbon Alloy, the best planet choice is Vesania as it has all but one gas needed to make it, and it also has iron which is needed to make it.  It is very punishing if you dont think ahead (eg.you fall into a canyon with your rover, or you forget to bring an extra thruster for your spaceship, now youre stuck on an unexplored planet and have to spend the next 2 hours building the infrastructure and gathering resources needed to built a thruster), but what i like is that mistakes are correctable. If you do something wrong, you have to put in a few extra hours to repair it, but there arent many situaions where repair is impossible (unless you make some stupid glitch and your rocket gets stuck in space, it happened to my friend). Id recommend this game to anyone who likes digging, building bases and factories and likes colonizing planets, but most of all, thinking ahead.

INGREDIENTS
- 500ml of mineral water
- 750g cane sugar
- 100g raw slivered almonds
- Almond extract
- Vanilla extract

TOOLS
- Glass jar
- Cheesecloth
- Food processor
- Mixing bowl
- Kitchen scale
- Strainer
- Cooking pot

STEP 1
Place the almonds in the mixing bowl, pour in tap water, and let the bowl sit for an hour. When that hour is up, dump out the water using the strainer.

STEP 2
Using the food processor, lightly pulse the almonds until they’re coarsely chopped.

STEP 3
Now that the almonds are ground, place them, along with the 500 millilitres of mineral water and 100 grams of the cane sugar, into the cooking pot, and bring it to a boil. It is the first part of making the “syrup” that’ll accompany the water.

STEP 4
When boiled, turn off the heat. Now, you have two options here: you can either leave the mixture in the pot and cover it or pour it into a container of your choosing. No matter which option you choose, you have to let the mixture sit for 12 hours.

STEP 5
After the 12 hours have gone by, strain the mixture through the cheesecloth, and place the liquid in the mixing bowl and add the cane sugar. I should also note that the sugar should be 1.4 times the quantity of the liquid. It helps when you dilute the water.

STEP 6
Once the sugar is poured in, pour the mixture back into the cooking pot. It’s important to note that you want to place the cooking pot on low heat. If you bring the pot to a boil, it will burn the sugar. With that being said, stir the sugar until it’s dissolved.

STEP 7
Now that the sugar is dissolved, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down. Once cooled, add a few drops of the almond and vanilla extracts.

STEP 8
Once you’ve poured the extracts, grab the container you’ll be using to store the almond water. If you want assurance that the bottle is clean, you can boil some water and pour the boiling water into it. Make sure you pour in the water with caution if you decide to do this. Once this is done, empty the bottle out.

STEP 9
Now that we’ve emptied the bottle of the boiling (if you chose to do that), pour in the almond mixture you just heated in the pot. And once the mixture is poured into the bottle, let the bottle sit until it’s cool enough to handle, and then refrigerate.

STEP 10
Once its ready to use, dilute the syrup in water to taste. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ delicious, but don't forget to shake well before drinking. Enjoy!",1680459592,1680459592,True,1,0,0.476377934217453003,0,True,False,False

The game's premise is simple: players must explore various planets, gather resources, build and upgrade their base, and survive the harsh environments of space. One of the game's strongest points is its exploration mechanics. The game features a procedural generated universe, which means that each planet is unique and offers new challenges and rewards. Players can use their space shuttle to travel between planets, and the game's low-gravity mechanics make movement and exploration feel fun and satisfying. The game's resource gathering and crafting systems are also well-implemented. Players must collect resources like oxygen, power, and building materials to survive and expand their base. The game offers a wide variety of items to craft, from basic tools to advanced vehicles and structures, giving players a lot of flexibility in how they want to play. The game's graphics and art style are also noteworthy. The game features a charming and whimsical art style, with colorful environments and adorable characters that are sure to bring a smile to players' faces. One of the game's downsides, however, is its lack of content. While the game's exploration and crafting mechanics are well-designed, there are limited things to do beyond that. Once players have built and upgraded their base and explored all the planets, there is little else to do besides starting over or trying to achieve higher scores. ASTRONEER is an enjoyable and immersive game that offers a lot of exploration and crafting fun. Its charming graphics, low-gravity mechanics, and variety of crafting options make it a great choice for players looking for a unique and relaxing gaming experience. However, its lack of content may make it less appealing to those looking for a more in-depth and long-lasting gaming experience.",1680221069,1680221069,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Bought it to play with a friend, so the normal thing to do, is go under the ""CO-OP"" tab and invite someone in your lobby, right? Well NO, you need to start a game under SOLO tab, and AFTER you have landed, you can invite someone from Steam Overlay.

-The camera movement is atrocious. The only way to look around is by holding Right-Click. You think there is a way to lock your camera to the orientation of your character? NO! If you look north and start moving south, the camera doesn't move with you, unless you move it with Right Click. So what's the point of this incredibly retarded camera? No one knows, as moving objects around is also stupid, because you need to also move the camera every time you do a simple task.

-The game's soundtrack is so annoying, I've turned it off in the first 5 minutes.

How am I supposed to enjoy your stupid game, when every single thing is meant to annoy you, right from the start? After 30 min I couldn't care less about exploring and doing anything anymore, as the camera movement made me Alt+F4 and refund it without a second thought.

Server can randomly corrupt and not let you in, or make all your rails disappear that you spent hours setting up, with no way of fixing it. One time, I entered a rover, got shot into space, died, and the rover with all items on it were lost forever. Sometimes the ground textures will not render and you will fall through the earth. The fall damage is an absolute menace, randomly killing you for no apparent reason.

One of the things I really like about Astroneer is the fact that it's an indie game. The developers are really dedicated to the game and are constantly working to improve it. They're always adding new content and fixing bugs, which is really cool to see.

The gameplay in Astroneer is really engaging. You play as an astronaut who is exploring different planets and trying to survive in the harsh environments. You have to gather resources and build structures to help you survive, and there are all sorts of different challenges to overcome.

The game also has a really nice art style. The planets you explore are all really unique and interesting, and the creatures you encounter are really cool. It's clear that a lot of thought went into the design of the game.

Overall, if you're looking for a fun space survival game with quite a lot of things to do, Astroneer is definitely worth checking out.

This sounds wierd, but maybe if the story was shoved on a bit harder or maybe it was more easily accessible. Don't get me wrong, there is just enough story and it is great, but maybe if the logs were logged in some ipad or something. This is such a minor thing, I feel bad for even mentioning it. You can just keep the strange stones with the logs in some pile next to your base, what I mentioned isn't that important.

I am going to say it again, for the folks in the back. THE GAME IS FUCKING AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL. Every visual. Also, for some games, good graphics are traded for visual clarity, not the case here. Everything is so incredibly clear. You can see something for the first time and it is immediately clear what it is. And this is never spelled out to you either! Little is! Every single bit in this world is so incredibly made to teach you as you go along.

Now, usually I'm not one for exploring in games. I'm your common factorio-playing spreadsheet-loving nerd. I don't really go for exploration that much. But in this game! oh my god. I don't often find myself finding something I have never seen before and immediately trying to interact with it and seeing what it does first hand. I normally just boringly go to a wiki or something and find a spreadsheety most efficient way to use that new thing. Not in this game. I went to the wiki like twice and then quickly stopped myself. You should too. Explore on your own, not just the enviroment. The mechanics and concepts themselves. They are so incredibly intuitive and when you use them for the first time its just such a ""oh man that is so cool"" moment.

I'm not even gonna talk about the base-building and automation you can do cause I'm really biased. I just love it all. Kinda wish automation was maybe introduced a tad earlier but meh that, I don't know if the game would have the time to introduce the insane amount of other incredible things worth introducing.

I know it says 31hours at review time, but secretly, I have been watching people play this game since... jeez, like 2018? Kinda stopped watching for a few years, got some money and saw it was on sale.  I have not left it for the past 2 weeks, it's too good.

Play it please, any type of person you are. Without any spoilers at all. Just play it.",1679952843,1679952843,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

1. The in game tutorial is awful. In the first 15 minutes I had to look up stuff on youtube or other websites.  
2. I got stuck somewhere with no way out, and the teleporting back to base does not work. 
3. The camera does not follow your POV, the camera has to be constantly rotated which is a huge pain. 

Going to ask for a full refund.",1679950498,1679950498,False,1,2,0.445735335350036621,0,True,False,False
