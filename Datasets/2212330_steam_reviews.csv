It's like if Rock Paper Scissors were a fighting game, it involves a lot of foresight and deception. Every turn you [usually] have to consider your opponents move very carefully, meanwhile your opponent is doing the same. It adds a hundred little layers of deception and mind reading to comb through before you make your move. You [i]can[/i] just pick blindly and get lucky, or copy meta strategies and force a win through sheer boredom, but you are greatly rewarded for accurate reads and clever trickery. 

While the turn based gameplay makes it much more accessible, it can make it a little boring sometimes. Getting hit ONCE means you're almost guaranteed to spend the next 5 minutes getting combo'd. The game takes steps to mitigate this, giving you Directional Input, BURST, and ALT+F4, but it only takes getting hit in neutral twice to lose the game. This can get a bit frustrating since each round tends to last up to 30 minutes, which can make the CLOSE button feel very tempting. 

(Another huge downside of the turn-based system is that it makes passive playstyles incredibly boring to fight against. The game technically has a system in place to prevent it, but it's so lenient i've only seen it activate a single time. This gets even worse when your passive opponent spends a long time deliberating on each turn, so 10 turns of  trying to close the distance while your opponent moves away can mean upwards of FIVE REAL LIFE MINUTES WHERE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS HAPPENING.)

At the end of every round you also get to watch a real-time replay of the fight, which is always fun. It makes sub-optimal strategies and risky reads worth it just for the enjoyment of watching it happen on the replay.",1675513781,1708513635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is bloody brilliant, and imo this game is better than the new COD MW3 ($100AUD btw).
From the unmodded game-play to the modded game-play, this game is always better with friends, and never ceases to challenge my skills. 
I even bought this game for my friend so he can join me, yes I bought the game twice bc it's that good.
I'd rate it a 8.5/10 for turn based games, its originality and fun replay-ability, and bc the game is still being updated (and modded), there's always new content for me to hustle with.

KILL_PROCESS.

I love KILL_PROCESS so much. You wouldn’t understand the lengths I would go to to hit a fat clip with it. I would give it my newborn son if I had one, but I don’t, so I’ll give it my sanity instead. Not that there’s much left, spending 13 hours a day watching a spinning KILL_PROCESS gif takes its toll after all. God, I wish KILL_PROCESS was real so we could get married and have beautiful KILL_PROCESS children. Every day I wake up and cry that I’ll never be with my one true love. KILL_PROCESS I miss you, please come home. I just want to deal ludicrous amounts of nuetral damage with you. Let me feel the joy of old ARMOUR. Nothing is like the thrill I get when I do an awesome predict and land KILL_PROCESS. Sex, drugs, money- nothing compares to the extensive range and invulnerability that comes with KILL_PROCESS. If I were ROBOT, I would do nothing but hit KILL_PROCESS over and over again. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. It hurts knowing that I’ll never amount to anything even close to the glory of KILL_PROCESS. I go for KILL_PROCESS every time I get 3 super. I don’t care if the enemy is in range, I just want to see ROBOT’s powerful form leap into the air with KILL_PROCESS. My wife says I have a problem, I don’t have a wife anymore. KILL_PROCESS is my wife now. Sometimes I go in singleplayer with unlimited resources turned on just to hit KILL_PROCESS again and again. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS.  KILL_PROCESS is so beautiful. KILL_PROCESS always makes me laugh, KILL_PROCESS always makes me smile. KILL_PROCESS literally makes me want to become a better person... I really enjoy every moment we spend together. My time has no value unless it's spent with KILL_PROCESS. I tell everyone I meet how awesome KILL_PROCESS is. Thanks KILL_PROCESS for being KILL_PROCESS. Whenever KILL_PROCESS needs someone to be there for KILL_PROCESS, know that I'll always be right there by KILL_PROCESS’ side. I love KILL_PROCESS so much. I don’t think KILL_PROCESS ever realises how amazing KILL_PROCESS is sometimes. Life isn’t as fun when KILL_PROCESS’ not around. KILL_PROCESS is truly stunning. KILL_PROCESS is my soulmate. I love the way KILL_PROCESS grabs, and KILL_PROCESS' large disjointed hitboxes are absolutely gorgeous. If I had a star for everytime KILL_PROCESS crossed my mind I could make the entire galaxy. KILL_PROCESS’ neutral damage is as pretty as KILL_PROCESS is and that's saying something. I love how I can learn obscure ROBOT tech and use LOIC to make KILL_PROCESS deal unavoidable nuetral damage (Latino combos). People quit whenever they get hit with this. I guess they can’t handle the truth- the pure unfiltered power of KILL_PROCESS. I do it anyway. There are more people. More targets for my KILL_PROCESS. Every time I see someone else use KILL_PROCESS, I get insanely jealous. How dare they use my KILL_PROCESS! They don’t understand KILL_PROCESS like I do. No one does. I got fired from my job because all I did all day was watch KILL_PROCESS. It’s sad, but I’ve already bought YOMI hustle, and by extension KILL_PROCESS. I can live on KILL_PROCESS and tap water, nutritionists be damned. If ROBOT was real, I’d take them out on a date, but then purposefully show up 30 minutes late (too busy watching KILL_PROCESS). I’d make sure to stand above them, at a high enough angle that TRY_CATCH (the weak impostor) can’t hit me, only the true heir KILL_PROCESS. They’d get so mad at me missing the date that they’d immediately leap into the air and KILL_PROCESS me. God, I’d give anything for that. I’d move heaven and earth. I’d walk on glass, eat a kitten, anything for KILL_PROCESS. The sheer bliss I’d feel as I get swung around and around, knowing at any moment I’ll be slammed violently into the ground, would be nigh orgasmic. Then, almost as soon as it begun, it would be over. Robot’s hydraulic musculature propelling me to my final destination. I’d be dead, but it’d be worth it just to die experiencing the true power of KILL_PROCESS. Would my family miss me? I think not. We lost contact when I begun my crusade under KILL_PROCESS’ banner. I’d be completely alone, just me and my beloved, spinning for all eternity. KILL_PROCESS. KILL_PROCESS….

KILL_PROCESS.

One of the biggest issues with fighting games is the skill cap you have to know about a game in order to play it. I've been playing video games, since 2014 on steam. The games that I play are more casual, more slow, and a break from the fastness of life. The game is action, and fast, but the turn based nature and a decent community of fighter lovers (and animators) take the action of fighting and bring it into bite sized pieces.

You can sit down with keyboard and mouse, have a sandwich an dream up fights yourself, or with a friend. No button combos to memorize, if you want to tech, you can just press a button to. 

YOMIS can break new fighting players into a genre as a playground to fighting's bare-bone moving parts, they can later move on to play real-time fighters, and not resort to button mashing like we all do when new to fighters.

When I talk to people about this game their first thought is tool, they think it's a good way to learn normal fighting games.

I'm here to say, probably not. YOMI has excellent tools for yomi, like all the frame data you can see midfight and it's amazing. Makes it easier to learn your character and more importantly your opponent's character.

For Beginners I'm going to give you info on defensive play.

Use your predictions, play a move you think I'm going to do, now select a move you think that will counter it. That's pretty much this entire game and sometimes it spins all the way back to making the first move.

Now take that same concept and apply it to block, predict a move you think I'll use, then press block. A bar will pop up that says melee parry timing. Parry happens when you select the exact frame the enemies attack lands. So say I select 7 frame attack, a parry timing of 7 will counter it. The game will automatically set your parry timing to the enemy move you predict. Some attacks can only be blocked, and sometimes you need to adjust the bar manually.
Example, I select dropkick on turn 1, that's an 11 frame move, however since you're a little far from me it doesn't land in the 11th frame. I need to travel closer to you which takes 1 frame. Which means you need to block at the 12th frame. This might sound complicated, it's not, the prediction will tell you a parry occurs with a big blue shine that comes of your character. So all you need to do is adjust it until it gives you that big blue glow in preview.

Aside from that, bursts which can get you out of combos can be parried, AND some moves can I-frame it.

Grabs pierce block, if you have no move that counters grab, grab cancels it out. Keep in mind if you grab your opponent could do a move which counters grab, at that point it becomes rock, paper, scissors. If you're scared to play rock, paper, scissors, you can dodge which has its own counters but I barely see people predict dodge for that exact reason, it has counters but doesn't deal damage.",1706672355,1706672355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before talking about the public multiplayer, I must admit that this game gets boring really, really fast. This is why most reviews, including my own, have less than 30 hours in the game. There might be something I'm ""missing"", but all of the recent games I've played with randoms are just completely stale. They'll pick Ninja, go for the guard break drop kick turn 1, I'll parry it, hit them once, then parry their burst. Wow. Fantastic.

The mechanics of the game are cool and innovative at first, but it loses it's charm after a while. It slowly becomes just another fighting game. It's not chess, it's not some genre-defining masterpiece, it's not the best game ever made -- it's just a neat idea that's executed well.

On the topic of public multiplayer: Overall, the lobby system is really poor not only from an operational standpoint but also a pure design standpoint:

- You are limited to 1 challenge at a time, and challenging locks you out of all other actions, including leaving the lobby. 

- Your games finishing will consistently softlock the game or break the lobby in some way, forcing you to restart.

- You will still need to wait a minimum of 3-4 minutes in a full public lobby for a match due to not being able to challenge spectators, the player list not separating in-game players and challenge-able players, and AFK players.

- There is absolutely zero information on players in the lobby. No hours played, no score/streak, no way to view steam profile, no way to add, etc. This not only makes the game in general super antisocial, but there is also no way to gauge general skill level of who you're challenging.

There are myriad examples of excellent lobby systems throughout FGs. Just hire someone to (quite literally) steal FC2's lobby design.

The game also suffers from the same problem many online FGs do: the online is just simply [i] lonely. [/i] Nobody wants to interact or chat (partially due to the chatbox being terribly designed). Asking questions about something or even saying something like ""wp"" or ""n1"" will 9/10 times get ignored completely. There's the public discord, I suppose, but most 20k+ discords (esp in FGs) are completely unbearable from personal experience.",1704480088,1705947803,False,9,0,0.563803732395172119,0,True,False,False

-This game has no single player content. you'll be playing by yourself or with people.

-There is no tutorial or instructions. check out YOMI Learn on youtube

-having some familiarity of fighting game terms is helpful, but not necessary. two of the biggest ones I can think of would be Directional Influence, and Frame Data(how fast a move is). if you know what those two mean at least, you can figure most of the rest out.

-expect to lose a bit at first. the game is confusing, but once you get the basics down, it gets easier. The game is a lot like rock paper scissors: thinking what your opponent might do, and picking the best option. again, having some familiarity with fighting games will help, but not needed.

-there is a modding scene, via Steam Workshop. do be aware, once you install mods of any kind, you'll only be able to join other servers of people who also are modded. in which case, I would avoid using mods at first until you learn the game a bit. Side Note: there are two kinds of mods: server side, and client side mods. those familiar with modding games in general will understand, but basic is Server  Side means everyone playing should have the mod for it to work e.g. character mod, while client side means only you need it e.g. background/stages.

is this game good? yes, it is. it's only $5 normally, and it looks hard at first, but after a few rounds, it becomes fairly easy to understand. it's one of those ""easy to learn hard to master"" kind of games.",1705477161,1705477161,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

it's is the best turn based fighting game I know of.
Toribash is free though, but much harder. 

This game is hard but it is more that the other players are really good. And their is a lot of options.
But the controls and UI are very intuitive.

I got it on sale and I feel like it was worth more than I paid for it.

Match time can vary a bit. When I first started I mainly lost fast. Or if it was a bit longer there was more back and forth on average.
Now that I actually know how to do a good defense, Matches can drag on a bit when fighting a better opponent. I have made a couple turnarounds though. And in some of those spaces there sometimes isn't room to really analyze. And it can end up being a little exhausting.

When matches have an ebb and flow, they tend to be more fun regardless of who is winning. But the vast majority of matches are fun for me anyways,
Objectively they tend to be 20 minutes to like 45 minutes though. 

There are two beginner lobbies for some reason. One has a longer turn timer which I prefer. With it's kind of open lobby system basically anyone could open another though.

No tutorial. Seriously, when you first boot up the game and hit ""single player"", it's not even clear whether they bothered to put in a tutorial or a basic bot (they didn't, on both counts). Then you get smacked with an interface that looks about as confusing as an aircraft cockpit, and you play around a bit controlling both sides. This is in spite of the game being [i]advertised[/i] as having single-player, when it clearly does not. I expect any self-respecting fighting game to have at least a tutorial to explain how the game works, rather than relying on people to make your tutorials for you and put them on youtube.

The turn-based nature and lenient turn timers in this game exacerbates the beginner issue. In most fighting games, you can expect to get bodied for a couple minutes and eventually you learn. But in this game, you might as well pull out Subway Surfers on your phone and hit spacebar for the next 30 minutes, as your opponent painstakingly takes about a minute to calculate which exact 0.1 degree angle to attack you from in the next hit of the 50-hit combo. Again, this wouldn't be so bad if the game had ANYTHING resembling a tutorial.

Online is plagued with weird connection issues and bad UX. The lobby system is strange and is designed in a rather anti-social way. ""Escape"" closes some menus, but not all. Everything feels very rough.

Your entire movelist is largely context-dependent. What this means is that buttons appear or disappear based on the context. This is a UX no-no and would be better served with greyed-out buttons.

In a frame-perfect game like this, there is [i]no[/i] way to just... wait a specified amount of frames. You can only wait a preset amount of frames, or throw out a move that is the closest to the time you want to wait, forcing you to have to framekill everything.

The predictions are distracting and just get in the way, as they are only correct if your opponent decides to be a sandbag and do nothing.

I got a refund, I'll come back when they put in a tutorial. Right now the game is only fun if you have someone else to learn the game with at the same time.",1704653949,1704839022,False,2,1,0.411951929330825806,0,True,False,False

YOMIH changes all of that. As such, the characters you can play as are far more precise and measured than any other game, capable of techs and combos that you will have never seen in any other game to this extent. A weird mashup between platform fighter style scale with traditional FG mechanics, be it a newcomer to the fighting game genre or a long time fan, you're sure to enjoy the absolute dopamine rush of pulling off gigabrain plays and perfect reads worthy of the term ""Yomi."" (meaning to get in the head of the opponent)

It's pretty great.

Animation's smooth as butter, the characters are very well thought out (and complex, oh so complex), the entire experience is beyond customizable - from the character colors, to the fight specific settings, and it's even open to modding and who *knows* what those weirdos get up to.

If you have trouble inputting 236236P instead of 623P, it doesn't matter. You click the cool thing, see what the animation does, and decide whether or not you're ok with getting shot in the face with a laser instead of a kick to the chest.
My only con would be that the new player experience is non-existent, but after a match or two you'll get the general gist of what each knob, dial, and button is probably for.

[list]
    [*] A incredibly nuanced and satisfying combo game, and all it takes to learn them is to mess around in single player for a couple hours. 
    [*] Offense focused, highly engaging matches. 
    [*] Chess like gameplay that allows anyone to learn the top level nuance of fighting games without spend any time grinding tech/combos.
    [*] A dedicated developer who is very active in the community and constantly listens to feedback.
[/list]

If you like fighting games, I guarantee you will love this game. Gone are the days of grinding tech skill for hours at a time.

Unfortunately, I do have some criticisms. 

One, there is no ranked mode, which would be really nice so that I can play against people at my level and not pubstomp. 

Two, this game is not easy for people who never touched a fighting game or don't have understanding of the technical jargon surrounding those communities. As such, it can be very overwhelming to a new player who just hops in and gets overwhelmed by a ton of buttons and 30s on the clock before they get their ass beat by some shmuck who has 3000 hours. This game lacks a tutorial, you will have to search outside the game if you want even a chance to understand what is going on. Hell, when I first played the game, I remember being very overwhelmed by what was happening and I would consider my knowledge surrounding fighting games to be very high. None of the mechanics are well explained in game, and unfortunately, your best bet for understanding what is going on is to get your ass handed to you by some guy in a lobby. 

But fear not, dear reader! Despite what I just said, I ask that you still give this game a chance. 
Some key things to help learning this game easier:
1. Learn what frame advantage is. Long story short, its how long you have until you and your opponent can attack. If I have a frame advantage of +5, that means I have 5 whole frames(unit of time) where I can do *anything* before my opponent can do anything about it. negative frame advantage is the same thing but reversed for your opponent. So if I am -1 frame advantage, that means my opponent has one frame that they can do anything before I can act. 
2. Learn to DI. Long story short, di away from your opponent. Farther equals better.
3. Don't look at single player and think it's useless because there is no cpu. It's one of the most powerful tools you can have as a player. It allows you to have infinite time and an undo button so see how your moves work. You can use it to learn how your moves combo into each other. It is a powerful tool that you can use it to comprehend this complex game.  
4. Ask questions. If your opponent beats the shit out of you, ask them for advice! Most people I found on this game are happy to help you learn. The YOMI Hustle discord and the character discords are also a good place to learn and find more resources.

It combines a one-on-one duel with strategic thinking, encouraging the players to think several frames ahead, comparable to that of strategy board games like chess. After each game you are rewarded with a real-time replay of the full fight, portraying both players to be acting at inhuman speeds.

People kinda take it for granted, but things like combos are really hard to hit as a new player, and a lot of the time it can put people off when the vast majority of the cool things you can do you need to practice regularly for weeks to be able to get to do decently often, especially when your hands just kinda... can't do that? Eliminating that and focusing in on prediction and decision making skills make YOMI Hustle way more accessible to me, and it would probably be a really good entry point for a lot of people who would otherwise be just unable to get into fighting games. As a bonus, the modding scene's great, so while a four character roster might feel a bit bare to some people it's not like you can't fill it out yourself really easily and find characters that appeal to you.

OH YEA, this game has alot of mechanics it just DOESNT explain to you, like DI, which determines how your character reacts to being knocked back, theres also melee parry delay, which sounds like what it is until you realize some moves are really fidgety when it comes to parry timing and what is or isnt considered melee. 

also this game is very buggy, its to be expected since the game is made by 1 guy but also its still annoying to be in a match and then have the other guy ragequit by unplugging the router and then be stuck in the match having to mash the quit button. also typing in game chat can crash your game sometimes.

OH and also theres no like, singleplayer anything, theres local and thats that. no ai or nothing, it would be fun to actually play against the most optimal ai to practice but sadly nothing

get this game if you have friends, it will be fun, but matchmaking is a gamble and the game itself needs some improvement",1702397066,1703125567,True,51,4,0.76781618595123291,0,True,False,False

   This game's unique, almost turn-based, method of inputting your moves both alleviates the rapid reaction times other fighting games may require of you, and grants you the time and opportunity to carefully plan all of your moves.
   The game often feels like a battle of wits, where each player watches for, and learns, his opponents favorite moves and tricks. The game's apparently slow pace never prevents baiting an opponent from feeling exhilarating, and sometimes nervewracking. Some matches progress evenly, with each player taking chunks off of the other's health, but others have one player dominating the first half, only to be overthrown by his foe in the last half.

   I haven't even mentioned the modding and workshop community yet. It's impressive, but others will surely be in a better spot to write about that.

Time is frozen and you're able to make ridiculously fast combos that a human at real-time speed could never accomplish.

Your Only Move Is Hustle (YOMIH for short),
is a 2D Turn-Based Strategy fighting game where you and another player fight against each other as different characters that you can choose. The game tests your experience, thinking and prediction that you build up the more you get invested into the game. At the end of each battle you get a satisfying replay, like shown in the trailer/preview of the game.

""The Struggle Of Each Beginner""

The game is extremely overwhelming at first upon seeing the UI at first. You dont understand a thing, meaning you are heavily dependant of others helping you out and understanding the ropes of the game, watching tutorial videos urself or simply trying ur best to understand it on ur own. Not saying that its hard to get into but most certaintly is rough, especially if you fight against other already experienced players. Getting the UI down is one thing but then learning and understanding how each mechanic actually works is another. Its not something that should stop you from playing the game though, you dont need to spend hours on end to just understand the basics. 

""Nice Community""

In my 136 Hours I spend playing and hanging out in the game, I can say that the community is very nice, atleast the Non-Modding Community (More to that later). I personally met 2 people that were really toxic towards me while 99% of others players were really fun chatting with and having discussions about the moves and fight we are currently having is very informative to improve. You get to be very goofy with another player, either chatting some funny shit how we beat eachother up or just trying to get a nice replay together. Obiviously thats only my experience so far and it really depends on how you behave around this chess-on-crack game. But usually the worst that happens is when you or your opponent rage quits.

""Extremely Cool Workshop""

If you want to take a look on what the community can make just take a glimpse at the workshop. You can test out other (famous) video game characters and even fight other players with them. I even saw entire game modes implemented or cool design changes that you can use (Including QoL changes). The community takes its time to be creative with things because of the simplicity of the game. Many players, if not the most, are playing ""Modded"" YOMIH. I personally just stick with the Non-Modded experience unless I really want to do something fun or interesting.

You may have seen footage of this game before, a high octane fighting game with moves and abilities that make you feel like a god. You might have seen split second reactions and wondered how on earth this was achieved. I wondered that myself, dismissing this game as just another fighting game with overly complex controls and an intense skill ceiling bordering on super human.

But the truth is that this game is actually turned based. Time is paused as you choose what move to make, once the move is locked in, time resumes for a brief period before stopping again as soon as either character can act. The footage associated with this game is actually a replay of the match. This style of game play opens up some unique opportunities you won't find in other fighting games. No move is locked behind a hard to execute series of button presses, any move that can me aimed lets you do it with unparalleled level of control, and the prediction feature makes planning and preforming awesome combos easier than ever.

All that being said, it is not without its problems. Firstly, while the game is surprisingly easy to get into, it dose still fall into the same problem every other fighting game has, the OTHER reason why anyone who isn't a sweaty try hard might turn away from fighting games, and that is people who are better than you stomping you into the dirt. I have played exactly two matches (lost both), and i haven't had the courage to go back to multiplayer. I just have better things to do than be someones punching bag, and with the game's built in feature to save replays, the fear of being in someone else's combo video has never been higher. Which leads me to the game's second problem, outside multiplayer, there isn't much to do. Contrary to what the store page itself might tell you, it DOSE have a training mode, a mode where you test moves on a motionless dummy. For some reason, the dev labeled it 'single player'. what this game lacks is a proper single player mode, a mode where you fight a cpu opponent. I understand that creating an ai that can actually play this game and do it competently would be difficult if not impossible (especially with the coding skills on display here) but with the game as is, the only way to play a proper match is with another person, which opens you up the to the high level dirt stomping I mentioned earlier.

Now, my review might seem a bit negative, yet you may have noticed that I still recommend this game. that is because that I can not in good conscience say I didn't enjoy it. Most of my time spent was in 'single player', carefully choreographing a fight like I was a stick fight animator of old. I also created a lot of fun skins for my fighters using the game's customization feature.

This is the first game that I've seen that properly captures the feeling of those old school stick fight animations I used to watch when I was younger, and that alone is worth a purchase in my humble opinion.",1702023067,1702023067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2212330,152809510,76561198084121867,67,8,1516,0,606,1706462916,"""Your Only Move is Hustle"", or ""YOMI Hustle"" as you will see abbreviated, is an absolute gem of a game that has me completely in shock, and let me tell you why:

First off, the idea behind the game is like nothing I've ever seen before. It's a fighting game that pauses as soon as you or your opponent can act, ensuring that decision making is the driving force behind winning. The concept is so innovative that it's spawned a one-of-a-kind game that even someone like me, who's about as coordinated as an autistic brick, can enjoy!

The turn-based gameplay is a total game-changer for people like me. It takes away the stress of lightning-fast reactions and complicated button combos that usually leave me feeling like I'm just mashing random keys. I simply do not have the time to grind away in the training mode to learn that 59 hit combo that every sweatlord seems to know by heart.I can finally stand a chance against the pros without embarrassing myself too much, and the only thing I need to do is being smarter than them!

The game also, and predictably, has a massive and very active modding scene. The fan-made characters are amazing. You haven't experienced true joy until you see a fight between characters based on Sans and Ronald McDonalds, and it looks like a true close bout between memes.

And get this - it runs on basically any system! You can play this trash game on a smart fridge. So, no more excuses for not joining in; I wanna see you get in here to lose every single tooth to a Robot's Kill Process.

In all seriousness, this game is perfect for people like me who enjoy more slow, cerebral games in which you win through superior thinking and being able to get in your opponent's head, but who like the skill and time to be aple to press 47 buttons in sequence to properly make use of this reading abilities.

I whole-heartedly recommend this game. It's very cheap for how good it is.",1701617208,1701617208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still absolutely worth playing and supporting, even if you're not a fighting game aficianado, it's just a really nice indie gem. Cool unique idea, cool execution, cool developer, cool moddability, heck yeah.

First, The community is very kinda, and everyone I spoke with was happy to offer advice.

Second, unless you are a savant, or willing to devote a LOT of time to learning the complex rock-paper-scissors web of moves and timings, I would skip.

Every game I played (yes, in beginner servers too) was like 10 minutes of me being unable to make any moves, because I've been stunned, so I just get to select 0 moves and wait for my opponent to continue their single player corpse beating adventure.

People will tell you to move the DI slider around to get out of your opponents reach. I've concluded that the DI slider is like the button at crosswalks. It does nothing but make you feel better while you wait.

Multiple people told me to look up guides on youtube. Guides for this game are produced exclusively by people with $4 walmart microphones who breathe through the mouth.

If you were actually as good as Sun Tzu then you'd be playing actual fighting games and thinking of these strategies in real time rather than pondering your guesses for MINUTES at a time. My advice? Get into an actual, physical fight and see how well your grand 300 IQ tactics work in a real world setting. I'm bet you'll be humbled in no time.",1701181037,1701181037,False,0,3,0.440251588821411133,0,True,False,False

this game truly helped me by making me use my brain instead of mindlessly button mashing my keyboard and throwing it through a wall... ever since my wife left with the kids because i spent their college funds on more pickles to fill my basement I've found closure in this game after a long time. even through the messy divorce and her taking half my assets, (yes including the pickles), i was left with little to nothing, while i spent paycheck to paycheck reclaiming each and every jar she took away from me, and with each new jar i got that was filled with the glorious nectar of god known as pickles, i was able to overcome a mighty depression which grasped my life and almost made me lose faith in my collection returning to its glory days, while this game was there with me through my journey. 

P.S Rachel i know you still have my limited edition 1992 jar of Claussen pickles and i know you only have it cause you know how much they mean to me, so if you're reading this give them back before i have to take matters into my own hands and call my lawyer because those weren't part of the settlement.",1700733043,1700733043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

you can ignore most of the negative reviews as it is primarily people who went into the game without bothering to figure out the controls and expecting to win, resulting in them getting their **** kicked and getting salty over it. To anyone actually considering playing the game, I would recommend watching some youtube videos. First about general mechanics and then the specific character you would like to play. I personally recommend the video Your Only Guide To Yomi Hustle (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NH1ko61rkw) as it is only 30 minutes long and provides you with a good grasp of the essential mechanics. I would suggest putting on some music to keep positive as sometimes you can get quite gruelling matches, but the most important thing to remember is that if you mentally accept defeat you will not see opportunities you normally would if you had a better mindset. Try not to be too disheartened by losing as you will never improve if you always win. Saving the replays of your fights, even the ones where you lose, are good as you can slowly analyse your performance and identify things you could of done differently. Joining the offical YOMI Hustle discord server is also recommended as you can find alot of answers to the questions you will undoubtedly have. Sometimes Your Only Move Is Hustle.

YOMI Hustle, AKA Your Only Move Is Hustle, is a turn-based fighting game that draws inspiration from stick-man fight animations, high-level fighting games, and chess.

This is a game of prediction. Is your foe going to attack? Grab? dodge? or jump? Sometimes these are important, other times you can wing it.

[h1]Cowboys, Ninjas and Robots, oh my!... And a wizard too.[/h1]

The vanilla game currently has four characters - Ninja, Cowboy, Wizard, and Robot. 

Ninja is the rushdown character with short-ranged attacks and a solid projectile collection. Harder to play for beginners
Cowboy is the mid-ranged, teleport-heavy all-around-fighter who is easier to pick up for beginners.
Wizard is the projectile-heavy zoner with a few mix-up specials and highly-trap-oriented supers.
Robot is the grappler, with awkward movement, heavy, powerful grabs, longer-ranged ground game, and a remote-controlled bomb that you can kick around like an exploding basketball.

[h1]Uh... How do I use this move? How does this character work?[/h1]

This game lacks a tutorial. Although it's gotten better on displaying how many frames a move takes and how moves work, you'll still need to take some time in single player to understand how your characters work. You can look up guides on youtube and wiki.gbl.gg/w/YomiHustle

The most important things to learn for anyone looking to get into this:
 
-- Use the DI wheel, it'll save you if you're stuck in a combo.
-- WHIFF CANCEL SPARINGLY! You cannot block after a whiff! It's also a waste to whiff after you and your foe get ready in four frames or less.
-- Burst can save you, but it can be parried - this is dangerous if your burst gets parried.
-- If you try and block mid-combo to predict a burst, but your opponent does nothing, you are vulnerable to attack.
-- Never underestimate a foe who has less health but more super bars than you.

[h1]Mods? More characters? Wait is that Sans Undert-[/h1]

YOMI Hustle has an extensive modding scene. Skins, Full-on Characters, stages, game modes, even ranked! I recommend trying out vanillia for at least a little bit before you go full-on into the modding scene, as many of the modded characters suffer from ""I want my beloved main to be more powerful than anything"" syndrome that you see in other customizable fighting games.

What looks like a half-assed stick fighter knockoff is an incredibly detailed, intricate deconstruction of the fighting game genre. It is hyper rock-paper-scissors. It's rock-paper-scissors-hadouken-kill process.

Just buy it, it's so god damn cheap it might as well be free -- and buy it for a buddy, too. Who knows, they might like it more than you. What's important, to me, is that this kind of thing is given ubiquity, to help make people wonder *why* they are attracted to a game or genre ----

For instance, I do *not* like fighting games. Generally speaking, I find them banal, despite all the mounting evidence to their own twitchy intricacy. I love X-Com! I'm a strategy guy! And I love Yomi Hustle. This thing is ""essence of Street Fighter"", with a strong base of Mortal Kombat, cut open and splayed, and all participants can see it's delicious, meaty interior. Even with four characters, each match is unique.

And don't even GET me started on this nutso-ass community. LOOK AT THE MODS FOR THIS THING. It's only a matter of time until we get the Scooby-Doo characters, or Ayanami Rei added to the roster.

And the best part? When a match is over you are treated to the entire fight *in real time*, and it looks *AWESOME*. I will just boot this shit up to WATCH a replay of a fight I've had. That's how bad this thing's got me.

It's good. Incredibly good.

It concurrently has 4 playable characters. which for a fighting game is a miniscule amount if you've played one after 1987, but the characters you do have are sharpened and designed to a laser-point accuracy, each with a viable and yet, unique play-style. doing endless 1v1's against yourself does get a bit boring at a point, but that just means its time to get out of weenie-hut-jr's and go get manhandled by the multiplayer community. Not-saying getting manhandled is un-fun though.
Fighting against other players is a totally unique gaming experience in my books, it feels way more like chess but at the same time you're constantly thinking about what the opponent tries to think what you will do, it gets to the point where doing the obvious thing is sometimes the unexpected option because you both start to expect the unexpected if that makes any sense.

well, YOMI Hustle is a great game for you!

by removing the aspect of reaction and replacing it with turn-based movements, YOMIH provides insight into fighting games that will genuinely help you understand fundamental concepts and get better overall.

YOMI Hustle expands on turn-based fighting in such a unique way that, once you grasp how the game works, it becomes a matter of tactics and prediction.
Some have called it ""fighting game chess"", and I believe this is a very accurate way to describe the gameplay.

In terms of graphic fidelity, it reminds me of the old stickman animations on youtube- except it's a game!
It's quite wonderful to see the explosive and hasty fight scenes work out; oftentimes one player will just narrowly catch the win, but other times one party will simply get pummeled.

Not to mention the modding community, striving to create characters that burn with passion. To the spriters and developers who work hard every day to provide cool custom content, thank you so much!

In any case, YOMI Hustle is an amazing turn-based fighter that takes a rather arduous element intrinsic to fighting games and spins the genre in a unique, lovely direction.

Very misleading but it is fun enough to keep. Maybe in the future there will be AI or at least simulate it with mods. Honestly the Random isn't bad if you allow yourself to play fair against yourself..... Eventually a tower of NPC characters to battle in Single player would be great.

But the developer seems to want this to be a different game, because in the recent update to 1.18, they removed a lot of the consequences for just blocking, over and over. This removes a big part of the game, blocks were a risk, and you primarily avoided damage with careful movement, and frame timings that were made easier by the style of game.

Now, matches are much much slower, and you are punished a lot for aggression. not the mention, move cancel is on by default, which just makes for an annoying thing to toggle every frame. I can't recommend this game anymore, at least until things are fixed or adjusted further.

Edit 1:
Well I can say the mechanics have gotten a little work, but really this one is aimed at the developer. As of posting I was one of many registered for the Olympus tournament qualifiers. Typically you would expect an online tournament to provide players a timespan to check in and register, with emails and notice sent in advance of the tournament. The only email I and many others would get was at the moment of the start of the tournament. Naturally I wasn't sitting on my email at the time, and expecting more notice than a minute, I missed the start.

I can't say how many people experienced a similar confusion, but given the tournament is in full swing now, I imagine I'll find out soon. The lack of communication in this attempt at invigorating the Yomi community is frankly just dissapointing, and I hope the team will improve with successive events, rather than let this be their template moving forwards.",1698105513,1699725375,False,15,1,0.617874205112457275,1,True,False,False

I've tried to get into most fighting games over the years as i like the idea of 1v1 games but always bounced off them after spending hours trying to learn combos only to get destroyed immediately online by people who have been playing for years and have ingrained fighting game fundamentals and eventually just give up as its difficult to notice what you're doing wrong when you're a human pinball. YOMI hustle massively cuts down the frustration with its turn based mechanic. 

While the UI can look a bit overwhelming its actually surprisingly intuitive and you'll be able to understand the basics after a couple of rounds, Though i did find that there is often no explanation of certain core mechanics as well as options around character move-sets. You're left to work it out yourself or more likely have to look it up. (I was surprised at how much of my character i wasn't using as intended until I looked up their abilities and i noticed most other beginners were doing the same )

I've only played a dozen or so hours as of writing this review but I'm fairly surprised at how much my play has improved by just experimenting with my characters kit, noticing how other people play & getting tips from my opponents during the games. The rounds are quite long and can feel like a bit of a drag if your getting mopped up but I found in the beginner lobbies most of my matches are pretty even & it definitely has that one more round feel if you managed to pull off a few cool combos or get a close win.

The base game currently only has 4 characters, I'm unsure if this is by the games stripped down design or because it seems the game is worked on by a solo dev but currently i feel that it works in its favour and hope there are too many added down the line. After playing for a few hours you'll have a rough idea of all the characters general play style,capabilities & their go to moves which i think is essential for the back & forth chess feeling of the game. All the characters play completely differently and have their own specific mechanics, strengths & weaknesses even the basic movement is quite character specific and at least for me with how consistent improvement can be you'll find yourself quite invested in focusing in on with whichever specific character you gravitate to. 

Outside of that the game seems to have a pretty good community, lobbies are active, people will often want to chat during the game and generally will give you some really helpful pointers if you mention your new. There also seems to be quite a lot of workshop support for additional characters/stages etc which seems popular and can provide tons of options for characters if you find the base ones are limited.",1698340520,1698340520,True,1,0,0.521276593208312988,0,True,False,False
