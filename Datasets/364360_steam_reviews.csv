Newcomer here, not to the Total War franchise but certainly to Warhammer. My only other experience with Warhammer was Vermintide, briefly, which was interesting but I did not really understand the universe. Total War: Warhammer is a MUCH smoother introduction to this fantasy world, as it leaves you wanting to know more about the factions you are leading and the rivalries therein. Enough of the lore is written into the characters, units, buildings, etc. that you understand what's generally going on in the game, both from a story perspective and (perhaps more importantly) a game play perspective.  It's not totally comprehensive, and you will still need to read up on the lore outside of the game if you want to understand what's going on, but if you have been hesitating about buying the game up till now because you have been intimidated by the lore, then this is the game to start with.

Game play wise, I am the wrong person to ask. I love the game play, personally, but I am someone who still thinks Mount and Blade: Warband looks good, and who just finished Rome Remastered after playing the original a year ago.

There is a bit more soul to this first installment, and a lot less overwhelming when it comes to learning all the features of the campaign. only an hour in and i feel like i grasp the concept and purpose of the campaign better than i did in the second which i mainly only played mortal empires on as the empire. Warhammer I is a lot more cozy with a smaller map and clear outlines with which provinces you can capture and the impending chaos invasion during the end game. And it seems much more effort was put into each faction since there are so few. This is a great starting point for anyone interested in getting into the warhammer total war series. This also will set you up properly for warhammer II since you will eventually be buying all the DLC for this first installment that will then carry over into the later titles. Pick this game up and take it slow as you learn your way around the controls and movement of your troops. You will have an absolute blast. I also noticed that the map environments in this game have a lot more variation in elevation and movement if you like that sort of thing. I would say if you have the money and have a friend that desperately wants you to play the later installments then just grab everything in WH I ( not all DLC is on the steam store, you will need a total war account for the free extra lords and units. Look up a guide if need be since this can get confusing) and WH II on a steam sale and purchase only the base game for WH III atm. Then when you and your friend are done playing the one he or she wants you to play come back to the first game to get your bearings in the single player campaign. This is if it is your first foray into total war games and the war hammer universe itself. If you have performance issues you must seek out fixes and mods that will help and i cannot say i have run into any problems that i noticed so far.

1. Literally 80% of the factions in Brettonia or Empire make it IMPOSSIBLE to get past 30 min of gameplay.
You will literally encounter a rank 1 enemy bot who literally has units that outperforms yours by times 100; literally NO ONE wants to make peace or make an allince, and if they do they always break it, or don't offer support when attacked by that rank 1 enemy. 

2. The BOTS literally play like god it is ridicolous even on easy/normal mode. They literally seem to attack the minute you make a turn moving your units away or declare war on another nation. The moves are near ""perfect"" and no the exact moment to strike

3. You will spend 80% of your turns under siege with 30k gold trying to make peace or a damn trade-aggrement with any factions possible offering up to 15k gold yet they'll still decline your offer!

THE CAMPAIGN IS LITERALLY RIGGED PLZ FIX! How am I suppose to enjoy this game when since turn one, the nearest enemy seems to have troops that take a minimum of 100 turns, AND seems to be hostille for no reason!

Now, I've seen my fair share of strategy games, but this one, oh, this one, it's a magnum opus that strikes a chord with fans of both genres, delivering a strategic experience that is as engaging as it is immersive.
Let's talk about the world first. The Old World, a rich and diverse tapestry of landscapes and factions, is brought to life with meticulous detail by Creative Assembly. From the grand fortresses of the Empire to the sinister lairs of Chaos, each faction is brimming with character and depth, bringing the Warhammer lore to life in ways that fans could only dream of. The attention to detail in capturing the essence of each faction is a testament to the love and respect the developers hold for the source material.
The gameplay, my friends, is where Total War: Warhammer truly shines. It seamlessly blends the deep, strategic gameplay of the Total War series with the unique abilities and units of the Warhammer universe. Whether you're commanding the stalwart defenders of the Dwarfs, or unleashing the raw power of Chaos upon the world, each faction provides a distinct and engaging playstyle that ensures no two campaigns ever feel the same. The battles are grand, the tactics intricate, and the strategic possibilities near endless.
But let's not overlook the DLCs, the lifeblood of the game's evolution. Each DLC brings with it new factions, units, and campaigns that breathe new life into the already sprawling universe of Total War: Warhammer. From the savage horde of the Beastmen to the enigmatic forces of the Wood Elves, the DLCs expand the horizons of the game, adding depth and variety that keeps the gameplay experience fresh and exciting for veterans and newcomers alike.
Total War: Warhammer is a testament to the creative synergy between two esteemed franchises, a game that appeals to both the strategic masterminds and the fantasy enthusiasts. The Old World is a stage set for conquest and glory, a world where the clash of swords and the chants of magic intertwine in a symphony of chaos and order. So rally your forces, sharpen your wits, and prepare to immerse yourself in a strategic fantasy experience unlike any other.

 This game was fun as fuck to play, especially with community mods but I was never happy about paying for BLOOD and waiting years for bug fixes while they churned out more DLC.

 I ONLY recommend the Total War Warhammer series of games if you get it on sale. Even then maybe you should think of getting it even cheaper if your able.

Update 2021, Dec 24th:
 CA and SEGA are milking wallets with these prices.
 But its one of the very few non-sucky Warhammer PC games around so we either pay up or stfu & gtfo, lol. I still don't like how they gate content behind there own launcher and stuff, but whatever, the game is really fun to play, especially with community mods.

Nuff said, merry Christmas, or whatever, and have a fun New Years and best of luck in 2022.

Rating: 4.5/5 Stars

After investing a significant 80 hours into Total War: Warhammer, I feel well-positioned to offer a thorough review of this captivating game. Total War: Warhammer excellently merges the grand strategy genre with a rich, fantasy world, creating an immersive and deep gameplay experience that is hard to put down.

What I Liked:

Diverse Factions: The diversity in factions and their unique playstyles is a major highlight. Whether you prefer the disciplined ranks of the Empire, the chaotic hordes of the Greenskins, or the enigmatic forces of the Vampire Counts, there's a style for every type of strategist.

Epic Battles: The battles are visually stunning and strategically deep. The way units interact, the importance of terrain, and the use of heroes and magic add layers of strategy that are both challenging and rewarding.

Engaging Campaigns: Each faction offers a distinct campaign experience with unique objectives, storytelling, and challenges. This variety ensures high replayability.

Beautiful Graphics and Sound Design: The game's visuals and sound design are top-notch, effectively bringing the Warhammer world to life.

What I Disliked:

Learning Curve: For newcomers to the Total War series or those not familiar with Warhammer lore, there's a steep learning curve that can be daunting.

Performance Issues: On lower-end systems, the game can suffer from performance issues, particularly during large battles.

DLC Content: While the DLCs add great content, the cost can add up, and some key factions are locked behind these additional purchases.

Recommendation:

Would I recommend Total War: Warhammer? Absolutely, but with a caveat. If you're a fan of strategy games and enjoy rich, fantasy settings, this game is a must-play. However, be prepared for a steep learning curve and potentially additional investment in DLCs for the full experience.

Overall, Total War: Warhammer brilliantly combines deep strategic gameplay with a rich fantasy world. It's a game that's easy to dive into but hard to master, offering endless hours of engagement for strategy enthusiasts.

Some things I've noticed instantly, as compared to my hundreds of hours of Warhammer 2 and the couple of hours I have on Warhammer 3;
1. Map size being smaller benefits the game significantly. Admittedly, it does feel quite a bit more lonely and the existence of diplomacy is barely functional, but there is nevertheless a sense of safety that you can get in this game that you will never experience in the other Warhammers, at least until way further down the line.
2. Battleground size being bigger is a huge improvement and I wish that this was still the case for the current Warhammer games. The larger map makes reinforcements have to crawl across the huge landscape, which is annoying, but it also gives way more opportunity to push landscape advantage and to control your units in a more strategic fashion. This also means you actually have to utilize the run/walk mechanic, which is a nice change of pace.
3. Cavalry works. Perhaps a little too well, admittedly, as they seem to significantly outclass most ground units. That being said, there's actually a reason to have charge defense in your army, as charges are actually an important part of the game now.
4. Missiles are way weaker, and it's not really that bad. Admittedly, missiles feel way more inaccurate and there's a considerable lack of satisfaction when unloading entire rounds of ammunition into on-coming enemy forces, but it's also not really that bad. Less missile units means more strategy, in my opinion.
5. Heroes are way overpowered, but maybe that's a good thing? I definitely notice the overwhelming strength of heroes in this game moreso than WH2 and WH3, though that may be by virtue of the missiles being far weaker (and relying on your infantry is just throwing wave after wave of them into an unstoppable force, so the only way to counter heroes is with heroes). They're also a lot rarer.
6. Some aspects of the U.I. are arguably better, and I like the option to choose multiple of different heroes in the same starting location. The other games have this too, but to an extremely limited extent. I don't really care that much about it though. It just feels like each faction is more self-contained.
7. Magical items are more rare, quest battles are more casual; why did this go away? Magical items SHOULD be rare by virtue of providing a stat boost to the strongest unit types in the game, and casual quest battles teach the player how to play the game or provide a unique gameplay scenario. They can't be that hard to set up.
8. No environment, just limited conquest; this is an interesting design choice and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it. On one hand, it makes playing each faction especially different because they are bound to certain cities that they can colonize. On the other hand, you cannot guarantee the stop of a resurgence of your enemy due to the fact that razed ruins can still be colonized by them, and only them.

I might add more later as I go further into the game, but it's surprising how different this feels as compared to Warhammer 2.",1702678587,1702678736,True,24,0,0.730317890644073486,0,True,False,False

DENUVO forces you to link the product that you purchased (which should rather be your own property, for you to do with as you please) to DENUVO's online servers.

If you must go offline for any amount of time, you are not able to play a game you supposedly own (surprise. As it turns out, you were simply renting it to a landlord, as it were).

DENUVO serves no purpose to the customer. On the contrary, DENUVO weakens the customer's rights to own the products, any product, that they purchase. DENUVO effectively assumes control and ownership of any product it is associated with. That control and ownership should be the customer's.

I will leave the original review below, but be aware it no longer reflects how I feel about any of the games in this trilogy;

THIS REVIEW WAS MADE IN GOOD FAITH AT THE TIME IT WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED.

[Hey, remember when normal price tags for DLC were $20? Yeah, those were completely normal times.

Seriously, folks. $20 is actually THE price that DLC was for the yesteryears. Do you know why you only now ever see ""DLC"" for more or less $10?

Consumerism. Really, it's ruined all our minds.

Take Age of Mythology, for example. A prime game, one of the most iconic and loved RTS's for the early, or even late, 2000's. Still played to this day. The ""DLC"" for it, the Titans Expansion? $20.

Heck, even Blizzard's expansions for it's own games are full game prices.

This $20 DLC does not and should not dwarf TW:W's great gameplay, amazing world map (as well as the very detailed and wonderful battlefields), and the care put into the races that are currently out.

That care takes both time and money. For every hour they spent on the Beastmen, they had to pay a building full of people to develop, animate, voice act, translate (From English into the actual Beastman vocabulary), and ultimately test, tweak, and hotfix. That $20 per person pales in comparison to the money they spent on it. Would you like to pay the full amount of money the company put into it? Nope. And I bet if they tried to do that you wouldn't complain about this pittance then.

TW:W is an awesome game, CA, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Keep it up!]",1470189211,1698676212,False,0,0,0.483075976371765137,0,True,False,False

I was pumped beyond belief when I heard Rome II got announced and bought it immediately (in my Freshman year of college, boy how time flies) only to not be able to play it because of how broken it was on launch.

This is nigh impossible for me as I am not a software developer or well-versed on how these games work under the hood. Therefore my advice on how to fix things must instead be focused on the need to engage constructively with the fan base, not alienate people who have spent hundreds of dollars on their games over the years, and been the base of the company's success over the last two decades. I also suggest that DLC prices moving forward be reduced to reflect the paucity of value they provide to the game. Additionally I would greatly appreciate new content to reflect what has been promised to consumers in the past (3k scrapped DLC).

The world is outstanding. Decades of developed characters, locations and general flavor make for a place that is fun to experience and learn about. If you're familiar with the Warhammer world at all you know what I'm talking about. It's just so rich a setting.

The game is a drag though. The tutorial is virtually non-existent at the beginning of the game. I won the battle either completely by accident or because one's performance in it is incidental. Once the game really gets going, the tutorial aspects become more helpful, but remind me a lot of Navi from the N64 Zelda game. More a distraction than a helpful guide.

There are two modes: Battles, which is the deciding factor in the story and how you progress towards ultimate domination, and Kingdom Maintenance, which has a kind of Civilization flavor to it as you try to balance your budget and build improvements to make your slice of the political pie more effective.

The kingdom building aspect is the most fun. Trying to figure out what combinations of things like religious institutions, trade centers, military support structures, or bars to keep the peasants happy provides a lot of food for contemplation as to what makes a good place to live. In the context of the Warhammer world, its kind of cool to figure out what's best for Averland, or Ostland for their best life to live.

The battle aspect is pretty boring stuff though. Myth the Fallen Lords was more exciting than this. Lots of micromanaging of units with a finger always on the space bar to pause. Gotta do a lot of saves so you can walk your way out of dead ends, especially as the overall campaign starts to pass into months. Customizing the army is fun, and again the world makes it have a flavorful dressing to the gameplay. But honestly, if I wasn't dull thud Karl Franz on a Griffin I'd have dropped the game much sooner than I would have.

The problem is there's too many battles to undergo and the actual battlin' to be done is tedious and uninteresting. The game actually acknowledges this by allowing you to skip battles not related to the main story by just pressing a ""roll the dice"" button. If your army is ""by the numbers"" better you pretty much win and move on. I found myself pressing the easy button a lot, and avoiding the main story battles because the meaningless battles happen all the time, while the story-battles are hard even on easy street. You can always put it off and build a few more units or another improvement.

I lost interest and put this in the smolder pit.",1697064832,1697064832,False,4,2,0.507658720016479492,0,True,False,False

There is no music on the campaign map.

Apparently, this bug was introduced in 2021 along with the game's release on Epic. You used to be able to fix this by rolling back to a previous build but then CA removed that option altogether. Furthermore, CA has not provided modding tools for the music files for copyright reasons, so this issue cannot be fixed by the community.

If you intend to play the Warhammer 1 campaign, be advised that this is a full priced game sold in 2023 where the majority of the in-game music is simply gone, missing, no longer there.

I think the single player campaign is a nice change of pace from the second and third Warhammer games, but there is no way I can recommend this game when such a glaring issue has remained unaddressed for so long.

Also on a more personal note I think it's absolutely shameful that a game released on steam in 2016 cannot be enjoyed as it originally was. I realize CA is primarily selling this game as a Warhammer 3 DLC but the campaign is included in the price of the product and should be fit for purpose. I can digitally buy games released in the 90's that have no sound issues whatsoever.

----------------------------------

Warhammer fan? Why are you reading this? Go play the game already.

Is the game good for everyone else? Yes, it's a solid game imho but bear in mind that my opinion is biased since I'm a huge fan of both Total War and Warhammer.

[h1]Technical and grapics[/h1]
First off, in regards to launch problems I'm aware there are some but I have not experienced any except for hanging during battles twice in 30 hours playtime. I'm playing on a 2 year old(top level at that time) gaming laptop and everything runs fine on medium/high settings. The grapics are great even on this settings and honestly I can't wait to get to play it on a non laptop 1080 GTX in Ultra setting later this summer when I'll be upgrading.

Be warned that there are technical problems for some people so you might want to check up on that before buying the game. If you're unsure you can try it for two hours(which is definitely sufficient) to determine if it works. If it doesnt simply refund the game.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
I like starting off with the bad and ending with the good. Of course there are bad things with the game and some of them are subjective while others might be objective. Many of these are subjective of course and people like playing the game differently.

[b]Agents on the map[/b] are fairly OP imo and agents cannot be specced properly into defensive roles when embedded into an army. I prefer running my agents in my armies but the enemy pretty much spam me with tons of agent actions every turn. There seems to be no defensive bonus for embedding your agents into armies which is wierd considering they take up a unit slot after all. The AI also never use the embedding feature at all. I never once faced a warrior priest on the actual field for instance, instead they run around like crazy on the campaign map. Somewhat immersion breaking. The same total war agent bullshit is still around where your agents got shitty chances and the enemies seems to cripple you a lot. 

[b]Balancing[/b] wise I felt like Orcs needed a heavy nerf when playing as the Empire, I basically lost to an army of 50% archers since they just ran away and I didnt even have access to cavalry yet so I had one unit of Empire Knights that actually lost to the archers after a while.(At least the AI seems competent) Archers is not a problem at all if you're playing Chaos though and only recruit shield units. Which is how I solved this since there is nothing on this earth I hate more than enemy archers(subjective opinion ;)). I have however heard more people confirming that Orks seem a bit OP in the campaign. Especially when playing on VH/Legendary. I also dislike Orks as a faction so bear in mind I may be biased here. 

There are tons of small things that go in here like how hard it actualy is to maintain chaos corruption in provinces that you moved way past and are at the top of the map. Corruption should not decrease in provinces that you already passed. Maybe a mechanic of it spreading from the Chaos Wastes and downward together with your lords as they move would be appropriate here.

[b]Diplomacy[/b] is as usual very badly done, they should have worked something better out between the various Empire factions and the Chaos-Norsca relation, where the AI of Norscans doesnt seem to know how to support you properly on the map even if you set coordination targets. 

Their idea of [b]underworld travel[/b] is a lazy prospect at best. I'd have expected a real underworld where the map shifts much alike Heroes of Might and Magic so this is a disappointement. What I'd like to see are select entrances to the underworld thus giving us more fun choke points as mountains either needs to be passed below or through sparsely places mountain passes. Currently, mountains do not feel like a hindrance or change of environment at all. Of course, non dwarves/skaven/goblins should have a penalty for traversing in this ""real"" underground I'm mentioning. 

Many obvious places for [b]DLC whoring[/b]. Hopefully some of this will be free. 

[h1]The Good[/h1]

[b]The AI[/b] is actually pretty solid this time around and I have not found them doing stupid stuff that were standard in previous games. Siege battle AI is solid when they are on the defense and they actually try and defend their walls properly. This is a huge plus. 

[b]Siege battles[/b] are remade and made less into a waiting game and more engaging which is good in my opinion. Towers now have range over the entirety of the map pretty much but with a limited fire angle making it possible to avoid them by moving past the small angle or getting in close. Towers are pretty strong as well so it actually feels like defenders have an advantage. Bear in mind I have not played a single defensive seige since I've been playing Chaos and only a small bit of Empire.

Both [b]battles and campaign[/b] are improved upon and I find myself fighting more battles than in previous games. The Campaign map is really nicely done. They actually put a lot of effort in improving the very core gameplay.

[b]Factions diversity[/b] is amazing and the factions feel as unique as they should. There are a fair variety of units and I hope more are added. I'd also like to see some more variants of Empire state troops. 

[h1]Matters of Taste[/h1]
It takes a very very long while to get the top tier units. I got Chaos Knights at around turn 160 and probably 25 hours played. I might just be bad though. ;)

[b]Siege battles[/b] as mentioned above. They also removed minor settlements completely and these battles now play out on the battle map. I like field engagement so for me this is in the green slightly but I still like the immersion of actually seeing the town close by. Would be cool if there was some town environments but the battle was still more in the shape of a field battle.

[b]Powerful Lords.[/b] For me this is a big plus since RP options are so massively expanded but for some of the more hardcore historical TW fans this will be an obvious negative since they dislike the fact of one man being as powerful as 100. I do wonder how it plays out with the lords on smaller unit sizes though, I am playing on Ultra unit size as a total war game should be played. 

Things seems to take time and the campaign pace seems slower than previous TW games, for me this is a good thing. 

[h1]Summary[/h1]
There are some good and some bad aspects with the game. It's a bit of an uncut gem at the moment but most problems with balancing can be solved with mods of course. 

The game is fun and I believe total war fans will like it since it plays like a TW game with some modifications. For Warhammer fans this is a must have, you need it! It's the Mark of Chaos game we all wanted. Even though I actually liked MoC this game is obviously a lot better. 

I personally enjoy the game despite some shortcomings. If you're looking for a perfect game and you're not really that interested in strategy games or fantasy you should probably just go buy the latest cash cow franchise FPS game(CoD). But if you're into fantasy and strategy games I'd highly recommend the game. I'm also very confident it will be improved upon as we see more factions and playability added into the game.",1464217594,1693755412,False,2,0,0.54356849193572998,4,True,False,False

I love setting up my cities, putting my armies in strategic positions and then engaging in real like battles where you control battalions of units and line them up against opposing army where positioning, flanking, army morale and your other tactics will decide who wins.

There are 4 races included with the base game:

the Empire: which are humans who use steampunk technology and magic. They are a jack of all trade army where you try to unite and defend your empire against a world with many enemies and dangers.

The dwarfs: you know short but stubborn people who prefer to live in the mountains. have strong infantry and ranged power but lack cavalry. Your campaign will revolve around reclaiming your lost cities and righting every wrong the other races did or will do to you.

The vampire counts: My personal favorite as you command legions of undead that don't flee from battle and try to dominate the world with them. They lack ranged units but rely on their infantry to anvil and cavalry and flying monsters to hammer.

The greenskins: consists of orcs, goblins and all sorts of other creatures who just love to fight and loot and destroy. They have decent infantry, monsters and some decent skirmishers. But it's the character and banter these races chant in battle that makes most of the fun with me and brings the full immersion of trying to pick a fight with my neighbors.

*******************

This game is very good.
Obviously, if the Warhammer setting doesn't appeal, it's not a plus (or may even be a minus, depending on your preferences).
With regards to the game itself, it has advantages and disadvantages over previous games in the series.

On the strategic level, it's greatly simplified over many of the more recent games in the series.  A few of the most obvious changes are:
There are no faction politics.
Province management is minimal.
There are no province governors.
There are pretty much no choices regarding how to develop a province beyond whether you want it to be generating cash or generating armies.
Many factions cannot be negotiated with, only fought.

Which all seems pretty poor, but the battles are, quite simply the best Total War has ever managed (except Warhammer 2, which I'll mention below).  The principle two reasons why boil down to:
Variety -
There are genuinely different faction rosters; Vampire Count armies are different from Wood Elf armies, are different from Troll armies, are different from Dwarf armies, are different from Chaos armies, are different from Empire armies, are different from Brettonian armies (and so on) in ways that the historical titles simply cannot be.
Specifically, all the ""regular"" kinds of Total War units (shock/melee/light/missile cavalry, sword/armour-piercing/spear/polearm/direct-firing-ranged/indirect-firing-ranged foot soldiers, varied artillery) are present, but there are also monstrous units, flying units, chariots, war engines, spellcasters, ethereal troops, fearsome and terrifying units and so on.
There are nine playable races, each with numerous legendary lords to use.  These races play in significantly different ways, again, in ways that historical titles simply cannot do.  This is also true on the campaign map.
The inclusion of so many factors in the battles leads to an excellent variety of options being available to the player both in preparation (building armies and choosing skills for lords and heroes on the campaign map) and in the execution on the battle maps.

and Action -
There is a sweet spot for exciting action here; cavalry, monsters, pikes, artillery, and even sometimes the ""regular"" infantry all seem to be interesting and powerful in different ways.
The inclusion of terrifying units, magic and hero units make for a more interesting and exciting battlefield, again, in ways that a historical title probably couldn't.

Personally, having been playing these games since the original Shogun: Total War (pre-Mongol Invasion), I've always been of the opinion that the game truly shines on the battle map; the strategic map exists principally to make decisions that determine the circumstances of what battles you will fight.  Although the simplification on the strategic level are a shame in some ways, the vastly increased options and excitement on the battle map more than make up for it.

The final plus point is that whatever you buy here in terms of the base game and DLC is not simply lost by being made obsolete by Total War: Warhammer 2 (and #3 when it gets released).  Everything you buy here is available as content to play in the Mortal Empires campaign of TW:W2, which thus offers even more options for variety on and off the battlefield and probably manages to create even better action than this title.

tldr: Best Total War title up to its release because the battles are so awesome.  Warhammer 2 is better, but everything you buy for Warhammer 1 is playable in #2 as well, so nothing is lost.",1513011814,1691931621,False,0,0,0.526627242565155029,0,True,False,False

80% role play and 20% strategy game (not like how it was advertised as a strategy game so ignore the videos and pictures bits on the store page with its attractive graphics and units).
the strategy part of it is decent (6.5 out of 10), however i can name strategy games from the 90s that are far greater than this game with all of its DLC's combined any time.

For anyone think its a good strategy game, then you haven't played strategy games at all or don't know them.

in short, over rated and waaaaaay over priced (good thing i bought it on sales so if you can buy it for less than 10$ go ahead, but still not worth it in my opinion).

This 25 dollar DLC features 12 unit models, 3 lords from already existing sides and some basic mechanics that are absolutely not worth the price. As I said in my previous unfairly deleted post, I am a working adult in US, 25 dollars is not the issue, the amount of content we are getting for 25 dollars is. Imagine, base game that is 50 dollars has several sides, dozens of lords, 100 of unit models, so how is it that a bunch of unpopular legendary lords and few units cost HALF the price of base game?!

Even more realistically does this amount of effort amount to this price? If you can get a brand new AAA game for 70 dollars? Can anyone actually agree that this DLC with few months of effort is worth 25 dollars while CA isnt even finished fixing the bugs and issues the game already has? This is a blatant insult to the community and a corporate cash grab. 

If we allow this to happen once, this will set the new standard for DLC, instead of giving us what we would pay 25 dollars for, like Nagash, Ind, Nippon they will keep spawning these 25 dollar pathetic lord packs expecting us to consume. Dont forget that a game is a business, they want to do least amount of effort for most amount of profit, this is exactly that, least amount of effort DLC.  

I am not a troll, or CA hater, I have every DLC, my account is open take a look how many hours I invested into this franchise, I am what they should be targeting a super fan of the franchise. I am all for supporting CA and buying DLC that have worthy content, but if this is their new tactic, sell overpraised junk and silence anyone who speaks against it? Forget it. I got all I need and I rather give my money to the modders. 

Since I see that CA is actively seeking their moderator dogs to silence the community, I will also be switching my review to negative for the time being with this exact message as the review.

It still costs $90AUD, despite having two sequels and coming out seven years ago. The DLC is also insanely priced.

If you're playing Warhammer Total War games on a 1080p monitor (like a gaming laptop for example), then this game actually looks better than 3 does. 3 is a blurry mess at 1080p thanks to the new AA system they've used, and you also can't scale the UI at that resolution and the default is far too large and blocks a lot of the screen. You can scale the UI in the first two games in the series however.

So honestly, 2 is probably the better game, but there's a lot to be said for the relative simplicity of 1, the graphical clarity, and the less bloated, videogamey minor siege battles and supply nonsense in 3. That all said, this game should NOT still be full price, nor should it's DLC. It should also NOT still have denuvo deactivating my game when I don't log on often enough (I travel a lot, and that horrendous program breaks my games constantly until I can get to an internet connection).

One thing though on the campaign map one can clearly see there are plenty of ""white"" areas on the map especially in the far south past the Greenskin/Dwarf lands that could easily house the Tomb kings factions Or at least one or two factions.

Starting there was a bit of a learning curve, but after a few hours, the new mechanics became second nature. I've played in every race, and subsequently completed every campaign. They were all varied and enjoyable in their own regard. The green skins were my favorite race to play, as the second were the vampires. However, at the time I have written this review I'm playing Warhammer 2 and it is clearly the better experience. It's more cinematic, the game map is more interesting, and it has way more variables that make it a much more of a varied experience. The only reason I purchased this game was to play the Empire campaign, but I felt guilty at least for not trying the first game, and I am not one bit disappointed in making that decision. I recommend trying this game out if your a total war fan. I did not play any of the dlc, except for the free ones.

Cool lord/hero powers and battles, just takes so long to get anything good going and then it gets taken away in such a fast and unexplained manner. Repeatedly.

This game is shit. It's not what games are supposed to be. It isn't fun, it's crushing. It chews up so much time and then destroys everything you built in about 2% of the time it took to build it. game over. If you can manage to slog through the first 10 turns on easy mode, well done. It's not easy. You start to spread... you clear all 16 of the heads up messages at the start of each turn, 10+ enemy heroes ruining everything, rebellion, ambushes fkn everywhere, diplomatic changes for god knows what reasons, civs destroyed across the map. Feel good kinda stuff. Early on you slog and slog with one good army, maybe 2 smaller. You try and train up heroes to go alongside but their development is slow and when something big comes into frame, they die and you start again... get to turn 50ish and you build up 2 armies, healthy plot of land and some semblance of control. Those 2 armies are all you can afford with this. You've got limited building options so army (stables and barracks => upgrades for those for unit types) and income (diplomatic trade and pottery/weaving houses) are your two choices. You cant handle anything else. These armies are great together and carry you over 100 turns and build/defend the empire. But you can't grow those armies, too expensive. You get 2 armies, quality, good unit types that you developed and all. Then sometime before turn 100, all your alliances get cancelled, trade cancelled. Everything gets cancelled. Out of the blue. You're slogging away with the common undead enemy and then, BAM! You're left with no-one. Not too bad, got like 15 settlements, good income, two big armies, lotta ground to cover but it ain't too bad. Then those old friends declare war with you, civs on the other side of the map declare war. Dwarves, Orc and Elves from the south who you haven't even seen yet declare war, the constant undead threat from the east and the flip of allies from the west and North. Mmkay, strange... everyone hates me. I'm surrounded. Loss of income but thank all hell I built those weaving houses. Wouldn't have any army. And then turn 100ish. Chaos... has entered the chat. 6 stacked armies of heavily armoured, magical, smash and bash armies roll down from the top of the map and down the middle wiping everything out. EVERYTHING. The game gives you a recap of your ass whooping, immediately post ass whooping. It's like someone takes an eraser from the top of the map straight to you and through your little homesteads in like 5 turns. Your 2 armies are spread of course. One army gets put over a fence post up near your northern border by the new 'chaos crew' and your emperor can't make it cuz he is getting cock blocked in the south by like 4 heroes from the elves, dwarves and dead preventing any movement. You can't get rid of those enemy heroes by the way. Assassination? That's a fancy way of wasting turns. Doesn't work. You can have a witch hunter from day dot (as i did), train this guy up to be a buffed master assassin and he will hit 2/15 in the field. anything higher level than him? Forget it, don't bother. In fact. The game won't let you try. Risk>reward or some shit. Game says no. But all g. My emperor can sit here in some attrition field in the my own borders cuz the influence of these enemy heroes and my 50 turns and 20k+ investment in buildings was wrong? maybe? I don't know. But now my homes are killing me and i can't leave or fix the problems. At this point you are the oxford English dictionary definition of 'useless'. There is nothing you can do. Lords/Heroes are blocked, attacks from everyone and sackings that you can't defend or afford to rebuild from. That Injustice Crew of 6 from before have left, they sacked everything north. You've got 3 regions still though. standing up to the undead wave that just keeps taking pot shots at you with this never ending pool of resources and legendary characters that pop-up. Fend of a couple hits from the dwarves that sack you a couple times while your back is turned as youre facing the undead. Holding on, might be on a comeback. turn 125ish. NOPE. Remember all those strange dwarves, orc and elven civs that declared war on you? well they just rolled in south. With huge armies. Against your atrophy'd army and beat-up, unsupported emperor who is averaging 200+ kills a fight. The dead that the emperor has been holding off are suddenly huge, the elves are huge and the dwarves are unbeatable tough. Even for your upgraded army. You're surrounded and unable to move. your army gets wiped. But here is the best bit. You keep hitting next turn to see what happens. You've been here a while, might as well look. Emperor keeps coming back every 4 turns, dies again and again. whatever. But these 4+ civs with nothing in common with each other, other than you, are taking turns besieging your last bit of real-estate. You can't recruit while being besieged so you can't even get your emperor out. You're just being hand balled around for like 20 turns before someone invades and then game over. like wtf? That wasn't fun. I just got donkey kicked outta nowhere after spending ages building a good diplomatic network, income and try to start building a lil something. The other civs were experts at making you chase tail and undo 30 mins of work in 1 turn. These beastmasters draw you away and get attacked on the other side of your pond by the undead. Pulling these draw 4 wild cards out of nowhere and expecting a rebuild after regressing almost all of your progress repeatedly. And then the overall game limits how far you can go and makes you limp for so long before ending it all and turning the entire map against you and send in the overpowered, unbecoming from the north. no warning, just ""here you go, a hand grenade and also... the room is on fire"".

[h1] The Game [/h1]
The first turn-based strategy game in the series in the Warhammer Fantasy universe. A solid introduction to the games but lacks a bit in mechanics, limited races, map size and variety. 

[h1] The Achievements [/h1]
If this is your first time playing a Warhammer strategy game (or any other titles in the same genre from Creative Assembly), then prepare for a difficult run. The achievements span over all of the available races plus additional races that are locked behind DLC where you must complete several objectives, which include winning on the higher difficulties. Due to lack of balancing and a very strong AI it can become very difficult and even require restarts of multiple campaigns to figure out the proper strategies. Luckily there are guides and tips available online that can point you in the right direction but ultimately it comes down to personal skill. Speaking as a seasoned veteran that spent 1000 hours in Warhammer 2 before jumping into Warhammer 1 it was vastly easier to learn and finish this game in comparison to others, which could very well be the same in your case. The time to complete could range from 100 hours or less to well above 300+ hours.

[h1] Recommendation [/h1]
At its core the game is a pretty good strategy game that is quite addictive and fun despite flaws in balance, mechanics and required DLC. I therefore strongly recommend to pick it up on sale as it does feel lackluster in comparison to Warhammer 2 and 3.",1688800847,1688800847,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that said, there is one thing that makes this game enjoyable: the playable races. Shogun 2 was most damning regarding this problem, but most total wars could have samey rosters/faction mechanics resulting in samey playthroughs once you figured out ""the meta"". Certainly some factions did stand out (Aztecs in Medieval 2, Steppe Tribes in Rome 2), but meta strategy tends to be the same across factions in a given game. In contrast, this game had truly unique rosters, and factions mechanic while bare-bones compared to earlier games, further made each race stand out leading to different metas (Balanced roster for Empire, supercharged Lord with supporting troops for Vampire Counts, etc.). Whether this was worth all the aforementioned downsides is something I haven't quite figured out, but I am looking forward to playing the sequel (as soon as I get a better computer, because I tend to not upgrade my PC for a long time and how well this game runs on it clearly shows its age).",1686975433,1686975433,True,3,0,0.554806053638458252,0,True,False,False

WH II is so vast and with only the story-driven Vortex campaign it takes much longer, over 100 hours longer. With the many more tribes, each turn can take quite some time to process.

My family was really poor and couldn't afford a PC at the time so I missed a lot of big early games. Unfortunately, I eventually got my hands on CIvilization 2 Gold, which absolutely consumed my life for over a year. 4X games have always been one of my favorite genres; I knew going into this that it'd be dangerous for me and it too ended up consuming my life for a while. Warhammer-flavored Total War is a fantastic experience once you get past the learning curve, but it's not flawless (yet). 

Total War: Warhammer plays like a 4X game with slimmed down diplomacy (it's called Warhammer for a reason) but vastly expanded combat. In fact, battles are the real focus here and are part of why the series isn't considered a 4X game. Sure you could auto-resolve that deathball fight, but wouldn't it be more satisfying to slaughter that stack that just razed your city? That's what this game really boils down to: pure fun. There's no shame in dropping a boring campaign or auto-resolving those last few tedious fights. I've had several campaigns that I played for a few nights and just dropped to try out another faction or rerolled out of frustration. This honestly might be the most fun I've had with a strategy game ever and it's only the first game in the trilogy.

When I first tried playing this, I only got about two hours in before dropping it out of frustration and boredom. The difficulty curve here is more like mountain climbing, even with the handholding tutorial and in-game help system. Initially, the lore was a big turn-off too; on the surface, Warhammer Fantasy looks like knock-off Tolkien, but the more you dig, the better it gets. Dwarfs look like your cookie cutter stereotypical dwarves for example, but they're extremely petty and have a Great Book of Grudges to record every slight against them for vengeance. It's basically the inverse of W40k's lore quality, which gets dumber and edgier the deeper you dig (look up Angron and Perturabo for some real high school garbage). A lot of the lore is loosely based on a mishmash of Tolkien with the real world, but where else are you going to see goblins riding spiders into battle against Strigoi?

The main complaints I've seen against this game are about the AI but I rarely had issues with it. Enemies rarely declare obviously bad attacks, they position themselves smartly for group attacks and follow-ups, and know when to run from your deathstacks. They obviously cheat with free resources (especially Chaos's Heroes) but that's standard for the genre for decades now. The only AI complaint I have is how frustrating diplomacy can be: to put it simply, some factions just don't know when to raise the white flag. Diplomacy is the weakest point in this game (even worse than sieges), but it sounds like they eventually got some things right by the third game.

My only big issues with this game is that I wish there were more maps and more endgame options. Each race has wildly different victory conditions, with most factions of those races having specific conditions on top of that. However, they all require that the Big Bad of Chaos be put down, regardless of their position on the map. Human factions not allied with Chaos seem almost braindead against the invasion but it's hard to disparage their struggle; Chaos (and their allies) rely heavily on Large/Monster units, which require units with the Anti-Large trait to have a chance against them. Most other factions until Chaos comes knocking have few Large units, meaning you'll have to drastically reshape your armies in order to finish a campaign. This again brings me back to my earlier point: I quit several games when the Chaos invasion started just because I didn't feel like dealing with them again. 

Then again, if there were more maps and less Chaos, this would just be another 4X game with a colorful fantasy skin. TW:W is a fantastic game but I need to take a break from it because it just consumes my life. I might return to this later to try out some more factions or the additional two campaigns, but I'll probably move onto the sequel. After all this though, I don't know if I'd recommend actually playing this version of the game. The main reason to purchase this is to play the Mortal Empries map in 2 (the expanded map from this game). There's not much reason to play this version unless you specifically want to play on The Old World map (which is about a third of the actual world map). Both Total War and Warhammer games go on sale several times a year, so if you're interested in this, wait for a sale.

Pricing addendum: This game is massively overpriced, still sitting at $59.99 after almost seven years. There's a lot of expensive DLC, but you really only need to buy the factions you want to play. All of the factions are still in the game, but you just can't start as them or Confederate with them. I'd recommend watching gameplay walkthroughs or faction tutorials on YouTube before purchasing any of the DLC just because of how expensive it is.",1679838743,1685397495,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The later games look and play well, but they also ported in assets from the previous game and had to rebalance the older races to match the power creep from the later ones with varying degrees of success. There's more to game balance than increasing stat buffs and these races all seem fit for the same purpose on a conceptual level. Also, unlike some of the small touches like the intro sequences that became simpler from game to game as the number of races increased, this one had full cutscenes for every race.

It's no secret that every game has its weaknesses and there is always room for improvement. But as a long-time fan, I also know that Creative Assembly is a company that works hard to hear feedback from players and improve the game experience.

One of the positive aspects of Total War: WARHAMMER is the depth of the game. The game offers a variety of races, units and strategies to explore. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, which makes the game even more interesting and challenging. In addition, the game offers a fascinating background story that provides players with an unforgettable experience.

Another positive aspect of Total War: WARHAMMER is the graphics and gameplay. The game looks fantastic and draws players into the world of Warhammer. The battles are epic and fast-paced, offering a high level of excitement and challenge. The game is also very accessible and easy to learn, making it suitable for any type of gamer.

""Total War"" is a concept that dates back to the early 20th century, maybe late 19th. it means ""war of annihilation"", ""genocide"" in modern words. This choice of title alone should tell you everything you need to know about the game series... 
But if you need to dive deeper, here it is:

""Warhammer"" is for the delusional Sunday warrrior and worshipper of the ""mighty and manly"" Sparta (which has been a ruin for over 2000 years while ""sly and effeminate"" Athens still endures as the capital of Greece... just sayin')
Morale is a gimmick. Humans can almost run as fast as horses. Logistics, demographics, and natural ressources are just an afterthought. The only thing medieval are the graphics, because all the rest is resolutely futuristic warfare: build the biggest 'baddest' mindless robot (monster) you can get, and stick it on brainless B1 Battle Droids who'll just stand there and watch the giant kaiju come to them, even though they've already seen it trample their tanks (knights) without breaking a sweat... 
""Tell me... do you bleed?""
""Tell me... can humans like you react in 0.01 seconds to avoid the equivalent of 200.000 tons of TNT launched at them from an unseen position 2 miles away?""
""??? ... Shiiiiiit!!! My genius-level intellect had never thought of that...""

Sprinkle it with a healthy dose of racism and barely veiled Nazi theories, et voil√†! You're ready to visit total annihilation on the whole (warhammer) world for the (British) Empire! Or maybe for ""da black orc boyz from da hood, yo""? No? For the ""Jihad of the unstoppable terminators from the North"" then?! Huh... you'd rather play the brave and decent elven defenders of Tolkien?? Are you a masochist?? Just keep that to yourself, maybe - and stay away from me, don't want to be infected by ""gayism"" too...

I have been a TW fan since Shogun 1, and I own, or have owned, Rome 1, Medieval 1 & 2 (MTW2 is my fave), Empire, Napoleon, and now Warhammer 1. I stopped buying TW games when I read bad reviews for Rome 2 AND heard that CA was restricting the possible mods. 

In ALL of the previous titles I would sink hundreds to thousands of hours playing and always want to come back for more. What makes the TW series is, IMHO, the mods. MTW2 & Rome 1 both had a plethora of mods (still do), and the MTW2 BOTET version of Warhammer is just superior to this game as far as my personal enjoyment goes.

There are a few things I like about Warhammer; leader/character leveling system, spells, flying units, corruption system, heroes, diplomacy improvements, army stances (raid, channel, etc) and the overhead strategic view. 

However... that is about it. Graphics was never a big thing for me, I am more focused on gameplay. The Campaign UI is just annoying. Sometimes when I try to select a Lord I will keep selecting a Hero or city instead, even when I am clicking directly on the Lord I want to select. I usually have to choose the Lord twice before I get his movement overlay. In MTW2 and Rome 1 there was an annoying army animation when sieging cities that sometimes caused problems, but in Warhammer you can get frustrated with almost any action.

The battles don't feel very good, just two blobs running into each other. In MTW2 BOTET I would get a feel for massive battles with battle lines clearly visible. In this game I pretty much just pick a spot I want to fight on, and then make a 'doomball' of units and throw them at the AI. Spells keeps things interesting (had fun moments with Mannfred on his Zombie Dragon flying around and spell-slinging). Ultimately, though, the battles are just lacking compared to earlier titles.

The map is also very empty compared to the BOTET mod for MTW2. Not being able to play all factions (even with DLC) was another reason I stayed away from this game for so long. But that is not new, CA has been trying to make playing all factions from the get go a chore since Empire.

The unit selection per faction is acceptable, and it is neat how different factions have to act differently in order to be successful. I usually pick 3 - 4 unit types I like and then only build those units for my armies, so I don't need 4 or 5 different cavalry options, or ten different infantry choices.  

The AI is kinda lacking, but that isnt new to the series. In fact, if you have units that can hide and there is sufficient concealing terrain, you will find it hard to lose any battles, no matter the odds. This is especially noticeable during defensive battles when one of your settlements is attacked. Just break your army up into 3+ sections, all hiding, and watch the AI struggle to find them all before the battle timer runs out.

Speaking of settlements.... I dont like the system used in this game. I like being able to build all structures in a single settlement and this game forces you to specialize your towns. Your basic towns also dont have walls, or even buildings, when attacked, so you can forget all about the glorious feeling of sending your army to fight block by block through an enemy town, or the heroic defensive battles on town walls. Provincial Capitals have walls and buildings, but the 'sieges' are very mediocre compared to previous titles (except maybe Empire & Napoleon, those games had ugly sieges also).

Overall, I don't hate this game, and for $40 it was acceptable. But it will never be a game I sink thousands of hours into, as I did Rome 1 or MTW 1 & 2. It is just does not have that good of a feel, overall - and the decision by CA to limit the modding options will severely limit how long this game remains on my hard drive.

If you could have Warhammer units fighting across historical Europe, Japan, or Middle-Earth, that would go very very far in extending the lifespan of this game (though the UI needs a fix AND the battles need to be tweaked so they are comparable to MTW2 or Rome 1).

The game feels like a cash grab, and I imagine WH2 won't be any different so I am probably not going to buy any more TW games. As a player I loath DLC most of the time (just give me the full game instead of charging me $50+ and *then* charging me $10 ten more times for access to features that really should be part of the basic game package (thus making the new series of TW games cost in excess of $100 (actually closer to $160 with all DLC). 

I understand I am in the minority on this matter *shrugs* to each his own. If you don't mind paying $100+ per title to get all the DLC then I suppose this system is for you.

EDIT SOME TIME LATER......

Just sunk another 50 hours into the game, tried out lots of the steam mods. Still cannot recommend it, and this will be my last TW game I purchase in all probability.

It just gets soooo boring. Beat the game (effectively, didnt bother grinding thru once victory was super obvious) with VC twice, Empire once, and Chaos twice. The mods helped ALOT, only reason I could keep going for 50 hours.

However, the mods are extremely limited in scope and ability compared to MTW2 (ie all the mods have to be in the Warhammer World, variant world map mods for other genres unavailable), and it is a pain to ""self-mod"" and ""self-tweak"" the game to make it more enjoyable for me.

Kudos to all the modders that powered thru it!

In BOTET mod for MTW2 I could, for example, completely change my starting location, army, income, and settlements in under an hour. My last project was to move the ""Tzeentch Faction"" into the heart of the Empire, start with one settlement, and establish a human-centric sorcerer kingdom with limited daemonic summons and help defend the Empire against outside forces.

Was alot of fun, and different. Good Luck doing all that in under an hour (or two, if you wanted to completely alter your unit and building trees).

Modding for this just required too much exertion; too many changes and not seeming to be worth the hassle given the fact that the Lords seem locked (cannot even rename them) and the world itself is a so limited to just this one map.

In MTW2, if I was so inclined, I could create my own custom faction without too much difficulty (I always just added units and textures from other MTW2 mods for ease of function). Time consuming? Yes, but only because it was so easy you had so many options.

I didnt even hate the BMDB; just save often and do things in the correct order and it worked fine.

This... just a mess IMHO. Needs two 3rd Party programs just to start. MTW2 was virtually all text-based. Even the scripting was easy, and even easier because most of the time you could copy/paste/tweak what you needed.

Now, all that being said, there are good things about this game. I like the spells, I like the skill trees. I like the graphics, I like the fact they finally seemed to fix that annoying moving flag animation that made it easy to misclick a stack you were sending to reinforce a besieging stack.

I dont like the fact all armies have to have generals, but I can live with that.

So... for $40.... yeah I guess I got a fair deal for 80 hours. I might even get around to pumping those numbers up to 100 or so. 

But, still, it is a terrible disappointment compared to its illustrious past. Ever since Empire CA has been going in this direction, so its goodbye TW for me. MTW2, Shogun 1, Rome 1, and even Empire will probably have a place on my HD for a long time to come. This game and (I presume) the rest of the ""modern"" TW series?

So I am reviewing this game as a stand alone fantasy total war for those that have played previous historic total wars in the past and are wondering if this game is worth it, specifically in 2023 and at this high price (but perhaps you're here because this installment is on sale and curiosity has gotten the better of you) 

The game is good

It's very good, imaginative, thematic and uniquely stylized. 

The faction diversity is where this game truly shines. Not only are factions wildly different aesthetically but mechanically as well, in ways only a fantasy total war can provide. For example, the vampire factions have armies made up of zombies and skeleton forces that won't route. Being undead they will fight until the last unholy abomination drops. The forest elves have monstrous tree creatures, The ""Empire"" has steam punk tanks and the Dwarfs have steam punk helicopters. The Norscans (should you get the DLC) have Willy Mammoths and the Greenskin races have..... globlin archers riding wolves into combat. But it's not only the battles, different factions have different economic layouts, resources and currencies as well as options of what to do with captured prisoners. Bretonnia has peasant economy which ties in the peasant population into the economy and military. So lots of peasant archers in your army means back home growths is significantly stiffed. Several factions have buffs and characteristics that make raiding/ pillaging the economic go-to. Dwarfs like to trade and mine etc. Some factions have providence wealth tied with population growth and more advanced economies that take massive hits should production centers get razed / sacked. 


This world diversity in the campaign leads to some very engaging and interesting battles, most factions field some form of artillery, melee/range infantry, cavalry. Some have the option to recruit flying units, huge monstrous creatures steampunk machines. Watching a tree God throw down with a giant Troll is a sight to behold. Now it's not perfectly balanced, some factions are more OP than others. The aforementioned vampire counts while having un-route-able units, doesn't help much when they all suck / are all killed off before the human foes succumb to their desire to flee the undead wastelands. There are also Chaos Warriors, basically death stacks of 4-6 full armies of unholy abominations that are a challenge to overcome. (Basically the Mongols / Huns from other games but unable to negotiate). 

On to the aesthetics, the factions by design and virtue of being in a fantasy game are unrecognizably different, even in similar races. The ""Human Race"" Includes the steam punk musket wielding Empire, feudal kingdoms with a medieval french flavor, Norsca, marauders  from the North, and a bunch of unplayble minor factions of vaguely Slavic inspired fiefdoms that get got by the aforementioned vampires, chaos warriors, a bunch of roaming hordes like the beastman etc about 30 turns in to any game. 

The game itself is a tad simpler as most factions don't necessary have to worry about food, just happiness, and ""unholy corruption"". The vampire and chaos corruption that if left unchecked will make seemingly happy Providences rebel with undead / chaos armies. (Also corrupted regions have huge attrition penalties). 

The AI can make intricate calculations and the difficulty does factor into how aggressive / defensive other factions will be towards you. The factions themselves also have vastly different goals. Which is nice as no faction can truly ""conquer the world"" the Dwarf cave settlements can't be occupied by non-dwarfs, the entire far north area of Nosca can't be settled by anyone other than the Norscan tribes, They themselves can only occupy/ colonize coastal settlements outside of Norsca. The death stacks of the Beastmen and chaos warriors can't occupy or colonize, so they just burn the world down. The humans and vampires and greenskins can all occupy the same settlements but to truly expand into them it's expensive / time consuming. So in many cases it's better to just raze everything. 

The world map isn't to large but is definitely diverse. Even with a medium map size, geographic elements make it feel much vaster than it is with mountains, forest and wastelands taking many turns to traverse. 

Multiplayer exists but no ones playing

The Game also runs exceptionally well of the Steam Deck, and is somehow the most optimized total war for this platform (Out of the 4-5 TW titles I tried) 

This is a solid installment that is worth your time should you give it a chance.

I played the sequel, Warhammer 2, for a ""little while"" - after 300 hours I had to delete it. The damn game was so addictive. It has its problems. However, this ""hidden"" gem aka. the original is in its own way even more fun than the sequel.

Sure, it doesn't have all the cool features of the sequel. For example, I really wish I could abandon settlements, but it makes me think more carefully who I'll confederate with or what I'll do to a settlement I conquered. There's much less content than in the sequel, the game could get boring if you rush through content like it's a race. However, there's still plenty of styles of playing and several races to pick up. I even enjoy the much-maligned pre-rework Chaos and Beastmen.

It took a while to get into the game. The endless amount of info boxes popping up are anti-fun for me, I want to play the game, not study it. However after several campaign defeats I got into the game and even the battles. I still struggle with tougher battles, especially when there's more than 20 units to control, but hey there's autoresolve for us smooth brains. I return to the missing features, you can't see what units you'll lose in autoresolve and once again the bright side is I have to pick my battles more carefully.

And excited to try the 2nd and 3rd game as well. Generally it's all a matter of taste if you're going to like this setting. If you grew up loving high fantasy settings such as LOTR, Narnia, the Warhammer universe or any similar titles that encompasses Orcs, Dwarfs, Elves and other unique races then you're in for a good time.

Just some things to bring up when I was first coming into it:
If you've played Shogun 2, Rome 2, Atilla, Empire and Napoleon and are a fan of cinematic locked combat animations, you're not gonna see much of it here especially when it comes to infantry vs infantry. There are in fact some interesting animations with giants and other creatures when they fight smaller enemies but for the majority of the fights they're mostly bashing at each other but in terms of gameplay arguably this is a better system since individual fights won't be invulnerable during their animations.

There are no reload animations for guns and artillery, a lack of gunpowder smoke compared to what you'd see from Napoleon or Empire. The bullet projectiles from guns slightly have an arch which is unrealistic.

For sure there are many issues that others may mention especially with this total war engine but overall looking into bigger picture and appreciating the new mechanics from an epic high fantasy setting, I love it.

I also do not like the price of the Blood DLC which should be priced lower but I gotta say after getting these effects it adds so much weight to the soldiers duking it out.

Idk if it's just me but when you auto-resolve battles in Warhammer they seem to perform better with less casualties compared to other total war titles especially in normal difficulty. I suggest downloading a mod that buffs the the AIs auto-resolve in order to push you to fight battles manually since you experience the game better and it adds more meaning to your recruited troops rather than just being a number generator.",1678076781,1678085064,True,8,0,0.582983791828155518,0,True,False,False

There is only a cloud save only for the campaign and by choice, which will not be there before. It is not quite right for this money and size.
The external part of the game is well done, the economy and other things.
When you catch an enemy army, you should kill them to the last, not in part, this is complete nonsense.
Total Waris a bad playstyle for Warhammer. 
Big size maps soldiers the size of ants slow and boring battles and more nonsense. These are perhaps some of the most boring battles for Warhammer.
They should have made it in the style of Warhammer: Mark of Chaos . It's close to Total War, but better.
Bugs badly balanced and too expensive.
If anyone is thinking of buying it, get it at a big discount, the game doesn't offer much.

The start of the game is a tsunami of information that makes no sense for someone just starting. 
The actual war is so boring, everyone moves so slowly, everyone dies so slowly, and artillery feels like it would take 10 min for them to kill anything. 

The story is far from gripping. 

I played on easy mode with the Empire since the game said that their start is easy as well since I have no experience in games like this. 

On easy mode, I got completely demolished by an AI that ambushed me 10 minutes into the game. 
Their army was triple the size of mine and yes I recruited MANY units early on, was actually getting worried about the upkeep costs. 

Despite playing on the suggested easy faction and easy difficulty I get defeated 10 min after the introduction to the game, quite unfairly. 
An AI with a much bigger army than you LEGIT pops out of the woods and attacks you when you barely even know whats going on. 

This game wasted my money and 18 hours of my time. Not one minute was enjoyable. 

The old Lord of the Rings strategy games were way more fun, and a lot easier to understand, the gameplay was actually thrilling and a lot more responsive than this modern Warhammer game. Please don't listen to the positive reviews, these people are massive fans of the Warhammer universe and the mechanics of this game. I really don't see the fun factor. 

I even saw a Reddit post where someone asked the Warhammer community why people even play the game because it literally isn't fun to play, people just love the story and the war mechanics.

I played this game after watching Army of Darkness one day and I wanted to control a skeleton army that was attacking men. Well this game provided it for me in a total war way and I was not going to refuse...

After playing it I then wanted to find out the lore about the characters.....and that's where the Rabbit Hole began....

This game is still very beautiful and it's a good way to start learning a little about Warhammer Fantasy. Do remember if you are playing the third or second one you dont need this installed to unlock the Game 1 Races.. You just need to own it.

This is really a great game amd I enjoy every minute of it. I play Total War games since the first, Shogun; at first I was a bit sceptic wrt fantasy setting compared to the ""more historic"" ones, but the mechanic sticks well with it and the addition of magic and monsters is just fun. So you don't make a mistake with buying this one, it's really a great experience. Imho the game is even after so many years still worth it's money. Nevertheless, waiting for a sale is a good decision with every TW game that has so muc DLCs that still have full prices.

Even the pricing, while egregious, isn't a major upset, as I got over 100 hours out of it, which works out to be less than an Australian dollar an hour. Yes, it's an older game and should be reduced in price, but it still delivers a premier product and I can't find it in myself to be annoyed.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been hooked on the gameplay loop of 'raise armies, fight neighbours, repeat' and it isn't hard to see why. In fact, I've become one of them. Heartily recommended, and I can't wait to get started with Warhammer II.

This is the first Total War game that takes place in a fantasy setting with vampires, orcs etc. to kill each other in droves instead of an historic time period. So they had much larger creative freedom in unit design (making for some epic spectacles) and even the quotes they show during loading screens (Did the developers just make these up?). The game uses the less encumbered Total War style of the newer games in the franchise but it does have one or two nice design decisions that increase the validity of certain lesser used tactics such the inability of seemingly all the factions to conquer all cities... some are restricted to their folk type! Meaning being allies with them or burning it to the ground all of a sudden have merit because you can't occupy that territory. It looks nice (Even if some design elements remind you of fairy-tales). But it's not a cheap game really. It is indeed rather decadent! Comparatively short to other Total War titles (Eats into the value for money) and it isn't the easiest game in the world to run or download. But worthwhile nonetheless!

Most of my play time so far has been loading screens. If they won't fix it, they should at least mention a SSD is necessary to play the game as not everyone has them.  By the way, all my other games in my account, some of which have higher requirements, run properly so it's just this particular game giving me the issue. If they won't fix the problem, they should change the recommended specs on the store page to reflect what IS necessary to play the game.

This game appealed to me because of the large battles and fantasy theme, good reviews, and it was on sale for $15. This is my first Total War game.  I initially played normal and got my butt kicked. Then I played easy thinking it would be like a story mode--it wasn't: I got my butt kicked repeatedly, if not on the battlefield then in the campaign. But I watched videos and read sites and kept at it. At one point I questioned if I made a good decision buying this game, but what kept me coming back was the variety and complexity of the game: all of the factions are different, with different units, skill trees, game mechanics, and play styles. I tried different factions and kept losing, but was making incremental gains over time. After about 55 hours and many restarts, I finally won a campaign (on easy). I really like this game now (I still play on easy) and recommend it, but it has a steep learning curve and requires some persistence. If you're like me and generally don't like RTS, you can pause the battles and also put it into slow motion so that you can take your time and plan what to do. I also tend to play more for the campaign (which is turn-based) and auto-fight most battles (some of them require you to fight manually, which isn't bad, plus you can sometimes win a battle fighting manually when you would otherwise lose the auto-fight).",1666465265,1666466947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics is smooth; the battles are glorious. Most importantly, compared to more recent warhammers, your fighters actually hit other fighters on the battlefield. More recent warhammers, for some reason, targeting is not that precise; and it looks like units are attacking thin air, while nearby enemies are registering a hit. Such little details are important for complete immersion. Otherwise, what's the point of a battle simulator. 

The game play itself is more focused than in subsequent games of the series. As time went on, additional races, abilities, etc. were added. If you ask me, I would say that many of the additions are unnecessary, fluff that sounds cool on paper and for moneymaking. I personally prefer a simpler world than a million shades of grey, the storytelling is more dramatic that way.

I also like the unpredictability of diplomacy. In the newer games of the series, the making offers/counter offers is easy, and the outcomes are very predictable. WH1 diplomacy always has this uncertainty about it, and element of risk. This older mechanic feels good; it makes you really pause and consider things before clicking the 'make offer/counter offer button.' 

WH1 world looks less cartoonny and more 'realistic,' both on the campaign map and on the battlefield. At first, I wasn't sure if I liked this realism. After all, the game is about magic. But then WH1 style grew on me, and now I love it. Somehow, WH1 art makes its fantasy world more believable. In my mind, I see WH1 world just like ours, only because of reasons, infused with the chaotic magic here and there. Basically, this makes it easier to connect with the WH1 world; I don't get tired of the world; one can easily imagine living in it without constantly trying to wake up.

Should you get this game or the newer ones? If you are new to the series, I would get this one to help you decide if WH is your cup of tea. If you like it, you will end up getting WH2 and WH3 most likely anyway. However, your WH1 purchase won't be wasted, as you will be able to use WH1 races in the newer games. I have all three games and all DLCs for them; and WH1 so far is my favorite. To recap, out of the three games, it has the most immersive battles that you can zoom in and watch, tight game play, simple and engaging setting; a world that is both magic and, at the same time, is kinda like ours.",1666352916,1666352916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Mighty heroes - characters are tough and deadly, while this is contrary to the realism most Total War titles, the feel of epic, over-the-top heroism is not inappropriate in the Warhammer universe.
* Cool toys - undead monsters, dragons, wizards, and all manner of weird and wonderful units in the toolbox for you to play with

Cons:
* The existence of Beastmen when you're not playing Beastmen - while an important part of the Warhammer lore and a worthwhile inclusion in the game, their ability to appear at random, with overpowered units and capacity to out-pace your armies on the campaign map make them incredibly annoying.  More a distraction from the main game than a real addition to it.
* Only one way to play - the game focuses heavily around the story of the ""Storm of Chaos"", Archaon's great invasion of the Old World.  While a fun story, once you'e been through it a couple of times, there's no real way to play the game that doesn't result in your faction becoming a super-power, beating Archaon's hordes, and then just mopping up a largely ruined map.  You will fight world-wide Beastmen and Chaos invasions regardless of your own faction EVERY.  SINGLE.  TIME.

All in all, a very enjoyable and mechanically sound proof of concept, but a sore lack of variation in campaign play.",1664880258,1664880258,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

4 campaigns that pretty much play out eacxtly the same, boring/predictable/stupid AI. By turn 100 on hard if you havent been wiped out your basically unstoppable, and you have to slowly grind out the  victory.

The units are cool, not that you spend muchtime looking at it as you will be microing your army.

battle levels are bland and dull, world map is a little better.

I dunno wtf is with gameworkshops actively trying to destroy their own frnachise by being a bunch of greedy sooks and happy with sub par products, maybe they are still bitter at blizzard for backing out of making a warhammer game with them all those years ago which blizzard then turned into warcraft and then starcraft and made billions.

Anyone who likes the Total War Series and fantasy is going to like this game, even though, like all Total War games, it is not without its faults. 
The Total War typical gameplay is something I will not describe at length, because it should be well known at this point and even if not, it generally works very well and is always fun even for those who have never touched such a game before. There are quite a few additions to the classic gameplay in this game however, almost all of them based on the new setting, for example the addition of magic and flying units. 
Something that the Total War games have always been is visually impressive and this game is no exception. The game also suits the fantasy genre very well and there is a lot of lore and little details to find all over the world. 
There are however a few not so great things about it aswell, most of them have been faults of Total War games for a long time. One of them is the AI, which isn't very bright and to compensate that, it gets massive bonuses which makes it less fun to play on higher difficulties. Another problem is, that since Rome II: Total War you almost exclusively play siege battles. The only specific problem for this game is, that those siege battles are always the same and after some time are just no fun to play, because the enemies always have towers which shoot down half your army before it reaches the walls. You also have no other way of attacking walled settlements, because all the siege maps are basically the same and only the visuals differentiate them from each other. Where you had in previous Total War games, siege battles where you could attack from all sides and have some sort of strategy, you cannot do that here and that is my main point against this game, because you fight so many siege battles. 

Pros:
+ classic Total War gameplay
+ a lot of Fantasy lore 

Cons:
- AI
- siege battles

With my PC, the game loads way too long to the point where the loading screen is longer than the battle itself. After doing some research it seemed like the problem is that I've downloaded the game on a Hard Drive Disk(HDD) instead of my Solid State Drive (SSD). I might be wrong on this one, but it seemed like this is pretty much every Total War games in general

For those who's not good with computer, go to documents and click to 'this pc', the Windows(C) is an SSD while the rest should be Hard Drive.

This becomes a problem for me since I don't have much storage for my SSD (it contains mostly personal work stuff and it helps makes softwares like Photoshop and ect to run faster for my personal gain), and since Total War games tend to be very heavy, I have no choice but to download it on Hard Drives which forces me to wait way too long to play. I wish I knew about this because the load time is infinitely faster with SSD.

My advice for you is that if you want to get a Total War game in general, make sure you have storage for SSD so you won't have to wait for really long load times like I did.",1660452251,1660452251,False,1,0,0.399776339530944824,0,True,False,False

The Old World echoes to the clamour of ceaseless battle. The only constant is WAR!

A fantasy strategy game of legendary proportions, Total War: WARHAMMER combines an addictive turn-based campaign of epic empire-building with explosive, colossal, real-time battles. All set in the vivid and incredible world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles.

Command five wholly different races: Bretonnia, the Empire, the Dwarfs, the Vampire Counts and the Greenskins, each with their own unique characters, battlefield units and play style.

Lead your forces to war with powerful Legendary Lords from the Warhammer Fantasy Battles World, arming them with fabled weapons, armour and deadly battle magic; hard-won in individual quest chains.

For the first time in a Total War game, harness storms of magical power to aid you in battle and take to the skies with flying creatures, from ferocious dragons and wyverns to gigantic griffons.



Additional Free Content
Total War: WARHAMMER launched to critical acclaim in May 2016. Since then, a wealth of free content has been added, including the recent addition of Bretonnia as the fifth playable race in the Old World.
As well as this additional race, the rich world of Total War: WARHAMMER has been expanded since release with the inclusion of four new Legendary Lords, brand new units, new Lores of Magic and over 30 bespoke maps for single and multiplayer battle. These updates are available for free to all new and existing players.

Hundreds of hours of gameplay await you at the dawn of a new era. Total War: WARHAMMER brings to life a world of legendary heroes, towering monsters, flying creatures, storms of magical power and regiments of nightmarish warriors.
Lead Extraordinary Races
The Chivalrous knights of Bretonnia, the valiant men of the Empire, the vengeful Dwarfs, the murderous Vampire Counts and the brutal Orcs and Goblins of the Greenskin tribes. Each Race is wholly different with their own unique characters, campaign mechanics, battlefield units and play style.
Command Legendary Characters
March your forces to war as one of 12 Legendary Lords from the Warhammer Fantasy Battles World, arming them with fabled weapons, armour, mounts and deadly battle magic as you uncover their tales through a series of unique narrative quest chains.


Conquer this World
The very first Total War game to feature a fantasy setting. In the Old World Campaign, experience incredible depth and the freedom to conquer as you see fit across a gigantic sand-box map. Crafted from a twisted magical landscape and populated with an incredible array of awesome and deadly creatures, this is your chance to experience fantasy strategy on a scale as yet unimagined.
Unleash the Monsters
The battlefields of Total War: WARHAMMER echo to the swoop and roar of dragons, the bellowing of giants and the thundering hooves of monstrous cavalry. Towering beasts of both earthly and supernatural origin wade into the melee of battle, bringing death to hundreds of lesser creatures at a time.


Harness the Winds Of Magic
Smite your enemies with magical storms, melt their armour, sap their fighting spirit or bolster your own forces with devastating spells that split the sky and consume the battlefield. Rally wizards, shamans and necromancers to your armies and bend titanic and unpredictable energies to your whim.


Watch the Skies
Harass your enemies with Dwarfen Gyrocopters, plunge into their front-lines with terrifying Wyverns and achieve air superiority with a stunning array of flying units for the first time in a Total War game. Entirely new tactical possibilities present themselves as you deploy your winged minions in open battles and jaw-dropping sieges.
What is more, this title will go on to combine with two future sequels and additional content packs to create the largest Total War experience ever. An epic trilogy of titles that will redefine fantasy strategy gaming.",1660323923,1660323923,True,0,0,0.266666680574417114,0,True,False,False

I am a huge total war fan and I love the warhammer lore but the dlc for any of the total war games is ridiculous. This will be the last total war game I buy until after 2 to 4 years after release and its on sale. Creative Assembly is hurting their fan base more than anything.

If you want an arcade style Total War than this is it. The battle animations have been dulled down ( No more watching individual units fight within a group as seen in Shogun 2 and Rome 2), The map is small and broken up into areas you can't capture and die if you try to cross (but need to cross), the game was completely bare when it came out. 6 or so DLC later (including a blood option which should be in the game already) and you get this polished turd.

This is also a game you want on an SSD not a hard drive, my computer is relative fast but the transitions between battles and the campaign map take minutes. Once it is cached the transitions speed up, but I literally was playing a game on my switch.

Overall this is like if you took Rome 2 and elements of gunpowder gameplay and mashed them together with awesome looking monsters. If you are a fan of the tabletop, I would say this is a nostalgic reimagining of the original. The base building is simplified from Rome 2's or Britannia, where there's really only one upward trajectory for a building type. Development has hard stops for non-capitals of provinces so it forces you to build important buildings in the capital, which is nice, but also restrictive.

The 4x map is not as grand and interesting as a Paradox games or an interesting simulation as a AGEOD, but it has a tabletop board game feel, which I like. The tactical battle controls are at peak TW. The faction unit selection is a little annoying and I hear 2 fixes them and makes the factions more nuanced in where they can setttle. I'm looking forward to transitioning soon after finishing a campaign or two.

I would recommend playing on easy if you are a Warhammer fan that is relatively inexperienced with Total War games, as the game still offers a challenge on that difficulty and it gives you a chance to get to grips with the mechanics of a fairly deep and complex game.

They have the lore and setting down almost perfectly.
Everything feels legitimately Warhammer, the setting is appropriately grimdark, the Orcs are suitably derpy, and all the Dwarfs are British northerners workin' down t' coal mines and fightin' t' orcs.

Day one DLC Chaos has lost them some serious points with the community and was a PR miss-step on their part but I can forgive a lot when somebody actually makes a good Warhammer game.

It's also worth noting that the game works surprisingly well so soon after release, and I have encountered no bugs as of yet.

The lore is well respected with the caveat that the Dwarven AI could use use a few tweaks here and there. They are far too willing to make pacts and peace treaties, even alliances, with Orcs and Undead. I actually turned down a large sum of money for an alliance from a Dwarf faction as an Orc player in my campaign, just out of sheer instinctive disgust for any Dwarf that would do such a thing. It just felt like something no Dwarf, let alone a Dwarven king, would ever countenance.

That minor gripe aside, I'm having fun smashing stunties and being ded Orcy and I recommend this game.

Total war games have a history of being quite moddable, (it was a Warhammer mod for a previous title that almost certainly led to this game existing), so anything irritating to hardcore fans should hopefully be fixable. Who knows.

There is Steam Workshop support! Yay!


Some more notes after playing a bit more of the campaign:

Tends to run at about 40fps whereas the new Doom game runs at about 100fps on my rig, but the frame rate is not much of an issue for a game like this.

The adviser in the campaign just told me that I can't settle somewhere. It was empire territory. I was playing as Orcs. I happen to know that Orcs settle everywhere, being an incredibly hardy form of bipedal fungus, so that was a little off too, but it could be argued that that is just part of Total Wars mechanics. Still don't really see why it's necessary to restrict the play in that way but perhaps someone can enlighten me?

9/10 choppas.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Rock paper scissors balancing makes the real time battles simply a matter of sending a unit at another unit which it will always counter with no need for strategic thinking whatsoever. No naval battles at all, siege battles consist of mindlessly charging your men at a single wall. Many units with unique models yet they are all functionally indistinguishable from each other. Even gun units function the same as crossbow units with incredibly low projectile velocity and even an arc to the bullet as if it were a crossbow bolt just as one example. The campaign is equally mindless and boring. The AI cheats and spams overpowered monster units (dragons especially) that it shouldn't be able to afford and the most viable strategy for countering this is to also spam entire armies of one overpowered monster unit whatever your faction is. The different factions initially appear quite different all with unique campaign mechanics but due to the reason just stated it doesn't even matter in the end they all turn out the same experience. In both the campaign and the real time battles there is no strategy or tactics. Of course there's also the criminal monetization policies of releasing so many overpriced dlcs that are basically more of the same but with different models, nothing a free mod couldn't otherwise provide. Churning out more terrible dlc touted as a full game which are all fully priced along with tons of tiny pointless dlc that despite costing $10-$20 provide basically nothing. If you respect your time and money at all I would suggest buying a previous entry in the total war series. If you're new to Total War and just wanted this because it's more recent, please get Shogun 2 or Atilla instead, as they are far more fun and engaging in every way. If you just want a Warhammer game then Medieval II has an excellent Warhammer mod for it and costs less than a dlc for this disgrace of a game.",1649872472,1649872472,False,3,0,0.509526908397674561,0,True,False,False

In the later entries they don't even have the balancing perfect or even optimal. Again, all that being said, this trilogy of games, let alone Total War games and let alone Warhammer games, are some of the best and most engrossing I have ever played. Who knew fantasy Warhammer would translate perfectly to Total War. This original entry is beyond fun and with mods is extremely replayable. Also side note, some may consider it cheap but you can still earn achievements with mods on...and let me tell you that beating the game on Legendary difficulty is almost, not quite, but almost impossible to beat without certain mods for all but the most experienced and/or professional of gamers. As said the balancing can be wonky, some units are just OP and some magic is too. Cavalry in the first 2 games doesn't work how it should. Multiplayer has a crazy meta.

Great variation between races so each is very unique in units/ playstyle/ tactics. 
Excellent replay-ability as every campaign turns out differently (even if you play the same faction again).

For those of you coming in from other total war games, they've managed to make siege battles more fun (or less of a grind if you're like me) as well as numerous gameplay improvements that make managing your armies and settlements a lot easier. 

I would rate this game as good as tw: medieval 2 (which i think is the greatest tw game)

Note to those with integrated graphics on laptops:  While the game will technically run, and the world map is entirely playable, the 3D battlefield is so sluggish that you can barely input a minimal set of orders to react to the AI's movements.

[list]
    [*]Siege battles are a joke. They might have been deleted from this game and very little would change. Walls are more of an annoyance than a real problem and even the biggest garrisons have hard time defending against a single army.
    [*]No naval battles. I have no idea if there are any naval battles in WH universe so maybe that's the reason. Anyway they are crap as they are land battles.
    [*]Gun powder. This one is not even a joke, it's an entire circus. Rifle bullets fire in an arc, gunners can shoot even if they are in the 10th row and there is no reload animation. Empire TW from 2009 has much better gunpowder mechanics than this game.
    [*]No unit formations. Whis is my biggest problem with the game.
Why they removed something so crucial? There is not even a phalanx formation! I have no idea why devs made this decision.
    [*]No units' gear upgrades. In previous TWs blacksmith could improve the quality of soldiers gear. In this game it gives them xp instead. It seems that soldiers learn how to fight better by staring at blacksmith. I have no idea why make this change either.
    [*]No banners nor officers. It's a visual detail but I don't see why remove it. Especially when one of the first technologies of the Empire is literally a banner.
    [*]Soldiers bump into each other when units are moving through each other. It may seem like a small detail but it makes your units slowed down considerably and is annoying (especially because it wasn't the case in some older WT games).

With heroes, items, quests and storylines it adds a new dimension to the TW series that fits well and is fun to play.

The game pressures you quite a bit, it's a world where danger is everywhere. So most of the time it is not about slowly building your empire, but putting out fires threatening you. 

I do like the diplomacy system which is mostly logical. Different to previous TW titles allies or friends don't attack without reason, you can coordinate attacks as allies and confederate.

Pros:
+ Epic battles (expecially if you like fantasy battles as in LOTR)
+ Great Replayability due to different factions with distinct playstyles
+ Quests and Hero development
+ Good music and atmosphere

Cons:
- Hunting enemy armys can be tiresome since they run away and are a nuisance (unless you sabotage them). Would've been nice if stragglers disbanded if their numbers were small enough.
- Pricey for its age, expecially when you want the full DLC Game. Since the base game (with free DLC) includes a lot of content already, I'd recommend to start from there and play the starting factions. Afterwards you can decide wether you like additional content (personally I enjoyed Norsca, but it depends on playstyles you like)

Overall, I recommend it for fans of the TW series and epic fantasy battles.

I tried Warhammer 2 since then. Fixes most (if not all) the bugs. It's quite sad they neglected WH1 like this if they have the fixes in the 2nd game. Buy this game if you want the factions it grants in WH2, otherwise forget it. It's basically unsupported.

I wish Steam wasn't black and white. I like this game a lot and would almost give it a positive review, but there are some things that are so damn annoying, I would rather give a neutral one. Without that option I chose to look at the average reviews and because the game has positive reviews, I'm giving a negative one.

This game sometimes feels a bit incomplete. When I want to move an army in raiding stance to evade attrition casualties, I can move farther if I first move in normal stance and then change over to raiding stance with just enough movement points left. This in itself is annoying. What's more annoying is that if I hold down the mouse button, I can see what percentage of the move would cost me. This almost never tells me the truth. Most of the times it shows I would have 25% moves left, then as I commit to the movement, I have about 30%. However occasionally I'm dropped around 24% and can't use the stance. I couldn't figure this out in 83 hours.
Also if I move just 1 step in marching stance (because I forgot about it), I can no longer change to normal stance. Makes no sense.

The distance of an army reinforcing another army in combat is also weird. Until I found out that I can hold the button over the enemy army and another arrow appears from the reinforcing army, I had to reload lots of games. I swear sometimes an army is near the edge of another army's circle and still fails to join in. Then I move it a bit to the side and it works.

Auto resolving combat is so random, I'm terrified of it. Sometimes my full HP most elite unit dies to expendable enemies. I couldn't lose that unit in manual battles against those enemies if I tried, lol...

But the most annoying thing that really got me to write this negative review is that I received two negative traits after a battle: unjust and untrustworthy. I googled why I got it. People aren't 100% sure, because the devs refuse to answer it, but it's highly likely (based on some exported database data) that I got it, because I executed my captives.
I played as a dwarf and I executed orcs, so my dwarven subjects hate me (reduced public order for unjust) and also I steal money from the treasury (reduced income for untrustworthy)? It makes no sense. People are complaining for this on forums for 4-5 years. If I recall correctly the first complaints I read were from 2017. This is ridiculous.
What makes it even more ridiculous is that I first played Vampire Counts and always ransomed my captives, so I got the opposite traits (kind and forgot the name of the other) with bonus to public order and income. ""What a kind guy, collects ransoms.""
What makes it even more ridiculous is that I then played Bretonnia and I couldn't really choose between ransoming and executing, because the former grants negative chivalry and the latter grants positive chivalry. So I'm basically forced to execute my enemies.
What makes it even more ridiculous is that I discovered, that on the diplomacy screen my allies start to hate me if I release my enemies. So yeah, I should release the damned orcs if I want public order and money, but I should kill them if I want to confederate the other dwarves. Makes no sense. This is dumb. People point it out that it's dumb for half a decade. Devs don't do anything about it. Well, the only way I know to reward devs like these is by writing negative reviews. I'm sorry.

The game otherwise was quite addictive up until I realized why I get these negative traits. I wonder how much I'll play in the future. But either way, I stated at the start, that I wanted this review to be neutral, rather than negative.

Edit #1: As bretonnians I multiple times got the trait procrastinator. I got it for waltzing into an abandoned province and immediately colonizing its ruins. Upon colonizing I lose all my move points. Next turn I start with the procrastinator trait. With bretonnians, for some reason, the game actually explains why I got the trait. It says I spent too many turns idling in the same province. Makes no sense. It's even funnier that I get descriptions of why I got a trait as bretonnians, because they are the ones that can remove negative traits with ease. They are the ones who couldn't care less why they got the negative traits. Roflmao.

Edit #2: Warhammer is on sale on steam. The 2nd game has -66% off and all DLCs for both games -50% off. (Except Blood for the Blood God, but that's only 3 eur.) Alright, let's put them in the cart and go to checkout. 110 eur. WHAT?! WHAAAAAT?! Are you kidding me? Less than half price is still 110 eur? And the game has such epic bugs in it?

Unlike Nakai, the horde factions also work quite well here even without any rework, like what the Beastmen have in WH2.

CA thought the implementation of this series out, meaning that ownership of WH1 and its DLC carries over into the later games, unlocks content for the player, and continues to provide value even as later iterations of the game supersed past ones. That being said, it's really hard to justify playing WH1 when looking at what it provides (even with DLC). A lot of the time spent here it's pretty difficult to find fun or entertaining. This is mainly because regardless of which faction, the first edition of the Warhammer trilogy lacks any of the features prevalent in the second edition. Making the entire first edition of the game nothing more than one giant redundant & overpriced DLC.

If you are looking for a fun and immersive experience that is more meaningful from the perspectives of Strategists & Warhammer enthusiasts, you probably want to buy Total Warhammer II. Consider purchasing Warhammer I (& DLC) only if you like the whole trilogy and would want to unlock all the factions, in the grand campaign map. However the price of $60.00 for this base game + $18.99 for Wood Elves + %18.99 for the Beastmen (""THE BLOODY BEASTMEN"" which is the worst faction in Total Warhammer I.) The price should be lowered substantially to people who already own Total Warhammer II.

BAD REVIEW. All three games are a money grab, not that many playable factions and each game one comes with some DLCs that while not mandatory for making the game enjoyable, are needed to make some of the in-game factions more viable, are you fraking kidding me?!? Aahahahaha Christmas is coming, maybe some ghosts are going to GW home.
Having the wood elves in the game but having to pay in order to play them ... yeah, great

Ok, dat said. The game is very expensive but what you get is very good. Total War always needed exactly this. Magic, giants, very fun nonsense, etc. You don't need to be a Warhammer fan to enjoy it.
The factions are very different and have different mecanics, the troops of each faction are very different too, no more 20 flavours of spearmen, most of them are fun even if you are not a fan, etc.

My criticism for the content you get is that they did not balance all the content they produced. If you play this game as the empire you will be surprised of how the Norse Khorne they way through all the factions that you don't own. OMG, what's happening? It's happening that the Norsa were released some months after the main game, they are not balanced for the main game, maybe for PVP battles.

Ok, too long already.
Great TW title if it was not a money grab. It is though, so get it only if massive fan or on sale.
Depending on what faction you want to play you might have to get one of the DLCs.

The Good:

1.  Warhammer is a bit of fun.

2. We see a change of focus from Total War's increasingly CIV like emphasis on developing your economy & teching up your economy, & a lesser emphasis on the aspects of TOTAL WAR.  Here, one is expected to FIGHT!

3.  The artwork is surrealistic & the colors & explosions are impressive.  There is some originality here.
I have also perused Warhammer 2, & see a further expansion of the colorful battles with Magic & Horrifying Monsters of all kinds.

The Bad:

1.  Attempting to play on Hard, the battles appear to be unbalanced in difficulty, too strongly favoring the ai.  Defending on Hills appears to be irrelevent to the efficiency of the defense.  Dwarfs lack of a fast unit, (not even a Goat unit, as depicted in the movie version of Tolkien's ""The Hobbit""), is, in itself almost a Game Killer, as they are seriously handicapped against other civilizations.

Early in the Game, one is attacked by multiple full stacks of enemies.  The enemies apparently have no problem affording such stacks of armies, or of finding your less defended settlements.  

2.  Town defense (except for walled settlements), is conducted on open fields, where the more numerous attacker has all the advantages.  This set up represents a retreat (step back) from the improvements of combat in Attila, & to a lesser degree, in Rome II.

3.  Your soldiers often do not obey your orders, & continue to do whatever.  This tendency/lack of control has been noticed by other reviewers.

4.  Warhammer is not as much fun as I thought it would be.  It becomes WORK.

The Ugly:

1.  The General has been demoted & stands all alone, without a Guard of fellow warriors.

2.  The diplomacy is mostly irrelevent - as usual.  If it borders on you, it will usually attack you - sooner or later.  An improvement to diplomacy (long overdue), has been added to Warhammer.  There is a new ability to occasionally confederate (combine/unite your kingdom)with civs of your own kind).  This appears to work best with the Dwarves.

3. The creators of Warhammer have not attempted to add patches that would improve game balance.  I have viewed some players on-line-videos, where they manage to expand & overcome the game difficulties (specifically in videos of Warhammer II gameplay).  

3.  Do not wish to dwell on the DLC scam.

Verdict:

If I could, I would give Warhammer a Neutral Review.  Its developers deserve a C for effort.  I cannot recommend it & will return to The Witcher (another game I find quite beautiful, but difficult).  And when I lick my wounds, & wounded ego, I will attempt to intelligently play Warhammer again.  Posssibly, I will play it on Normal setting & see if that makes a difference.

The fact that vampire counts don't have ranged units and use a different system in place of morale, the Empire's artillery superiority and professionally-drilled soldiers defending their walls with the seasoned grace of a nation beset by constant war, even Bretonnia (took me 2 playthroughs to like/love them) and their reliance on heroes and Grail Reliquae to keep their morale in line, the sturdy f***ing dwarves and the mindset of the Slayers, and the nuances of keeping a giant Orc army (waaagh) from ripping itself apart by constant, brutal conquest all blends together into this wonderful tapestry that is my #1 game on steam.

[damn them for making us pay 4 DOLLARS FOR BLOOD EFFECTS] Yet all in all, money-grabbing and executive corporate BS aside, it's an amazing game worth your time and money... yeah the DLC aspect makes me mad but it's hard to stay mad when you start playing and are presented with the scale and lethality of the game and the ability of it's AI to keep you reloading saves- and like I said i've been playing since Rome 1.

What Warhammer 1 gives you is the ""Old World"" side of the Warhammer map, with the Empire, Wood Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Undead and Chaos - Warhammer 2's original campaign diverts into the ""new world"" with High Elves, Dark Elves, Skaven, Lizard men ect - as well as a ""moral empires"" mode that mashes the two games together into one. So you can get all the content from Warhammer 1 in Warhammer 2 if you wish to skip this installment. What Warhammer 1 does is give you a nice set of training wheels to learn the game systems and how to play each faction without having to play on a massive global scale. If you are a fan of the classic Fantasy Warhammer table top game you can also appreciate seeing the models brought to life, as well as the effort put in to keeping the lore of the game alive with each faction.

This is also compounded by some factions having unbalanced 'super' units which in the hands of AI make defending or attacking impossible; I've cheesed a number of encounters just to move forward. The balance of power system is widely inaccurate, no real point in using it to make any sort of judgement. The characters and interactions between factions is enjoyable, it feels like a more critical aspect of the game to maintain relationships. Field battles can be quite entertaining and involve some strategic thinking, the use of terrain matters.

The campaign map is just too far a departure from traditional TW titles and the way the game is sectioned off into DLC is off-putting.  The main bad guys, Chaos, should have been in the game from launch, but oh well.  I think I'm several years too late to gripe about DLC.  The battles can be eye pleasing but it just seems a little too arcade-y.  I suppose Empire and Shogun 2 spoiled my expectations of this title as I was hoping for something more in-depth strategy-wise.  I mean, it's fun to play the battles in TW:WH and I still enjoy that part of the game but the campaign is just lacking.  What they did get right, I felt, was the diplomacy system as it made sense to be able to unite your faction through confederation, but beyond that it's largely useless.  

I had high hopes when I bought this game, but after playing it a bit and now coming back to it I can't say I'd recommend this game to either fans of the TW or GW franchises.  Both companies have much better offerings that more fully encapsulate what each IP is really about.  For TW, I'd say give Empire or anything newer than that title a try for a good semi-historical strategy game and for GW I'd recommend either Battlefleet Gothic 2 or any of the Dawn of War series.  Space Hulk is great and so is Inquisitor if you're looking for more action.  

Anyways hope this helps anyone looking at this title to make a decision, I am a fan of both companies and I felt this one was just a bit shallow.

For years i have wanted to play warhammer total war when it first came out may 24 2016 a day before my birthday and couldnt due to me not haveing a pc to run it so i had to wait until just 4 months ago when i got this amazing omen laptop and now was able to join the warhammer total war series. This game is amazing and yeah you start with four factions without dlc. but this game had exceeded my expectations. Literally best games i have ever played in my whole life and i have been into gaming since the nes in the 90's as a child. I have warhammer 1 and 2 now and will be getting the third i must admit yes there should be more factions and yes the dlc's are pricey but i have them all now and it is totally worth it. i wont ever get into another rts because warhammer is the only thing that left me wanting more and more. i've played plenty of rts games like starcraft, halo wars, command and conquer, warhammer 40k, lord of the rings battle for middle earth 2, ancestors legacy. but none have matched the prowess of warhammer total war games.

You have to plan your campaign map movements carefully as well as make alliances in the Warhammer fashion. The orcs are big bruisers and have great monsters. The beastmen are like the orcs, but have even more monsters and have croxigors that are very terrfiying (as is the whole roster). The wood elves have a lot of special units and are great archers.

Best to look at the technology advance panel before starting to play and prioritise what you think you play style will be eg cavalry-heavy, infantry-heavy or artillery-heavy.  There are special buildings in certain settlements that help with recruiting each type of unit.  Look out for them and prioritise what you want.  I did not recruit much artillery or cavalry only basic units like mortars, pistol outriders and legendary artillery units.  You can win without recruiting greatswords as well.  You can get several trade agreements with the Dwarfs, Bretonnia and Estalia especially when Chaos show up so build these buildings early on in anticipation.  Also get technology advancements that relate to this eg build the harbours early on.

The history at the end of the game is a great feature but could be a lot better.  Make the map a lot bigger and integrate the text information with the points as they appear on the map.  Having a small map and separate text box is hard to follow; they should be integrated into one large map with text on the points. Have a graph that charts the rise and fall of all the factions.  Have the option of multiple maps showing different aspect rather than all  in one map.  Be able to download this data and view it in a spreadsheet or other software would be great too.

The buildings could be made more interesting and relevant.  For instance the resources could also effect the speed you construct buildings, like marble, recruit units such as iron.  The already do it with stock, although that could also  be a trade item.

CA should also improve naval battles.  Recruiting different naval units would be fun and having that strategic element of the game would give another dynamic. Being able to protect the Empires coast with some form of proper navy with Greatships, galleys,etc would be fun (and make sense strategically?).  An advanced form of auto resolve could developed so some strategy could be employed without having to develop tactical sea battles.  A bit like hero actions but with some extra actions or variables to control. Hero's could also be embedded with ships, maybe a naval hero or lord/admiral options...

Many of the campains I have played offered interesting and at times challenging problems sometimes a decisive victory others a crushing defeat. Much like many of the Total War series this title is a sure hit with both total war and Warhammer fans as now you can summon monsters into the field, massive giants, spiders, Dragons and warbeasts with a wicked and enjoyable theme and style which has been incorporated into the games play unlike any other of the Total War Series. The main story line follows that a great evil (Chaos) is massing an invasion upon the old world and that only if a nation could build a strong enough empire and unite all other under the same banner could the forces of evil be stopped.

I truly enjoyed playing Total war: Warhammer not just the new feel but some new in game mechanics such as magic, units and movements. In time I hope to pick up the new DLC's to grow my experience in this game being able to play as Chaos interests me greatly other nations such as Beastmen and hopefully the introduction of elvish (both Dark and good) to enter the game or the rat people in future patches/updates. its been interesting discovering the differences between this game and others of the Rome II and Attila tiles and so I give the developers a good pat on the back and encourage them to continue their good work at improving game play to have this game stand as successfully as the others.

Possible improvements
- greater unit rosters for factions (giving a grander and wider feel)
- some work on AI mechanics such as:
   the return of factions which had earlier been destroyed through rebellion like others of its title 
   wiser AI moves making use of garrison forces and walls rather then sallying out loosing such advantages
- not to sure about the idea of racial territorial holdings such as orks and dwarfs can only capture mountain regions

I'd strongly recommend this game to tacticians, strategists and empire builders as it is really is a fun and challenging game which you should try see if you can hold out as an empire and save the old world from total Chaos.

Charge full price for 1/4 of a game and sell the remaining quadrants into dividends equally about an 1/8th of the game at a time.  

Companies involved in this game are toxic waste to the community of gaming in general.  If the game and all of its DLC were put together, I STILL would not have paid 60 bucks for this load of crap.  Such lazy development with every battlefield and siege being the SAME DAMN THING every time....Total War: Shogun 1, made about 2 decades ago, has more depth than in the field of map generation than this game.  This is absolutely and rediculously sad.  

I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

First things first: this game is great. If you aren't sure, and it's on sale, get it. 

It's not a perfect game, but to date for me, it's the best Total War I've played, and they beautifully recreated the Old World of Warhammer Fantasy Battle for me to explore and experience for the first time. I love it. The factions are all quite dynamic and play differently enough to keep things fresh - Vampires have undead raising capabilities and only melee units, while the Dwarfs are exclusively heavily armored and boast powerful ranged tools. As well, they made it much easier to actually ""finish"" a game - the short and long campaign victories are treated the same by the game, and both are much more focused than, say, Rome 2, wherein you needed most of the map to win. 

The downsides: infrastructure got simplified. This is personal preference, of course, but the lack of food after games like Rome 2 and Atilla can be.. odd. They're replaced by a much easier to understand Corruption mechanic, so it's not like there's nothing there, but regardless. 
Siege battles also got simplified to very straightforward affairs. Again, this is flavored to taste, but for the most part you'll be using your Lord to tank the towers while you rush the walls or gates, or otherwise shell em with artillery. Not unfun, but it can get a bit samey. 
There's other issues, like not being able to settle in every province (they're racially locked), but they fixed that in the sequel I read, so it's not worth mentioning.

If nothing else, buying this game unlocks all the races for Total War: Warhammer 2, which I haven't played yet, but I've heard that it's somehow even better than the best in the series so far. Nice.",1627964409,1627964409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Go buy Medieval 2. It's a better game, it's got better mods, and you'll get far more for what you pay for.

Highly engrossing, makes me surprised that I never got into the Total War franchise before this title. I love the way it manages to feel like a large scale RTS as well as maintaining a distinct massive 4X board game feel.

Cons:
I can see the game's single player campaign becoming ""solvable"" seeing as there is only a single world map layout, and with faction positioning and win conditions being locked.

That being said, it still feels like a massive war game with an exorbitant amount of play time wrapped up within those bounds.

Pros:

- Great new battle system. It is simplistic and easy to use. I could compare it to creating a TW that is more action oriented if that is possible.

-Each race has its own unique strengths, so the balance in the game is just so vast. So much so that you never know what you are going to get when starting a new campaign.

-The interaface seems more easy to use, and the construction trees are simplified as well. You have a lot to build on without having to deal with other factors such as ""marrying your daughter to an opposing tribesman"" that was present in Atilla. It isn't that I didn't enjoy that part of Atilla, but it was rather side tracking from the battleground. This game delivers without having to deal with things in such a detailed manner. Which I think is nice. Others may disagree though.

-The cultural differences in the different factions are very significant giving a variety of gameplay that no other game on the market can deliver hands down.

-Movement on the map has been improved based on your race. The Dwarves for instance can travel further  by using a tunneling system that creates a new strategy. Mountains beware, no oysters please.

Cons:

-First and foremost, there isn't any longer a ""Grand Campaign"" mode. I have read that they may add this later, but at this time is an extreme disappointment that it isn't present at launch. It is possible that they may never release that mode in the game. If they don't, I will never buy another TW unless I know the grand campaign mode is available at launch.

-A lot of graphics issues for nVidia users, which I happen to be. The game runs fine, but it is just that: fine. I had to do a bit of tweaking to get it that way in the options, but the graphics are not what they should be. I hear that AMD users get to enjoy a much better graphical experience. Which in my opinion TW has just fucked off half of their customer base. What a fucking stupid thing to do. I am hoping that with patches and updates with nVidia this issue may be resolved. Apparently some of the base files in the driver names for the nVidia driver were the same in this game than for a game lost past released that had an outdated graphics system. This is total shit, and I am not so hopeful for the cooperation of nVidia and the creators of TW to work this issue out.

-The game does not have a variety of units as its predecessors. The combat has been simplified, which I like, but the variety of units have also been simplified and it eludes from creating an immersive experience. If that is why you like about the TW series this game is not for you. I imagine they will release DLC that will require further purchases in order to enjoy that aspect of the game series. This is total shit.

- The game is lessening the TW experience by cutting corners and cheapening the gameplay by dumbing down the game altogether. This breaks my heart to see such a successful series turn a corner like this. My guess is that they want to make the most money with the least amount of effort. That is business, this is life, and I am sad to say that TW is now being effected by it.


Conclusion:



So many DLCS for a game with so many flaws. It is a piss poor effort by a corporation to take your money with minimal effort put into the game.

The game is interesting, but because of the underhanded business practices, I must not recommend this game. 

It is not worth the sticker price.

I bought all of the DLC's and the title on sale, and I would have to still pay way more than $100 for the full content of the game.

Another nickel and dime scheme, except instead of dimes, it is $10 here and $10 there.

Fucking disgusting..

getting past that... for someone who has never played the series hundreds of dollars to feel like you have the complete experience is an incredibly large ask... i almost think they should make the base game free for at least do demo weekends regularly because it really doesn't matter how deep, beautiful and genuinely engaging if no one is willing to invest in it to see. 
it's really only a reasonable choice to buy this game once you've seen it's scale and potential. 
i do recommend this game, and at the moment you should buy it on sale while you can.. it takes hundreds of dollars down to about a 120$ for both games and all dlc.

One main problem that Total Warhammer has is boring battles. The battles are slow paced and take too long. It feels like you have no real unit control and the units act as big globs bumping into each other. If you are zooming in on the action, you aren't managing units; if you are managing units, it feels like there is not much to be done and your actions don't have any impact and don't matter. I shouldn't feel bummed out every time I have to actually play a battle instead of clicking auto-resolve. If Total War could make their battles more engaging like in an RTS game (of which it is not) then it might be better.

Another problem Total Warhammer has is that it can lead you to believe you are making progress only to realize ten hours too late that you picked the wrong buildings from the tech tree. The tech trees are terrible. Why can I only build six buildings in my capital? Does that sound like a capital city that you've seen? No. It's stupid. You will fill up your building slots only to realize what you should have been building when it's too late to course correct.

On the world map, you will spend way too much time dealing with redundant pop-ups and adding points to hero characters. If you make a mistake, you get to start over again or reload from a save and spend all those points all over again. There's no way to auto-allocate hero points or pre-select them.

The DLC is overpriced and sometimes hanging out a bit in ""pay-to-win"" territory, particularly for Total Warhammer II which requires you to buy DLC to use Sisters of Avelorn or confederate Avelorn or Yvresse.

Overall it fits the Sega brand - the complexity is too high for the boredom it offers.",1622051147,1625514389,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: still not worth it. The most dumb downed total war ever.

As for Total War: Warhammer 2, it is the same game at its core but at a different part of the world map with different races. This is why every1 recommends to buy both to get the ""true/optimal experience"", since the games merge, literally.
Buying this honestly depends on your budget. For 15~20$ this is an excellent value. Otherwise throw the big $$$, because this publisher is indeed thirsty as fuck for your money. Tons of DLC (but none of them are needed), means paying 200$ for the ""full experience"" but honestly, just play this for 15~20$ to see if its worth it, it already includes the DLC - you just can't play as them.

There are some gameplay issues, one being that the combat is streamlined compared to old total war games, and all maps are default/vanilla/boring. Both of them are fixed by Steel Faith Overhaul mod, so I highly recommend you to get it.

The Empire, The Dwarf, and the Vampire Counts are all interesting factions here. Once I understood who these factions were and understood their army, I had much appreciation for them. 
Going into the second game with any of these factions has proven fruitful.

Some may argue that Warhammer 2's factions are all better, and I can partly agree as my favorites are there, but this game should not be slept on. This game has been an absolute pleasure and I actually quite love the Dwarf factions.

if you are a historical total war game fan like me chances are you are not going to like this game. 

i was pretty hyped when this game was announced so that i even pre ordered the game, expecting it to be like the previous total war games. it wasnt. so what are the differences to historical total war games that make this game worse? this list is  going to be pretty subjective:
- the battles are pretty short. units rout quickly
- battles are pretty easy and not as engaging as other total war titles. for example an expensive cavalry unit will most of the time win against a medium priced spear unit. in other total war games the cavalry would simply lose.
- there are no animations for fights between 2 men
- the construction is the easiest out of all total war games. it is just not fun to build the same layout in every city
- special units like generals and agents are single entity units with enormous health pools interrupting  the feel of a battle. the were lots of occasions where the enemy army is defeated an the only one alive beeing the enemy general. your army will surround him and youll have to fast forward the battle until this one guy dies adding 5 minutes to a battle that is long over
- sieges are pretty bad only letting you attack from one specific side
- i didnt like the magic in the game. it just feels like point and click buffs for most of the time
- i dont like the rpg styled way you cant enhance the stats of the character with different types of armors weapons etc that you can give your generals ( they wont be displayed in battle ) just a point and  click buff to stats
- pretty cartoony visuals with over exaggerated animations
- no naval battles

what are the positives?
+ extremely beautiful and large map
+ a lot of factions with extreme unit variety. probably the game with the most unit variety in the franchise
+ replayability due to the different factions and different lord options per faction
+ the setting is unlike any other in the franchise with lots of love put into it so that it even got me interested in the warhammer franchise
+ beautiful character and unit models though i think they aged pretty badly compared to rome 2 or shogun 2
+ i liked the large units like giant spyders or ogres. they fit in pretty well into the tw formula. 
+ interesting battlefields. for example fighting in caves

over all it felt to me like a oversimplified tw game to attract the masses. simplifying both the battles and the construction system to a point it made the game not that enjoyable for me.
this could be a great game to get started in the franchise though i would recommend shogun 2 and rome 2 a lot more.
medieval 2 could be great too but i feel like it aged a little bit from the modern point of view.",1621902206,1621902206,False,24,2,0.595854461193084717,0,True,False,False

The single reason why I'm giving it a thumbs up is due to the clever way in which CA thought the series out, meaning that ownership of WH1 and its DLC carries over into the later games, unlocks content for the player and continues to provide value. That being said, it's really hard to justify playing WH1 when looking just at what it provides (along with the DLC). A lot of the time spent here it's pretty difficult to find fun or entertainment, mainly due to the fact that regardless of the faction you want to play, the game appears to be designed around the idea of hindering the player and not giving them tools to work with rather than providing meaningful options. Sure, you get plenty of cool looking units, but for the most part they are terribly inefficient and cost-ineffective. It's frankly pretty depressing to see how poorly melee infantry & cav perform almost across all factions in a game that has bloody WARHAMMER written in the title. 

On the flip-side, if you simply spam  stacks of the cheapest infantry you have available and just auto-resolve all of your battles, or if you stack whatever monsters your faction has available, the game completely breaks down and is entirely trivialized. Either the auto-resolve engine gets overloaded and gives you a decisive victory with next to no casualties even against an army that would completely destroy you in the manual battle, or the monsters are so overpowered than when they're stacked together they just roflstomp any and all opposition. For the most part, there is no real middle-ground where fielding a balanced army can give you strategic and tactical advantages, or at least offer options to be considered if you want to play effectively.  

A lot of the above is due to how poorly siege battles are designed here. Regardless of who you are playing, most of the game involves besieging cities. It doesn't help that all look and play the same no matter what cultures are involved (in terms of substance, the textures are different of course). The main problem is that they are completely stripped of options or mechanics and everyone from the exalted champions of chaos to the sneaky night goblins simply have to bumrush a wall, losing half the army in the process due to how overpowered the towers are, following with the hope that you can outlast the defenders and win to attrition in a frontal slog with whatever you have left. So you can suffer through that, training costly armies that perform very poorly and wasting many turns setting up sieges and recovering your loses, or you can be smart and either cheese the towers and shoot the passive AI to shit with your cheapest artillery and archers, or simply blob a stack of monsters, smash your way through the gate and roflstomp your way to victory. Or even better, just bring 3-4 stacks of the cheapest infantry you have available and auto-resolve, which is the most efficient and headache-free way of playing WH1. 

If you are looking for a fun and immersive experience that is more meaningful from the perspective of a grand strategy game, you probably want to have a look over WH2. Consider purchasing WH1 and its DLC only if you really like that game and would want to unlock additional stuff, like the grand campaign map. I'll mention that the above impressions have been formed on Normal difficulty, playing the game across all of its campaigns and with all factions. The only 2 iterations of the campaigns that I haven't completed are the Beastmen grand campaign specifically with Morghur as the starting Lord (he is essentially denied the use of the single cost-efficient units in the entire roster, minotaurs, and encouraged to use Chaos Spawn, which are worthless) and Wintertooth (because I would have done an exact carbon-copy playthrough of the campaign with Norsca, as going for non-mammoth armies and pledging to anyone but the serpent god means just hamstringing yourself for no benefit).",1621762607,1621762607,True,87,3,0.804429709911346436,7,True,False,False

The 4x strategy portion of the game is practically nonexistent as everything has been streamlined: no tech tree options, no food upkeep, severely unbalanced factions, a Dynasty Warriors-like unrealistic hero, and a boring agent system.

On top of this, there's no tutorial campaign any more, despite the fact that the game has the most changes to the actual units. Which leads to what the game seems to do well - battles. With new unit types, this is the first Total War since Empire and Napoleon that actually feels fresh. But I'm not looking for a simple skirmish game; I want a strategy title.

Honestly, the game is stale. Adding more factions doesnt make a game more fun at the end of the day. Everyone is hoping they improve sieges but honestly warhammer 3 is gonna need more then that.

I got this game on a sale, the full price for a 5 year old game it's just bonkers, and I'll wait for sales to get the dlcs too, although there's enough content in the base game to keep me occupied for quite some time.

The good:
- factions have unique traits, mechanics, units and playstyles
- units are diverse enough and early game units don't really get obsolete, used correctly they still pack a punch
- not a lot of economy micromanagement which lets you focus on battle and conquering
- challenging campaign: [spoiler] having to deal with vampiric and chaos corruption, as well as the feeling of impending doom when chaos armies are steamrolling all the factions on the map [/spoiler]

The bad:
- units are pretty dumb, there's a lot of micromanagement to be done in battle
- in battle units are slow, moving some parts of the army across the map is just mind numbingly slow
- some mechanics are poorly explained or not at all; magic for instance, I still have no idea how that works
- dumb but also cheating AI; chaos armies just steamroll over everything, your allies don't move on common targets
- there's no way to efficiently defend your territory once it grows, there's a limited number of money you can make and a limited number of armies you can support; this might be seen as a challenge, but it's not really a great one.

Bottom line, get it, play it. Base game has enough content to keep you busy for a long time and there's a lot of replayability value.",1617267828,1617267828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Am an experienced and longstanding Total War fan, absolutely love Medieval, Rome, Medieval II but the massive changes to the playing format and the graphics package for Warhammer Total War makes the game absolutely  frustrating and unenjoyable to play.

The graphics make the game unintelligible, the building and troop development are utterly different from previous games and the tutorial is non existent all bar essays of interlaced instructions that you‚Äôd need a post grad to understand. So despite hours of game play I still cant work out how to build troops or buildings in settlements, or move troops out!

What the game makers are thinking making these statements, only wish I could get my money back!

The game gives the player absolute control over the chosen faction's battles either in combat or in politics.  What makes it great is that every action has a consequence in battles & politics, in how the rest of the continent reacts to the choices made by the player.

Warhammer has a richly detailed world that is deeply immersive to at lest to the distortion of mine.  The world reacts to each faction that the player can choose in a different way.  For instance, there are two vampire factions & both are different experiences despite them both being of the same faction.  The other states seem to react to either faction in a different way.

364360,87720695,76561198037352861,0,2,7272,0,3278,1620819101,"Sigh. I really wanted to like this game. After the awful mess that was Shogun 2, I hoped that the team would correct the atrocious mechanics. Sadly, despite substantial improvements, this game has missed the mark.

The main problem is the tactical battles. The mechanics are broken. Ignore any reviews advising you on how to win battles - there is simply no point. You can't win anything except when you have the most overwhelming numerical superiority. The following comments apply to a mix of normal and hard difficulty.

Firstly, the mechanics are grossly titled to favour the enemy. Units which are useless when you use them are nigh-invincible when you are facing them with your units.
*For example - zombies and skeletons. When I was playing VC, in a one-on-one fight, zombies and skeletons would not defeat empire units. When I am empire, I can have zombies facing two halberdier units, and charged in the rear by two units of reiksguard and a lord, and the zombies will hold out for five minutes. This gives another unit of zombies time to attack and destroy your units. 
*In another example - crypt ghouls are defeated in ~20 seconds by units of halberdiers that they charge. However, when I take the halberdiers, the ghouls push them out of position and will hold their own against three units of halberdiers (attacking from the sides). I need to charge in a lord to finish them off.
*Bats - absolutely useless when I use them. Two full units have been defeated by artillery. When facing them - one unit of bats will destroy two units of crossbowmen before I've realised they are under attack. Spearmen or halberdiers are reduced to at least half strength, and the bats just fly away, with above half of their unit strength.
*Heroes - mine are durable enough, but do no damage. I've seen a level one enemy hero take on four units of spearmen and wipe them out.
*Cavalry - black knights do no damage when they charge. At all. Pointless. You cannot charge spears head-on, you are wiped out in seconds. However, when I charge enemy cavalry with three units of halberdiers - they take several minutes to reduce the enemy to half strength. 

In all of these cases, I have upgraded the units with technology advances and lord skills. 

*Enemy armies seem to be more powerful when their lord is at a higher level. I can outlevel an inferior army by at least three levels, and the best I have ever done is a close victory. It is impossible to win against equal armies when the enemy lord is of higher level. Impossible. Your units simply don't do damage. Besides, the enemy lord could literally - without exaggeration - defeat your entire army by himself. I've played battles where this is the case (especially against Throgg). 
*Enemy artillery is devastating when used against you. When I use it - almost always misses, does little damage when it does hit. One enemy artillery is worth at least five of yours.
*Spells often simply don't work. The mechanics are broken. I read advice to use soul leech (VC power), but it only works 50% of the time.

Now, don't get me started on chaos warriors. They are simply invincible. Only one thing can stop them - missile troops. There are no infantry which will stand against them. I don't mean one-to-one. I've had five units surrounding them, and the warriors emerged victorious. I've had five fighting them, and charged in the rear with 2-3 cavalry units. I won, but most of my 7-8 units were on 25%. Most chaos armies are composed of at least 10 units. Five is sufficient to defeat any army I can field (without missile troops). It is not possible to defeat chaos armies with only one stack. You can do it with two, but you are left with at best 30% of your troops. Note, this is on normal difficulty.

Forget about fighting siege in battle mode. I've surrounded a unit of grave guard with five swordsmen and lost. Five units is enough to decimate any attacking army. Except when you are defending. Your units last seconds when enemy units use ladders. Even though they outnumber the attacker 3-to-1. 

Of course, the controls are so clunky you can't tell when you have selected a unit. It is very difficult to attack enemy units (why is this so hard? this was done very well in the first Rome, and in Medieval 2), because you can't click on them easily (especially enemy heroes). You have to zoom in and fiddle with it.

All of this leaves you with auto-resolve. Which predicts poorly. And you rarely win on an even footing. Meaning your only option is to fight an enemy stack with two of your own...
...and this is where the strategic map bugs come into play. The enemy can move absurd distances sometimes. You retreat randomly. Enemy stacks jump from 4-5 units to 15 in one turn. Normally gaining the most powerful units the enemy has. From nowhere (this is especially the case with chaos, but applies to VC, too). Meaning you can't win auto-resolve.

So much of the strategy map works, but the broken battle system makes this depressing. The not-quite-broken auto-resolve and enemy movement system means you are constantly reloading so your stacks aren't out of place.

Overall, a pale shadow of Rome: TW and Medieval 2. Substantially better games designed by people who knew what they were doing. Warhammer: TW - and, indeed, every TW series since Medieval 2 - feels like it hasn't been play-tested, and has used mechanics that were the beta of Rome: TW. Disappointing.

Oh, and the ridiculously long load time is annoying. I have to read a book in between battles. I can watch a tv show before the game even boots.

This game is the closest to the original Total War formula of the series but mixes it up a little with magic and quest battles. Magic can turn the tide of battle and make even the smallest force take on bigger hordes. The Quest Battles offer a set of missions to accomplish and culminate in a battle that upon winning yields special prizes.

The stuff from earlier Total War games are here too but have been tweaked to match the setting. For instance, each faction belongs to a certain race and this determines what type of units and strengths and weaknesses armies have. Gone are the days where no matter what faction you played, you really only had a handful of unit types to choose from that only differed in stats. Total Warhammer introduces Wizards, Monsters and flying units. But these are merely the tip of the iceberg. 

Although at times the difficulty can be a little arduous and overwhelming, it suits the gravity of the Chaos invasion this games introduces and which permeates all of the games in this series. With that said, one major weakness of the game is that some factions are not fully explored or balanced to match up against others. Some of these inequalities are addressed in Total Warhammer II but not fully.

In summary, if you are a big fan of the Total war formula, this game is as faithful to that formula as any other. It cleverly melds it into the lore and style of the table top game that it draws  inspiration from without losing focus on what makes Total War great. If you want more streamlined gameplay, you will most definitely want to grab Warhammer II instead. But, to fully enjoy that game, you might as well pick this one up as it helps build up that game.

Final verdict: 8.5 Warhammers out of 10.

Finally - and this is the big one for me - but mileage may vary based on the kind of game you are hoping that this is:

I had hoped the kingdom 4x part of this game to be much more detailed and 'better'. It felt tacked on and very light to me. 

Conversely I had hoped the 'RTS' portion of this to be simple - instead it felt very typical RTS.  

I wanted a 4x game with some real-time combat, instead I got a RTS game with some tack-on 4x elements that were a complete let down.

Even worse I purchased 2 copies of it 1 for myself , 1 for my son as a gift.

Inane text, especially the loading texts.  They used to be quotes from historical figures, with a meaningful content.  Here it is just trite parodies.

This game started the Total War Warhammer series. For its time it was something amazing and refreshing. People wanted a fantasy total war for years and few IPs were more suited for that than the warhammer universe. It grew to one of the most developed and ambitious  strategy game in years. I had lots of fun  with this title and I needed little to be convinced when warhammer 2 was going to be released ( I started playing like 2 weeks before that).  but as a potential purchaser you want to ask yourself  a question: is this game for me ?  The answer depends if you have already warhammer 2. If you don't own it then no this game is not for you. 

I have around 1600 hours in both games and I recommend getting the second game. Mainly for the many quality of life updates,more interesting mechanics and updated warhammer 1 races and the combined Mortal Empires campaign.  As of now Total War Warhammer 1 is more of a ""expansion"" for game two. The races are a nice adition to the Mortal Empires campaign and the second game allows you to purchase a separate DLC that enables you to play some of the game 1 races in the Vortex campaign (Markus Wulfhart in the Hunter and the Beast for example). This is a great feature to help you decide which race you like.

So get this on a sale and play warhammer 2. You will enjoy thousands of hours of gameplay.",1612729868,1612729981,True,13,1,0.59405672550201416,0,True,False,False

First of all Praise sigmar.

It's a bit slower than TW Warhammer II, but that in itself it's the beauty of this one.
Diplomacy i found meaningful.
I felt a more races factions/race matters in this one too.
Doing Empire campaing i got to see why Franz it's the best lol

Praise sigmar.

√â um rts com uma campanha mais lenta que o TW:Warhammer II para quem jogou o 2 e veio para o um pode ser ruim esse fator, por outro lado ele favorece um estilo defensivo e mais devagar com mais batalhas de cerco. 
Diplomacia nesse me ajudei mais que no outro.
Percebi que as guerras tem um foco mais forte em ra√ßas distintas e/ou certas fac√ß√µes que cria um certo alinhamento de coopera√ß√£o.

The lore is amazing, feels like World of Warcraft but different. (Now i do hope for a warhammer fantasy mmorpg lol). Pretty rich in details and immersion as well as the gameplay. They are greedy and shitty with the expensive DLC's, but this is one of those games that i just tell them ""SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY"" that's how good this game is. (If you are into medieval/fantasy universes that is).  

One thing that this game does better than other Total War games is that the factions feel unique and there are lots of them! 

Usually with other total war games let's pick RTW 2 for this example, yes they do have lots of factions, but it's pretty much an illusion as most of them play the same. In truth you have 4 factions at most (Roman culture, Barbarian culture, hellenistic and sand people culture ?)  If you try to replay with other factions you will get bored pretty fast as you will discover this illusion. 

BUT with TW Warhammer that's not the case! Having so many factions and each of them is pretty unique and have to change the play style to fit it's something that gives huge replayability value!

First of all, about half the game is locked behind multiple pay walls. Even on sale major $$$ to actually get all factions.  Some bugs here and there (Dwarf book of grudges bug means I could not complete campaign for one), Annoying little surprises for each faction (You must randomly move your armies around the map each turn as Bretonnia or you get big penalties ???), tedious city management (want to go fight with that nice army? ha! they must stay behind so your city won't rebel.  Don't want them to rebel? turn off taxes.  Now you can't pay your army! Are we having fun yet?). 
Strange map/army interactions (want to attack that enemy army? sorry! you can't for some reason!  Were you hoping to reinforce this army? Sorry! not close enough! Sorry your beloved hero you spent so much time cultivating is now dead)
 So so SO many turn reloads with really long load times.
The worst part is that the highlight of the game; the truly impressive real time strategy battles, are annoying long and just about who has the better troops.  The maps are ludicrously large and that's not a good thing. A single powerful terror causing monster will rout an entire field of weaker troops.  Skimishing range troops are impossible to box in.  Spells are cool but very weak. Even worse, the auto battle ALWAYS does better than you! How? no idea because there is no replay to watch and learn from; it's just a calculation.
Sure all those cool looking battles in the trailers and gameplay clips look neat but you won't be zooming in to enjoy that during your game.  You are too busy trying to keep your troops from standing there picking their noses while getting shot.

HOLY CRAP WHAT HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO!?

The battles look FUCKING AWESOME, the units REALLY interact (finishers and beheadings and everything) and not just stand there stare at each other. The campaign has SO MANY factions and you can have real alliances and confederations and it's not just siege after siege after siege and random crap from the AI. The campaign map is really diverse and the races play very different.

This is now my favourite game of the last couple of years.

JUST TRY (without any dlc) and see if it's the same for you.

I highly recommend buying it when it‚Äôs on sale. It can frequently be found 50-75% off multiple times per year. I bought it and all the DLC on sale for a little over $50 USD.
 

I bought this game after enjoying its sequel TWWH2 and wanted to expand on playing that game as it adds an expanded campaign map(Mortal Empires) that is widely considered superior to the base Vortex campaign as well as adding the ‚ÄúOld World‚Äù factions from this game. I decided I would play this game before I play the Mortal Empires map for WH2. I did enjoy it and can mention a number of things the game does well and not so well, but every one of them TWWH2 does just as good or better. You can play this game and have a good time with it, but you can and might as well just get it to add to your play through for TWWH2. I feel weird saying spend money on a game and never play it, but that‚Äôs what I would recommend as you aren‚Äôt really missing anything because you are basically playing the best of two games at once when you play the Mortal Empires campaign. This is why I and many others now consider it an expansion pack/DLC for TWWH2, even though it came out first.

 

The game consists of varied factions with unique play styles. There are humans, vampires, dwarfs, elves, beasts and demons. Each has strengths and weaknesses that you will need to use to you advantage to win battles and the campaign. 

 

Addressing some Negative reviews.

A common review of just about all Total War games raised by a vocal portion of the player base criticizes CA for releasing DLCs that all together end up being as much or more expensive as the base game and feeling the ‚Äúfull game‚Äù is locked behind this sort of DLC paywall. I appreciate were they are coming from, but I feel CA is doing it the best way for both the players and themselves. Firstly, if you buy the game at full price at release(otherwise wait for one of their frequent sales) you can get hundreds of hours of game play for your $60 USD, far more than many other games or other forms of entertainment that you would potentially substitute that time and money for. I feel a few hundred hours of fun is a great deal for my money and if it‚Äôs not, their frequent, heavily discounted sales ought to make it worth it for anyone that enjoys this genre of games. The DLC portion of the game gives the hard-core fans hundreds of hours more playtime for about the same price and a similar reasoning of entertainment for the money makes it worth it for us. Because I believe the complete package of the Total War games plus all their DLC to be worth more than the ~$150(it would be around $250 for both WH and WH2 if you bought and played them from release) you would pay at release for these games. But, if they charged that at release, I may be hesitant to buy it just in case I didn‚Äôt enjoy it and many wouldn‚Äôt consider it, meaning CA would have spent the same amount of money and time making it, but would have fewer players and less money to show for it. By building a base game and adding varying amounts of DLC based on it‚Äôs popularity, they don‚Äôt waste resources on DLC for less played games and redirect resources to ones we want to play more. It also allows them to release the base game at a completive price that allows players to take a chance on an historically strong franchise instead of having to stomach $150 upfront that would lock many players out of the franchise entirely. Even considering that Steam seems to be generous with their return policy from what I have heard from others. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, the DLC route avoids the real micro-transactions prominent in other games. I would stop playing their games entirely if the put in pay to win mechanics in their games. Some may disagree with me, but I find it unreasonable to expect CA to put out 1,000 or more hours of quality content for $60 USD. Where are you finding entertainment for less money per hour?

 

The second pricing themed reviews are mainly about the price increase due to inflation that mainly impacted non-US players. Not being political, but economically speaking, just like you have to manage your in-game economy or else bad things happen, you have to manage it in real life too. Poor monetary decisions by your government(like printing money) can lead to inflation. That means the money your currency can be converted for into other currencies is now worth less than it was before(the creators would take a pay cut for their hard work due to something that is out of their control). Blaming Steam or CA is unfair to them in this situation. These negative reviews should be redirected towards their politicians, not CA/Steam.

 

There are some real problems with the game. While not game breaking, there is some degree of ‚Äúagent spam,‚Äù fortunately it can be partially alleviated with a workshop mod. Heroes can be in armies as powerful, single entity units or out on the map doing work formally done by agents. The agent aspect is the problem, like some previous TW games, the AI can spam them and it‚Äôs more tedious and annoying to deal with them than it is difficult. Another smaller issue is unit balancing, especially in auto resolve. Some units will get ~700 out of 1,200 total kills in an auto-resolve battle, while some get 0-10. It can be used to your advantage if you are interested in a quicker auto-resolve focused play through, but I think they could have done a little better in the balancing department. Some magic spells can be very powerful and some aren‚Äôt worth the cost. I will add the unit balancing and magic are better balanced in TWWH2, while there is still some agent spam.

 

Overall, the game itself is a bit dated after playing TWWH2 and Three Kingdoms, but you can still have a good time, just remember to get in on sale! I was able to buy both TW Warhammer games and all the DLC for both games for around $130 if memory serves.",1606511070,1606571453,True,61,2,0.785193383693695068,12,True,False,False

-(expensive) DLCs

I'm a big fan of the Total War series and Warhammer 40k, but after the disaster called Rome II: Total War, I was hesitant with buying the game. But when Valve added the Dota 2 Treasure of the Old World, I prepurchased it and holy sh*t, that was a good decision (thx Valve!).
Like all Total War Games it features real-time (Combat) and turn-based (Moving Armies, Upgrading Cities, Recruiting Troops, Diplomacy, Research) Elements, but it all happens in the ""Old World"", not in the real world. And instead of British, French, ... you play and fight Orks, Elves, Dwarves, Humans and other fantasy races.


The gameplay is very smooth and focuses on raiding and combat. Citybuilding is reduced to ~10 different buildings (most are upgradeable) with a limited amount of building-slots per city. Since your building slots are limited, you have an incentive to conquer more cities. Cities are grouped into provinces - if you control an entire province you gain bonuses (another incentive to conquer).
The main aspect of the game is land combat. Like all Total War games, your soldiers are grouped into units and fight in formation, but this time it's not (only) humans fighting each other, but also Orks, Dwarves, Dragons, Trolls,... Another innovation is the introduction of mages and flying units.
Your Armies are led by some default commanders (of various types) and Legendary Lords like Karl Franz or Grimgor Ironhide. All commanders gain levels by Fighting and Raiding - those levels can be used to give them a mount or buff the character or the army they are commanding. Legendary Lords are usually stronger and cannot be killed (if they are assassinated or their army is annihilated they are ""wounded"" for a few turns). Commanders can also equip items and Legendary Lords have access to unique items by fulfilling quests, which involve moving the hero to a certain location on the map and defeating at least one army.

One of the biggest achievement of the game is the balance between the races - each race feels and plays differently and they still fare equally well on the battlefield. For example Orks get strong melee infantry and rely on numbers while Dwarves have strong melee infantry and strong artillery, Bretonnia on the other hand is heavily cavalry focused. Speaking of cavalry, Warhammer Total War seems to be the first game in the series where cavalry feels right - it was way too strong in Rome and Medieval II, but got demolished in Empire - now its useful without being OP.

Total War: Warhammer succeeds where Third Age Total War (a Medieval 2 mod) somewhat failed: the races are all balanced and fun to play.

Last but not least I have to praise the setting and atmosphere - Games Workshop's worlds are just perfect for grimdark, brutal and epic games and Warhammer:Total War is just such a game. Every race and it's habitat feels right and the permanent threat of neighbouring factions and chaos is always at the back of your head. The atmosphere is further enhanced by great memorable soundtracks.

Total War: Warhammer was my first contact with Warhammer Fantasy and now I'm deeply in love with the franchise.",1522848632,1606420537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

after giving this game a fair chance i have to say it's totally horrendous. many of the core mechanics are heavily flawed but the worst thing by far is the hideous amount of cheating the campaign ai commits alongside their fixation in harassing the player and overall just being annoying and obnoxious.

playing the empire campaign on ""hard"" and in turn 13 i'm getting attacked in 3 different fronts at once by hordes who apparently not only have full banner armies with elite units, 2 beastmen hordes and 1 orc horde and one undead faction which all have decided to ignore the other 50 ai players and focus down on my 4 settlements because ""fuck you in particular"", i can't field more than a single strong army without crippling my income, i could build garrisons everywhere but that would cripple my economy aswell as my growth and besides garrison buildings kinda suck anyhow. this would be fine if i could just build units to defend my cities like you could in every pre-rome 2 total war game but that's forbidden now.

but that's alright, as is tradition in total war games, the battle ai is so braindead that i can easily beat them while taking minimal casualties 99% of the time. but of course the ai seems to be aware of this, so they wait in the campaign map just out of sight and the moment i dare to move my army out of a settlement they will instantly attack that undefended settlement with a full banner army, so really that's where the difficulty comes from during the early game, playing hide and seek with the ai on the campaign map, once you get past that stage the game is pretty much over and you've already won.

i've never felt challenged while playing this game, only mildly annoyed. the older total war games were enjoyable to play even if they were pretty easy, but this one feels like an exercise in frustration",1499342834,1604794985,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,1,True,False,False

-----
Honestly, I usually write pretty long and in-depth reviews, but I think this one is very simple. Total War: Warhammer II is a better game in pretty much every regard. Literally the only reason I see to buy this game is if you want the Mortal Empires campaign in Warhammer II. Sure, that‚Äôs fine if you love Warhammer II and want that campaign‚Ä¶but that still means you should buy Warhammer II first and see if you like that game.  So, the final verdict is: spend your money on Warhammer II‚Ä¶there are plenty of places to drop cash on that game.
-----
A bit of context:

I played my first campaign in 2019, 3 years after this game released, and 2 years after Warhammer II release. It was fine. I even had fun. The campaign story was below average, but I sunk my teeth into this heavy 4X wargame just fine anyway. It still had occasional bugs, with one preventing me from being able to complete my dwarf campaign.

Then, 9 months later, I play Warhammer II and the game is more polished, MUCH better maps, very few bugs, more refined, and a neat campaign. And‚Ä¶it was the Exact. Same. Game. Sure, different factions and maps‚Ä¶but really it was the same game. It left me feeling like they took the lessons they learned from this game, used them to improve Warhammer II, and did not bother to update this game with those same lessons.
 
So, I literally see no reason to buy and play Warhammer I. Just buy and play Warhammer II. If the siren‚Äôs call of the Mortal Empires campaign (a Warhammer II campaign that also requires this game to play) latches into your soul at that point‚Ä¶sure I could justify buying this game. But sadly, that still means you are buying Warhammer I to just play a Warhammer II campaign. If this smacks a bit of corporate greed, you are not the only one that smells that. It‚Äôs up to you to determine if it is worth it. In the end, I like Warhammer II enough that I would end up buying this game to support the devs and hope to get a Warhammer III. But make that choice after you play Warhammer II.",1604101921,1604101921,False,1,0,0.493877530097961426,0,True,False,False

I have similar problems with other factions. As much as I enjoy this game and could spend hours going on and on about the level of nuanced detail that's involved with it, I do miss the more simplistic days of Dawn of War.

I love the warhammer fantasy universe and lore and the game generally does a good job of setting the scene, I like the unit design, but I just hate the battles so much it spoils the entire experience.  
I have spent many hours playing total war titles; Rome, Rome 2, Attila, Shogun 2, Empire etc and I've always enjoyed the battles but they have utterly munted it on this one. Plenty of people play it and its successor so others obviously disagree but I really don't get any satisfaction from the battles.  Victory comes from having more and/or better units and a couple of well placed spells can turn the tide.   Who cares?  Trying to be tactial with positioning and terrain really seems to have fairly marginal effects and fighting combat through trees is just awful as you can barely see what units are engaged.  And without battles through settlements and decent sieges they are all very samey.
The tech tree is also very disappointing, no sense of progression gained from it at all.  Build a building then you can spend a long time researching a selection of three buffs.  Woohoo.

I will now attempt to explain why in this review and probably end up ranting in the process. This is my first time reviewing a game so bear with me if the review is a bit shit. ;)

Now i haven't played a lot of Total: War games.... But i can confidently say that from all the Total: War games i've played and watched, the battle system is much better in this one. It feels a lot more satisfying, and it actually feels like you're doing damage for once, instead of 2 armies just staring each other to death. There is also many new interesting units and mechanics due to the fantasy setting. So yeah the battle system definitly improved a lot in my opinion.  

The setting of the Warhammer universe offers a nice and unique take on both Total: War and Warhammer. 
I personaly am a huge fan of the choice they made to stray away from the usual historical stuff to try something new instead.

Now to the bad stuff... The game is a lot more simple and has much less replayability than most other Total: War games. 
It becomes boring very fast due to the game pretty much playing out the exact same way everytime. This combined with the limited amount of factions makes the replayability much worse than previous titles. 

Now to wrap it all up. 
Is it a good game? Yes, very much so. 
Is it worth the full price? Nope.
I recommend picking it up on a sale if you're either a very avid Total: War fan, or someone completely new to the franchise. Play it for a bit, and see if you like it then you can pick up the dlc's afterwards.",1492311085,1600987881,True,2,1,0.490883588790893555,0,True,False,False

The different factions play is fun and in the campaign can make epic moments. But the problems that it has are why I added mods to it. 1st to balance out the Ai's bullshit cheats i use mods to stop them from having late tier units and monsters while i‚Äôm still 20 turns in. Many factions have problems dealing with some of the later tier when you just got your first cannons or cav. 2nd are the open land maps. They barely have anything other than hills, trees, and one or two rocks, they are bare bones and very few have choke points. 3rd siege maps and village battles. The siege maps are the worst and were falsely advertised by the dev, as pointed out by people like MandaloreGaming  part 1  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_iXKhoujA&list=PLitAxwTh-JeTF6qHZNUaChCvngEFQvtip&index=6&t=3208s

As for the town battles are the same maps as for open areas.4th problem is more one the whole buying aspect, if you want to play the old T.W. warhammer 1 factions you need to buy the first game, btw which is still $60.00 plus each the dlc if you want bounces for your preferred faction. ‚ÄúThis need to change soon because it‚Äôs a FOUR YEARS OLD GAME‚Äù not only that each dlc cost a lot to buy and are sometimes not worth it. so wait for a sale or humble bundle to buy it cheap.

Keeping horde faction mechanics (and using it 4 Chaos) from Attila was genius. The monsters (shaggoths and bone dragons, and mammoths oh my! just2 name a few) and spells/hexes/items add many tactical options to the battles.  And of course the animations are uber dope, you can save battle replays to rewatch when that Chaos Giant stomps your enemies or that Comet of Casadora descends gloriously from the heavens to turn enemy heroes into a shimmering icy crater.  Campaign is well done with a fruck ton of factions (with purchase of expansion packs) and troop rosters. They keep improving the A.I. particularly the strategy map A.I. The battle AI is gettiing better but obviously multiplayer is the way to go if you want a real challenge. Lots of mods for people who like cheat codes and customizing. Warhammer 2 is also excellent, but as the series goes on the map gets bigger and bigger (which is awesome but more time consuming, lots of water and island hopping on a huuuge map).  Some people complain about Warhammer 1 because certain factions are restricted from ""occupying"" all the provinces on the map. (i.e. Human/Vampire cannot occupy Dwarf/Orc-Goblin). You can still Sack/Raze, but for those who absolutely must paint the whole map one color there is a mod that allows all factions to own all provinces.
Why do I love this game so much?  I love how many times you can replay the campaigns and it feels different every time, (even using your favorite faction over and over again).  I never get tire of playing the game, and its just as fun now (maybe more so) as when it first dropped so many years ago.  I used to play Warhammer tabletop when I was a kid- the tabletop had strategy and complexity but battles took forever and you had to memorize thousands of rules like a lawyer so it was way more work, and killing stuff will all the dice rolls could be like pulling teeth. For example on the tabletop, for each catapault you would have to guess a distance and then measure (with a tape measure i kid u not) it out in inches on the table(plus a ""scatter"" dice roll to account for accuracy skill of the catapault crew). Then put the damage radius circle down to see how many enemy models were hit and then armour rolls to see how many were killed. And at the end of that 3-5 min process usually the catapault misses and nobody dies. So yea the computer game version is way more action packed, very satisfying to group select 2-10 pieces of artillery and aim and fire them pretty much instantaneously (unless they are reloading) then watch fire and flame devastate the enemy ranks as enemy models fly through the air.  Battles are like your own personal Lord of the Rings movies, and Game of Thrones episodes. I just hope they keep making expansion packs for all the Warhammers not just Warhammer 2 (and eventually Warhammer 3 when it drops). Thank you Total War game developers, can't wait for more Warhammer games its the gold standard. Always looking for more content, keep it coming.",1598985969,1598985969,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not only did they do Warhammer right, but I think that was probably the best type of game for Warhammer Fantasy to be done in. The graphics can kind of be wonky at times, the music is not so great, and the AI is terrible when it comes to diplomacy and other actions like co-ordination, but in the end the gameplay saves it all. Total War is a fantastic game franchise, and to see all of the different factions in Warhammer Fantasy and all of their units and war machines going at it is beautiful. I have had tons of fun playing this game, and I would probably have a lot more hours in it with the DLC and more factions to play, but that is another negative aspect to this game.

The amount of DLC and the price is pretty brutal. For some of them you get quite a lot, with some entire factions being changed depending on the DLC you get, but to still have Wood Elves at 22 dollars, or Norsca at 12, is just unforgivable. They are not that great, and after 4 years they shouldn't cost more than actual full length games that are out there. Then there is the fact that they charge you for blood and gore to be added. In a war game, set in Warhammer. That is just not right. Don't waste your money on the DLC, get the base game and the second game and play on the huge world map with all of the factions, it is great.

This was my first Total war game and as a cinematic game, its beautiful and fun to play at the begining but once I got my hands on Rome 2 this game seemed a bit weaker to me.

Im gonna go ahead and tell you guys that Total war games are not for the light of wallet.
Pros:
-Stays true to the Warhammer universe
-A lot of bugs have been (or are being) addressed. Not a disaster on release like Rome 2
-Community constantly pumping mods for you to try
-Campaign can be fun and is easier to grasp for new players
-Introduces giant units and beast that really add to the fantasy theme.

Cons: (This is where it gets good)
-Chaos DLC (Luckily I got this on release week) and already another coming out. RIP wallet
-Missing mechanics from previous Total war games (How is this game getting better reviews the Total war Attila?)
-only 4 playable factions without DLC's 
-Custom battles and multiplayer get repetitive and boring (Almost the same thing over and over)
-SEGA and CA will milk your wallet faster than steam sales do

It has the Civilisation just one more turn aspect down and mixes in epic fantasy style battles with gruesome units and magic to boot (though you don't have to fight the battles if you don't want to).  If you've really never heard of Total War but are a fan of strategy games (and specifically real time strategy) then this could be for you.  Don't be put off with the Warhammer backdrop, you really don't need to geek out on the lore...if you don't want to.

Personally my favourite faction were the Vampire counts.  No one likes you but your units are kickass.  I mean who doesn't want to field a giant flying mutated bat thing whilst your undead ghost cavalry charge at the enemies flanks.  The different factions like the Empire, Dwarves and Orcs etc, change the general play style, strengths and weaknesses.  For instance the Vampire counts have no ranged units so a very vulnerable to gunfire, arrows or cannons.  But their units don't break per se and they have a pretty diverse range of flying and cavalry units to boot.  You can play both single and multiplayer skirmish battles or campaigns.  There is a number of DLC units and factions but the base game is still very good value with lots of replay value.  Still, it's best played with a friend or better against one!

Overall this was a surprising success of the Total War system mapped onto a fantasy setting.  I highly recommend for those into Total War or Total War like games as well as those into strategy and real time strategy alike.",1597538192,1597538192,True,5,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False

-To be brutally honest, in 2020, Warhammer Total War 1 should be treated as a very large DLC for Warhammer 2 (and soon, Warhammer 3) that adds all the Old World factions to the game as playable factions. If you're interested in playing the Empire, the Orks, the Dwarves, the Vampire Counts, or Bretonnia (except for any factions added as DLC in Warhammer 2 [or 3])  you need to buy Warhammer 1.
-All race sin this game have received significant changes and overhauls to how they work in Warhammer 2, such that they will be completely unrecognizeable between this game and the second.
-All DLCs for this game should be treated the same way: as DLC for the overall game package. All of it transfers over to the future games in the series.
-No changes in future games have been backported to Warhammer 1. There is no reason to play Warhammer 1 over 2 (or 3 in future) at this point, unless you feel really really nostalgic for some reason.
-Yes, there is a lot of DLC. However, all of that DLC represents *playable* content. All of the factions and units added will still be present in your game to fight against. You only need to purchase the DLC if you are interested in using the units and factions yourself. If you never want to play Wood Elves, don't buy Wood Elves - they'll still exist for you to beat up endlessly. Same for the Lord Packs - don't want to play Belegar or Skarsnik? Don't buy King and the Warlord. They'll still exist, but you can't confederate them or play as them.
-This game, and the DLC, often goes on very heavy sales now due to its age. If you want to stock up, wait for a sale and do so, remembering the above: you only need to buy what you want to play and use. If you want everything, wait for a sale!

I don't have anything else to say here - Warhammer 1 as a game is totally deprecated due to the existence of Warhammer 2, and should only be viewed as a DLC investment for future games in the series, not as an actual game to be played in itself. All other DLCs, and the games in general, should be viewed in light of that investment - yes, it's a lot of money, but there is an absolutely fantastical amount of content here.

However, other than that, it just feels like ""Oh, you got your alliances, economy, and armies well organized and operating effectively?

[b]Pro's[/b]
- Seamless large scale wargames with massive armies of largely free play units
- Graphics are fantastic (for an RTS game)
- True feel to the large scale battles that I believe are accurate to the way these war's would of progressed
- Wide roster list for every faction to suit every playstyle
- Repeat gameplay value is high, with no two playthroughs ever the same
- AI (whilst sometimes clunky and counterproductive) can recognise its own opportunities, and can challenge you at most difficulty levels by capitalising on your mistakes

[b]Con's[/b]
- If you don't like having to wait on loading screens, this game will not be one you enjoy (but in my opinion loading is worth it!)
- If you only play one way, and your playstyle is best suited to one race/faction, you may get bored, and the replayability can be affected
- The 'Quick-Match' game modes are exactly that; do not expect to be able to jump in and out of campaign at a moments notice

A solid addition to the Total War Franchise, and even better mixed in with one of my favourite fantasy worlds!

10/10 would recommend to both Pro and Casual RTS gamers

""There can be no victory, for the darkness. Always returns.""

If you like grand campaigns with considerations of economy vs military, diplomacy, and conquest, this one has all of that. There are different factions, which for the most part play the same but have different goals or mechanics or unit strengths to take into consideration. Every lord of the same faction has a slightly different start, be it different units in starting army, or different enemies to take on first. All of the different factions and lords provide a lot of different flavors to the game play that keeps it fresh and exciting. This holds true also for Warhammer 2.

Even in a time when Total War: Warhammer 2 exists, Warhammer 1 is still a game worth buying and playing, for a few reasons. At the very least, owning both Warhammer 1 and 2 gives you access (for free) to the mortal empires campaign, which is a map that combines the eye of the vortex campaign map from Warhammer 2 with the Old World map in Warhammer 1, and allows you to play any race from either game in it. This means that just owning Warhammer 1 is worth while, especially if you pick it up during a steam sale, like say the one going on now (written 6/27/2020).

However, there are more reasons to get and play Warhammer 1 than the extra content you get for Warhammer 2. One such benefit is you don't have to deal with those Skaven rat bastards, lol. There are some other differences in the game play, like in Warhammer 2 when you control a whole province, no matter the race, you get to issue a commandment for some extra benefit, like growth, recruitment, or money. In Warhammer 1, not all races have that. Also, in Warhammer 1, you can't settle in towns that are not suitable to your faction like you can in Warhammer 2. The differences aren't really enough to throw you off, but are enough to offer a compelling reason to play Warhammer 1 as well as Warhammer 2.

If I had one complaint about Warhammer 1, its that even 4 years after its release, there isn't a definition edition you can buy that has all the content for one low price, say $30 or $45. Given how much DLC both games have and how they're all pretty much $9 or $20 USD, the price really quickly adds up, even if you are picking it up during a sale. 

Anyway to wrap it up, Warhammer 1 is worthwhile on its own merits and as a dlc pack for Warhammer 2, in my opinion, especially if Warhammer 3 continues the tradition and lets you play factions from previous games.",1593295954,1593296039,True,20,0,0.693575739860534668,0,True,False,False

Total War: Warhammer expands the formula by including a variety of factions and races which allows for greater variety and versatility. The number of units, mechanics, and goals is vast, which offers great replayability. But the way they are implemented allows for only certain interactions, specific fights between specific factions that happen every time. And Warhammer suffers from the same problems which have plagued the Total War series since the beginning: an incompetent AI which loses battles it should win easily. Even the battles seem like they are missing some of the excitement of earlier games, with a stodgy, rigid feeling. At the end of two campaigns and a few unfinished attempts, Total War: Warhammer is fine example of the genre, if not as good as some of its predecessors.

I played several Total Wars but never was I confronted with such a beautiful experience. It's a new world for me, with new art / graphics style, very easy to comprehend battles but many challenges. I love the setting, artstyle and how the battles and campaign play. The UI is really nice, even if I wish for more hotkeys (for provinces and settlements for example). The game is really good at immersing you in this beautiful, heroic world full of magic and wonders - and exciting battles with tons of different units and strategies. You really become invested in the race you choose and its struggle for survival and domination in this epic universe I didn't know a thing about prior to playing - but that is very easy to love !



The only thing I regret is the struggle for survival of my (average) gaming laptop, even in low settings the game stays quite beautiful and so you have long loading screens and it can make your PC heat up a little. But the game is definitely worth it.

The only portion that supports additional players beyond that is the battles mode, which is just one-off battles between armies with no empire-building mechanics involved.

It's all about attacking, losing settlements, gaining some, wash, rinse, repeat, with zero strategic planning nor strategic development possible! Just go-go-go attack, attack, attack! You'll win at the end, but clearly this has NOTHING to do with true Empire management game! You are even slapped with severe ""procrastinator"" (traits) penalties if you decide to opt for managing your empire from your capital city for a few turns, through improvements and diplomacy, etc. 
And the most boring consequences of this style of gameplay is that you only have an 'illusion' of decision-making freedom. But the truth is you have to follow a very linear and highly 'guided' path: i.e. attack whoever is the weakest player the AI has placed there underneath your nose for you (regardless if this would make any sense for any Emperor trying to strategically build a lasting Empire)...or else! Really: Anything else will get you punished with a swift defeat!
This game is clearly made by and for RTS or first shooter CSGO / Fortnite / MOW or COH 'chicken-with-no-head' types of gaming. But NOT for Total War, Strategic, or Empire management fans!
Sad as it is otherwise robust and looking real good and could have been the GGOAT (Greatest Game Of All Time!). But this is NOT a Total War game at all! And I am now running back to Total War Rome I and Medieval II ...in a hurry!

I don't have Total War: Warhammer 2 yet and I'll probably love that a lot better, but for now this game is the most fun I've played in a Total War game ever!

Update: Now with even more hours in and playing on Very Hard difficulty. I have played all free races (Vampires, Dwarves, Empire, Brettonia, and Greenskins) and had a lot of fun. Now playing Dwarves on Very Hard before I finally turn to Warhammer 2 (already bought it but waiting to finish Warhammer 1 before playing Warhammer 2). 

I recommend playing Warhammer 1 before Warhammer 2 so that you learn the races from the Old World without the huge Mortal Empires map. It's also cheaper especially when both are on sale and you are going to spend a lot of hours in single player/campaign to be really good at it. 

I've had experience with older Total War games but the unit diversity, monsters, quests, and legendary lords here are amazing and you really get into the game. 

Highly recommended! Don't listen to the people complaining about it being a DLC trap, you don't need to buy it and only buy the DLC of the races you want to play.

4 year old Base Game: $60
The REST of the game: $85 and counting

GAMEPLAY:
The fine folks at CA Watered down the territory management found in previous titles.  Which may not me a bad thing for micromanagement but it means when you lose a settlement you take a serious hit.  That said, the AI cant even handle the few tasks it must do so its given bonuses, immunity to attrition that devastates players, gets free gold and units, insteant heals and respawns, and cheats.

Be prepared to always have an inferior army because somehow, you having 8 settlements, wont be able to field an army as big as your neighbor who is down to his last town!

How many times did I max out my upkeep costs to put an army of 18 units, supported by an army of 12, marched on the enemy city to be faced with a 20 stack, with a second 20 stack in range to reinforce, and a garrison of what seemed like millions of troops?  If you attack, you die.  if you call off the attack, they bum rush you with yet another 20 stack that was hiding somewhere.  Now its 60 vs 30.  And if you take his last city?  well he amazingly had 3 twenty stacks hidden near your cities and quickly devastates your homeland so you are left with less than what you started with.

I WANT to like this game.

But its (1) a money sink; (2) a rage-quit fest on wheels (3) buggy, (4) cheats; and (5) uses business practices that are considered bad faith and practice by the industry.",1590992286,1590992286,False,49,7,0.595781683921813965,0,True,False,False

GW is the worst when it comes to pricing because they have a complete monopoly on Warhammer. Wait for a sale extra hard on this one (especially since most of the content is locked behind DLC)

Even if this game was a fair price I still don't think I could recommend it because the AI completely cheats and ruins the balance of the game. In the game their are special characters called ""Heroes"" who can do cool stuff, if attached to an army they give you kick ass buffs. If deployed alone they can commit sabatoge on the enemy.

But the AI cheats, see Hero sabatoge costs money to use but the AI has unlimited money, it also has a COMPLETELY RANDOM chance to actually work. The AI will never fail a sabatoge check and will spam them CONSTANTLY parking UNKILLABLE UNREMOVABLE UNSTOPPABLE heroes outside your settlements and attack them with the hero EVERY SINGLE TURN UNTIL THE SETTLEMENT IS DESTROYED and the only way to counter them is to either 

A: Save scum constantly because your heroes have an outright uselessly low 24% success rate for actions (This process will also take the better part of a day because loading saves takes about 1-2 minutes because this game was optimized by a monkey)

Sadly, I haven't seen any strategy game do the previous, only Pen and Paper games which let you fully utilizie your creativity and imagination to actually have good strategical combat/tactics

Before the review note this, I am no pro Gamer, and have never trolled either, don't work for a Mag. etc.
This is just my personal view of this and it applies to all newer 'Total War' Games (Nap, Medieval included)

I do not and can-not recommend these Games.

It used to be that in Games like the original 'Rome' etc. That you had to work to unlock other Tribes and so on but now...now to get any of the stuff and Tribes/Countries beyond the Core few, you have to pay, we are not talking a few Pounds here...no, to get everything, it costs over ¬£100....

This is stupid, Paywalls, not Gaming..just to drain your Bank Accounts...seems fair and like SEGA and C.A. are about the Cash and not the Games.

I am proud to say, I loved the original 'Rome' but nowadays...it is just a Money-Grab.

I honestly hope C.A. stop doing things this way and go back to full Games, no Micro-Transactions...you know...making whole, full Games from the start...

So much variation in unit types and factions make this very replayable. 
How many games can you witness units in there thousands engaging in warfare with magic, strategy, stunning graphics and sound? Very few, if any.
My main gripe is siege battles. They're such a dip in quality from the likes of Shogun 2 and Rome 2 albeit very pretty settlements. 
Overall, across all genres, not many games tick as many boxes for fantasy or strategy enthusiasts.


Many negative reviews are due to the cost of both main game and DLC. This is easily addressed. You're paying for time and fun. How much would you pay to go to the cinema, amusement park or anything else you deem worthy of your time? Compare the ratio of time and cost and this game is very cheap. 
I have spent 234 hours on this game and 500+ on TWWH2 over the lastr 4 years. Now I probably play more than the average person so maybe the cost is a detriment to some. If, like me, you play games most days and can spend a number of hours on them then this game is cheap. I've yet to do everything I want either and will continue to play. 
Please note, All DLC purchased carries over to TWWH2 as well.

This game was the creative assembly‚Äôs jumping the shark moment. This game blindsided fans and sharply divided the fan base of the series. I know and have met many total war players and YouTubers and anyone that has been with the series for a long time was shocked at this game coming out. It is painfully clear that the creative assembly got their hands on the cheapest license they could get while still making the most amount of money from their existing fanbase and the warhammer fanbase. I looked into the warhammer series after this game came out and it‚Äôs not as popular as the total war series. Many total war fans had never heard of or played a game for this series before. It also basically started off as a board game. Total war was originally supposed to be a historical RTS sandbox but CA fell to greed with this. Total war‚Äôs fan base has shown that they aren‚Äôt opposed to the series doing a fantasy game but the most popular choices for that among fans would have been game of thrones or the lord of the rings, both have been made into very popular mods for total war medieval 2. There isn't much wrong with the game on a graphical, mechanics, and technical level, but that is really the only saving grace.

pros 
the battles and mechanics still have the spirit of total war 
the graphics are good 

cons 
divided CA's fanbase 
confused the majority of CA's fanbase 


As someone who grew up playing the historical total wars, I thought this game was a gigantic spit in the face. It was a spit in the face to all the historical total war fans and completely divided the fanbase. This game was like apple's failed U2 album giveaway, it was executed without error, but it drew the ire of a lot of people, especially those who were blindsided by it and/or never heard of it.

I really missed Total War games (grew up with the original Shogun/Medieval/Rome, etc...) and the last TW game I played was Empire.  I decided on Warhammer first even at full price just to get back into it and....

I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!

PROS:
-unique factions (love the vampire units / chaos units / orc units) and the flavour of unique battles most of the time
-unmodded diplomacy seems a lot better than older titles (I was unreliable so couldn't trade).  I have focused my attacks on vampires/chaos/beastmen and gradually I am trustworthy again, have alliances with other empire factions/dwarves and have lots of trade agreements meaning lots of monies!  Seems to be working as it should
-Big battles!  I love that the ai (even unmodded) seems to be able to put together full stacks all over the place meaning I get the big battles i sometimes wouldnt get in earlier titles
-Easy army setup - I love that the army creation is now from the commander vs having to recruit from towns
-Great mods! I added some mods that suited my tastes and even if they show as outdated I have had no issues
-1 crash in 18 hours from reloading a save file but otherwise has been very stable and great frames

Cons:
-I wish they had more of the troop movement options like they do in empire (rotate / move forward buttons) actually in the ui when controlling units.  As well better built in army auto assigned orders/ai so I dont have to micro-manage as much (dont stand around if you routed an enemy, find someone else to fight!) to allow me to enjoy the battles a bit more.

Lets start with the positive. I gave a thumb up because I would definitely recommend to play it. The game is challenging, which is not bad. Battles are very well made I like it very much.

After some time the game started to get a little bit [b] frustrating [/b] due to some issues:
- The non stopping pressure from every side, i feel like there is too much enemies, you cannot not leave your developing cities alone or immediately some dimwit dark sided enemies come and SACK IT. (You also cannot defend all of them because you do not have enough income for enough armies)
- I feel like enemies come out of nowhere. (some kind of watchtower system or increased visibility in the map is missing)
- [u] the battle will take place outside of the settlement [/u], this should definitely be changed, making [b] walls [/b] to your settlements takes way to long.
- Enemy [b] lords [/b] are way too overpowered but yours dies in middle of a combat every...time and fast. However, playing with the lords and using the spells during battles is one of my favorite things in this game!
- The overall [b] income [/b] is too low and the army upkeep is too high. You might be at turn 100 and chaos knocking at your door and you still do not have the best units upgraded, neither enough armies (because you can't keep them up)
- Public order changes too much and is too difficult to get up -> rebels appear (too easily)

Where am I going with this?
The TW Warhammer project reached my absolute first place in popularity and changed my gaming life (of course I mean the whole three-part series).. Warhammer took the crown.

The style of play is the same as in any Total War - building an empire, fighting for territory, diplomatic agreements, player-controlled and detailed battles.
The story of this part of the Warhammer takes place in the ""old world"" (type of middle-earth), where factions are crammed into each other and have to fight for supremacy and survival from the very beginning. We have a choice of several playable races such as Empires, Bretonnians, Dwarfs, Wood Elves, Greenskins, Vampires, Norscans, Beastmen and Chaos.
The politics of the world is based on the idea - everyone can fight with everyone, but this is not the case everywhere, cooperation between factions and races is often key to survival, or to victory. How the individual races get together (for the uninterested of this topic) is a diplomatic tool in the game, which will show who has an aversion or affinity towards whom, or what a large number of the mentioned feelings. Classically, some races are good and some are bad. Some races are peacemakers or builders and some races are aggressors or exterminators.
Each race has different life goals, a different style of play, different fighting tactics, different diplomacy, a different army, different conditions of victory. A everything Warhammer has to offer can take a lot of game hours.

I played the original Shogun, Medieval 1 and 2, Shogun 2, Rome (the first one) I tried the buggy mess that was Empire Total War. I skipped Rome 2 and Attilla based on reviews about the oversimplified Strategic level.

I like the Theme (why I took a chance on this game). The lore is interesting. The races are cool and different (the tried and true paper rock scissors remains in place) The battles remain fun when the odds are stacked against you (even if they are over in a minute). I like the heroes. I love the Chaos invasion. 

However this remains a completely dumbed down total war (which was apparently true for Rome 2 and Attila). Total war used to be half strategy (campaign map), half tactics (real time battles). Now the ""strategy"" is take over a province and spread out your building across four settlements. Want to build more than 4 buildings? Too bad. What to choose your garrison forces? too bad. (Garrisons are upkeep free though, because free soldiers make sense.) Worried about where you want your barracks? Don't worry your troops just jump into your army from the far side of the province. Logistics are irrelevant. Chase stupid AI armies across the map and fight glorious (way too fast though) battles. Watch helplessly as a Beastman stack appears in your indefensible settlements (because yeah no fortifications and default boring garrisons)

I wish the game makers would realize that a meaningful Strategic experience will make the battles much more fun in the first place. I care a lot less when I lose a settlement that I invested no thought or effort into. there are no meaningful choices for towns. You always need the money building, you probably need the defense building and one settlement builds a barracks of some type and the unrest building. The worst part, simplification of the strategic level makes no sense since the battles are hardly appealing to a mindless clicker. I want real choices and resource management. 

Bottom line, I recommend this game to people who love the realtime battles, but for anyone who prefered the strategic side of it, no. It really just makes me want to go play Medieval TW 2.",1482956271,1588089054,True,0,0,0.522574543952941895,0,True,False,False

Yet another of those games where you are forced to have played previous titles* to understand what you are supposed to do in order to win.
Sure the game manage to instruct the player on how to play, move the camera and armies.
But to be able to stand a chance in the campaign you need to read the guides provided and follow them thoroughly to see exactly which development to choose, which buildings you must build in each of your settlements and when you should build them. Also when to move your armies and to which location and down to which of the different events you should chose a respond to. This I will refuse to do because this would in such case mean that we could skip the game part and automate it with a script!

As a new player as myself this isn't at all appealing.
Playing the easy campaign with the Dwarfs resulted in a crushing loss against an overwhelming force of Orcs at ~turn 20.
And that's not because I didn't have an army, the size of mine was as large but the enemy had a stronger leader which was higher level than mine, the enemy also fielded an army with units which I had no counter to.

Part from that the game itself is nice, the only thing that comes to mind is that you doesn't rotate the camera in the campaign map the same way you do in the battle phase.

Being a total war fan there was a lot of stigma to making a fantasy total war since fans of the series were used to historical titles, but in my opinion besides Medieval 2 Total War this is my favorite.  It adds tons of gameplay changes while a lot of the older titles didn't experiment much.  Whether it was legendary lords, flying units, monsters, magic or others the battles felt a lot more chaotic and engaging.  Not to mention I had started to feel with recent titles that faction rosters were too much the same being copy pasta from one faction to another, in Total War Warhammer while fewer each faction feels drastically different and made me feel like I had to play through each of them.  Each faction also has their own set of legendary heroes that has quests you could complete to gain equipment for your character this could also be done through battles making your hero insanely powerful.  Besides the equipment that they can equip, the legendary lords you get can also level up buffing their stats further and allowing you to put points into a skill tree.

I LOVE Total War Battlefield!!! ...I HATE the STUPID things they do on the campaign map that almost totally ruin the game.

DIPLOMACY:
1. Create a Diplomacy System to raise expectations and brag about features,
2. Make sure the Diplomacy mechanics are horribly unfair and broken,
3. Release new version of game and gather feedback,
4. Revise the Diplomacy system based on feedback and remove everything still usable,
5. Repeat from Step 3.

The only thing 'new' about this diplomacy system is that Diplomacy is a more useless aspect since there is nothing the computer can give you other than trade income. It all still works the same, make alliances with everyone, if anyone tries to drag you into conflict just check which of them has more enemies and break your alliance with the hated one. Your reputation will always be steadfast.

...if they made the trade agreement automatic for non-hostile factions, i think no one would ever need to click the ""Diplomacy"" button. They could make things clearer by just replacing the computer responses with ""No"" or ""I'll stab you in the back later.""

PLAYABILITY:
I think the issue at the center of the CA teams struggle with making a good Computer AI is that they don't seem to grasp the difference between 'Competitive and Challenging' versus say 'Cheating your Ass Off'.
  There is facing off against a computer opponent that is operating under the same limitations and on an equal playing field while still being difficult to beat. And then there is fighting against an opponent whose interpretation of Hidden is ""I know where they are, I just need to get LOS before shooting them in the face"", or say turning off the 'Routing' mechanic for the computers troops.
  The former is what I would call 'Challenging' or enjoyable 'Competition'; the latter though, I would put more in the category of 'very annoying' or 'stupid'.",1587616525,1587830801,False,4,0,0.482740581035614014,0,True,False,False

All 13 hours of my game time were as Dwarves, the ""easy"" campaign, and every minute of each failed game was frustrating in all the wrong ways. And, frankly, the game is far too grindy for me to care to try again.

Apparently the trick as Dwarves, reading peoples' guides, is to sit and turtle for dozens of turns until each and every one of your settlements are completely garrisoned and equipped with city walls. Or go to one province north of the starting position, completely not where the tutorial tells you your main enemies are, and then turtle for dozens of turns. Which is maybe thematically appropriate but boring as hell.

And not even a sure indicator of success, in large part because of the cheating, unpredictable AI. Unpredictable not in the sense of devious, but just...random. Some games the Greenskin ork faction would absorb other ork factions every other turn, ensuring that they were quickly able to send numerous full armies and just demolish anything I had. Many of those armies were recruited free as a result of the ""Waagh"" mechanic, of course. Other games the orks would do almost nothing. Except send out seemingly endless numbers of their heroes, which unlike your heroes have no cooldowns on using their incredibly disruptive abilities and the AI often gets to recruit for free.

Speaking of cheating, the AI is able to abuse the movement stances to a frankly ludicrous degree, granting them huge amounts of free movement. In addition, the AI does not suffer from fog of war and knows the location of every one of your units. The result is that the AI frequently positions its armies either at the very edge or completely beyond your movement range. And apparently gets to retreat for free, on your turn. I had multiple instances where I ordered an attack only for the opposing army to just get an extra hop back once I had completely exhausted my army's movement getting into range. So be prepared to be kited for multiple turns before you even get to a battle.

And the battles quickly become tedious. You rarely wipe out an enemy force, just get it down to maybe a third health (or not even that). So the next turn you have to repeat the battle again. And again, And again. Or more likely just have another army come zooming in from BF nowhere to reinforce the guys you just walloped, and now outnumber you because most battles are grinding slogs of attrition that rarely destroy individual units let alone whole armies.

For the last game I used a bunch of mods to disable some of the AI cheats and reduce enemy hero spam and it was still frustrating as hell. Gave up when I trounced 3 different armies in one turn, only for all of them to emerge from the battle with about half health, then turn around and gang up on me the next turn and collectively destroy me.

I got this on sale for $15, plus $5 for one of DLCs. For that $20 I could have bought a copy of Into The Breach. I already own ITB and it's utterly brilliant, a genuinely clever and fiendishly brain twisting strategy game. I wouldn't have got 1 minute of playtime for that extra copy. But I could have gifted it to a friend and they could have played a great game, and I could have enjoyed them playing a great game, and instead I got to ""enjoy"" Total War: Warhammer.

Less Warhammer and more...Boringhammer.

Wait.

Ai don't care, even though they should, about the oncoming chaos or beastmen. They only care about you losing to them. Your allies will raid you, purposefully send their assassins against you, not help against any sort of rebellion THEY end up causing and actually take your forts if you lose them to the beastmen, chaos, or rebels. On easy mode. The Ai BEG for peace and the minute you give it to them they immediately start encamping and raiding your towns ceaselessly, even if they're losing at their own base. You look bad if you do anything against them, move on their land, you look bad, raid you look bad, sneeze,  you're the incarnation of Nurggle and deserve death. 

This game looks incredibly fun but it's to have fun when the AI knows your every fucking movement both out of the field and on it. Over the top it looks like Civ, best comparison I have, with cities/settlements and your armies moving around. You have a general for every army so you don't have a giant cluster of soldiers. The AI seems to know without a drop of a beat where your generals are 100% of the time on the map without any vision or given thought. They'll march against you without any cause to block you or immediately run away the minute  your army turns around and starts heading back from the other side of the map. The battles now are just BS. They tell and try to teach you about ambushing your enemies where I believe they took away the AI's map hack. Follow it up with other points of conflict they know 100% of the time where you are at all times. Even if you're troops aren't moving, have been hiding the whole time, and are ready to try for a flank the enemy will immediately disband a part of their army to head straight toward yours even though they have yet to even see them. I've had this happen now multiple times to where it's not even worth setting up a flank or surprise attack it's just ""well I guess I never get to do this."" even though the AI has actually done this before in hiding their troops in tree's and buildings then rushing me after a minute when they caught their breath. 

If a game has to resort to cheating, like also giving the AI a bonus to auto-resolving a fight, it's not worth even bothering to play or support. Stay away from this game unless you can apperantly get the second one. They said, and people who support it, that they fixed all the AI issues and more. However with the amount of mods that have to tinker the game and that I'm actually told to get if I want the AI to be winnable against I doubt it. My recommendation unless you're a Total War fan looking for a fantasy based game this your game if not stay away from it.Not worth the hassle

Edit is here: If you do plan on getting this, wait for a sale. This game is not worth the $60 price tag it STILL has after a coupld of years now.

UPDATE:  Ok, i have added another 24 hours of game play because i really WANT to like this game.  But i cannot, in good conscience, recommend a game that cannot even follow its own rules.

I have inflicted crushing defeats on enemy stacks, watched them retreat a few inches, and attacked them a second time in the same turn, only to find that the entire army of 90% depleted retreating foes had SOMEHOW replenished itself to 100% in those few inches and while STILL on MY SAME turn.

In this last campaign i started, i saw my capitol sacked by an army of Green-skins consisting of 16 all but invulnerable LATE GAME units, and the campaign was a mere 8 turns in.  Not even a full TEN turns.  They spawned inside my province, marched and sacked in the same turn, crushing not only the standard garrison, but the general and his 13 units i had stationed within the city.

The tutorial adviser had only JUST explained what ""offices"" were the turn before.

These weren't the only questionable events, but you get the idea.

If the only way you can program a challenging AI is to give it cheats, then QUIT.  There were games with better AI crapped out in 1995.

I have played most of the Total War games and most of them i liked, but i'm seeing more and more truly shoddy work squeezed out by these publishers.  They spew out so many projects that they are becoming spamware.",1581625534,1583587893,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

I've mastered the Grand Campaign with The Empire, The Dwarfs, Bretonnia, Greenskin, Wood Elves, and the Vampire Counts... and this game is awesome! It is the sort of game that gets you hooked on playing ""just the next turn"".

The graphics and the sound is nice and captures the Warhammer look & feel known and expected from the tabletop game. Apart from some minor glitches (e.g. having some crashes) and some wired idiosyncrasies (e.g. navigating armies across the sea is not calculated by the pathfinding algorithm, need to ""exchange"" troops to be sure the same army is in the attack range of the other, ...) the game plays very smoothly. Each faction has their unique playing style, and some are harder than others. However, each has its own pros and cons.

Ok: micro-management of cities and overall gameplay could be more complex in the campaign part. Yet it does not stand in your way. One will also find some optimization here in there in the player navigation on the menus when one really wants to find something, e.g. more than once I found myself typing escape to abort a hero's action, only to be confronted with the ""Exit Game"" dialog, huh?

Ah, yes and the stupid implementation of probabilities! The game tells you that your hero has a success chance of X%. Well, the game did already role the dice on that one and only shows you this number it had [b]before[/b](!). It took me a while to figure that out. I read that this is to prevent Quick-Save - Quick-Load series until your hero succeeds. ... which turned out in a Quick-Save - Quick-Load if the hero fails to save the money spent. Errm, this is not how math works, does it?

But still: a must-have for strategy fans, a feast on tactics.

In this installation of TW series there are some other experiments turned shitty: expensive DLCs of each additional race, limit of how many armies you can field due to increasing army tax (my dwarven empire spanning half map can affod 7 armies. In previous installments you could run 15 armies easily, allowing epic battles). Then there are chaos spawning without upkeep with monstrous armies - 4 armies with full stacks, which you cannot afford with funtioning economy for first 50 turns). Also at the same time Norska attacks, and if both decide to attack you, you are pretty much screwed, as you 5-6 armies ar usually split while cleaning up last goblins. So you reload few times, until Chaos army decides to kill Empire. As even empire has only 4-5 armies, Chaos usually burns down half of empire before it can be repelled. After your victory there are still random army spawns of chaos and goblins, so you have to chase those respawns constantly.

Clutch-y moments, hard fought battles, miraculous victories, and tragic defeats.... 

But more importantly, catch things on sale. like, seriously, don't burn your wallet too badly. allot of the stuff in this game--while nice--is a bit flawed and the pricing can really really REALLY sting if you have to pay 20 for the only faction of elves, but can pay 10 for a faction of dwarfs, a faction of greenskins, and a unique set of units 

Also, whilst theres a couple glitches and other issues, like dlc characters being entirely uncooperative shitheads until you buy their dlc or...being able to recruit lords you havent unlocked the ability to recruit yet by some bizzare oversight, it's a decent variety and selection of units and factions from the warhammer universe lovingly rendered and voiced. and the structure system is fun to fiddle with, too. though i hear it's nothing new to the total war series.

- AI cheats in campaign movement. You will spend a lot of time wandering why an army dwarfs that hauls cannons across Reikwald forest is faster than your cavalry that is chasing them. You cannot catch the enemy armies and they often refuse to fight. Thy want to win by making you quit playing the game.
- non functional diplomacy designed only to keep you at war and under pressure. Small state that cannot expand to your cities and has been your friend all along declares war on you because it helps another state across the map. Factions commit suicide by going to war with you when you are way stronger. Friends never stay friendly for long. Also you cannot give liberated provinces and cities back to your friends or trade territory at all. 
- in campaign there was something called chaos invasion that killed almost every other AI faction and left half of the map in ruins. It resets the game and suddenly you play something else.  
- Battles get boring because AI doesn't have too many strategies and the complicated ones mostly work against them. For example undead cavalry positions on your flanks and waits until their main army approaches, but they are waiting in range of our crossbows. So you kill them before their friends arrive. AI is more successful with a head on attack. After a while you just make sure you have the numbers and auto resolve everything.

The varied units among the factions including the heroes and lords, along with the strength and weakness associated with said units made each battle a challenge.  I was actually excited when someone new attacked me because I had no idea what they were going to field in battle and I found out what works against one faction, does not necessary work against others.  

For instance, played my campaign as the Dwarves with Thorgrim Grudgebearer as my legendary lord and learned over time that what strategy was effective against Orcs, is not necessarily so with Vampire Counts or other factions. First time going against Vlad von Carstein they rolled my army with all sorts of units I had not seen yet!  Giant bats, some corpse cart thing, and demon wolves OH MY!  Army was routed before I knew what to do and this was the same army of Dwarves that was destroying Orcs fairly easily.  It's a rock, paper, scissor match against units sometimes, however you can have the rock, paper, and scissors at the same time in your army.  Just takes good placement, timing, and patience.  It takes a defeat or two to figure out where you are going wrong.

In the end is this a great game, yes!  Is it for everyone, no.  Learning curve if you have never played a TW game is steep.  Even on easy and being able to pause battles you may still lose due to superior enemy units or strategy, but to me that's half the fun...fixing those mistakes.  Campaign can also be equally unforgiving if you aren't paying attention to who's allied with who and putting your forces too deep into enemy lines.  It does, along with all TW games has a great tutorial and a pretty detailed built-in instruction guide.  You also have an adviser that does a good job of keeping aware of the going ons in your empire like unhappy population which can lead to rebellion armies popping up and other things like that.  If you are a veteran TW gamer like me, I really have a hard believing you would not like this game, unless you don't like a fantasy-based game and prefer more historical ones.  Game is worth full price IMO but it has been on sale the last two Steam events at 75% off I believe and is definitely worth it then.

Also, addressing the DLCs....not at all necessary and don't see what the complaining is about.  Get Dwarves, Empire (humans), Bretonnia (humans), Orcs, and Vampire Counts right away.  Those also all have at least one sub-faction too available.  Tons of hours can be spent just on those alone.  Have 50 hours on one campaign!

Defeat an army in battle? Well, 2 chariots lived, so the army doesn't get wiped out and will resume running around the map until it replenishes to full strength! Good luck hunting it down before Archeon respawns and you have to do it all over again!

When you get a hang of the battles and some shortcuts or QoL-tips (like alt + left mouse button for easy movement in an established formation) the great battle variety will give you many hours of entertainment. Great fun and quite challenging on hard and up.

I love it to the point where it's easier to point out it's flaws than to list everything I felt it has done right. The atmosphere and portrayal of the Warhammer world as well as the faction diversity put it heads and shoulders above other total war games and orders above other medieval RTS games. I think I'll break this review up into my mental notes about the notable mechanics in this game in order to give you guys the most complete look at this game that I can.

Single player: This is mainly a turn based empire management game- Like Europa universalis or Crusader Kings from paradox- with the option to do rts battles whenever you get involved in a fight. The turn based part is much funner than it could be because of how different factions have different mechanics and wildly different play styles than other factions and add to the uniqueness and replayabillity. My criticism here lies in the turn-based nature of the game and the lack of starting areas. 

turn based games seem to naturally tend toward being frustrating when they're complex. This is probably gonna be the reason why you refund the game or rage quit. losing a town because of dumb oversights and misunderstandings are gonna happen if you try to be inquisitive because, imo, minor mistakes and major mistakes get the same punishment in turn based games. Setting up an ambush a little much to the right or positioning your army a pixel reinforcement range of a settlement in the case of a seige get punished in exactly the same way as ignoring the goddamn enemy army entirely and raiding your own provinces. Your still gonna lose that settlement, have to deal with a rebellion and get emotionally drained. Turn based games can still be fun, but there are gonna be a lot of moments where you get the socks raged off ya. As for starting areas, I don't like the base ones. It gives you the option multiple lords per faction but all the lords start off in that factions capital and are working for their cannonical leader- which is lame. Like your telling me Manfred's frollicing through meadows while I'm subjugating the world and putting down insurections?

Typical Manfred.

The only other problem with the game is that it's loading screens are waaaaay to long. way to long.

As for the battles; they are fun but sometimes I feel like Lords shoudln't just automatically retreat from a battle. After a certain point- even if they're fresh tomatoes- your units will just give up and not make a final last stand. That's lame but kinda acceptable, I wasn't gonna win anyway. But the speed that it happens and the fact that my general runs too is what makes it feel so unfair.

The amount of different races you can play and with the huge Mortal Empires campaign the replay value for me is staggering (not to mention the many mods for the game). I think the fantasy setting is a sweet spot for Total War games.  It seems to have allowed the developers the freedom to set up very interesting and balanced scenarios that perhaps historical setting would not have allowed.

I highly recommend it. If you are a newcomer to Total War give yourself time to practice the real time battles. Once you become reasonably proficient at these the game really opens up.",1579642475,1579642475,True,8,0,0.595577239990234375,0,True,False,False

I liked this game and I did enjoy playing for the one campaign I played when I first bought it. Since then, it's sat in my Steam library and I haven't ever felt the urge to revisit it. Much of the bitter taste is from Creative Assembly/Sega's business practices when it comes to the Total War series as of late.

I am a big fan of Total War and I love the concept. Merging turn-based grand strategy while you manage your realm with real time strategy battle segments where you command and manage your troops on a massive scale is genius. The idea of putting the series in a one-off fantasy setting into the Warhammer universe is also genius. But unfortunately, around the time of Rome 2, Creative Assembly decided to really change around how cities are developed/managed, and really bogged down much of the gameplay so that, while still fun, slows down the campaign time in a series where the campaigns were already crazy dragged out.

More so than this, around the time of Rome 2, Creative Assembly also began the practice of never, ever dropping non-sale pricing, limiting sales (in terms of percentage off) and locking the VAST majority of game content behind ludicrously high and numerous DLC paywalls. There's been DLC before, for sure, but it was more reasonably priced to begin with, they further dropped the price when the games became older, and had typical steam sales so it was never THAT unreasonable. Even then, they would start you off with the majority of the factions to play as.

So what you get now when you buy a Total War game made after 2013, is a bogged down, bloated, overpriced shell of essentially 40% of the full game. Be prepared to pay a king's ransom. I really do think you're better off playing the much more reasonably priced Shogun 2, my personal favorite. It really does suck, because I'd love to play this series more, but it just feels off. I really disagree with how Creative Assembly and Sega have been managing this series.",1578832865,1579521973,False,76,2,0.773315250873565674,0,True,False,False

They will Fullfill ALL YOUR WET DREAMS about the Movie style battles and Grand importance campaigns and worldwide Interaction and Conquest Diplomacy and War you dreamed of when playing Age of Empires and watching Gladiator or Lord of the Rings, Napoleon and palyed Warhammer. 

When you just WISHED that theres a way to have this and command the armies and countries. Or when you play Europa Universalis 4 and just wished there was MORE just more graphical battles and Realism. 

THESE GAMES and THIS franchise is UNPARALLELED unbeaten and the ABSOLUTE king of the Hill in Things Real time AND Turn Based Strategy, History, Graphics and Battles of ten THOSUANDS of Units (if your PC is good enough).

Its LITERALLY Cinematic. And if you dont OWN THIS WHOLE franchise...you pretty much dont know what PC and Gaming and History AND ANYTHING is Capable of and WORTH. 

Skyrim is NOTHING compared to this Franchise. I have OVER 700hours of game time FOR SHOGUN total war ALONE..

Pros:
- 17 factions to play as
- Smaller version of mortal empires map
- Magic is fun
- A lot of variance in each faction
- Story/ Quest battles in the old worlds campaign
- Loot
- Bribing beastmen to go attack your enemy is really funny.
- Chaos is actually a threat in this game.

Cons
- Beastmen... they're more of a pest that just does not go away.
- Diplomacy can be really random. Stay away from defensive alliances.
- AI has a tendency to retreat instead of staying and fighting on campaign map.
- AI has cheats the higher the difficulty.
- Like always, Vassals are more of a hinderance than helpful.... don't get me started on vassals deciding to declare war on your other vassals.

Neutral
- Wood elves are meh
- Some factions are more prone to confederate quicker than others. i.e. Dwarves.

Great Concept, loved Empire and Napoleon and was delighted to see a fantasy one. But it is a shame that they ruined the battles.

Attila has the same issue - just seems like developers have paid lip service to Medieval fans and gotten rid of the bit that improved Empire and Napoleon.

The menu being capped at 30fps feels cheap. The multiplayer battles looked empty only showing 2 lobbies, and both were private. I tried singleplayer battles, and armies can be totally invisible (Empire TW forced atleast 1 unit to be visible at all times) and won't attack, so you just aimlessly wonder around the map hoping to bump into something. There's so many other gameplay mechanics that worked in previous total war games but were butchered in this one.

The hero units seem ridiculously overpowered, killing hundreds of units each, making for a poor blend of fantasy and realism. This was nowhere remotely near my experiences of the tabletop game. Surely the immersion should be anchored by a foundation of realism. If a flying horse quickly wipes an entire army then what's the point? It's a fantasy game, but it does overdose on fantasy to a sickening degree...

The campaign was a poor experience. Already starting with multiple wars, and facing constant ""incursions"" that spawn units of another hostile race in your own land. With a limit to how many units you can sustain - how on earth are you supposed to defend from ""incursions"" AND go on the offense, when taking another city would promptly lead to another nation taking it from you. It's not intuitive enough to make clear progress, and with so many restrictions and such a cluttered campaign map there's little room for creativity.

With so many heros, so many abilities, and so much DLC there's a steep learning curve. If the battles and campaign gameplay don't entertain, then where's the motivation to deal with the learning curve? I was put off by the whole thing. They had the money and experience to make this game complete and intuitive, but they didn't. They cut it up, and left it in its state to go work on the next years project. And what was that next project? A near exact copy of this game...

Then why on earth should someone buy this one? I wouldn't recommend it to friends.

Overall, a very good game on its own and needed to play Mortal Empires in TWW2 (which is even better).",1576420407,1576420407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Factions are horibly unbalanced.

- Can not conqour settlments ?
- Seige is just 2 steps back.
- DLC 

Positive
- Hype of fantasy. 

Broken game, regret buying it ! Ill carry on playing rome 2 until thrones comes out.

Don't buy this unless it's 70% off and you like random punishments distributed throughout  a game.

Build your faction. Slowly make progress over hours and hours of effort. Expand and make alliances. Fight, build, complete a couple of neat missions. You're just about to get your capital city to where it can make a new kind of cool unit.

10,000 Chaos forces and a Greenskin Waagh attack. The Chaos forces have possessed a faction on your border, so it attacks. Two other factions suddenly declare war on you because you're in an impossible fight. Your weakest ally sends almost no forces to help you. Everything except the 8,000 wandering attacks at once, and those Beast Men raid your provinces. You are nearly wiped out in four turns. 

Rebuild, but to half of your previous strength before all the above happens again. Get a random environment event that causes two of your provinces to rebel. You can only build level one forces now and are fighting on four fronts. You are wiped out completely.

This is on Normal difficulty. 

What kind of jerk makes a game this way? Randomly setting you up to fight everything at once is not a ""difficult game."" It's just a roll of a die that lands on You Are Dead. This is the way games are made by companies that can't figure out anything but a deus ex machina to generate difficulty.",1572800196,1574952569,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've followed every total war game since Medieval and this one is certainly the most unique being that it's based in a fantasy world. I admire the game for it's unique factions and various details in both the campaign map and the battle map. However, I have to warn you, this is not your typical total war game. Those that are lovers of the series due to the historical context may not appreciate the appeal. I also have a personal gripe with the Chaos Faction. If you recall crusades and jihads in medieval total war, the Chaos faction is a version of that, beware! This faction seems much too overpowered and hijacks the rest of the game for many. They have the ability to conquer faction after faction until you're one of the few left. There are mods to get around this issue, but it is intended to be part of the game? Perhaps I'm just not ahead of the curve in this game! Overall I'd recommend giving it a shot.

The game does have a few issues, but if you have been looking for a fantasy-themed strategy game then I highly suggest picking up Total War: Warhammer.

Graphics: 8/10
As with my previous Total War review, Warhammer hit it's pretty square on the head in terms of graphics. To truly enjoy the game in all it's glory, your going to need a decent video card. I originally played the game on a GTX 750 and was able to play with most settings on medium. However, I soon upgraded to a 980 just for this game and was blown away. The detail on each unit and character is amazing. The developers really did their homework to ensure the units accurately reflect the tabletop detail of each specific race. That's not to say it's all great though. The terrain seems to lack some detail in the graphical department. Expect to see terrain similar to other Total Wars with fantasy elements thrown in. The over world in the single-player campaign is great to look at, but at times I would experience some stuttering when moving during my turn. This may just be some optimization needed on Creative Assembly's part.

Soundtrack/Audio: 7/10
For the most part, all the audio is intense and matches the theme of the game. For the longest time I would turn up the music because at certain points, it was very 'epic' if you will. But the same music does get old after a bit, and there does not seem to be much variation in music. Sound effects are what you would expect and add immersion to the game but it's nothing over the top. It's good, maybe even great, but not excellent.

Gameplay: 7/10
The game plays like many TW's with some exceptions. The exceptions are the main reason why this game didn't get a perfect 10. Creative left one KEY aspect out of the game, NO VILLAGE BATTLES. Yes, you can siege castles and large cities, but when you surround a town and decided to attack, you will be met with a flat landscape. This can be very frustrating during the campaign because in other TW's, the town's defenses would at least give you the chance to put up some sort of resistance. In Warhammer, if your town is small and not built up, even the smallest armies can destroy you since it turns into a straight 1 on 1 battle on flat terrain with the AI.

Speaking of the AI, it seems creative has not done much to improve it. You may frequently come across AI armies made entirely out of artillery, or notice that the army you are chasing can somehow stay right out of your reach even if the AI technically has the 'advantage'. I have also noticed the AI will rarely siege settlements. They would rather wait you out which is very disappointing as I find defensive battles to be quite enjoyable. Expect your typical Total War AI sillyness. (Also, would it kill Creative to make the Greenskins not spawn SO MANY AGENTS? Thx.)

On the other hand, tactics do play a very large part in the single player campaign. Many races have certain abilities that can be utilized during the game. Dwarfs move underground which can be great for making up their general slowness on the overworld map. Elves utilize 'forest paths' to quickly move about the map making ambushes quite common and unpredictable. Agents play a key role in the game and can be utilized in your army as an actual unit. Magic is a new and welcome addition to TW, and for the most part adds to the enjoyment. Some of the spells are underwhelming but many can make or break a battle if cast at the right time and place. If your race uses magic, don't discard it.

Overall 7.5/10
In the end (get it?) the game is very enjoyable and well worth the money for both the game and a few of the DLCs. The Blood DLC is would say is a must at the minimum. Race DLCs are not mandatory and even if you don't buy them, you can still see the new races in game (You just can't play as them in SP or MP). The gameplay, paired with the amazing graphics really make TW:W something special. IF your a fan of the fantasy setting or Warhammer in general, you might find yourself playing this game for quite some time.

The Giant crashes into the gates, stumbles back and crashes into them again. It bursts through to be faced by massed units of Longbeards, fearless Dwarf veterans, who mob the Giant like dogs harassing an elephant.

They win, because in the rock, paper, scissors of Total War: Warhammer the Longbeards' immunity to psychological effects makes them good at fighting fear-causing Giants. Slayers would be even better as they have the Anti-Large trait as well as Unbreakable, but this is a game where paper can beat scissors so long as there's enough of it.
Moldy Old World

Until now Total War has recreated historical eras, and so the tactics have been based on simplified versions of real-world tactics, whether deployed by Rome or Napoleon. Cavalry flank and race ahead to attack missile units before they get too many shots off; spears defend and resist cavalry charges; missile units pour volleys into dense infantry units as they slowly advance. Here, things are more complicated.

The Warhammer World is a fantasy setting, one loosely based on Renaissance Europe but with the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, H. P. Lovecraft and Fritz Leiber funnelled into it through industrial pipes while copies of 2000 AD and heavy metal album covers are scattered on top. It's a mish-mash of everything someone at Games Workshop ever thought was cool, and it's both familiar and really weird. 

The tactical map gives a good overview of how badly you're losing.
The tactical map gives a good overview of how badly you're losing.

There's plenty of crossover between fans of historical wargames and Warhammer, as shown by two of the previous Total War games receiving fan-made mods that squeeze Warhammer armies into them. This is something else though, a ground-up alteration of the Total War formula to make it suit the fantasy setting of the Old World (and it's moddable too, so someone out there must be itching to reverse the trend and put historical armies back in). That formula comes in two halves. The first is a turn-based grand campaign about marching armies across a map and managing provinces through construction, research, and taxation, trying to balance the economy and people's happiness with army-building. The second happens when those armies meet and drop into a real-time, though pausable, battle.

In previous Total War games the factions played in a relatively similar way, but not any more. For instance, the Greenskins have a meter measuring each army's Fightiness. Win battles, and it rises. Lose, or squat in your hovels like a coward, and it drops. If Fightiness is high enough, and there are at least 17 out of a maximum 20 units in the stack, all that sweet victory encourages other Orcs to band together in a bonus force called a Waaagh! For other species buying and maintaining multiple armies is a huge expense, but for Greenskins can earn them free, which encourages a state of constant aggression that's entirely appropriate.

    Dwarves never forget a slight, carefully noting each in a massive book of bitterness.

Dwarfs on the other hand have to keep track of grudges. They never forget a slight, carefully noting each in a massive book of bitterness. Any time their land is raided or attacked or Dwarfs are hindered in any way some scholar back at the capital sucks in air over his teeth and says, ‚ÄúThat's going in the book.‚Äù While revenge earns rewards, having too many unavenged grudges drops public order as people lose faith in their leader. It breeds a playstyle all about defence, limiting fronts on which the Dwarfs can be attacked and only marching off to make new enemies when old ones have been thoroughly dealt with.

Each faction has their own tech tree, though the Orcs is a bit rudimentary.
Each faction has their own tech tree, though the Orcs is a bit rudimentary.

Meanwhile, the Vampire Counts rely on spreading corruption in the form of a grey, sickly taint on the map. Other factions suffer attrition when moving across corrupted land while Vampire Counts armies are diminished by marching across uncorrupted land. The Vampire Counts can also raise the dead to fill armies instantly rather than waiting (like in Rome II, armies are generated by generals rather than settlements, but cost extra away from the buildings that produce specialists). It's not as much of a game-changer as you'd expect. Unlike the Heroes Of Might & Magic games where the undead grow and grow as they incorporate the fallen into their hordes, Warhammer's Vampire Counts are still reliant on the old-fashioned way to get decent troops, though provinces where large battles have been fought provide a better class of corpses to recruit.

The final of the four playable factions (Bretonnians exist as NPCs but can be used in multiplayer, while Chaos Warriors are available free to those who pre-ordered or buy Total War: Warhammer in its first week and will be paid DLC later) is The Empire. Modelled on the Roman-German Empire, the humans are the most traditional faction, with starting units including crossbowmen, spearmen, and knights that will be more familiar to Total War players than Terrorgheists and Arachnaroks. Imperials get weirder as they go on, with Steam Tanks and knights who trade horses for eagle-headed Demigryphs while their leader Karl Franz can upgrade to a flying Griffon.

All these differences dramatically affected the way I played. As the Greenskins I fought just to keep armies Fighty and raided neighbors without regard for what they thought because that's a significant part of the Orc income even though it went against what I learned with other factions and my regular tendencies. It's not the kind of game where replaying as a different side means ""focusing slightly more on missile weapons because they have +1 with bows"". Each faction is almost a different game, and that's kept me interested.

Clothes shopping must be hell for Giants.
Clothes shopping must be hell for Giants.
Fantasy battles

There's variance between factions in both the turn-based campaign game and the real-time battles. Dwarfs don't have wizards but are blessed with plenty of artillery, and are generally more of a defensive, come-get-me-you-lanky-bastards force. Vampire Counts don't have missile units (not even skeleton archers), though their wizards have a decent Wind Of Death spell. For them it's all about lurching forward, targeting specific enemies with flying units and Black Knights while the skeletons and zombies shamble up to fill the gaps. The Greenskins have a bit of everything, but can be hard to control. When their Leadership drops due to being flanked or attacked by enemies who cause fear they have a tendency to scarper, but recover quickly and need to be shepherded back into the fray for wave after wave.

The effect of spellcasting on battles is less than expected. There's a limited pool of Winds Of Magic to draw from, with goofy blue haze wafting over the campaign map to show where it's strongest this turn, and individual spell effects feel slight compared to the impact of a flanking manoeuvre or well-timed charge. The Raise Dead spell can summon a unit of zombies out of the ground, which is suggested by the handy in-game guide as a good way of blocking a charge, but also works to bog missile units down or pull off a flank attack. Zombies are weak combatants, however, and the spell can only be cast if you're at less than 20 units. Plus, even if those fragile zombies survive they'll be gone at the end of the battle.

This game is absolutely fantastic. It's satisfying when everything clicks and can absolutely make an entire day disappear in an instant.

That being said...This game has a pretty steep learning curve for new comers of the total war series and even more so if you're new to both Warthammer AND total war. I've never been super great at strategy games, so my first few hours with this game meant CONSTANTLY restarting the main campaign, because I would back myself into a corner that I couldn't get out of. But after doing some research (Especially tips on the early game) I was able to hit the ground running.

Also...Don't pay full price for this. It's currently sitting at over $70 CAD and I would NOT pay that much for this game. I did however pick it up for $17 on sale and was TOTALLY worth it.",1572482265,1572482265,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I saw the trailer for Warhammer I knew I had to have it. It looked so cool. I knew nothing about Warhammer Fantasy but that didn't stop me. I rolled an Empire campaign and they seemed to be the most newbie friendly since they were human and had balanced armies familiar to historical titles.

Then I ended up fighting vampires and really fell in love with the game. Here I was fighting monsters and the undead. I just knew I had to try the vampires next. And so I did. They play exactly as an undead faction should. With tons of zombie meatshields to bog down their enemy while their actually valuable units flank and wreak havoc. Hell, even if the vampires lost most of their army, it's not a huge loss. They can simply raise the dead and fight again. I love it!

I had to try every faction. Each time I encountered a new one I thought they had some really cool units or characters and wanted to try them next. Through this game, a love for Warhammer developed and I began to research more about the lore and world. No regrets. Still one of my favorite fantasy worlds ever. And now I have moved onto Warhammer Total War II.

The first game is still very well polished and has the added benefit of being at the end of life. No more updates will throw it out of balance which is pretty good. If you purchase both this game and the second game, there is a combined map that can be played from the second game. You can choose any faction from both games and fight factions from both games! The only downside is the load time can be excessive. So that would be a reason to switch back to Warhammer I.

I bought this game shortly after it came out, and I gotta say, despite it being an older release I don't care they upped the price. Unless you're particularly cheap, or simply want to get it so you can play the 2nd one with the factions included from the first, it shouldn't be any problem that it's full price. If you like the total war style games and also happen to be a fan of Warhammer, I recommend just buying the first one and just letting that be it. Play the first one first, and if LATER you decide you want more out of it, or you feel something is missing, by all means buy the second. I'm planning on buying the second eventually because after playing the first one for a decent amount of time I want more of it. If there are any Warhammer fans not sure what to do and you happen to stumble onto my comment, I recommend buying the game with your favorite faction. I'm a fan of woodelves, and beastmen now too, so I'm happy that I managed to get the first one first. However, if you wanna play with some rats, or some edgy elves, grab the second. Those races don't even make an appear as a minor faction in the first one. There are some things about this game I don't like and that's the cheating AI, the time Chaos shows up and their insane power level, the fact the game just ends after you finished the questline, rather than it give you some OP bonus or some world environmental effect that affects the world instead of just outro and continue or cut to main menu. Rather tame for a Warhammer game imo. Then again, most Warhammer games aren't quite as brutal or out there like the lore, including 40K. I also wish there was a way just to spectate the battle field and just let the AI's duke it out in the campaign, which is unfortunate because my favorite thing to do in this game is to just watch my armies rip enemies to shreds.

Ok i was super excited about this game when i first heard of it. I've been a big fan of the other Total War games as i have over 1000 hours between Rome, Rome II, Attila, Shogun, and Medieval. So i bought this game as well as Warhammer II. 

Truth be told, this game is a TOTAL AND UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT.

If you are a fan of traditional (and new) total war games, then do not buy this game and do not waste your money. As for what is wrong with this game...where do i start??

1. First of all, there are no minor settlement defenses. At first i was like ""why not, might as well try it out since i paid money for this game."" Then i proceed to waste 50 hours on a campaign as the Empire, upgraded all my settlements to 3 or higher, and even BUILT GUARDHOUSES in these minor settlements. But then, 3 stacks of Beastmen just magically spawn in the middle of my land WITH NO WARNING and proceed to raze all my settlements to the ground as my main armies are HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD. And the funny thing is, if there was minor settlement defenses, i would have been able to hold them off. 
Which leads me to my next problem with this game...

2. Absolutely ridiculous campaign mechanics. Some of these AI cheats makes the Huns from Total War Attila look like babies. I'm talking about random full stacks spawning in the middle of your land with NO WARNING and you might have had a chance if you had minor settlement defenses...oh wait... there isn't any....
So next time you are 100 turns in and waging a war across your kingdom and its going fairly well...think again. 

3. The battles are a joke. There is no strategy. No formations or abilities you can use. No shield wall formation with a unit of fully armored swordsmen. No pike wall with halberdiers. Hell they even removed loose formation. And some of you are gonna say ""Well theres a mod for formations..."" which i have tried. And it got my hopes up. Except this ""mod"" doesn't change formations. All it does is change the shape of the unit and give ridiculous buffs. (Like unbreakable).....That's only the first issue with the battles. Next up - armor and defense doesn't mean sh*t. Neither does well composed armies with ratios of cavalry, spear infantry, shock infantry, and archers. Noooope. That strategic army you just raised just got decimated by a motley crew of dinosaurs, wizards, and magical floaty chariots. No strategy like i said. To win....just have the biggest monsters and the most amount of wizards.

4. Diplomacy is bland. Compared to other total war games, Warhammer diplomacy is half-as*ed. It was literal copy and paste from the first Warhammer. Nothing makes it special, it is just meh.

5. Greedy devs. LITERALLY HALF the game you cannot play without buying DLCs.
You'll break your computer finding out that all your money was wasted on an utterly useless game.
(Side note: Any game starting with, containing, or ending with the world 'Warhammer' or any game in the Warhammer series is a rip-off and money hungry.)

All the hard work put into this game was in the wrong places. Its like the old phrase of putting gold on a pig. The graphics, particles, and battle maps are supposed to be icing on the cake. If the cake is sh*t in the first place, then icing is useless. The strategy is gone. Old school Total War feel is butchered. This game is like a mutated and wrong version of Total War.

So heed my advice and do not buy. I almost broke my computer over this game. Do not make the same mistake i did. DO NOT BUY 1/10 UTTER CRAP",1571692355,1571692355,False,5,3,0.406027048826217651,0,True,False,False

The presentation is nigh on flawless, logistical campaign gameplay manages to be just as fun as the mighty and ferocious battles, and it's all brought in a beautiful package full of gloriously cinematic bloodshed and politicking. 

This is one of those games where it really does feel like every decision you make matters, even on repeated campaigns when you've got the general rhythm of gameplay and upgrades down. The A.I. is intelligent enough to match and combat almost every decision you make along the way, at least with the help of some subtle balancing mods that help prevent early game enemies' bad habits of spamming archer units when you have no effective way of countering them yet.

Mods are highly encouraged to really enjoy the game, especially when starting out, and this can easily be seen as a negative.  But the vanilla experience is balanced well enough that 99% of the time you have to be just making extremely poor choices to get yourself in an unwinnable situation.  The mods and surprisingly engaged community, such as youtubers like Lionheartx10 and Zerkovich and the subreddit, are there to ease new players into an experience that actually isn't as complicated as you might think.

The abundance of expensive DLC is definitely a turn off in this day and age, but there's such a massive content available in the base game and with the free DLC that it has more than enough to get you invested in the experience.  There is absolutely no reason to purchase any DLC right when you start the game.

All in all, this is the game that got me interested in grand strategy, and I'm very happy I picked it up. This is one of the most thrilling and frenetic strategy games ever made, constantly bringing a new challenge to the table and making you feel like you earned every upgrade and victory.

1. Replayability  - Good. You will replay this game


1. in homage to the original civ (great game) they replay the whole world as you conquer it. 25 Year anniversary of a cool concept. Shame they messed it up by having the events come up as well. You won, have a button you click if you want to see the events. Also needs to have a faster playback, when you win it's fast. Well that's how you recall it happening....
However they still get one thing wrong, it should show the whole map not just the area you have reached. For goodness sake the game is over, show the damn map and lets see all the factions and their conquering too. Civ 1 25 years old and still got this right when warhammer didn't. 25 years and gamers haven't learnt a damn thing.


Cons

1. When you lose a city, you have to wait upto a minute before a pop-up appears to end the screen. Seriously not even escape or any key press works you have to wait for a stupid pop up, you will just be sitting there all day waiting for popups.


2. So much time wasted messing around with no quick escape/enter key press. You press escape or enter  to end a screen pop-up and no you must move your mouse icon over a small button. Talk about a console port fail or just rubbish programmers. PC users have a keyboard and like short cuts.

To some, this may be a great game, but after following the warhammer series and knowing total war mechanics, I cannot sujest this. Even the workshop community is trying desprately to revive what the devs of WH:TW failed to do.

First off, The DLC's are dumbfoundedly limited <other then chaos thanks to workshop, GJ guys, especially Chaos Devided, very nice stuff there.) and don't have as many units as they should. The elves are woth it only because of their treemen, but, sadly that is still not enough to buy it. All the DLC's have so few units in them <cept chaos because WS>. Like, elves and beastmen according to WH lore, have TONS more then what is there, and even non lorefriendly ideas would be amazing just so that it doesnt feel like a compleate waste of money. 

TW:WH does not have enough content even though it has so much, compaired to Medivel II: Total War it's not very much.
The only reason I can put up with the lack of units for the overpriced DLC is because of the hard working Workshop members who arnt even getting paid.

SECONDLY AND IMPORTANT TO OTHER TOTAL WAR PLAYERS
This next and simple part brings the soul of Khorne out in me. It is that there are NO UNIT FORMATIONS.

When I say Formations, I mean, No shield wall, no spear wall, no turtle shield formation, NONE OF IT. I have NO IDEA why that CRUTIAL option is not included, but it isnt there.

Instead of formations, they have buffs against charges, etc. Stupid... no animations or anything for it.

This is what you need to know before you buy it.

Pro:
Beautiful Characters
Amazing Locations
Fantasy Fights in Total War
Diverse Units
Dedicated Workshop Members <Honestly love their work>

Cons:
Few units
Mostly Reskined units
Minimal Content for high priced DLC
No Strategic Formations for units
Units tend to not actually have much Morale compaired to other Total War games
Many Warhammer Units have been excluded from the game.

And finally, I am Waiting on Skaven <Yes I am going to wait for the Skaven even if it never happens. I mean, cmon, they could be a good addition, I WANT MY GLOBADIERS. Assassin rats, rat ogres, stormvermin. Cmon, they basicly made the Skaven ready for Total War. Just saying. Look into Vermintide guys, you can find some ideas.

Love you all, If you get the game, hope you enjoy it. You will understand the cons and pros i've pointed out if you do get it.

If more units/factions/races get added, I would definantly change my opinion. And if unit formations get added. Makes it more stratigic and satisfying as you watch your shielded spearmen line up to counter a calvery charge.

Don't even get me started on the DLC, there are four playable races in the game that are admitedly quite unique but Sega designed more than four before they even released the game for example, the chaos warriors this race is not included in the base game which is 60$ but was released week one for about 10 more $ WHAT?????

CA made Warhammer Total War, made some changes and released DLC that added more stuff to it.
Then came Warhammer II, a continuation of Warhammer I, so much so that some people complained that it should have been an expansion.

While I agree, at this point Warhammer II is what Left 4 Dead 2 is to Left 4 Dead 1: it overtook the game and is now the ""main"" game of the series.
The same will happen to Warhammer 3 and I will happily buy it again when it does.

Now, regarding Warhammer I. It's good, even if it was suplanted by Warhammer II. I think it's worth the buy, especially since it unlocks all its races for Warhammer II (it's in fact the only way to unlock them) including Empire, Dwarves, Vampire Counts and Green Skins. 
Factions like Chaos, Wood Elves and Beastmen must be unlocked via this game's DLC, but it also unlocks those factions for Warhammer II.

I found this game to be fustrating I know most people say my review is not helpful but I played every single Total War game via CD/DVD or Steam.  Of course I have prejudice as a Total War game.  it's a step backward you be better off buying Atila. As a game it's not a bad game it's just not up to my expectations of Total War Series.  IMO Total War is the greatest game series of grand strategy / rts games. I enjoy other RTS games like blizzard, command & conquer extra.  But those do not have a grand campaign similar to total war series.   

CONS:

Cost more than other Total war games that are more fun.

Boring implimentation of common units, other than lords.  Even Humans in Total War Rome had shield walls to make a different stance.  Here everything is "" Lord "" 

lack of intresting or unique technology tree seemed to just be random with some races like an after thought as if I got to get this done fast.  
lack of unique spells (general) all spells between the lords is similar 
lack of control in battle field seems like units were unresponsive in pathing around buildings
lack of commands for units no special stances
lack of grouping or battle formations during fights (2 only) 
Also they don't stay in the formation such as in a group movement once assigned unlike other total wars they stayed in formation here they don't.
 
PRO:
new units large, flying ""kind of""
introduction to non-human and magical units
new fight animations
unique terrain/castles

There are some negatives though (and the developers should look at this for future games)
-The Dlc policy, I know the developers may need extra cash for the budget, but a lot of the games-content is made of dlcs and some are just bizarre to be a dlc. Like blood for bloodgod, I mean it is a cool game feature and shouldn't demand an extra buck.
-The AI. It is sometimes quite crazy what the enemy as well as the allied AI does, so of course it keeps exciting, but it is something that can be improved
-The level of difficulty. Now I usually play the campaigns and I think everything is quite enjoyable until the hard-level.

I finished the campaign as the Empire, Vampire Lords, and Dwarves and completed the Eye for an Eye story (ok that one was not as good as the main campaign).  And I can attest that the 4 factions I played are quite different and refreshing.  A quick note that yes the DLC policy is quite annoying as the vanilla game without paid DLCs doesn't feel like a complete experience.  But the option of combining the two worlds from Warhammer 1 and 2 is simply fantastic.  

Pros:
+  Multiple factions with distinct gameplay mechanics.
+  The battles are very fun.
+  The Warhammer universe brings quite the epic flavor to the Total War formula.
+  If you add the DLC contents, you can easily sink a few hundred hours.
+  I liked the Quests, but I think they can expand on those and make them even more complex.  Would have liked to have some more varied situations like quests where they force you to start with specific Units or where you fight an overpowered Boss that cannot be played...

Cons:
-  Everything is monetized.  There is no loot boxes, but quite a bit of DLCs.
-  The Legendary Heroes are not as Legendary as one can think.  I believe this is done to have balancing among factions...  But Archaon the Everchosen should be able to literally piss on many other Lords that are Tier 1 in this game.
-  You need a beast of a PC if you want to have everything maxed AND use the Mortal Empire DLC (the one that combines both Warhammer 1 and 2).

This game would be good if it weren't for the loading times. After the intial wonder and fun soon the annoyance and impatience set in. And after a few hours in the game the fear to fuck up and have to load again undid every fun I had with the game.
That probably is no problem to the total war players who already are really great at the game, but for me it's no fun like this. And because it is so tedious I also have no desire to put myself through the torture of getting better at the game that consist of 50% loading screen.

Also something minor, I think the UI is pretty bad, it adds to the unhandiness of the game.

The diplomacy system is absolutely bare-bones, if Archeon isn't on his way or you're not a big power or you're not just swimming in money, others most of the time don't want anything to do with you except for killing you.

Strategic part of the vanilla game is simplified and relatively OK. You have diplomacy similar to Attila TW which is not bad when compared with diplomatic options of the older games including Shogun 2, Napoleon and Empire. Map is a bit cramped and combat often unavoidable. Now you might say what is wrong with combat? Here comes the punchline: the vanilla game is horrible because battles last 4-6 minutes. You gather your troops carefully and watch them getting slaughtered in a few minutes time. If you stick with only Patch 7 and install old mod, whose community is still active, called Wakes Realism Overhaul, the game changes completely, battles are satisfying and the whole feeling of the gameplay is centered around enjoyable experience which has some depth. All thanks to a mod. Now comes the controversial part - is it recommendable to buy games only because of mods?

I am baffled why anyone would give this a positive review, much less a majority of people reviewing it as such. This is my first venture into the Total War games, and I now know why there's so many of them; these must be real easy to pump out. There's more load time than gameplay here. It's like they took the worst, most tedious parts of Sid Meier's Civilization and Warhammer, and mashed them together to make one of the least enjoyable, least playable RTS games I've ever experienced. There's 2 different ""gameplay"" elements in this - the campaign map, and the battles. In the campaign map you get to move around your armies and ""heroes."" Heroes can fight in battles with your armies if you choose to have them do so (which is really the only time that they're vulnerable), otherwise, they can run around the map on their own, and be totally immune to any danger, unless another very high-leveled hero has unlocked the ability to assassinate other heroes.  This means that heroes can just move freely around the map, and hamper armies by just standing in their way. There's nothing the army can do about it, and the AI knows it, so this is what they have their heroes do to you, and each other, ALL GAME LONG! Heroes are mobile mountains; awesome. The campaign map lets you manage pre-placed cities as well, which have very limited building options, and are constantly under the influence of multiple factors (order/support, chaos, vampirism, etc). A majority of your interactions with cities will be trying to manage those factors with the very limited options that you have. Now, onto the battles...which you also won't do much in. The biggest influence you have in battles is placing your units, and choosing their first fighting engagements. After that, good luck getting them to do anything you tell them to. And that's it. You don't really do anything in battle past that...unless you include battling the camera, in which case, a majority of your time in battles will be committed to that endless war. Now, let's say that you want to actually do these battles, and not just pick to auto-resolve them when they happen. Everytime you enter a battle, you have a long load time. If you messed up your placement in battle, or if your units really fudged something, you'll probably want to try the battle again. Unfortunately, there's no 'retry battle' option, so what you actually have to do is pick to concede the battle, endure a very long load time, then load the save, endure another long load time, then enter the battle again, and endure yet another long load time. I kid you not, redoing a battle takes over 5 minutes of sitting around! And it's not even time where you can go and do something else while waiting, because you have to keep picking to load the next thing! IT'S SO ****ING STUPID!

however, i played rome 2 the other day, just for fun, and i came to the realization that over three fourths of the game is closed behind DLC paywall, and to be honest, that kinda cash is not just laying around.

my other gripe is that it runs pretty bad on my PC. but, granted, my PC is not some, top of the line, supercomputer, so the fault is mostly mine...but still.

my other gripe, and this one is the main reason for this review, it's not the dlc paywall for the game, the poor running, its the battle animation. take rome 2, or shogun, or shit, even medeval two. the sword duels between indivudual units were riviting. i remember watching for hours my legionares duking it out between gaulic tribesmen, or being hacked to bits by germans in forests.

     warhammer does not have this same zeal.....it really just starts and ends with the units jumping up and down on eachother with their weaopns........a small gripe, but still a major one , when combined with the other ones.


a good game, just not a good Total War, but this game does have some redeeming qualities:
a good charecter development system
mounts
giant critters
fantasy atmosphere
your heroes go out to battle
generals are not made of glass.



like i said, a good game, just, not a good total war game.",1545894941,1562223019,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think I have only two major complaints:

1.) The campaigns don't offer too much depth in the economic system. Money seems to easy to get, while trade isn't important enough and spam of elite units far too easy.

2.) Heroes and generals being one-man armies is even for Warhammer a bit too over the top. A single character trying to beat an entire regiment on its own is even in the tabletop game pretty dangerous. I would have vastly preferred a unit attachment system for characters.

Graphisc look good. Gameplay on other hand is somewhat different. On difficulty higher than normal, AI cheat (What a suprise). 
AI agents drain your blood, happiness (luckilly, u can fix it by mods). AI armies just move one step before yours so hunt some army make u do it for like 2-5 rounds longer and if u get loses in your army throw that your army will be decimated before u even get to fight. 

And on the point of it, i just cant get to it. These new monsters, heroes just make common tactics like spike on kavalry doestn work here on 100%. Now u have to think about composition of your armies and the enemy one to counter their units. Becouse if u didnt, monsters or heroes will decimate your armies by them alone. It wouldnt be problem but u have to adapt for it. If u do the battels will be fun.

Economy and buildings are cut to be easily understand, but i like more the economic page of ruling your empires, buildings watchtowers, roads etcectra and after that to fight. 

The worst part of the game:
AI diplomacy is compleatly worst of this games i played. The AI dont accepts your trades becouse u have one province more than them. U cant get or give your cities to AI throw diplomacy or get rid of the city once u conquer it (And in basic game u cant conquer and capture all cities. IT is not even the bad thing, it just fit in fantasy.)

I played mostly moded TW: Medieval II so adjusting to this game was really terrible for me. 

On the other hand if u want Warhammer its better to buy second piece (Has better AI according my friends). Only reason to buy this one is to get the Grand map adjusted with these two TW: warhammer series.",1561895145,1561895145,False,2,1,0.479704797267913818,0,True,False,False

Since the release of Warhammer 2 it has seemed like the original has not been getting the same love in terms of balance and bug fixes. Although I have not run across anything that makes the game unplayable and have even been able to rule the map with Bretonia before it was buffed.

Even though this game got positive reviews, I didnt buy it until recently...And oh boy was I missing something. TW:Warhammer is definitely one of the best in the series. 
Every faction has a different mechanic such as Vampires have to corrupt cities before capturing them or Dwarfs need to keep their Grudge Book clean to avoid conficts at home etc. etc. Unit variety is on point, you won't get bored by playing the same units over and over again. Dragons, helicopters, pistols, magic...This game has it all.
Battle maps are excellent and for the first time ever in a TW game, you can really use the terrain to your advantage. Battles are challeging and you have to play to your factions strengths to win. For example, you can't run your Dwarfs around all the time and expect to win the battle.
This can go on and on, so to keep it short; from campaign map to battle map to battles, this game delivers. Only thing it is lacking is a real story to keep you going for the ultimate victory (I heard TW:Warhammer II has it).

This game recaptured my love for the franchise, no historical title could have.

As a DnD player and someone who only knew about spacemarines in 40k, I was so glad to experience Warhammer in such a nuanced setting.

After not buying any TW after Attila, I moved on to AoE2 and Paradox games. What made me pick up WTW? Learning from  one Heir of Carthage video and some friends that I was not only good, but thankly better optimised that the FPS crunching of R2TW and ATW, and was the accumulation of most of the best features of modern TW's.

One thing that bothered me when I first played it was that you could not settle any old type of settlement, you could only capture or settle compatible settlements or raze them if not. 

Economy is a much simpler version to most total war titles. As food was only required for growth of a settlement to enable upgrades. Military buildings only needed to be placed sporadically leaving room for other elements to be built.

Family trees seem to be no longer used. Personal faction politics are also not used as far as i seen.

All in all I love this game and will play every faction at least once.

The politics that was introduced into Rome 2 had me pissed for a while I do not forget but will be more careful with their products in the future

This is not a game for people who may get "" triggered"" if chaos ensues !
Like me for example..
Purchased game, bought most of the dlc's.
Said to myself, ""lets try easy mode"", and try to figure out the schematics.
But,,,,, there is no easy mode... As a matter of fact,, it's barely a game.. 
If you are willing to spend 40 hrs on you tube, watching videos that some kid who lives in his mom's basement posts, on how to micro manage a completely broken economy, then buy this game immediately, and prepare to go on welfare.

If you enjoy, building an army on a Wallmart workers salary, running it across the map to take a city, only to lose 4  by the time you take 1 ?? this game is for you !!

The level of frustration will be sure to cause anyone with anger management issues to punch your monitor through your mom's basement wall. 

If you smoke, get the patch, you will go through a carton, and that""s before the chaos even begins. !

It starts out fun, but even on easy mode, it's a terrible game to wrap your head around. 
The economy does not work, unless you are able to outsmart the most OP artificial intelligence on the planet.
Mark my words kids, if you get zits easy from stress, you will need a lifetime prescription for proactive after the first couple hours.

In short, this game is for hard core basement dwellers, who can do a Rubik's Cube, without pulling all the stickers off ! 
I had to pull the stickers off....
Frustrating game... broken economy... it`s Chaos ! In the literal sense..
I give it a 2 out of 10...

This game has an excessive amount of DLC with some glaring power imbalances. TW:WH2 also came is also out as a separate title (with yet more DLC). That being said, it captures the aesthetics of the WHFB very well and the TW engine is as solid as ever. Diplomacy is pretty off, but what did you expect in a wargame? It's all an excuse to murder the other team.

The campaign is pretty rough starting with the basic Empire faction- use guides or get your face bashed in repeatedly. Likewise, game mechanics aren't always very clear and the game is punishing on bad matchups. Auto resolve can also be wonky. This can be exploited, but may also mean you lose and army to what should be a decisive victory.

For WHFB fans, faction imbalance, odd combat mechanics , mandatory purchases, and power creep will be nothing new.

The game also suffers from power and feature creep; many of the new DLC characters and factions are absurdly OP compared to the original ones in the game. The Empire, for example, was a faction in the game from the beginning. Their research tree has an option to increase your soldier's armour by +5 (a pathetic amount), and this takes 12+ turns.

On the other hand the new Vampire leader gives every single one of his soldiers on the map a big XP boost every turn, or his entire army gains poisoned attacks. Similarly the new Dwarf lords, particularly Grimbrondal, do absolutely absurd damage and are very hard to kill.

The major negative is the DLC and the fact you need to pay for it. Understand extra campaigns, but factions such as Chaos and Norsica should have been included and factions such as the Empire should have been released with all their heroes and units.

I've watched as each game gets better graphics but reduced gameplay and complexity in every installment. Warhammer is not a total war game. It's a very cut down arcade game. I'm not saying it's bad. It just isn't the grand strategy game I enjoy.

If you enjoy Warhammer or fantasy combat then you will likely get some enjoyment out of this. If you want Total War grand strategy then you're completely out of luck. It's all fantasy and geared for arcade style player vs. player combat. I have tried to get into the combat but it's so completely alien to previous Total War games it's just not interesting to me. Sadly this seems to be the direction Creative are taking all the total war games. Online live service multi player competitive play over historical strategy. Yes the AI is appalling in all total war games and very easy to exploit once you figure out how it works. But I do enjoy single player games and the ability to just do a few turns as and when I have some free time and that's what you can achieve with Atilla or Rome or Empire. 

Creative have patched most the bugs out of Warhammer and combat is fairly balanced for the type of game it is. Graphics are very nice and in keeping with Warhammer. I can't recommend this as a Total War game because it isn't Total War. If you don't mind that fact then give it a try or watch some campaign plays on YouTube.

You can build a settlement up to have walls and a significant garrison for defense, but then a random army can roll up and attack, and I am forced to LEAVE those walls and defend in an open field against a superior force? Why even have the option for walls?

Diplomacy doesn't make sense either. The computer only wants to trade or form alliances if you are weaker then them. Even if you declare war on all the factions they are at war with boost your reputation with them... getting a basic trade agreement is like pulling teeth. Hell, the computer can still deny a trade agreement if you subjugate them!! Yes, the game is called Total War, but why waste time building a Diplomacy system if a Total War run is the only way to play? Might as well just declare war on everything right away every time you play and save yourself the time of the computer making a non-aggression treaty one turn, and then break it the next.

These games aren't known for smart choices made by the computer, but it seems even worse in this game. They just charge right at you. There is no trouble kiting tougher units and isolating weaker ones to achieve crushing victories every time. I just ended up auto resolving to save time, as I was having more fun building my territory up and dealing with the broken Diplomacy system

I hear Warhammer II is better, I might give it a try at some point. But I think I'll be going back to Rome II or Shogun II

The map is small and you can win inside 250 turns probably a lot less on 2nd play through if you're that bored and want to do it again and all because of one thing, the stupid event that is supposed to bring death but unless you are playing as a troll it's completely your best friend, it starts in the north and wipes out the competition leaving ruins for you to easily colonise. When will CA learn that roaming horde factions suck, every game that has these just turns the game into easy mode. I want to plan and struggle taking cities not colonising their remains, castles and armies are far harder to kill than a roaming horde. I won the long campaign without ever being the strongest faction the whole game wtf. I had one battle with the elves and barely saw any orcs or goblins, I started as the empire and made friends with the dwarfs at the start of the game who were the strongest faction throughout the whole game, they took care of the south while i cleared up the norths ruins. Not even having to fight the strongest faction to win is a major flaw in my book, the battles are an improvement generally although can be very messy when there are trees making you struggle to click on or see a unit ( not hidden just hard to see ) they really should have made these go transparent when you're directly looking at them. 
It was still fun ( mainly the early part of game ) but lacks a challenge once the main event starts, maybe I'll try a troll race as really they are the only ones who could struggle.
CA when you make your next game please remove roaming factions, they suck, suck, suck. I bought this for 10 pounds and wouldn't recommend paying anymore than that.
I guess the people over at gamespot are too young to remember Rome.
Ok so I originally gave it a thumbs up but I've changed to a thumbs down, you can't play as a troll ( well not in the standard game ) so this game offers no challenge whatsoever and no replay value for me, 42 hours is all I'm going to be putting into this one and the last 20 of those were extremely boring. The Elves, what's the point ? they are not even involved in the game if you are the Empire, I had to go right out my way just to attack them once, Greenskins are not much better. As a rule I use auto fight most the time but when the best part of the game is the RTS then this really doesn't suit someone who likes a challenge on the map. The map looks pretty but it's just cluttered making it hard to find things, people go on about all the different lords but who cares when they nearly all do the same thing but look slightly different. pretty sure this game will only appeal to Warhammer fans.",1553468655,1553538090,False,1,1,0.424935817718505859,3,True,False,False

The cav get's stuck , even if a single rider gets stuck in combat, it has Disastrous impact on the whole unit.

There is a severe pause between user click and a unit caring out the command even if done manually.
The SHIFT queing of commands is basically pointless as units behave in strange ways , sometimes they stop randomly and think about god knows what.

the charge mechanic is wonky, as you have to be specific distance from the enemy to perform a charge , it's not very fluid , it's clumsy. However it's not like you're going to make good use of it as the units get glued to the enemy regardless. 
So most of the time you charge and then baby sit your braindead unit until it FINALLY somehow get's freed, inb4 half of it get's killed anyway. 
Especially low tier units have not that very strong charge ability, they can't really push trough entire unit. So you don't get to utalize it strategically, other than maybe to chase down the missle infantry.

You miss out on The Beastmen, Chaos, Norsca, The Wood Elves, and a whole heap of lords and unique units for some factions not to mention a distinct lack of blood. (Also Bretonnia but they are technically free DLC) So you miss out on more than half the game without the DLC. Which I hate, you can't buy just the game you gotta get the DLC too. Which is where this game begins to falter. Now this isn't the first time CA has done this. They did it with Rome 2, Warhammer 2, and will most definitely do it with Three Kingdoms. I hate this practice and so does most of the community, and as much as I don't want to do it, if the game plays like this one I will likely continue to buy it.

That's fucking pathetic.


EDIT:

Just wanted to give an update to this review, not that anyone cares or is buying Warhammer 1 other than to play Mortal Empires... Anyway!

I haven't purchased WH2 yet, simply because of the mountain of modding I will have to do to get the game even to a playable state.  I've heard that CA finally went back and rebalanced the old world factions to still not be as competitive as the WH2 factions and they're drastically overpowered skills/spells in the second game compared to the first.

It's a great game, it is NOT a Total War game.  This is a WARHAMMER game.  There are elements of Total War, such as the campaign map, and that's really about where it ends.  This is meant to be played as if you were competing on a tabletop.  IF you can get in that mind set and compare units going up against units (pseudo-rock-paper-scissors style), it's actually a great game for combat.

The main mods I did with it was edit the Morale, items, and abilities/upgrades of characters.  The base morale values in this game are absolute shit, fights won't last more than 5 minutes if it's not edited.  These are supposed to be trained soldiers fighting for their entire world against age old enemies, they wouldn't just up and flee in 30 seconds of the fight going the opposite direction.

The close in, the battle graphics are vastly superior to previous TW titles, but there's no actual point, as you're never viewing the battle from there anyway.  The campaign map also looks pretty in the screenshots and whatnot, but actually it's a lot of clutter, and it makes it difficult to see where anything is.

I kept losing very badly to the greenskins.  On my third attempt,  I was able to contain my main enemy to three provinces.  (by all rights, having 3x the economic might should have clinched the war, espcially considering the loss I kept inflicting.) He had a full army, which means nearly his full budget should be going to pay for most of it.  He attacked where my army was not and took two provinces before I could catch him.  Then a second full army appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.  It is quite impossilbe for several reasons, the least of which is that he could not afford such an army.  Seeming that the game was unbeatable due to cheating, On fourth attempt, I then discovered that attacking the greenskin provinces in the right order provided much better results.  In short, I had to move straight to attack his main city.  This contradicted several game guides, to which I had referred since I was apparently doing something wrong.

Total War: WARHAMMER is a game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by SEGA and forms part of the Total War series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Total War: WARHAMMER overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great grand strategy game to play in short bursts!

This feels like an incomplete game, in 14 hours i have already hit the end game in two campaigns and noticed that despite the variety of tactical gameplay between factions; there is no variety in the main objective of the game.

Simply put 3 things happen.
1. Chaos curb stomps you.
2. You curb stomp Chaos.
3. Play as Chaos and run around the map doing nothing.

This leads into the same kind of strategic gameplay across ALL factions, which is just utter stupidity and boring as watching paint dry.

End game units can be made available in turn 40, so about 2 hours work. However these units (with exceptions of course) are barely better then baseline ones which are also significantly cheaper, while tactics may win you battles in this game, overrunning your enemies in cheap units wins you campaigns.

The map is smaller then many previous titles that CA has developed, many of the races are behind a pay wall and you STILL have to pay for blood and gore effects. Take out the setting and this is one of the more shallow Total War games i have ever played, they still have a rock, paper, scissors mentality to how units fight and not to how they would realistically perform or even how they performed on the freaking tabletop game. Top it off with nearly half of the races in the setting missing and it just ends up with a whole lot of its potential missing.

It plays like half of a finished product that has been polished so it can be sold to consumers at full price, lo and behold when CA brought out Warhammer II with the rest of the game for another $80.

I am tired of CA, tired of SEGA throwing this franchise against the wall and beating it to death. I said that i would not get another total war after Attila but i made an exception for this one due to the setting that i hold dear, especially since the makers of said setting, Games Workshop, have thrown it on a dumpster fire.

I am not buying another total war while CA and SEGA have control over it; a mixture of franchise fatigue, bullshit business practices and oversimplification of gameplay has left me sour and bitter.

Winning a battle is meaningless, the AI will rebuild instantly. Any effort to weaken the AI is meaningless, it doesn't need money or resources to maintain multiple, massive stacks of the best troops in the game. A single AI province can maintains four or five maximum stacks of the highest teir armies. I have never seen this before in a Total War game.

edit: the game works at least. If it were just about the real time combat on the tactical map, I would recommend it. But I hate everything about the campaign map where the game play is extremely poor and needs to be redesigned. In the single player, you'll spend most of your time on the campaign map where the developers have created an amazing mix of the boring and the frustrating. Essentially, on the map, you make about two or three decisions and then wait for the AI to resolved the other 25 factions. But since the AI doesn't need money and has many stacks of the highest tier units, the AI is having all the fun. Everytime I exit the game, all I can think about is how much I hate it.

edit 2: Played the Wood Elf campaign and it was pretty fun. Although the stacks of high tier, free AI armies continued,I actually had an economy and had some decent unit stacks myself. Because of that, I got to make meaningful decisions and fight some challenging battles with some interesting units.

I suppose whether a campaign is fun or miserable really depends on the faction.",1547368657,1547930643,True,0,0,0.449814110994338989,0,True,False,False
