If you like games like DayZ then you'll most likely love this game. It's just like DayZ, except remove the zombies, replace them with hostile human NPCs who are armed to the teeth, add in a bit of base building and vehicles (only boats so far though). You will likely have to struggle to survive at first and to build a base and get established. This game has some very tense moments and a bit of a learning curve for most, but once you get things figured out it's much easier. So far this game has given me more hours of fun than dollars spent, so it's good for what it is.

Pros:
The game pretty much showers you with guns and ammo, they tend to be very easy to find and plentiful. There's a wide variety of them and it's fun to test out different ones. Your guns sometimes jam (the Scorpion SMG especially) on you and you'll have to clear it, adding more realism. Food and water tend to be more scarce than the guns and ammo or items to use for crafting or selling. You'll have to sometimes go fishing or hunt deer or duck to feed yourself. The game runs very smoothly for me, usually at around 100 fps, never dropping below 60, and the graphics are quite nice. There are missions, but they're simply to just kill all of the enemies at a certain location. I've completed a couple of easy and a couple of medium so far, I plan on moving on to a hard one next. I've been playing on a PVE server and grouped up with a random guy for a bit, which was fun. So far I haven't been killed by an bugs in the game, which is far more than I can say about DayZ where I'd get killed by glitches more than anything else. The game has some rudimentary base building and vehicles, but...

Cons:
So far it only has boats and there's not much building or crafting to be done, so that stuff seems to be more of an after thought in the game. From what I've heard they're working on adding land vehicles and the prone position. Yes, that's right you cannot go prone in game yet, which is a bit disappointing, but I've been able to get by without laying on my belly. Once those are implemented successfully the game will be improved, as the game can be a bit tedious at times having to run around so much. Another improvement I would like them to add is much more base building and crafting. As of right now there isn't much you can build, just a simple wooden base with crates to store items, a station to repair guns and paint your clothing, and a campfire to cook food.",1709069268,1709069268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Deadside initially captured the attention of players with its expansive open-world environment and intense survival mechanics. However, the game's potential is overshadowed by the rampant spread of hacking and cheating, which has transformed what should be a thrilling struggle for survival into a frustrating and unfair ordeal.

One of the most glaring manifestations of hacking and cheating in Deadside is the prevalence of aimbots and wallhacks in player-versus-player (PvP) encounters. It is disheartening to witness skilled players being overshadowed by individuals who rely on automated aim assistance to gain an unfair advantage. The result is an unbalanced and demoralizing gameplay experience, where victory is not determined by skill or strategy, but by the ability to exploit illicit software.

Furthermore, the integrity of Deadside's economy is undermined by players who engage in duping exploits and item manipulation. This not only devalues in-game currency and items but also disrupts the delicate balance of the game's economy, rendering legitimate gameplay progression meaningless. As a result, honest players are left feeling disillusioned and disenfranchised, with their hard-earned efforts overshadowed by the exploits of cheaters.

Despite numerous reports from the community regarding hacking and cheating, the response from the developers has been disappointingly inadequate. While occasional ban waves may temporarily address the symptoms of the problem, the root causes remain largely unaddressed, allowing cheaters to resurface with impunity. This lack of decisive action only serves to embolden cheaters and perpetuate a toxic gaming environment where fair play is a rare commodity.

In conclusion, the pervasive presence of hacking and cheating in Deadside represents a significant blemish on an otherwise promising survival game. Unless urgent measures are taken to address this issue, the game risks losing its player base and tarnishing its reputation irreparably. As a fan of Deadside and the survival genre as a whole, I implore the developers to prioritize the fight against hacking and cheating, lest the integrity of the game continue to decay into oblivion.",1708725128,1708725128,True,9,1,0.652208030223846436,0,True,False,True

But I do feel like they made the game a bit too casual. There are respawn points all over the map, rarely more than 1km away from wherever you may have died. This makes PvP pretty awkward, as you basically have to loot and run within a minute of getting a kill or you risk getting surprised by the guy you just offed. Since player bases can have respawn beacons too this only makes the problem worse, as they can then return fully geared out. 

The AI is either dumb as bricks (easy) or Ready Or Not levels of cracked (hard+). Easy is no challenge at all, Hard+ has to be cheesed. Generally though you soon find yourself without a reason to do missions, as most stuff can simply be bought in the safe zone and you generally find a lot of good loot very easily.

The basebuilding is terrible and janky - I am not sure why they tried emulating DayZ here - there are a million games out there that did this better.

How the fuck is anyone supposed to play your game with this going on? i guess we'll see a patch for that in half a year, right?
Review update: i tried pushing further and i even enjoyed the game for quite a while, but frankly it is a complete mess. I don't recommend wasting your money on this game considering it is void of anything meaningful and provides an irritating experience the moment you are actually playing it and not just looking at things. Just so i am not leaving the devs with nothing, i will say that the water bottle/canteens are essentially useless because they store so little fluid considering you drink 20 out of 60 in one drink for the canteen, which is the second highest water storage in. The guns apparently do very little damage to an unprotected enemy and sometimes it can take multiple headshots to kill a bot not even wearing a beanie. The snipers common sniper scope is so terrible that you are better off using iron sights a whole mile out. Enemies spawn wherever they feel like. I literally got swarmed by almost 50 enemies in a location (all bots) and they just kept coming. I dropped almost all of them but was killed by a rush at the end. The bots literally snap to you when you get within a distance. There is no indication of them hearing you or having spotted you, they just snap on and start firing like AI with no bonework whatsoever. The limited water sources is also highly frustrating, especially when you are dehydrated and you've been to all the wells in 5 different locations and got zero water. Clothing items that should definitely house more inventory are only capable of fitting next to no extra items. The intention for the player to build a base is absolutely abysmal. This game is not rust, and it never will be (at least i hope). My point of that is that the inventory space in the game is not at all polished and it is horribly small for how much leg work the game devs are tasking you with (and with all the constant bot spawns) in order to build said base. I also noticed you can't sell ammo to the guns dealer which makes me question if any thought was put into even the safe zones. And the items in the shop are outrageously expensive. explain how a funny mask is 76,000 but a god dahmed AKSM is 15,000. Balanced economy my ass bro, even gucci isn't that steep. You make money by selling items and looting it off dead bots. Though, i don't believe you can get money off of bots unless you are already carrying cash, which puts you at risk of losing whatever you take with you. There is a lot more that i could list off, but frankly i've already dropped a good handful of issues.This game is ridiculous, it's quite dead player wise, and i don't imagine it will ever become anything even good.
Old part:
I truly hope that the devs are still working on the game, because there is so much room for improvement. I do enjoy the game, and it is very beautiful, but it's as if barely any real thought went into this game. there is no way (at least dependably taught) to purify water, which means you MUST travel to a well to fill up bottles and your canteen. Though i spent an entire game coming across empty wells in every single town or spot i went into. literally every single well was empty for no reason. It also takes a ridiculous amount of fire to kill someone if you are not immediately aiming for the head (which in most cases, i am by default) even if the enemies are not wearing a vest or anything reasonably protective. I also wound up with two gun flashlights which are so terrible at illuminating i'd rather just shine an actual flashlight at my monitor to see if that helps. When i had first started playing, i had noticed that i was getting an overabundance of food and drink, and later in playing i was receiving next to no food items after fully looting two whole POI's. I don't know if it's due to server rules and setting item discoveries to a fixed loot drop, but if so there should be some type of indication of said rules clearly listed. Also, the safe zones are absolute crap. I worked very hard in a server to stay alive and keep myuself fed until i got to the safe zone packed with gear, and when i finally get into the safe zone i immediately have an enemy spawn in front of me and kill me. I've also noticed that the vaulting is very screwed up and doesn't really function unless you stand still in front of what you are attempting to vault. I have all of my experience streamed on my youtube channel by the way. 
For as enjoyable as this game can be, it can become such a truly infuriating experience because it is, in my opinion based off of gathered experience as a new player, not very well tuned at all. This game feels as though it was crafted together and then not really touched again. I'm not even sure if it would be wise to be hopeful about this game, because frankly i gave this game a lot of time in my wishlist before purchase and frankly i'm quite dissapointed with the experience they have to offer.",1692349165,1708478667,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I really am not one to write reviews, however, I really like where this game and where it is going. That said it would be nice to see some things get polished that really are horrible. 
Number one: A guide: like the one that's in State Of Decay. Really helps get one up to speed on the how to. 
Number 2: The movement/mechanics: You get stuck on everything while in a building. Furniture, boxes etc... which in certain situations can lead to death. If I get outplayed fine, getting stuck on a box, crate etc. and killed because of it pisses me off. It would be nice for the movement to be as fluent indoors as it is outdoors. Might as well mention the wolves, the wolf I encountered was like a card board cut out and jittery in movement. Again, unrealistic.
Number 3: The sounds/Audio: This is the biggest one for me. Certain sounds are very clunky and just unrealistic, especially the walking/running. This is not even close to the sound of walking and being highly repetitive it drives me nuts. Sounds like your a zombie dragging your feet. When the sounds are realistic it just makes the game play that much better IMO. Other than that, I am enjoying the game thus far.",1708304189,1708304189,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Installed the game again today. Thought why am I still running around the map with this running simulator? Did alt+F4 and uninstalled the game. Still no cars or bikes. Also played this game because I am bored. How come I am bored when I have 500+ games to choose from. Don't even know what to play, is this what aging is!!! HeLp....



------------------------------------------------

The game is pretty fun but it will get monotonous after a while. We need more scopes and weapon types.

Yes there will be vehicles but we don't know when. So for now you will have to run across the entire map to get to your destination.

The AI is OP when it is either Epic mission or Convoy. But who know it will change in the future.

It's fun as long as you play this with friends, i was having a hard time playing this game solo since it got rather boring just running around alone all the time and dealing with a dificult AI/Bot's. I ended up running back and forth from same spots killing enemies and collecting my corpse a lot on PVE servers.

The map area is rather large for you to explore, the problem i see with this game is that it's a lot of running and scouting out enemies. So far in the game there is boats to make you travel faster but other than that i miss some sort of more fast traveling options.

More Storage  in safe zones is something i miss in this game, i get it that you only have a limitied space to deal with but i would like a option to upgrade my storage in the trader with a couple of slots so i dont need to make a base after a couple of misions just to store my cash and ammo.

It is a fun game, just a bit punishing for playing alone. Make sure to get a base up fast or you will be punished with using the weapons the bot's are dealing with just to conserve ammo!

Gun play, movement, looting, POI's, AI etc. Could be a good competitor with Day-Z if they put more effort into it. Game seems abandoned.

AI: Sometimes don't make noise when moving. They target you through solid barriers. They will prefire corners if you re-peek from the same location quickly. You get targeted from 300+ meters out sometimes and there really is no way of sneaking up on some of the areas. They're either aim bot or storm troopers. They get caught in corners and behind doors sometimes. Wolfs will agro you when you're in ANY location, running straight into military bases to chase you. 

Gun-play: Head bob while ADS'ing is gnarly. If you play on high DPI, you will have to lower it in order to play since in-game sens doesn't go low enough. 

Movement: Feels just like Day-Z but worse. Switching weapons, equipping food, tools etc all cancel auto run. Clunky and slow. Not enough transportation for mobility across the map.

Game-play: Unable to reload while running. You have to continuously hold Left-click to consume food, drink water etc. No option in settings for a press lean, instead of hold. If you aren't using NVIDIA shaders during night time you are automatically at a huge disadvantage. You can get stuck in walls if you close a door on yourself. Building a base as a solo takes ages. Switching weapon attachments between equipped weapons is tedious. Items sometimes don't stack in your inventory when you already have said item. You can loot a very large radius just by pressing TAB (through walls and floors as well)

      -Or you just complete a mission and have collected the loot and if you are there just a little too long the enemies will 
        respawn right on you.
      -They can shoot you with great accuracy even if it is night time and you are behind a bush.

-Vehicles:
      -Only a boat. Enough said.

-Envrionment:
      -You can't drink water from streams or other bodies of water.

I am hoping that future updates will fix the above however until then I cannot bring myself to playing the game further.

EDIT - I came back after a few years and I'm not happy with the state of the game at all. The Shooting as gotten better, the game runs a lot better, and there are more guns. The major problem I have with this game is that it, in the end, too is turning into Dayz in a way. I love the idea of the traders and finding gear but the implementation of crafting and and weapon durability was an instant turnoff. For some people that's fine but it's nice to play a game of this sort that simplified that. Another major thing (I know it will change later or by time anyone sees this review) is the lack of vehicles.

Gave it an honest to god chance again after the updates; nothing new. Some claim cheaters are in with ESP and whatnot, but not sure--all heresay,

Gunplay and sound really is the best thing in this game, but overall not worth it for again, same reason as below. Skip this and enjoy others.

Old Review

I really wish I could give this a thumbs up as it is not a bad game on it's own and I wish the developers well on their success, but unfortunately in today's market, this genre is flooded with EA like games and one's already known (Rust, DayZ).

You get to build a base on one of the 50 player servers, most people have them with lookouts overlooking the entire roads and approaches to the base for easy snipe kills and loots... smart, but these bases are close to mission areas, i can see this being abused. Fine, EA can be tweaked.

Gunplay is fun, really liked the way it handles. But the game itself feels like a mixup of DayZ and Rust. 

Having missions to do and traders location is cool, but the map doesn't feel that massive. 

Personally, I like the more realistic survival fps games; this is one of them, but I prefer SCUM and Escape From Tarkov over this. I don't see any outstanding features that can put this forward in front of what is already existing and kinda feel like this will have the H1Z1 life-cycle. Fun, just nothing unique where it hasn't been done before.",1647291472,1706568511,False,0,0,0.477941185235977173,0,True,False,True

UPDATE: After playing for a while.. my experience is getting worse. First, there are hackers with aimbot and speedhack. second, for somereason my stash inside my locked base is always getting stolen. Maybe they have a hack to go through walls? or some glitch. Anyway, these players will take the fun out of this game. not recommended until they find a way to remove those hackers from the game.

I have experience in Rust and Dayz and I can say this game has been my favorite out of all. The simplicity makes this game a better pick for anyone who don't have time to play 24/7. You cannot get raided unless you die to another online player, and even then there is a chance you won't drop a raid token. Once your raid token is popped, any other players in server have 1 hour to gather c4 and raid your base. It takes 1 c4 for any type of build to destroy. (Loot boxes are not lootable for others not assigned to base, only when raid is active of course.) There are many missions scattered around the map varying from easy to epic. There are also loot drops and convoys that give high tier military loot (weapons, attachments, and even better armor). There are also different places around the map that contain locked crates which can be opened with red keys found at heli crashes, dead NPC's clothing, or mission crates. Inside these locked crates are various types of guns with many different possible camos that can only be obtained by opening these crates. Loot obtained from missions, drops, etc. can be stored at any of the two safe zones located north and south of the map (Large green circles). Once loot storage is full, you can sell unwanted things to trader, or you can obtain a hammer, axe, nails, and wood and start building your base! Doors can be locked with code locks, and crates can be made to store loot. (8 crates max as of this update) There are many guides on the game as i cannot explain everything.

The crafting is simple and almost every item in game can be used.
Weapons have wear to them but can be repaired in your base with parts from other disassembled weapons.
Plenty of missions, starting with easy, medium, hard and then Epic as well as crashed helicopter missions.
The helicopter guys are on steroids or pissed off they just crashed, so beware.
And then there is the convoy. Iron sights from 400 meters, and they hurt.
As the mission difficulty goes up, so does the Tier of loot. Scopes, weapons, armor etc..
Magnification scopes higher than 2X can only be obtained from higher missions, or found in the world, and not sold.
If your weapons and tactics are good the Epics can be soloed, just be warned they will come in herds, so have a high tier weapon with a fast rate of fire or a high capacity shotgun.
There are rubber and swamp boats for traversing the world and can be found all over randomly.
Deer and ducks can be hunted for meat that can be cooked.
Your hunger and thirst will last for quite a while.
I have seen some games that I refunded due to being almost dead 10 minutes after eating, but these guys got it right.

Add prone animation cuz its very useful in a lot of situations

Add cars

Fix laggy servers...you dont need to add ducks instead fix the netcode

Fix raiding mechanics

- Good Performance (Smooth)
- Average A.I

Cons

- Crafting is horrible.
- Outdated graphics
- Item management is a nightmare.
- Lifepoints (HP).
- Sounds lack quality.
- The game map is relatively small.
- No immersion. 


Bottomline

The game is very simple. It has battle royale elements without the stupid parachute thing. Basically, you spawn, run to a city, find itens and start to PvP with other players at once. Go to a trade shop, back to a village and PvP. It's an ARENA game. No elements of survival, only shallow PvP.

That is how actually easy Proton made Linux gaming possible. Just needs devs to update their engines. Refusing to update your engine for a glitch cutting you out from thousands of potential players, because you seem lost in 2014.

UPDATE

20/01/2024

well firstly, i love the game, and  have  a lot of fun  playing it, have met a few new friends around my age (yes i am old 55),and find that   the game is a decompression  for me.Yes there are some things  i  would like added/changed/ revamped but that  comes  after the  update.

I do seriously believe that this game is a great start to a long and great  game to have fun in,and with, i hope that the creators  add more  area/weapons/vehicles ( boats ) and that   you can with a vehicle lock keep the vehicle permanently unless you dismantle it otherwise  its the only one you can have.

Weapons are great, but  would love to see more  types of scopes,and weapons  and also if possible a bergan backpack  ( little bigger then a stalker) otherwise loving it so far ( i hope it gets better.

Now i am fully aware  many  who  don't like the game,for there own reasons, maybe give it time and a chance maybe instead of trying to achieve everything  within the hour, try   to learn the game, as from what i experience i have ""dayZ-Arma3-Americas Army ect ect all rolled in to one....plus including all the missions you get a chance to  go loot hunting or  sneak  through h a location with AI  to find  gear  like  weapons/explosives  ect....god its exhilarating to  sneak past AI  

enjoying my self a lot 

But for me the best thing is  have  made new friends!!

I've personally experienced the aftermath of a similar situation in an MMO game, where the creator's code was stolen, leading to his traumatic experience and personal drama, perceiving all unusual things as hostility. Despite being a devoted fan since childhood, I was unjustly banned by the creator, who targeted me randomly after I spoke the truth on his Discord. While some users began to realize the situation, he banned me without cause, alleging flooding, a claim that was untrue. As a mere sound designer with no knowledge of coding, I found myself caught up in an unjust ban.

Considering this, it raises the question: are the Deadside developers similarly hostile and ignorant?

Recently they added a new city location and also have greatly expanded the map with adding little things in areas that used to be open/ plain and boring.. Only real issues I have is still no  cars that can be driven, should be soon as they got boats now. They have addressed and fixed a lot of the NPC ""Aim Botting Behavior Issues"" Anyways... Game is basically like a stand alone version of those custom ""Tarkov DayZ"" servers, but with the potential of better optimizations, etc.. 

1. Open World Map - (Similar to DayZ)
2. NPC / Patrols - on the map (Similar to Tarkov)
3. Safe Zones - (Similar to the DayZ custom wanna be Tarkov Servers) 
4. Player base building, (Similar to DayZ custom wanna be Tarkov Servers) I never base build in this game as safe areas is plenty in my opinion. 
5. Safe Areas - has traders for buying and selling items, and storage for items you don't want to risk taking out of safe zone. (Similar to DayZ custom wanna be Tarkov Servers)
6. Crafting Menu - tells you what items you need in order to craft said item; so you don't have to find out the recipe on your own.
7. Events/ Missions - randomly happen on the map, with multiple in many areas active throughout the map, with ranking of different difficulty levels that you can see on map so you know how hard the event/mission will be before heading out. (Some of this is Similar to those Custom DayZ Tarkov Servers)
8. Server List - has official and privately/ player owned servers. (Similar to DayZ), also very nice to have this option especially with the amount of cheaters in video games these days...This makes it waaay easier to ban a cheater as you can contact server owner directly(especially once you have decided on a main server to play on), and they can personally help you get your stuff back or w.e to make it right; Instead of just dealing with losing you items, and seeing a ""ban wave"" every few months that does nothing to help you personally after you've being cheated - like Tarkov....

So to gain reviews it is a ""squad focused"" game, to rally up horde reviews for a quick cash grab. there is no intention to develop this game further, not because the Devs are Russian or lack money. Check the player counts! It was a cashgrab and never updated. Dont even bother checking the initial 2020 version compared to 2024 version of the game, if you want to see anything work related.

In the end its a walking simulator with: 0 penalties for dying, 3-4 goals to achieve if you count side quests with just bot armies, and 0 moderation. 


Unknown ""Russian dev"" team bad pixel releases Deadside. In 2020. Hmmmmm.
Is there proof they are Russian? Not in the slightest.

1 year later 17 million were offered to buy this piece of crap title, and since then no updates were made. 

TinyBuilld, the Ukrainian company bought a Russian game in 2021 and would not in any way include something non Russian, they would still hire Russians despite cooperation beeing outlawed in Ukraine? Politics aside, this the dumbest case of money laundering. Abysmal Team. One day you will be prosecuted and jail times for laundering money is not very well treated in prison.

Anyways, they made a cool 20 hour fun game to explore a little and have some pvp and the player count shows you the average playtime.

Its tough, cos the AI is no joke but any comments re it being too hard isn't strictly accurate (im no pro btw). Its not Dayz though, the AI have gear and guns and decent pathing so you cant just run about opening and closing doors lol, you defo need to use cover, retreat as reengage often.

As a general rule of thumb you cant steam into tier 3 and elite bases unless you're moderately geared or with a squad (or just an FPS god - Im not lol).  Its less the difficultly of said AI bots though, more the sheer number so if solo'ing or under geared you just get overwhelmed. 

Solo'ing and PvE provides tiered bases to raid, convoys to capture, helidrops and cargo drops to capture as well as random encounters/street patrols to either swerve or engage.

PvP has all the above plus the PvP element obvs 

Unlike Dayz though, gear acquisition is far quicker and dying, whilst annoying isnt hair pullingly, keyboard launchingly annoying, just respawn at nearest town and you can usually just run in grab it and retreat in order to re group/plan

Base building is fine, you cant get raided unless you activate a raid token (from what I've seen?) however an 8 container cap soon gets full if you have a squad of more than a couple. 

Talking of squads, you can invite members to your base, squad up and access everything as expected but any tactical markers you place as a squad can only be viewed by you still which is a bit annoying imo

Finally, i usually host my own servers, have done for rust/ark/dayz/valheim/7d2d etc etc but this time decided to use Gportal and frankly its both well priced (imo) and super slick. £18 for a month, instantly online, backup and save storage for days.

Loot scaling is good, progression is easy and the further you go up the harder good loot becomes to get, so skill is involved. The loot storage systems are fine. The base building is a little grindy but very worth it in the long run. Water and food are a bit annoying but do their job and add pressure into the game, much better than rust. Only negative things i could say is the base building is very precise, and that A.I stop scaling after medium/hard missions, even though they go up to elite with others like event challenges.

Mixing elements of survival, shooting and exploration makes this game exciting and fun for fans of post-apocalyptic settings.

One of Deadside's strengths is its expansive open map, offering a variety of biomes, from forests and fields to urban ruins. Players can freely move around this world, completing quests, exploring areas and fighting other players or AI opponents.

The main focus of the game is survival. Players need to look for resources, weapons, ammunition and other equipment to increase their chances of survival. The crafting and leveling system allows players to create items and improve skills, which adds depth to the gameplay.

One of the main elements of Deadside's appeal is its PvP combat. Battles with other players are intense and dynamic, requiring tactics and skill. At the same time, the game offers a safety mode so that newcomers can get comfortable and explore the world without constant threat.

Despite some technical problems at the beginning, the developers are actively working on improvements and updates, which gives hope for a further improvement in the gaming experience.

Deadside offers an immersive post-apocalyptic world where survival, combat and exploration intertwine to create an exciting and fast-paced gameplay experience for fans of the genre.",1704771956,1704771956,True,0,0,0.499394685029983521,0,True,False,True

If you've played DayZ, the first thing you'll note is that this is basically DayZ - except:
- no kidnapping, torture and murder of other players. (PVP is ok. Binding someone, taking all their stuff and then shooting them in the head feels a little too far.... none of that in Deadside)
- no zombies. I was a little surprised by this.
- no cars - they did add boats in the last patch, but you don't ""own"" a boat. It will de-spawn and go back to one of the random starting spots. 

- You can pick your spawn area -  there is a 10 min timer on this, so if you're in a hot battle and die within 10 minutes, you'll have to pick another spot.
- your dead body is marked so you can find it.
- you can mark the map so you can know where you're heading without constantly opening the map
- base building is simpler but still time consuming. Trees never despawn so you could build your entire base with one tree. 
- the trader helps and the storage there is a nice perk.
- everyone will have automatic weapons after a few hours/days on the server
- there are non PVP servers so people actually work together to take down more difficult targets.
- food /water use is a bit more realistic in being used up by activity.

The BAD:
No cars means that you're walking. 

EVERYWHERE.   The addition of boats to the game has largely alleviated this.  Also, when you die, you can typically spawn at a village nearby.

You have no stamina bar and it doesn't seem to drain food/water much faster (if at all) but walking everywhere compounds with the spawning mechanic for missions.

 The chopping mechanic is awful. Whoever did the animation has never chopped wood, never held an axe and there is a VERY narrow spot in which you will actually hit the tree.  They need to expand the area that lands a valid strike and make it so you're not standing practically IN the tree to hit it.

The UGLY:

The AI bots are deadly accurate and  they can see you through foliage that should be blocking their view. It doesn't matter if they're not using a scope. They'll cut you down in a single shot from 150 meters. 

You CAN sneak, but you have no good quiet kill methods. The bots hear your gun shots (of course) and will swarm you - maybe like a trained military would? But there is no morale factor. If you mow them down, they do not run nor hesitate. They know where you are, even if you've moved after you sniped that shot and will turn the corner and pop you with their deadly bot aim.



The AI can definitely see at night so there doesn't seem to be very good night/sneak mechanics. There is No use in going out at night vs aimbots who are unaffected by the dark.  Build your base instead. Go duck hunting.

Melee combat mechanics are terrible. Weapons that should have reach (swinging an axe) have ZERO range. 

Gun terrain interference - They have a somewhat unique mechanic where if you get too close to a wall, you will bring your gun up ...because... hey, guns can't go through walls....so. Its ""realistic""  The problem is that it is far too sensitive. You want to snipe through a window? Forget resting against a wall or window well to steady your aim. Well, if you're anywhere near the edges (bottom or sides) you are going to hug your gun to your chest. To make the shot, you'd better climb into the window. STUPID.

Prone - there IS NO PRONE. They've been talking about it since 2020. You have a ghillie suit and no prone? They probably can't make it work because the terrain gun interference mechanic probably makes you hug the gun to your belly when you go prone... *sigh*

THE WORST:
Missions and Spawn mechanics.

Not sure who decided this, but you can be in a base doing a mission and have killed all the enemies and ""blip"" mission randomly despawns. Bad guys and rewards, gone.  Or worse. You've pretty much killed them all and *BOOM* a whole new squad just appears right on top of you. What?!

I decided to take on a convoy.  Killed them all and as I'm running to pick up the case? DESPAWN. 

I'm checking the map for nearby missions. Closest mission is 2KM out. Welp... Head out!   Almost there...? BLIP.  Mission despawns.

Server reset teleportation.  Twice since the last patch, I've been teleported accross the map to a random spot when the server reset.

Playing together? Great. You'll be throwing your stuff on the floor to share it and won't have the ability to let your friend access your secure storage.  If you have a lock on your door, your small boxes can be shared....but you can make 3. That's it. 

So forget building a base together. Yeah, one of you could play lumberjack and supply the wood.

The game can be played either on PVP - Player V Player or PVE - Player V Environment Servers. I personally like to play PVE and ""Deadside"" provides enough variety to make this play style enjoyable. 

AI Missions - There are a variety of missions which often are easier played with friends or teaming up with somone on the server and sharing the loot. The missions are either in set areas ranging in difficulty from fairly easy to damn hard with better Loot on each level of difficulty or Money Convoys which have extreme AI but the best Loot. 

BASE BUILDING - The base building is well implemented with a variety of preformed foundation frames that you build on. The difference on this to most other survival games is you need to put a frame in place to support your next level of walls floors ceiling etc. You can add teams to the flagpole to enable them to build and access the building.  
  Top tip make a water collector as soon as you can Wells are on the map but are often dry. Thirst and hunger kill and disable you.

MAP - This has been updated and has a zoom option as well as ""Shift  L Mouse Click"" add/remove  Waypoint markers. You can add multiple markers and they are different coloured so you can have your base the safe zone and your mission co-ords all at the same time but easily recognised. 

Longevity of Gameplay - I find it fairly easy to gear up and start again on another server but once I have completed a base done a load of missions explored some new areas of the expanding map I do get bored. But that is after a good few hours and the challenge is available on many servers add PVP and it's a lot harder. 

Conclusion - Is it worth buying If you like Survival PVP PVE and a decent challenge it will easily provide well over 20 hours of entertainment. I have 82hrs and still want to explore the NEW City. The Dev's keep adding more so yes I recommend ""Deadside"" compared to DAY'z The AI are smarter and harder than the Z's.  The missions are comparable to Arma2 Day'z Missions providing loot and challenge. The Crafting is Similar to Rust / ARK but different in it's own way. 

Have Fun and use trees for cover!

It is focused on plpe who do not have so much time for DayZ. It has similar open space feeling and loot is lot easier to find, so we get more PvPvE fights.
Game look so good in 1st person view and it is meant to be played that way. For some reason, 3th person view looks artificial.
Graphic and weapon handling is 10/10 and game goes more towards fights then survival elements.
With vehicles, some quests, more staff on map and some reason to enter fights and risk loot this game is going to be top tier.

- AI AIMBOT. Even the easy AI can spot you from hundreds of meters away and start plinking you. Including the EASY mission AI. Not only that, if you are just freshly spawned and only have a pistol or a knife, may as well find the nearest body of water to die in. Save yourself the trouble.

The AI's aim needs a re-work, because their aim is crazy good depending on the difficulty of the event/mission.

Cons: NPC enemy aimbot ridiculousness. NPCs consistently spot & hit you using a pistol / SMG with no sights from 200+ meters away while you are in cover. This creates frustrating, poor gameplay. Very poor loot distribution on NPC enemies and in stationary buildings. Very simple and absent crafting & base building system. Limited weapons, poor weapon balancing with some being next to useless.

However, there's a few things that sort of sucks about this game, and it's been a part of it since day one. Sure there are plenty of missions and things to explore on the map, but it doesn't take many hours to reach the ""endgame"". Do a few easy mission, gather loot and better gear, and move up to the harder missions. Do this correctly and quickly, you can reach top tier loot within a few hours to be honest. After that, it feels a little empty and repetitive.

I have not since it came out built a base. I remember it being a really grindy and tiresome process that takes forever. How it works today, I can't know. All I know is that you don't really need a base, as the best loot can be saved in safe zones. Bases and chests have a timer until they disappear unless you login every 7 days I think.

The map is huge and awesome, with many great points of interest. However, this comes to a disadvantage as there are limited transportation vehicles in the game, and you spend probably 40% of your time running from A to B. There are boats in the game, but you cannot lock them for more than 30 minutes, and after that they simply despawn. There are no land vehicles as of this review.

Base building is a plus although it needs some tweaks to it. Other than that this game lacks content and im not talking about the ammount of cities or bunkers or missions etc it lacks loot items cars gear all around the ammount of food choices are slim and same with the guns 95% of your time in game you will be using the same shitty weapons you get from the same npc missions its nearly impossible for a solo to come buy the higher tier guns and even if you do you prone to loosing them to a sweaty 5 man group who plays nothing but this game.

Devs do not listen to the community.

Mods ban you for sharing concerns in community.

No vehicles so far which was perhaps the most requested feature since day 1.

The updates you get are mere unlocking of a small portion of the map and some bug fixes.

Instead of listening to community, devs will add a feature that messes up the game experience even more.

In a nutsell, this turned out to be a cheap clone. It is a Boring Repetitive Walking Simulator in the hands of horrible devs & arrogant mods.

Just started with a friend a couple days ago, and it's been an absolute blast. It has that open world survival feel, but everywhere you go there is action, whether it be AI or players. Having the stash in the safe zone and not have to worry about your base getting offline raided is a huge plus for me. I don't have the free time that I used to back in the Rust days.

So far it appears that there are different levels of AI. The better the weapon they have, the better the aim. However, I have multiple times been able to rush an AI and kill him with my knife and take his weapon (just dont rush a shotgun lol.) If you get in a decent spot it actually feels like their aim is quite terrible. Couldn't tell ya if the negative reviewers just suck or maybe they're on a private server with cranked AI lol.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. We spent 4 hours on the game that night and we had killed the first 3 bosses. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Drawing inspiration from titles like DayZ, Deadside delivers a familiar yet distinctive Zombie Survival experience, complete with loot, weapons, and engaging NPC encounters.

One of the game's standout features is its modest server capacity, capping at around 50 players. This limitation fosters a more intimate and focused environment, making player versus player (PVP) battles both enjoyable and engaging. While the missions lack the grandeur of a full-fledged campaign, they offer a fun co-op experience, especially when playing with newfound companions.

Connectivity-wise, my personal experience was smooth, thanks to a robust internet connection. However, it's worth mentioning that some players, particularly those with less reliable internet, reported issues like rubber banding. If you're in the latter category, it might be wise to approach Deadside cautiously, as connectivity issues could detract from the overall experience.

The arsenal in Deadside, while not overly intricate, provides the essentials for survival. From basic firearms like the AK to other distinct tools, the game delivers a satisfactory array of weaponry. Admittedly, the ADS (aiming down sights) mechanics feel a bit clunky, but this minor hiccup doesn't overshadow the overall enjoyment, especially for fans of the survival genre.

In essence, Deadside is a game that finds its strength in simplicity and the camaraderie of small-scale multiplayer interactions. If you've enjoyed titles like Rust, DayZ, or Scum, you'll likely find Deadside to be a welcoming addition to your collection. While it may not boast the complexity of larger productions, the game's charm lies in its modest scope, offering an entertaining space for zombie survival enthusiasts to explore and conquer together.",1701843850,1701843850,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Now the main selling point to me with this game is it very similar to ""DayZ"" but without so much of the boring survival stuff.
This game offers a similar experience to ""DayZ"" but lets you get guns and gear fairly quickly with the added benefit of AI bots roaming around to keep things interesting along with being a source for loot. This game also had no zombies which is a plus for me as in my opinion ""DayZ"" zombies are terrible and something like ""Scum"" offers a better all round survival experience when compared to ""DayZ"".

Now in terms of improvements I think the missions really need improving with more variety. Basically the missions as they stand is go into an area and kill all the bots to get a reward. While I think this is a good starting point it gets boring fast in my opinion. The convoys were a cool idea but I find nobody bothers to try and steal the loot therefore it doesn't work too great in practice. Perhaps adding objectives to some of the missions making them harder would work better if done properly. Also i'm not a fan of the re-spawn system. Basically when you die you can choose which town you want to spawn in which means when you kill a player they just spawn 100m or so away and instantly come back. I would much prefer random IMO.

Okay some others things I would like to see to make this the perfect game is more points of interest in the current map ( Not expanding as the map has plenty of free space at the moment ). Making cities and towns more useful such as adding a police station and hospital as a place for basic guns, armour and an easy way to get medical supplies which is very difficult ATM. Also perhaps having an NPC which gives some basic quests for money or items would be cool. An example of a quest could be go to ""Stepnoe"" find a golden watch and bring it back here. This would also promote going to towns and cities along with increasing PVP in these areas. Some sort of weather system would also be greatly practised adding much variety and sounds to the environment making it feel more real and immersive.

Anyway thanks for reading this lengthy recommendation / review for this game.

     FINALLY a FUN open world/ base building/ looter shooter without the BS! 
Boats are nice but they still limit you very much and force you to run a LOT and spend so much time doing so your boat despawns (or someone steals it) and your stuck running anyway..
      I look forward to overall polishing/ additions & ablility to share/ build bases in squads <3   Would like to see there being a way to drink from rivers/ lakes if you purify the water with filters/ purification tabs/ or simply boiling it on a fire.  The wells and water collectors are nice but for early game runs without those things running thousands of KMs for a couple dry wells feels bad (or not finding a bottle to be able to drink), especially when there is all these beautiful freshwater sources around that your running by.  Also having some wild fruits/ veggies growing around and a crop system for base gardening implemented will be amazing! (instead of only options being killing animals or finding processed foods) 
       Tons of potential here i hope to see improvements like this in the future but so far so good!

It's also very buggy - disappearing loot, weapons not firing, floating assets etc. Events can spawn instantaneously on top of your character, insta-kill you and prevent you from reaching the loot it took hours to grind before it despawns.

In order to give it a fair chance, some friends and I rented a private server to see if it would help with some of these issues. The server setting options are few and not helpful and we still experienced lags and crashes.

All this aside and the fact this an early access game means most of this could be forgiven or even expected.  But after reading through the game's FAQ, I'm unimpressed with the developers. Not only is there no female character models in the entire game, the developers are quite flippant toward adding any. From the FAQ: “A: The gameplay itself implies having a lot of different clothing and equipment for characters. If we add the new type of character the amount of these items will increase accordingly and we will need to create them too. Such usage of the human resources will be counter productive for current stage of the game development.”",1701121998,1701121998,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

However, the devs for whatever reason are more focused on adding little things that doesn't matter at this point in time such as wolves, roe deer, and changing how the weapons look rather than making and adding changes where they are needed. 

The dev team is very small but come on, there's early access games out there with only one guy, and those are going in a better direction than deadside. I will say this, is deadside fun and enjoyable? Yes, it is. I wouldn't have put over 600+ hours into it or make content on it if I didn't enjoy the game for what it is. But that's what you have to keep in mind. For what it is.

A lot of people would say Deadside is a dead game. When in reality its not. A ""dead game"" has less than a 1,000 players playing and doesn't get any new content or updates. Although the player base is normally under 1,000 at the moment, it does get new content and updates often. Deadside isn't popular by any means but it isn't dead. You can still find public and private servers that have good pop to play on.

Lastly, would I recommend Deadside? Yes and No. Yes because everyone can have an enjoyable time in game. And No because once you get to ""end game"" in deadside there's really nothing left to do but PVP. Though PVP is fun, it can get really boring if that's all that left to do. Especially when you have people playing on a server who are new going up against people who have hundreds and thousands of hours in game. At that point you've just got to roll with the punches.

895400,151700694,76561198119654657,0,107,1536,0,129,1701562361,"After slightly more than 5 hours into the game i feel like i have done just about everything this game has to offer, i built a base i ran around to do missions and loot up some gear, i also got a few air drops and did some PVP. No i have not got a boat but i don't know what the point is to have one other than to just duck hunt or fish. I have also been to both trader towns to do some trading. I have not been around the whole map yet but i am not thinking there will be anything new to offer in a different location than what i have already done. My biggest issue with this game is that it is labeled as a survival game yet the only survival mechanics in the game from what i noticed is a hunger/thirst system, there is no other survival mechanics/systems to the game at all, no weather system in the game so there is no hot or cold system there is also no stamina system either so you can just sprint forever with out needing to rest. There is rivers/lakes in the game but you are only allowed to fill up water containers at wells that you find around the map if they have water in them. There are things that you can interact with in the environment but it is very limited, like if you go in a house to look for loot you can not look through cabinets or in a dresser or even a fridge like you can in scum, so if you find loot in a house or any building it will be on the floor or on a table or something, there is only 1 type of static crate that you can loot from that i noticed. For a game that is labeled as a survival game it sure is lacking majorly in that category. The gun play in this game is not the best as it can feel a bit off and take getting use to. Speaking of guns it seems pretty lacking in verity, you got smgs rifles shotguns and snipers along with handguns, i did not notice any other gun types.There is wild life in this game but it is very limited, there is only deer wolfs ducks and fish, but the wolfs give no meat only fur. I am well aware this is a early access game but i mean come on this game has been out since 2020 and this is all the game has so far, i don't know i feel like it should have a lot more to offer than what it currently does. I guess if you can get the game on sale and you have a friend to play it with then sure it may keep you invested for a little while since there is PVP but honestly i think that is all this game has going for it, if there was no PVP i really truly think this game would be completely dead.



UPDATE: I recently explored more of the map and found and drove 2 types of boats, The boats are really not that great and mostly used for fishing. There are larger towns on the map that you can go to and look around for loot but it does not seem to differ from loot that i can find in a house, meaning i do not think there is better loot to be found in specific locations i am pretty sure you can find any kind of loot anywhere on the map as it feels like it is just RNG based loot spawns. Community wise for the game can of course be toxic but if you get on a good server that has active admins that actually enforce the rules it helps with the toxic behavior. I found it very odd that there is still not land based vehicles in this game yet there are boats, You also can not lay prone either all you can do is stand or crouch. Again as i have stated this is a VERY shallow game when it comes to things that can be done. Before i sum up here i want to talk about the AI's behavior, There are missions that you can do in the game that range in difficulty, the easy to mid range difficulty missions are not to hard to do because the AI that are at them missions are pretty stupid and easy to kill, BUT the harder missions the AI are actually on crack or something because they will just instantly 1 shot you in the head from a crazy far range like 100+meters away. This feel extremely unbalanced and near impossible do go up against, it makes me feel like i am going up against cheaters. The worst thing about this is that you have to do missions to get the better gear and obviously the harder missions are going to have higher tear gear, yes i guess you could get the better gear by killing a player that maybe has some but it would be nice if i could get it another way without having to worry about getting absolutely destroyed by cracked out AI, before you go and think to yourself skill issue, go try it out yourself then and see how you do.

Now the main selling point to me with this game is it very similar to ""DayZ"" but without so much of the boring survival stuff. 
This game offers a similar experience to ""DayZ"" but lets you get guns and gear fairly quickly with the added benefit of AI bots roaming around to keep things interesting along with being a source for loot. This game also had no zombies which is a plus for me as in my opinion ""DayZ"" zombies are terrible and something like ""Scum"" offers a better all round survival experience when compared to ""DayZ"".

Now in terms of improvements I think the missions really need improving with more variety. Basically the missions as they stand is go into an area and kill all the bots to get a reward. While I think this is a good starting point it gets boring fast in my opinion. The convoys were a cool idea but I find nobody bothers to try and steal the loot therefore it doesn't work too great in practice. Perhaps adding objectives to some of the missions making them harder would work better if done properly. Also im not a fan of the respawn system. Basically when you die you can choose which town you want to spawn in which means when you kill a player they just spawn 100m or so away and instantly come back. I would much prefer random imo. 

Okay some others things I would like to see to make this the perfect game is more points of interest in the current map ( Not expanding as the map has plenty of free space at the moment ). Making cities and towns more useful such as adding a police station and hospital as a place for basic guns, armour and an easy way to get medical supplies which is very difficult atm. Also perhaps having an NPC which gives some basic quests for money or items would be cool. An example of a quest could be goto ""Stepnoe"" find a golden watch and bring it back here. This would also promote going to towns and cities along with increasing PVP in these areas. Some sort of weather system would also be greatly practised adding much variety and sounds to the environment making it feel more real and immersive.

This game feels like a combination of Rust, DayZ & Tarkov but with alot of Stalker elements! A hardcore survival that truly lives up to its description! 
The World & atmosphere is absolutely beautiful, It is currently in Early Access but already feels like a polished game! Each region & little town you go to certainly feels different from the last & each time town feels like they have their own little story of what happened there, from major apartment complexes to tiny little farms & factories. The landscape is truly wonderful & planned out very carefully! The map is also very huge! i have yet to explore so much of it but i am in love with the current towns i have already visited. Vehicles are yet to be added but when they do it will truly change the game for the better!
The AI in the game are very fun to hunt down, some will walk in pairs, some in bigger groups. Some will camp out in houses, rooftops & sheds & others will just straight up hunt you! They range from being very dumb to CSS bot instakill tier, which personally i hope receive some tweaks in the near future. The missions in the game are very fun & are always a new challenge. There are PvE & PVP servers available which throws a whole new challenge into the mix!
The Base building at the moment is very clean & i like it alot! Although you do have to sacrifice one of your main weapons to wield the axe as there is no storage option for rifles, the devs are currently working on multi space storage slots. It can feel abit grindy during building your base but definitely mix it up with missions & random looting so you don't burn yourself out, trust me. 
The food system is very nice! tinned food & goodies are scattered throughout the world & the metres do not deplete at an extremely annoying rate such as other games, so eating & drinking can become stressful but its actually kind of rare, i like it! although there is no cheeki breeki vodka drinking just yet!
The combat system is very smooth! Guns look amazing, the recoil & control of weapons is very slick & the felling of getting a kill or headshot is so satisfying! the ragdolls are pretty nice too! Theres too many guns to name & they can all be modified with Scopes, Silencers, Mags & Flashlights! 
This game is already so good with what has been done & can only get better from here on! The devs recently got a major funding boost so there's no doubt we will see more content added soon! If you're a fan of any of the games mentioned above there's no doubt you will enjoy this game! Highly Recommend!

..But of course not everything is great, here are a list of Cons I personally have come across or not a fan of that others might agree with, but don't let this be the decider of your purchase!
- The AI in Epic Missions & Helicrashes are far too OP on their aiming & Damage, always a 1 hit instakill before you even see them or when they pop around a corner, Not all the bots are like this, but there's sometimes just that one that is sick of humans
- In Base Building, the land claim can become frustrating to place as the requirements are too high valued, you cannot build near buildings, other player bases, roads, train tracks etc. so you can be out in the middle of nowhere & go to place your claim but i tiny little shack could be nearby blocking you from that with nothing else around for miles. kinda annoying.
- Trees don't disappear when collecting wood, you can build your whole base & more from one tree. If a Runescape sort of regen timer was implemented that would be kinda cool & add to the realism
- The inventory slots & what you can & cant hold at times is annoying but this will be fixed/updated
- The Safe Zones & traders feel very empty, i feel like they should split the roles up to make it more populated, such as a medic to sell the medical items, A vendor for strictly food, a Tradesman for all base building & split the gun dealer with a clothier for all clothes, instead of just having the two for everything.
- Although i do not mind walking in games, There is going to be ALOT of walking & running in this game until vehicles are added. 
- At this stage there is a little bit of lack of content, but this is purely because its early access. There are missions consisting of Easy, Medium, Hard & Epic Tier, Convoy missions where you have to take out the boss & his guards to retrieve a briefcase, Helicopter Crashes & airdrops of random High Tier loot, which are heavily sought after on PvP server. I haven't gotten bored yet with all these missions but some people have & might.
- Lack of Online players! So come join us! On the Official Australia server i play the most people I've seen on is around 11-13 people, on average around 3-6. Alot of people complain of this but there's only one way to change that! The Bots are always on & shooting when everyone leaves!

So yeah they're all the cons I've come across, & with a bit of time they can all be easily fixed!
Again, I highly recommend Deadside to anyone!

AI is still fundamentally broken. Devs say they added ""stealth mechanics"" but once one AI spots you, ALL OF THEM come running straight to where you are. Same thing if you fire a weapon. 
AI still shoot through foliage, and will spot you through foliage. For them to say stealth mechanics have been implemented is a blatant lie, all they did was tone down the AI aimbot a little. 
Which doesn't help when they double or triple the number of AI at missions, convoys, heli crashes, etc. 
Game is still in a nearly unplayable state due to the sheer difficulty of getting started on a multiplayer server.
Not only do you have to put up with dozens of aimbot AI with infinite ammo, you also have to deal with fully geared players camping every mission or convoy.

Sadly i cannot recommend this game still.  Little to no progress given the length of time in development and no effort to turn things around at a reasonable pace to draw in a bigger and better player base.

-The map is fairly small and empty although the game is a walking/running simulator with only very small towns/locations of interest.
-Little added in variation with weapons and these dont even seem fun.
-The missions are boring and always take place in the same industrial places.  Just 2 primary military locations to loot.  *more locations added but still the same rinse and repeat copy and paste mess*
-Gun play is a little ropey at times and scope drift/shake without the ability to hold breath using sniper rifles is frustrating.  *gunplay still remains bad*
-With the exception of killing AI and players there is little to do, even looting/running to the trader to sell/buy gets repetitive.  Missions are just uninteresting.
-The addition of boats as a form of travel was pointless, you still find yourself running for miles.  
-Base building is extremely basic and there is currently no way to raid/breach bases.  *Still basic even after several major updates*
-Server performance seems atrocious when playing on servers with over 35 players.  *Still the same poor performance*
-Locked to a single server host G-Portal and they aren't the best for server hosting.  *still remains the same and i suspect their servers are of poor performance quality of severely over allocated*

As usual with games like this cheating and toxicity is rampant.  *Toxic chat in game seems much worst, the worst part of this was for me that some of these individuals seem like mature gamers given their time on steam vs playtime*

Before I said the future potential was possibly there, given the lack of progress and development this will remain dying a slow death and I dont see the developer making improvements anytime soon.  The game still makes for a frustrating and boring mess and I dont have confidence in things changing.",1604440181,1700603613,False,113,11,0.701089024543762207,0,True,True,True

Economy is broken, weapons and armour are about 1/5th of the old price where as ammo, medicine and food is more than 10x the old amount in some cases. I feel like they shifted from mostly combat focused to survival focused. 

Used to be able to keep hydration up by drinking soda which replenished ~50/100 iirc, soda is the only hydration the traders sell and not only has it gone up in price but now it only replenishes 20. Apart from the coca cola you can use the flask that you spawn with but the issue is you can't fill it up at rivers and of the 6 wells I went to only 1 was able to fill the flask up to just 60%. The only reliable source of water is a water collector which you can only make inside a base (I cbf going over how atrocious the base building is). 

The AI still shoot at you though bushes and will stay aggro for over 250m through walls and whatnot. They can still hit you accurately from hundreds of metres while constantly side strafing which would be fine if you could do the same but good luck with how fucked the sway is. Shoot one and every other bot will spin on your ass and light you up with scorps or Ak74s. If you think Tarkov AI is bullshit then this game will enrage every brain cell in your head. 

The spawning system is more forgiving and being able to fast travel between the two safe zones (for only 3 dogtags) is really convenient. However the addition of wolves has ruined this experience because they don't make any noise until they are already within 20m sprinting at you. Pretty much always get attacked by at least 1 when running back to my old corpse which guarantees you'll be at 3/4 health or lower everytime before you stab em with the spawn knife. Unlike actual wolves they hunt alone and are not scared of gunfire in anyway (I think they actively run towards it). They never attack the AI scavs or soldiers and will still run up on you while there are bullets whizzing around left, right and centre - fuckin nuisances.

Gunplay has improved but is by no means flawless and the amount of times you will cancel the reload by sprinting too early is infuriating. Your character can put in a new mag and cock the gun and it will still make you restart if you do anything in the ~half a second between your bolt going forward and the animation actually completing. Sway is horrid and hold breath bugs out by sometimes removing your ability to move the reticle - you will miss shots due to this so get used to the sway. 

Servers are by no means dead, just injured. Americans and Europeans will be fine but I played for 8 hours straight and didn't see a single Australian or Asian server with more then 5 people. All up I'd say if your coming for the PVPVE just play tarkov, if your coming for the hunting and survival play Call of the Wild, and if you want a bit of both with some less scuffed base building then hop on DayZ because at least the Zombos can't spinbot you.",1700134749,1700134749,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Sadly, my thoughts remain the same: This game has potential, quite some, in my opinion, and does some things VERY well. 
BUT. All the good things are overshadowed by a single thing, that has ruined multiple times the experience for me and my friends. 
It's not the animations, it's not the mouse weird acceleration thing going on that makes your aim go funky, it's not the graphics, it's not the boredom after just a few days and the repetitiveness of the gameplay... it's the AI. 
THE. F*****G, AI. 
Let me explain: I stopped playing because we would get headshotted by a single enemy controller by the AI running in a field with an SMG and insta-killed. From 200+ meters. With TOP ARMOR. Multiple times.  So you have to respawn in the closest city, run back to your body to get your things back, only to find the bots evaporate you again, and again, and again. And each time you have to spawn further away, because spawns have a cooldown time. Fun, eh?
So we stopped playing out of frustration. 
Then we came back last week because they had ""Rebalanced the AI"", only to find they kinda did... but there's still a huge underlying issue with the way the devs program difficulty for the harder missions.

Their words:"" [i]Getting an instant 180 headshot by an AI using a Mosin is not the experience we are aiming to deliver, and we hope these changes will eliminate that problem""[/i]
I mean, yeah i have multiple videos of me getting evaporated by AIs doing a 180 turn and shooting me with spiderman's reaction time which was kinda bullcrap.
Now? Well, now if you dare to pop your head out of cover you get shot and killed... in 2 shots. I mean, i agree the AI actually turns slower and reacts slower, but we're talking American Sniper's level of accuracy no matter the weapon they use and how far you are. I have videos of AI following me repositioning myself while running hidden from them: use 3rd person, run along a hill, a crest or a shore hidden from view and see how the AI's powerful x-ray eyes follow you wherever you go. 
Oh, and if you dress yourself with a ghillie, set up a .cal50 on a hill and shoot enemies from 500m+, don't expect to live for more than a few seconds. They will kill you with their shoelaces.

This is not ""The Dark Souls of Survival FPSs"", this is lazy coding.

As someone who's not played a game of the genre before, it took me a while to warm to it, with some early frustrations as I kept dying and restarting with nothing. However, after a few hours learning the ropes I managed to get some decent weapons and build some momentum - winning a few firefights and completing a mission. Once you have a basic grasp of the game mechanics and stash some items the experience becomes rewarding and you feel very tangible progress.

Update - 9 July 23:

I've now clocked in 30 hours, so though it would be timely to give an update. I'm getting more and more engaged with the game every time I play it, and it keeps drawing me back week after week. The missions are challenging and varied due to the changing locations, and even outside them you regularly have engagements with wandering patrols and hostiles manning checkpoints and industrial sites.

I've started to work out some of the survival aspects of the game like collecting water and cooking food, and have reached the point where I'm thinking about setting up a base, since my storage in both safe zones is full.

The boats that were fairly recently added to the game are great and I've enjoyed using them to get about when I've found them. Parking the boat just off the shoreline and picking off enemies from afar is a great way to clear perimeter guards before moving in and completing a mission.

I convinced a friend to buy the game and playing in a squad has really amplified the experience. Doing coordinated attacks is great fun and has allowed us to tackle more challenging missions than we could have managed solo. I'm sure you can find other players on the game's discord server if don't have anyone you can rope in.

I have been playing on an official PVP server, which has meant I've had a few run-ins with other players, usually around medium difficulty or higher missions. It's been a mixed bag, but generally wise to treat anyone you encounter as hostile. There was one occasion where I completed a medium mission but then got taken out by someone with a sniper rifle which was somewhat frustrating. But I've also had a couple of times where I've arrived at a mission in progress or just completed and managed to come away with the prize, so swings and roundabouts. As a general rule, if you want to avoid engagements with other players, stick to missions further away from the safe-zones, or if you really don't want them at all, you can play on a PVE only server. The game is certainly challenging and engaging enough without fighting other players.

There is a roadmap of new updates coming, including the addition of a city for some urban warfare, new missions, more animals to increase the hunting component of the game, and at some point, wheeled vehicles. There will also be a tutorial added soon, which I can tell you will make the game a whole lot more approachable, as even after 30 hours I'm still working some of the game dynamics out. At the moment you need to watch some other people play on YouTube or Twitch.

Anyway, highly recommend the game and there's lots to look forward to in the future.

• Deal with official servers that are lawless in every sense of the meaning but are subject to frequent server crashes lasting upwards of a week - while you have 7 days to log in until everything you build is wiped. (This is what killed 303).

Or 

• Play on private servers what you are subject to changing rules, admin abuse, weekly/monthly wipes, everyone runs just M99 or M4, and you can be banned at any point in time because you killed an admin before he could remove the stick from his rear. 

This game uses GPortal servers, that should be all you need to know. Dev's won't rollback 303 to restore bases that over half the server lost JUST after an update was released. I don't think they realize there's a fair chunk of players that only play on weekends (ya know, work, adult stuff), and because 303 and multiple other servers were down, and an update was released at the same time, people couldn't reset their aggressive 7-day timer and didn't get to try the new content. They loaded into a bare ground and not the base they worked on for weeks that was wiped without warning.

It lacks a lot of good survival mechanics from other games of its caliber even though the game is almost 3 years old and still is in (Early Access) which is a shame. the gameplay needs improvements the overall feel of the game feels weird from the shooting to the movement of the character I can't describe it with words. The performance is not well optimized having almost the same FPS from high settings to low settings and yes high settings punch my graphics card a bit but having medium to low settings and having the same FPS as high settings is a dead giveaway of a poorly optimized game. Also, the visibility of the game is ok you can't see the player models clearly from far distances it needs improvements even in this section as well. Overall the graphics are good the audio of the gun and environment are also strong new additions like the wolf are adding more in to the game but it needs more fixes. like the shooting to be more accurate while moving and reducing the weapon sway also a hotfix is needed for the enemy AI as well as the optimization and performance of the game.",1698757361,1698757361,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Negatives:
Everyone is right about the running around ruining the game, it's terrible, but at the same time if they put in land vehicles everyone would just use them to run people over. They need to expand the train travel functionality and this game would be a 7/10 instead of a 5/10. At the very least add Add more fast travel by train locations around the map. Some real time train travel where maybe some enemies shoot at you along the way or make a mission where you hold up a train carrying some loot. Finding a place to build your base is a ludicrous process, and building it isn't much more satisfying. the jump mechanics HAVE to be improved because its currently useless and very annoying not being able to jump over a small ledge,rock, or fence. One of the worst things by far is the hunger and thirst aspect because the only way to really get anything most of the time is to buy it and its very expensive so you end up dying of hunger/thirst all the time and loose your stuff or at least have to run all the way back to it.

Positives:
Very fun combat. Bullets matter, gun selection and equipment is interesting and the playing field in that aspect is pretty level.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 Stars) - A relentless, hardcore survival experience

When it comes to survival games, Deadside takes it to a whole new level. This game is all about embracing the hardcore nature of the genre. It's not for the faint of heart, and it offers a level of intensity that's simply unmatched.

💀 Hardcore to the Bone - No Mercy 🔪🏚️
In Deadside, survival means fighting for every breath, every morsel of food, and every bullet. The game doesn't hold your hand; it throws you into a ruthless, post-apocalyptic world where danger lurks around every corner. The unforgiving nature of the game is what sets it apart, making every small victory feel like a monumental achievement.

🌲 An Open World of Desolation - Explore or Perish 🌍🪓
The game's open world is a stark, desolate wasteland filled with resources, but also with threats. Exploring it is a constant test of your survival skills. Whether you're scavenging for supplies, fending off hostile players, or hunting for your next meal, every moment is a struggle for existence.

🔥 Hardcore Community - Band Together or Betray 👥🪖
Deadside's hardcore nature is not just limited to the gameplay; it extends to the community as well. Here, players band together to form alliances and take on the challenges, but they're just as likely to betray each other for their own gain. Trust is a rare commodity in this world.

In a gaming landscape filled with survival titles, Deadside truly stands out as one of the most hardcore experiences you can find. It's a game that demands your full attention, your wits, and your survival instincts. If you're up for the challenge, it's an adventure you won't soon forget. 💀🪓🏚️👥🌲🔪🪖",1687703237,1697882178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

To the people saying it's harder than we think it is, it's certainly not so difficult that it takes several years to develop. There is a good game in here somewhere, but it becomes boring incredibly quickly because running around the map on foot is dreadful, and the players have been saying it for years. I cannot understand how they've ignored their Nolt feedback and update comments so completely. I have always wanted this game to progress and become popular, but I don't know that they deserve it at this point, and I don't know if it is recoverable. Sadly, the status of this game is in it's name. Honestly I know I will come back and reinstall it and give it another shot when vehicles are in the game, and I hope others will too, but I think too many players have uninstalled for good to ever make it a relevant title. While the devs' decisions have left me confused and annoyed, I still want them to succeed.

Pros
Bullets actually matter it only takes a few (best part of the game)
Ai populated areas (kinda dumb kinda aimboty)
Missions (can be easy-epic)
Not too hard to obtain Loot once you get over the learning cure and pace
Online raids only (slow and steady)

Cons
Be prepared to auto run for hours ""~""key
Base building exists but is very underdeveloped and time consuming
Storage is highly limited 
Spawn locations are far from everything they need a bag system like rust
Only cars only a few boats on entire map

Over all.. I play it occasionally just cause I own it already and I like that bullet damage is more realistic than say rust or cod but it's maybe like a $10 game cause your ganna die eventually and get in this loop of endless auto running. I've learned it's best to play this game by simply not giving a shit about Loot and only seeing it as a bonus if your lucky and just hit a few missions then getting off.

I wrote this entire review while auto running to my base across the map cause I needed 6 sheets of scrap metal to build some chests and now I have to commit suicide because I'm dying of thirst and hunger then run back to may base area again grab my Loot and proceed to build. 

Endlessly autorunning.

Fun gameplay loop with extra steps if you want.
Basically a battle royal/TDM, spawn in, find gear, look for action.
There are survival mechanics. thirst, hunger, and base building. all of which fit the game well without being clumsy or irritating. There are also objectives like missions and bunkers for high tier loot, base raids, and a large map littered with POI's.
But it all boils down to the same game play loop of spawn, loot, fight.
It's a good take on the dayz genre with less of a focus on survival and more of a focus on fighting. The AI being human also adds a nice change of pace over the normal zombies in games like this.",1695305424,1695305424,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

however the game does fall short in areas: gun play is limited but okay. sounds are good, weapons look okay with limited attachments. basicly one scope or flash light fits all.  
at the moment the game is more walk and shoot simulator then survival. since your not stressing about food or water fighting Players or NPC is nice but the time between combat can get boring.

The bot system is ridiculous. Imagine starting with a level 1 mission and the game spawns heavily armed bots around the mission location? Well, that's what happens. In other words, it's not enough to be forced to deal with the mission's bots, there are others around you to literally eat your ass with lots of sand and broken glass.

Other than that, if you are detected, the bots will relentlessly chase you for miles (that's if you don't get shot and die by a bot that appears to be cheating).

In addition to this concern, the hunger and thirst system is ridiculous, they fall very quickly. Buying basic survival items (water and food) is impossible by doing only level 1 missions, as the money received barely buys a can of food. Trying to get water from wells/cisterns is also impossible. Just now I passed by 3 villages and they were all deactivated. The developers just forgot that their game is in the style of a walking simulator, where you have to walk like a son of a bitch from one place to another.

This is all a great way to attract new players and even keep active ones. Congratulations on continuing to dig your own grave.

-environment and graphics are good.

 -safe zone is decent for beginner 

-mid tear guns are good, can be found easily 

-easily find loot for missions

-reward management good 

-missions implementation and their rewards are good.


NEGATIVE 

- Delay when walking.feels slow 

- Too much space between points of interest , have to spend time while roaming around.

- the AI is buffed as hell , you are on the hill 3km away from a convoy , AI with a Mosin without armor can kill you instantly ,  

- spawns are pretty unbalanced at the moment 

 -4min of running from the PVP site , just kills the engagement during the fight 

- Cheaters,  I don't like saying , but maybe there are already 
 
- sometimes your stuff will be gone  randomly from the server.

-PVP is buggy , you throw 3 neds to OP he still dont die and somehow manage to kill you.

-player base is very low.

-as foods you can only hunt ducks , no other animals are there till this date.

-there are literally no cars available , other than  boats , you have to run for atleast 6min even more to go one to another point of interest.

-often times you have to press reload thrice to reload a gun properly 

-officials servers are no restriction on safe zone camping.

-PTW dlc

the game mechanics and foundation is good but need much polishing and adding content to it 
right now its not recommended , for pvp and hardcore survival game lovers.

There are only 2 servers populated at  any time (with exception of some weekend nights) and any above average gamer will be banned from private servers because they don't like competition (will say you're cheating and report  you to devs and when it comes back clean, they power-trip and ban for nonsensical reasons. server max is 50 and the ban list for certain servers exceeds that by 10 times ( no wonder servers don't fill up) official servers don't get over 10 pop so have fun playing a running simulator to find players that run away and the first sounds of gunfire. Players never start missions anymore like they used to, everyone plays so scared and only hides until you go to loot mission crate due to the fact that they updated game and completely destroyed the economy and rate at which you can find armors (the most valuable thing in game because it prevents one shots from mosins.) The map is wide open in most places and after 200m basically all the bushes you would consider as concealment arent even there for the guy camping with a one hit sniper way out. Who adds boats on a game that 98% land 2 % water, instead of cars or even bicycles. The game doesn't even have a TOS that should also tell you something. Bots have needed to be reworked since day 1, they run around a corner and instashoot you (doesnt show gun raise or nothing, just an instant snap and dead in less than .3 seconds. Bots can also shoot through bushes and grass even if they cant see you, which they have claimed to fix but as we all know they dont do anything right, and bots also can shoot while strafing back and forth never stopping and shoot with perfect accuracy at you, meanwhile you cant walk and shoot to save your life, you have to stop and as soon as you hit the hold breath key it forces you to run sometimes which take you out of aim and screws you into a death. I also cant  count the amount of times ive shot people and it not register(everyday occurance). Also dont let me forgot that if you go to the official deadside discord to make a dispute about someone they favor it results in a ban from discord. I feel the devs are so low that i wouldnt be surprised if i got banned from the game just for writing this review, they are tired of hearing about me anyway, i get reported to them on a daily occurrence for cheating when im clearly not. Maybe what the game needs is for devs to listen to people who actually put time into the game, instead of someone whose got a stick up their bum. they are all in one anothers pockets and its slowly and slowly killed the game and now here we are here with whats left, DEADside! I'm sure there are plenty of things ive forgot to mention on this rant as well!

One community manager is claiming that this was never the idea and it was all due to a problem of poor reading from the people who became concerned with this terrible idea, but that's simply not true, or at the very best, was caused by really poor writting and communication with the community. There is no reason for them to even make such a big fuss about adding options to the community servers. All options for community servers they can add are welcome. Who would care? Even if they add really stupid, nonsensical or meme worthy changes, like for example, all players spawn as chickens and can only use their beaks as guns, the server owners could simply not use them and stick to the default settings. They don´t need to evaluate any feedback in that regard.

Also, It's written on the post that they wanted feedback on this because that would ""...determine the outcome of development in this direction"". Many discussion threads were made to talk about this, and a lot of negative feedback about safezone removal were posted, for weeks straight, and not a single peep from any of the devs or the mentioned community manager regarding this possible ""misreading"". Smells like a terrible damage control attempt, instead of just admitting that the idea was bad and was rejected. I advise that they seek improvements to the communication with the playerbase.

At current state, the game is bare bones. I advise waiting a year or two for more substantial updates.

The AI. They got Xray nightvision and shoot through bushes, it really NEEDS an update.
STEALTH part of the game is almost non-exsistant, there is no point in sneaking when AI has ""radar"" where they detect you.
Feel free to drop or sell your knife right away, it doesn't do anything to enemies.
You just do empty swings and do no damage.
You died? Well good luck, because there is no way to sneak your way to your corpse.
The game has small pay to win aspect, the supporter pack. x2 storage space, Compas and Binoculars.
So buy supporter pack and you get up above mentioned, hence the pay to win.

Sometimes shooting feels janky, janky in a sense that at point blank range me and friend would shoot the bots. But the hit didn't register.
Squads get disbanded after death and after every new game, which is bit annoying.
There is no persistant clan/guild.
Crafting is very lacking, Workbench only serves so far as a weapon/uniform skin changer from what I've seen. (Tho they say will be expanded upon in future)

My biggest gripe at the moment is with Bot AI. As I said, very limited stealth system is currently in the game.
It definetly needs polishing and updating, that's why one of the reviews said ""I'm more afraid of Bots than actual players."" Because Bushes in forests don't obstruct AI bot sight, they SEE you ALWAYS.( When you enter their detection range) The only question they have in mind is, is there a solid object between you and them to prevent them from shooting.

Choice of Firearms is good enough, from what I've seen so far. But they could add a bit more. Have yet to find a proper sniper rifle. Current choices for buying are only 3, Hunter Rifle, and 2 Moksin variations. Which ain't much.
All in all, game has potential. And will give this game thumbs up when they update and polish it more.",1660173106,1694269081,False,6,0,0.561752974987030029,0,True,False,True

While it offers an intriguing premise and a blend of survival and shooter elements, the game struggles to rise above the competition in a genre filled with established titles.

Atmospheric Post-Apocalyptic World (3/5):
The game's post-apocalyptic setting is immersive, featuring desolate landscapes, abandoned structures, and an atmosphere of tension. The eerie silence broken by the occasional sound of gunfire or distant zombies adds depth to the environment.

Survival and Looting (3/5):
""Deadside"" places a strong emphasis on survival mechanics, including hunger, thirst, and temperature management. Players must scavenge for resources, weapons, and gear to survive. The looting aspect of the game can be rewarding, as you uncover valuable items and weapons.

PvP and PvE (3/5):
The game offers a mix of PvP (Player vs. Player) and PvE (Player vs. Environment) gameplay. Engaging in firefights with other players or banding together to tackle AI-controlled zombies and creatures adds variety to the experience. However, the balance between these two aspects can sometimes feel uneven.

Crafting and Base Building (2/5):
While ""Deadside"" includes crafting and base-building mechanics, they are not as robust or intuitive as in other survival games. The limited building options and the complexity of the crafting system may frustrate some players.

Technical Issues (2/5):
""Deadside"" has faced its share of technical issues, including bugs, server problems, and performance optimization challenges. These issues can detract from the overall gameplay experience.

Lack of Content (3/5):
One of the game's shortcomings is its lack of content, especially when compared to more established titles in the genre. The map, while reasonably sized, can feel limited over time, and the gameplay loop may become repetitive.

Community and Development (3/5):
The game has an active community and a development team that continues to work on updates and improvements. However, the pace of development progress and addressing player feedback can vary.

Conclusion:
""Deadside"" offers an intriguing premise with its post-apocalyptic survival setting and a blend of PvP and PvE gameplay. However, it faces stiff competition in the survival genre, and while it has potential, it struggles to stand out due to technical issues, limited content, and less polished mechanics. If you're a dedicated fan of the survival genre and enjoy the thrill of scavenging and engaging with other players in a harsh world, ""Deadside"" may offer some entertainment. Still, it may not fully satisfy players looking for a more refined and content-rich survival experience.",1693341758,1693341758,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

In the beginning it's just run for my life, everyone trying to kill me including AI bots. It takes me 3 hours to realize how to play. If you like to play this game Watch a YT video before playing then this will be much easier.

Here are some Tips If you like to play

1. Get a Gun ASAP
2. Get a Bottle and some Food / Drinks
(You can find these thing in houses like in Battle royal game)
3. Get some Cloths (Try to get the cloths that give you more inventory slot)
4. Tear up some Extra clothing and get Rags
5. Find some Alcohol, Moonshine, Vodka and then you can craft some healing patch.
6. Then Try to do easy mission on the map

If you played Rust, Dayz, Tarkov, you can find similarities, big ones, in many areas of the game.

Now, the team is small, the game looks good, but it's janky as all hell on basically every aspect. A lot of polish is required on pretty much everything.

Considering they're better off adding new things rather than rewrite their current content, take into account the slow dev process, and you end up with a potential fun game that could be so much better.

The issue is, most likely, the new stuff they work on is suffering from the current state of the game.

I didn't PvP at all yet, but otherwise it's still entertaining for now.

There's always something to do. I like the concept of the safezone storage so you don't have to build a base right away, which gives casual gamers a good outlet. I will say I like everything about the game, the gunplay, missions, etc, but there are 3 things to keep in mind:

1. Servers usually only have 10 to 35 people, even during peak hours. I mostly play PvE, so that's not really a downside, hbut just keep in mind.

2. Enemies are hard to spot from a distance (200m+). Even with antialiasing all the way up, High graphics, the bots can be hard to spot.

3. We need something like a horse or vehicle to get around the map. It's pretty sizeable so I use the autosprint function. We just need more ways to get around.

No. I guess if you like sitting in corners for hours not playing the game that you paid money for to shoot some poor soul in the face. If you get satisfaction out of that somehow than cool but for people that like to play the game we payed for, not for us. What they mean when they say it's a hardcore survival game is that your footsteps can be heard a mile a way and full squads will be crouched in bushes to kill you and take the knife you spawn with. There is no goal, the ""events"" are just AI with guns. Even if you manage to take them out and get all the sweet loot without someone third partying you and taking all the loot that you got from killing all the AI what do you do with it? Go kill more AI or sit in corners and use them on other players. There is no point to this game. Just a big empty map with assets, AI, and the poor souls that spend their time in it.

But, now with quite a few hours in the game... honestly, it's potential ridden Trash. 

Potential is outstanding.  Unfortunately NPC's are ridiculously difficult to deal with.   I know, I know ""....used to be hard, but now I roll right through them"".   Good for you.  Most of the rest of us aren't blessed with lightening fast reflexes, you know, to deal with that NPC you know is just around the corner, you're aiming in the space he's about to occupy, and still he manages to get around the corner and headshot you with a long rifle that is literally longer than the space between the two of you.

OR, the eyesight to be able to see with laser-beam-clarity through weeds and brush, or deal with the insta-shots you get when you fire.  They literally know where you are and have you crosshaired before you even think about pulling the trigger (and naturally, Heli's seldome offer 0 cover in the immediate area.

Or... well, lets just say they're faster than a terrified Navy Seal running downhill with a tailwind on grease.  Nobody in history is that fast guys.  Nobody.

Bots: Super soldiers with X-ray who will either turn any number of degrees and one tap you in any armor and will chase you to the ends of the earth, abusing terrain hitbox that you cant see to murder you before you have a chance to even think you have a chance.
Playerbase: yeah theyre toxic but its a hardcore pvp(ve) survival. Its to be expected
Bases: Very barebones. Buggy. but a fun and actually relaxing timesink....Just Press Y when smacking the tree for 20 minutes. Most servers dont allow players to base camp, but are ok with people camping outside of your base so be warned.
My BIGGEST complaints are:
Being able to just Destroy any guns they loot or find. including yours. If they kill you and cant carry it, they just break it down so neither can you. And there is NO requirements needed to do so. Just your Bare hands.
Night Time Nvidia Filters: Just remove night mode. Too many people exploit the filters and can see you cross map with the damn thing that nightmode has absolutely no purpose other than to punish new players.

Most people exaggerate the AI's aimbot if anything it's more of a they do more damage than your average enemy AI's. But if you play long enough you'll learn some advantages that you can use to manipulate the AI's reaction. PvP is kinda dead but PvE is fun as long as they add more updates to it. 

If devs are reading this add factions and different type of enemies(They're not gonna add zombies). Or just add steam workshop mod support tbh. I wouldn't say it's a good buy but compare to other survival early access games I have played that cost a bit more even through discount, I totally enjoyed this one and even bought the supporter pack later on.

1.) My arms are jello. In what survival shooter game does my hip fire AND ADS CONSTANTLY jiggle. NONE. This is my number 1 issue and until it is fixed I will not be playing more. There are multiple games out on the market that have a better gun play system than this. All they seem to care about so far is updating boats and cucking you on survival elements like how much resources are given when consuming items.

2) Base building is atrocious. Doesn't want to work correctly or intended 99% of the time, not even half  the time MOST of the time. Then after countless wipes you are expected to go through the pain staking process again. This is just so bad on gameplay, need 1000 nails for a decent base that will get wiped within 2 months for you to need to do it again all while struggling to even get the wall or floor you want to place down. 

3.) WE NEED MORE CONTENT. No I don't mean I want another boat to ride in? WHO CARES. Give me a land vehicle if you are going to leave every ""city"" (the cities are like 1 block of a normal city) 2km apart I need a reason to play besides a running simulator. 

MESSAGE TO DEVS: You have essentially taken DayZ... and made it DayZ without zombies... no one wants a cut and copy unoriginal idea, get some balls and start making decisions that go against the flow of your normal every day in russia shooter. Its over done. Your game will die within the next year if you don't start making some changes. Especially to your atrocious gun play that acts like I handed a 2 year a fully loaded RPG and expect them to hold it steady. No reason to have my cross hair, red dot, acog what have you on the enemy and STILL miss a shot. Really disappointed in this and the changes that have and haven't been made.

Go buy SCUM, Escape from Tarkov, shit even by DayZ but don't waste your time on a game that the gun play feels like you cant even shoot a fucking side of the barn with a howitzer.",1686337750,1689032857,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Imagine yourself, walking through the swamp, when suddenly, a duck flies out of the reeds, loudly quacking. Yes my friends, it's duckhunt 3d, with many hunting locations, weapons and the classic duck sounds you might remember from the NES classic.

To flesh it out they've added a decent survival games which fixes my many grievances with other survival games (scum/dayz) You have a storage at the 2 savezones, so you don't have to build a base right away. You can find weapons nearly everywhere, making it a lot less likely you'll die 10 times before even finding a way to defend youself. And missions give people something else to do then just kill eachother, so people here not only shoot you, but often engage in convo and ask you team up. Last, but certainly not least, you can't be raided anytime, removing the constant coming online and finding your base raided that other games have.

The whole vibe is a lot more  friendly and less frustrating.

Graphics are great and it runs surprisingly well, never really dip below 140fps on ultra.

My only big complaint is that the enemy AI is very very verrrry stupid. It's like the absolute bare minimum pve AI can be. If you spot a group of them and shoot, they all immediately turn and lock onto you and shoot. They don't take cover or flank or anything like that, they simply just walk straight towards you while shooting until you either kill them or they kill you. Playing solo and running into a big group of them in a small space can be terrifying as you eventually have to reload or bandage yourself while there's 8 enemies walking in a single file line like morons straight towards you.

I remember being able to take on the npcs solo, as long as I moved around a lot and kept trying to misdirect them. This game used to be a lot of fun with a group and also solo, the AI was difficult but not impossible. After buying this game when it first came out (and purchasing the developer support pack), I have a different opinion now. I just tried to play it the last few days with my buddy, and we kept getting lazer beamed by the AI. I used to be able to hide behind rocks and trees to try to survive (not always successfully mind you), and as long as I could run far enough, the AI didn't one tap me the second they see me... I am disappointed in the direction this game has gone in, I always held it in high regard, but after trying to play for the last week with my buddy (who I told to purchase the game to play it with me), I am upset. We are literally being one/two shot by NPC's and it sucks. We used to be able to survive, and actually kill them, but now we try and capture different events and we get shot at before we can even see where they are located. In the current state, it is a waste of time. Maybe, there is a hardcore player base that has over 1000 hours in this game that knows how to progress, but unfortunately, it's not me. This game is not worth even 100 hours. At this point in the game, I am very upset with the difficulty of the NPC's, and I don't think I will be playing it again at it's current state. I am at 66 hours (around 55ish hours before playing in the current state), and I realize that isn't much, but at this point, I regret buying the game. What happened? If I wanted to grind, I would have played a tony hawk pro skater game... The game used to be much better after you found a scope for your gun.

PVP isn't rewarding when enemies you've killed are able to immediately respawn at a nearby town and be back in under 5 minutes to grub a gun off a bot's body and kill you before you've can finished looting and healing. The gunplay does feel good, and it's pretty easy to go out and get some serviceable gear if you lose a kit. 

PVE is dull at it's peak, and rewards don't match the inputs at the highest level missions/events. Not to mention, out of the maybe 20 wells on the map, you'll be lucky to have 2 that have water? 

Basebuilding is shallow and haphazardly put together, it feels like building a house with toothpicks and elmers glue & all it really ends up being is a place you can throw stuff in containers and refill your water with the single water collector per base.  

TLDR: Get it if it's on sale like I did, play it for a weekend & maybe come back in 3 more years when they've added a few more towns, a few more guns and maybe something slightly more interesting to do.

As a big DayZ fan (439 hours since 2020) I wasn't expecting this game to reinvent the wheel but give me a more rounded version of the experience I was used to, and it did exactly that. Deadside is very clearly a love letter to DayZ and games like DayZ but it's smooth, optimized nicely and is essentially like if DayZ SA was its own standalone product. 

The main difference is everything is faster. The map is smaller, the loot is easier to find etc. which makes the game so fun to play. Unlike SCUM where you can go hours without seeing any loot or any sign of intelligent life, Deadside's AI is abundant just enough so you never really feel relaxed. That's not to say DS is better than DayZ or SCUM, but while similar theres an entirely different approach that doesn't rely on you having to log in daily and play for hours at a time.

There is less than 700 people on this game usually at any given time. Yeah ok its classed as a ""HARDCORE MULTIPLAYER SHOOTER"" so I know that throws a lot of players off but I mean, you should see how bad the game actually is.

What I have experienced and how I feel
⚫You can craft a base, awesome - Think rust but lifeless. Pointless. It gets torn down before you actually get to build it.
⚫The development speed is glacial. I am not kidding. You will be waiting 2 years for a fix for a bug that hundreds of players are complaining about.
⚫The ""small"" amount of players on this game are TOXIC as all hell and do NOT let you play the game. If I want this I'd go play rust as it is more alive and BASICALLY THE SAME THING.
⚫They called it a ""realistic game with survival elements"" but it needs more animals to hunt. Some for of weather such as RAIN. Yes thats correct. Maybe add some form of sickness to give some use to pills... and definitely work on more base build features as its so barebones.
⚫I think PvP should be restricted in sections across the map, for obvious toxic reasons.(referring to how toxic the game is)
⚫It can be played in PVE and PVP, okay.... this one is a lie. Its PVEVP so the devs are selling a FALSELY advertised game in my opinion. Not once can you choose to just go and PVE. If you can, well... im an idiot and never seen that option.
⚫It has ""Realistic weapons"".... okay. Trust me... they are hardly ""realistic"" compared to Escape from Tarkov or Arma.
You can craft your own stuff... hahahahahahhaaha... funny.
⚫The animations are lacklustre at best. When you ""open a can of energy"" to drink you legit just hear it open and then you hold the can in front of you with your arms stretched out. Cans not even open either. This one makes me laugh as it looks like you are sh***ing yourself.
⚫The games community is a hotspot for toxicity and it drives most new players away. I once was running around a map and just seeing what ""high level"" players were doing to a new player disgusted me. Me and a friend had to get our good weapons on to kill the 4 man group harassing a fresh spawn. After we had killed them, we got comments on our steam accounts with... lets just say ""toxicity"" and end it there.

My Verdict
All of this combined, I can say this game has been dead in the water since day one. I bought it day one, played it a little and then played it on another steam account as I refunded it. I have 657 hours in this game in total and I have not seen any improvement to it at all. If anything it feels like it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ worse. The game feels hollow and it really does not feel like theres much to do in it. The price is decent enough at least for £16.75 but thats about it.

I was honest about this game in the discussions page on my other steam account and you will not believe what happened. A belligerent dev sent me a sarcastic message and banned me from the discussion!",1688173364,1688173364,False,54,6,0.683993279933929443,0,True,False,True

I have over 1000 hours in Dayz on vanilla and heavily modded servers...and I walked away to play deadside... and I can honestly say I have no problem not looking back. However I would like more lore to be added to explain the situation and backdrop of the situation you as the player find yourself in. In most every way Deadside is superior to dayz.... the Ai is great and helps keep it immersive....no more zombies thank god....am soooo sick of zombie games. Wouldnt mind some rescue missions..... bailing out players that get in way over their heads doesn't count lol...thats every night for me. If you are thinking about buying..... do it. You won't regret it. PvP is always toxic.... its pvp. However most of the PVE servers are filled with some real good people. IF you still find it toxic.... then maybe its you and they are just getting retribution on you for some toxic crap you have done.

I see a lot of comments saying the players are ""Toxic"" and have yet to experience any at all on PvE servers, most of the player base I interacted with helped a lot of new people in the game including myself so that the community will grow.
With that said I have yet to delve into the PvP side of it and have no knowledge of how toxic it is... I imagine it is no better or worse compared to DayZ PvP on official servers that normally has large groups controlling the map with alt accounts everywhere.

This game is not a DayZ, SCUM, Rust, Tarkov killer and probably never will be... The game is enjoyable PvE wise if you just want to do the events, missions and dodging the shots from NPCs.

Rating: 4/5

Deadside is an open-world survival game developed by Bad Pixel. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the game offers a tense and atmospheric experience where players must navigate dangerous environments, scavenge for resources, and engage in both PvE and PvP combat.

One of the standout features of Deadside is its immersive atmosphere. The game effectively captures the desolate and gritty nature of its post-apocalyptic setting, with detailed environments, abandoned structures, and hauntingly beautiful landscapes. The sound design adds to the immersion, enhancing the feeling of tension and danger as you explore the world.

The survival mechanics in Deadside are well-implemented. Players need to manage their hunger, thirst, and health while also keeping an eye on their ammunition and equipment durability. Finding and utilizing resources becomes crucial, as it directly impacts your chances of survival. The game strikes a good balance between being challenging and rewarding, providing a sense of accomplishment when you successfully overcome the harsh conditions.

Combat in Deadside is intense and unforgiving. Whether you're facing off against AI-controlled enemies or engaging in PvP encounters with other players, every encounter feels dangerous and impactful. The gunplay mechanics are solid, offering a satisfying sense of weight and impact. The addition of stealth elements adds an extra layer of strategy to engagements, allowing players to choose between going in guns blazing or opting for a more covert approach.

The open-world aspect of Deadside provides a vast playground for exploration. There are different regions to discover, each with its own distinct environments and threats. The game world is filled with various landmarks, lootable areas, and hidden secrets, encouraging players to venture off the beaten path. Additionally, the inclusion of vehicles adds mobility and allows for faster traversal across the map.

While Deadside offers an enjoyable survival experience, it's not without its flaws. The game can feel somewhat repetitive at times, as the objectives and activities tend to follow a similar pattern. More variety in missions and tasks would have added depth to the gameplay. Additionally, the AI could be more refined, as enemy behavior can be predictable and lacks diversity.

Overall, Deadside delivers an engaging and atmospheric survival experience. With its immersive world, solid survival mechanics, and intense combat, it keeps players on their toes and provides a thrilling post-apocalyptic adventure. Despite some minor shortcomings, Deadside is a game worth exploring for fans of the survival genre.",1604269235,1686509560,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Guns are loaded when you find them, and that's not hard to do. They don't fall apart after 10 shots and become useless. Scopes are easy to find. Food isn't an issue that keeps you from enjoying the game, it's still needs to be found, but it can be. 
I don't like the AI (no zombies), they use aim bot and will smoke you if they catch you in the open. Open means anywhere other than inside or next to a solid wall. Don't use the woods for cover, they ignore it like an open prairie. You can't see them, but they see you 100 meters away. Sniping from the woods=bad idea if there's more than a few AI.
The AI are fun to fight at close quarters though, they seem to have a bit of intelligence at times and can surprise you when you think you've cleared the area.

Gunplay feels great as always and the couple improvements they did recently help a lot with quality of life. While I wish we had land vehicles over boats, I'm glad we have some way of traveling around the map versus running. I really want this game to succeed, but I feel like the sparse nature of the map between landmarks on the map is what hurts it the most. Occasionally you'll find a roaming patrol of NPCs or a run down village, but not much else. I'm not sure what they could do to improve the gameplay between running to missions, but I hope they have something planned. 

All that aside, it's really a fun/challenging game when you're in the action. Just wish there was a little more to do between the action. I still recommend it. It runs great with few bugs or issues that I have run into. Give it a shot especially if you got some friends to join you.

So basically this is just PUBG but with monuments and things to do.

As a soloist the game is rough.

Base building sucks. Like legit sucks. Tried to build a 1x3 cross platform (just the platform mind you) and that literally took a whole day (as a soloist).

6/9/23 Edit: So I was reading in the updates and not to my surprise.........

1). I'm guessing base building hasn't been improved (sped up) 

2). Nobody asked for boats you idiots. We asked for cars right before you expanded the map the first time.

3). Ya this game might fall off if the devs don't get their sht together.

It HAD potential but after this long and they add boats over cars then ya hard pass boys n girls.

How this game got 26k upvotes is beyond fucking me. Never mind, I found out why it has 26k upvotes.

Ya I don't know how I feel about end game loot in the safe zone vendor. Defeats the whole purpose of the game scaling system if you ask me but whatever. I remember complaining about end game loot dropping in air drops but now? Naaaaaa fk it let's just add it to the vendor ""because we want to give new players a chance.""

Chance to what? Buy a gun they'll prob never afford starting out on a high pop server? I don't think you guys understand gear score/scaling.

Combat is a bit unbalanced at the moment, cause freshspwans manage to kill geared people quite easy with knifes and stuff, that should be more challenging for them. 

There are NPCs on the Map that spawn pretty randomly, also sometimes behind you and they are quiete good at aiming, too good sometimes. It is a littel frustrating as a Solo-Player.

Between the AI of the enemy bots that are unrealistically accurate and at the same time terribly inaccurate at close range, the extremely long healing animation to only heal 5hp with a singular rag, gun play that is not only unrealistic, but also extremely basic (no bullet impacts to be able to tell where your shots land at any range outside of about 30 meters), the inventory and looting system being very bare bones and unpolished, water and food stats (quickly running out of water with hardly any consistent ways to be able to re hydrate, besides only being able to build your own well to collect water, or a random well in the open world, which never have water, and there isn't any water wells at the safe zones, and the VERY rare occasion that water/soda spawns as loot, or you can spend $6000 at a vendor for just ONE can of soda that only refills 10 hydration, they only used to cost $175-$350 each). The whole gameplay loop entirely revolves around travelling to spots on the map to complete different objectives that change in difficulty (which is just the level of aimbot accuracy the AI possess, plus the weapons they use, even though an AI with a pistol seems to do as much damage as a AI with a shotgun, sniper, or MG), you go to one of these objectives, kill enemies, loot them and the reward chest, then rinse and repeat. There is base building, but since supplies like sheet metal are completely random, that isn't even a viable way to play. Deadside is just a poorly built shooter with mechanics that are on as basic of a level as the original DOOM, with survival mechanics thrown in, that only make the experience more tedious and downright boring.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I'm a fan of the survival genre and have been playing these types of games for some time. My buddy who plays these games with me wanted to give Deadside a try since it was on sale, so we took the plunge.

Initially, we were having a good time learning the game. Loot seemed readily available, NPC fighting encounters were fun, and gun mechanics seemed alright. Where we started running into issues was our hydration meter.

Food/hydration doesn't seem to deplete at an unreasonable rate, but finding liquids was incredibly annoying. Since we were fresh on the scene, we weren't knowledgeable about the various ways to gather water/liquids.

We would occasionally find a soda on an NPC we whacked, but we weren't finding these fast enough to keep up our hydration. And we were doing a whole bunch of killing. So we made our way to a safe zone. To our surprise, a single soda cost $6.9k. This just didn't seem right. The Deadside wiki said sodas cost $350 each, and I couldn't find any other documentation online to indicate why the price was so inflated.

So I thought, maybe this was a server specific setting that jacked the econ way up. So I loaded into another server and ran to a safe zone to compare prices. Same coal-raking deal there - $6.9k for a single soda that barely scratches the surface of your hydration needs.

I made a post on Reddit posing the question regarding pricing. Several people responded ""just go to a well with a canteen"" while dodging the question of why was a price that was originally set at $350 jacked to $6.9k like this was post WWI Germany.

As I'm told, this was to ""make purchasing survival items a non-viable strategy."" My question to that is - then why bother having this item available to buy at all in game?

Prior to this knowledge of being able to gather water at wells, I was forced to but 1 soda, which ended in me selling 3 guns, several pieces of clothing, all my ""junk"" items, and all the loose cash I found. For 1 soda.

Look - I understand in a survival game you don't want folks to be able to just farm cash to meet all their needs. That's fair. But to give no explanation to new players on some of the core mechanics of the game whilst bending them over backwards for something as simple as a soda that barely puts a dent in my hydration needs seems incredibly shortsighted. I like survival games, but none have been as annoying as Deadside in figuring out what the hell you need to do to survive.

This got me looking closer into the dev support for this game. I've seen numerous complaints that fixes/enhancements come at a slow pace. This coupled with my initial frustrations of the game has lead me to believe a lot of folks won't enjoy the game in its current state. If devs start adding in more features in the future and take in some player feedback, I could see myself coming back. For now, I'll stick to my $2 sodies at 7-11.",1685715833,1685715833,False,0,0,0.401732981204986572,0,True,False,True

The thrill of forming alliances, engaging in intense firefights, or betraying your temporary allies for personal gain is unparalleled. Deadside's multiplayer offers endless possibilities for emergent gameplay, ensuring that no two sessions are ever alike.

Furthermore, Deadside boasts a comprehensive progression system that rewards both skill and perseverance. As you explore the world and complete objectives, you'll unlock new weapons, gear, and abilities, allowing for more creative approaches to survival. This sense of progression keeps you invested in the game, constantly striving to become more formidable in the face of ever-present dangers.

Lastly, the developers of Deadside have shown a commendable commitment to ongoing updates and community engagement.

Then they made the scavs an actual challenge. They should dial the scavs back because it is very annoying to clear hard missions and above as a group and as a solo it is a task best left to people with a lot more hours in the game than I have.

The scavs seem like they either totally miss, or instant kill. It is not very often that you feel yourself just get tagged once or twice by a scav spray. I have seen 3 of them miss every shot of full spray for 2-3 seconds, and I have seen one scav hit the nastiest spray transfer of all time and absolutely dumpster my duo and I. 

The pvp is actually fantastic. The healing mechanics are simple and while I find the dehydration mechanics (when usining the higher tier, faster healing meds) annoying, at least there are methods of fast healing in the game. This makes solo v duo or even solo v trio possible without ratting. 

Short version, the PvP is fun but the PvE is tedious. The game is challenging and unforgiving for all the wrong reasons. The scavs randomly have better aim than any player at times and it is frustrating to say the least. The scavs should have a more consistent accuracy. It should not feel like essentially every time a scav sprays it is a coin flip whether they will either completely miss 15 shots in a row or beam you in the head with no in between. I am not kidding when I say the scavs will miss just enough to make you comfortable and then randomly you will see a scav peek a corner and absolutely lay out your whole squad.

Pro
-open world
-weapon are not hard to find
-there are mission
-there are cargo
-weapon feels fantastic
-ammo are easy to find
-armor,clothing,bags are easy to find usually on the Enemy bot/player you killed

Cons:
-almost no player in server, heck even 0 player
-no singleplayer (i have a bad connection so i like it if this game has Singleplayer)
-the enemy can see you a miles away and can see you, but you cant see them
-Not alot of weapon in-game
-huge map, but there is no vehicle that can be used to fast travel (only boat)
-only have 2 safezones
-you cant choose a location to start (sometimes i spawned in a city with buncha enemies)
-to leave a server you must wait 30 sec
-most player are thirsty for loot and kill anyone on sight, even the one who just joined
-bottle of water cant be refilled from lake nor river
-cargo drop only has 1 item innit
-bugs can be found, it is not serious it is only moderate
-please let me crreate server for free

In the end i refunded it because it's not my taste. I like survival games that are more complex. That said i've spend most of the time shooting AI enemies and running to a trader to sell items. Thats the PVE side, extremly boring. PVP however has it's thrilling moments. So if you plan on buying this for PVE, don't! PVP is where it's at and that's also what the game centers on. Hence the raid mechanics and simplyfied, not very well tought out survival aspects, they seem to be just tacked on and what you are really playing is deathmatch on a large map. 

It's that kind of review where i wish there was a button for a middle ground between good and bad. Or a ""Not my taste button"" because in itself for what it want's to be, the game isn't bad and i think it would really shine with mod support.

I can say that this game has potential. It provides a PVP/PVE experience that doesn't require insane amounts of grinding. The missions and events in this game are fun to do and provide you most of your loot/cash. The way raiding in this game works is great too. With the way it is setup, offline raids don't really exist. When someone kills you, you have a chance to drop a raid token which will disappear within 5 minutes if not used. When used, it highlights a large area where your base is located for 60 minutes, allowing your base to be raided in that time period. The NPCs in this game can either be easy pickings or extremely deadly.

no transport
no effects after being shot feeling stupid

I LOVE this game..the AI is fun to battle, I'm getting in  some great practice sniping them at great distances .
Don't let them being AI fool you, these things can see through bushes and their aim is deadly....very worthy opponents.
I love the map,the graphics are amazing it sort of reminds me of the area where I live.
I love the missions and the rewards are pretty good.
The airdrops offer keys which unlock crates at the bunkers.
The Convoys carry cases with very nice rewards. just be prepared to have a VERY large group to deal with.
If you just wanna chill and go treasure hunting for loot, you can do that too!

Since I'm just starting out and learning the game I've chosen to play on a PVE server for now.
But if you opt for PVP style play with other players, there are a lot of servers that have just that.

The game being in early development comes with it's limits, there needs to be more animals to hunt, fishing needs to be included, and possibly vehicles, but I think I'd limit those to ATV type or side by sides.

Did I mention they have airboats? and they handle BEAUTIFULLY!!
Skimming across the lake, or taking one of the ajoining rivers makes you feel like you are on a float trip, but high speed!
It really IS that good! 

Building was a breeze and there's some pretty impressive bases on the server I'm playing on.

The developers really put out a solid game here, albeit somewhat limited right now as far as food and crafting is concerned.

I can't wait to see where this game goes as it has a super solid beginning.

It's almost the funnest game in it's genre. Most of the time you walk around for hours and then die to an ai with laser vision.

This is a great game, my personal favorite survival game. 

Pros:
-Not too complicated, very simple compared to most survival games
-Very pvp focused compared to most survival games
-No offline raiding
-PvE as well (no zombies)
-As of update 0.2.6 (2-1-22) better spawn system, spawn anywhere with cooldown time & NOT dogtags
-As of update 0.2.9 (5-4-22) fast travel between safe zones
-As of update 0.5.0 (4-18-23) Boats have been added

Cons:
-Only Vehicles are boats, traveling can be annoying
-Bots sometimes can be ridiculously hard to fight
-there's a glitch that will occur every so often saying [account has been banned] from a server even tho ur not banned, all u gotta do is just try to keep re-joining, restarting ur game may help",1645210089,1684614334,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Unlike DayZ and Rust, you can find guns almost immediately when spawning in, in houses and shelters. So you aren't spending hours looking for a firearm, magazines, and ammo. Guns in this game spawn with ammo.

The game currently has two safe zones that you are able to enter and store some of your loot or even sell it to one of the two vendors. One vendor sells ammo, guns, and armor/clothing. The other vendor sells building/crafting supplies and food/meds.

My favorite thing about this game is that there are no OFFLINE RAIDS so you aren't glued to the game like Rust. Depending on the server, when you die you have a chance to drop a raid token and if someone pops the raid token within 5 mins of your death, it triggers your base to be open to be attacked and large general proximity of your base is shown on the map any everyone has ~60 mins to attack.

CONS
-The game could use a little bit of work on the gun play. I understand it is not supposed to feel snappy and ""arcady"", it could definitely be tightened up a little bit.  It seems to lack that satisfying feel or ""punch"" when engaging in firefights.
-The sound!!! So, I'm torn because some elements are okay.  Atmosphere, gun sounds, and reverberation sounds pretty good by themselves.  HOWEVER, it can be extremely difficult to determine the direction and pin point the sound's origin.  As far as i can tell ( I may be forgetting ) enemy footstep sounds aren't there.  But probably the most frustrating thing at times, AI enemies don't speak or in any way alert you to their presence other than their physical appearance.  Other games usually have ai speaking, breathing or coughing every once in a while so you know that they are present.  

PROS
-Very pretty game.  I play in 4k on a c2 OLED and while it's simple, it is nice to look at.
-Performance.  My rtx3070 for the most part doesn't drop below 100fps on medium to high settings.
-Looting and economy.  This game's economy and looting are simple and easy to understand, it also leaves the player with many meaningful ways to craft and earn towards good and genuinely helpful items.  What stands out with this game is the prevalence of weapons and items.  This helps early game and you can easily gain 3 weapons and a full inventory.
-This can be enjoyed solo or with friends.  You'll definitely enjoy this more with some pals but the atmosphere and stakes make for an awesome solo experience, especially if you notice small details.
-Community.  The player base seems to be more helpful and welcoming to new players than not.  While you'll certainly find yourself killing other players, you'll definitely still have fun with others too.",1683235929,1683235929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Perfect if you love running long distances for literally minutes at a time, only to get shot by a convoy 200 meters away wielding shotguns. Or maybe you misstep and die with a ton of gear and, whiie running back to your base, a level 3 mission pops up and you're forced to abandon everything after the bots detect you sneaking around the trees naked. But hey, realistic gunplay, right? Boosted damage from military AI bots makes sense, since the Army trains you to shoot harder apparently. They can also dome you from over 100 meters away with a shotgun, but fuck you if you try to do it. It's also physically impossible to go prone, not that it would help the heat-seeking AI bots anyways. 

Even if all that [i]doesn't[/i] move you (lord knows it didn't me), you still have to contend with a dying playerbase, and lord f*cking help you if you pick a private server and the f*cking admin decides to make it private in the middle of the night cuz some rando took his loot or something. 

But hey, for the casual fan among you, let me detail your first few moments in the game. You spawn in with a knife, probably around a level 1 mission where people are still stupid accurate with shotguns and pistols. So you'll have to knife a weapon, which a lot of you probably won't do, and so you'll die. 

My favorite part about this review, though, is when the devs inevitably see this and ban me down the road for some asinine reason; a common thread if you look through enough bad reviews of this game. So watch out if you review this as 'helpful', since they're probably compiling a list of those users too. 

So hey, if you like Russians, having things incredibly lopsided for you in the name of 'realism', love spending literally five minutes just running, major updates maybe about twice a year, sh*tty and dying playerbase. As for me, I'm going back to DayZ.

I'd love if the vest/rig was expanded into two slots - so that one could wear a hunting vest on top of a bullet proof vest to get best of both worlds if no actual plate molle carrier was available. I think knife and pistol should have their own designated slots as the knife has its utility value at all times. A gas stove would be nice. Random patrols or loners would be nice to have on the map too. Yet to see or use any vehicle - maybe that's for the future too.

One of my biggest complaints about this game, is the world just feels SO EMPTY and basic. Like verrry empty feeling. There is no wildlife, no bugs, nothing blowing in the wind. The only thing there is, is a few AIs every now and then, that are EXTREMELY stupid and basic. They are so dumb. They just run around, and fire like a 3 y/o is controlling them. Walk up to you slowly firing, sometimes will hit you like they turned aimbot on
for a second. Going back to how empty and character-less the game world is, I didnt see ONE dynamic prop in the whole time i played, i dont think there even is any. The WHOLE game/map is full of STATIC PROPS. The trees are static props, the buildings are static props, objects you pick up in game are static props. Literally every thing in the game, is a static prop. It makes the world SO BORING and basic. I mean the trees dont blow in the wind, you shoot an object, and it just sits there unaffected. 

Another thing I didnt like is the physics, they felt so cheap and generic. Nothing felt like it had any ""weight"" to it. Just felt like some basic physics programming, with my player clipping through walls and such. Also found ""floating"" buildings and stuff, which really shows how much effort was put into this game.


The thing this game really needs is ZOMBIES. Yes. Zombies, because it solves a few issues, it gives the world a bit more character, gives you an actual reason to use your weapon and collect ammo, gives you something to survive against, and its the ONE enemy, where its actually ok to have a stupid AI for. Also with a name like ""DeadSide"" how could you not have zombies in it? ha.

Also this game really should also have Linux support. Not really any reason it shouldnt.


In order for this game to be good, it needs some serious work, so much work in fact, that i really dont even know if its possible. At least i dont think the devs are willing to put enough work into it to make it good. Cause right now, its extremely generic, empty, and honestly pretty boring.

It takes almost no time to scrape together a basic PvP set and start roaming for players. Bases are nice but not necessary unless you're a hoarder. I was like 100hrs deep before I built mine.

Deadside is one of the most solo-friendly open-world PvP survival games. Love to solo DayZ, Rust, ARK and Tarkov but want something a little more respectful of your time? Pick up Deadside.

I'm in no way saying it doesn't have issues, because it does and they can be VERY disruptive... but picking the right server makes a massive difference. I'd stay away from anything that doesn't have solid admins.

I highly recommend ""Loaf's Bakery"" if you love PvP but hate 3rd-person perspective. Admins are always on, it restarts constantly for stability, and it's run by the game's own Lead Community Manager. Together they host PvP events for the server - for instance, there's a bracketed 3v3 arena-style PvP tourney today.

10/10 would get beamed by Loaf again.

Newest update brought long awaited features and fixes to several issues mentioned in previous review.
Overall game feels to be running better (in terms of graphic performance), most of the bugs have been fixed Hurray!
New AI on convoy bots made this event more interesting and fight are longer with better loot from reward (box).
Boats are nice additional feature that makes moving across the map way faster and it gives new tactical opportunities.
New economy however seems to be unpolished and need adjusting.
One of the biggest problems that still exist are flying bases, this is a thing that need to be fixed asap.
Anyway, I can recommend it to any new player who can have a ton of fun for small amount of money.
In my opinion it is one of the best survival game available right now.

I keep trying to love it, but it just feels like the developers don't really want to try in making things better about the experience of this game. 

The AI can STILL see through shrubs and bushes and laser you to death (it's gotten slightly better at a distance, but it's still ridiculous how accurate they are, and how quickly they can kill you, even with really good gear. There's also basically NO cover in forests, which is like 75% of the map. I love the fact that DayZ has trees everywhere with no Robocop-like aim, while this game needs it but doesn't. Just funny how the gaming landscape doesn't listen or just drops things in for no real reason.

The community is also incredibly toxic for the most part. On my first day playing the game, myself and my partner were absolutely wiped by a squad, who used the fact that they had gear to taunt us, make us feel like shit, and continue to abuse their power. There's not a REAL WAY in game to even report people, so you have to email them in order to report anything, which probably makes it easier for people to be abusive and do what they want. On top of this, a lot of the people in the Discord are either rude, despondent, or arrogant. There have been some people that I've met in-game who have been really nice, and a few in the Discord(s), but that's about it.

It's also the worst thing any piece of media can be--boring. The gameplay loop ends incredibly quickly, the missions become boring after doing them for a playtime of about 40 hours, and the world doesn't have any story. I would love to be able to offer more support to this game, but EVERY time I have, I either get arrogant, egotistical people in their Discord (their main place of communication with the community) or no response. That's not to say everyone is like that, but that's what happens most of the time. It's absolutely ridiculous. It's the worst thing you can do to a community of players--keep them at a distance and shoot them down for no real reason. There are only a few that are close to the development (Like Loaf, from my experience) who genuinely care about people and try to make their opinions feel heard. I have SO MANY ideas for this game and I was so optimistic, but the Discord and the updates have just left me feeling empty about the game as a whole.

I'm not saying don't play this game. Maybe one or two of these things will change, or at the very least improve. Maybe even all of them will--but I doubt it personally. Ultimately, I'm just disappointed.

Many will say ""The game lacks content"" or ""The devs are lazy"" Trust me the devs aren't lazy they just are struggling with high demand and lack of man power THEY HAVE LIVES TOO. And for the lack of content thats both a yes and a no, yes it could do with more content but also no it doesn't need it the current content just needs refining and the game needs and deserves more backing because the more we back it the more they give us and the more they give us the faster we can explore the WHOLE desired map!

You will find some content, locations are improving with with updates bi-monthly or so. Quarterly now annual update being usually a wipe with not a lot added set pieces and such, but the foundations of the game are being shifted. I wouldn't mind if the developer took more risks to progress faster.

PvP my limited experience has like many other games polarized to hate or friends only group vs matches. Any group of modest skill tend to roll over single players. Base raiding is a new dynamic here worthy of inspecting.

There are no monsters, no zombies, not even a bird. Just heavily armed npc's with deadshot aimbot that can shoot you between the eyes before you even have a chance to know they exist.

Game is online only, no local play or solo available, forcing you to rely on server halfway around the world.
Game is based off looting and crafting but offers no loot and has the most barebones crafting system possible.

You spawn in with nothing but a knife in a world populated by heavily armed npc's.

Updates are few and far between, but seem to mostly be empty promises. Dev's have talked about the same piece of content for over a year but have yet to deliver.

eu como um amante de jogos de sobrevivência, após ter visto esse jogo eu comprei por que gostaria de dar mais visibilidade ao gênero de sobrevivência


sobre o jogo: um jogo incrível, com altíssimo potêncial, com uma experiência imersiva com gráficos excelentes 

agora a parte que mais me revoltou e que me fez tomar medidas judiciais: após eu ficar um tempo sem jogar, decidi reinstalar e jogar novamente tendo em vista que agora possuo um pc melhor para usufruir melhor do game. após alguns minutos de jogatina, fui entrar em uma casa para lotear, porém ao abrir a porta meu personagem bugou na porta, tentei sair de todo jeito mas não deu certo. pedi ajuda aos jogadores e eles me recomendaram a sair do servidor e entrar, após esperar os 30 segundos e voltar minha conta foi banida, de início acreditei ter sido só um bug e solicitei para tirarem meu ban pois eu nunca usei hack na minha vida, após isso, recebi um email da EASYCHEAT dizendo que eles tinham PROVAS!!

PROVAS DO QUE? DA MENTIRA DELES?
EMPRESA INCOMPETENTE QUE BANIU UM JOGADOR INJUSTAMENTE POR CAUSA DO JOGO PODRE E BUGADO!
me as a lover of survival games, after seeing this game I bought it because I would like to give more visibility to the survival genre


about the game: an amazing game, with very high potential, with an immersive experience with excellent graphics

Now the part that most disgusted me and made me take legal action: after spending some time without playing, I decided to reinstall and play again, considering that I now have a better PC to enjoy the game better. After a few minutes of playing, I went into a house to do lots, but when I opened the door my character got stuck in the door, I tried to leave anyway but it didn't work. I asked the players for help and they recommended me to leave the server and enter, after waiting for 30 seconds and returning my account was banned, at first I believed it was just a bug and I asked them to remove my ban because I never used a hack in my life, after that i got an email from EASYCHEAT saying they had PROOF!!

reduce leave server timer for those who are trying to find a public server that is right for them

Remove enemies around the player so they are not immediately killed and lose all the items they gained from the last session

im not sure what changed with the ai enemies jumping around everywhere but it is really frustrating when youre picking them of from a distance from behind a rock at a level 1 mission while using high tier weapons and they snipe a head shot from 200 meters with a pistol (this actually happened)

add LITERALLY ANYTHING to make it just the slightest bit more interesting to just explore other wise its a hiking simulator broken up once in a while with some escape from tarkov action

let the player zoom in closer on the map if all the icons are taking up so much room and covering each other

fix the weapons interactions with static objects like windows and railing

the amount you lean over should be increased so that your poking your head out from cover not poking your head out from being half way behind cover

add a third safe zone of the far right side of the map because that area is totally useless otherwise

allow exploration of larger buildings (maybe add a single city thats a really high level area for very geared players to explore) as adding verticallity to the game is something it could benefit from

overall the experience with the game is good but even after a short time playing the game i had taken full notice of each of these problems multiple times during my most recent play through after not having picked up the game in quite a while and while im sure that the devs have good reason for the slower pace at this point there really should be more added in than just ducks and its is for those reasons that i cannot recommend the game in its current state but should it ever reveive a full release i look forward to seeing what it will look like in its final form

Deutsch :)

Also vorab erst mal was positives. Es gibt eine Entenpfeife das ist das geilste in dem Spiel :p 
Negativ ist allerdings man kann Enten töten -.-

nein mal ehrlich jetzt... Ja das Spiel ist im Earlyaccess aber das nun auch schon fast 3 Jahre.
Könnte man eine neutrale Rezension auswählen dann würde ich das machen. 

Ich fange mal mit dem positiven an.

Das Bauen:
Also vom Baulimit her reicht es vollkommen aus um eine gute und sichere Base zu bauen.

Die Waffen:
Es gibt eine große Auswahl an Waffen.Es gibt ein paar Nahkampfwaffen und jede menge MP's, Sniper oder MG's.

Das überleben:
Es ist eigentlich recht einfach. Man findet in jeder Stadt ein paar Medis, Essen/Trinken, Waffen und genug Munition.
Ihr könnt euch auch ein Funkgerät bauen das euch vor NPCs warnt.

Die Missionen:
Sind von leicht bis episch eigentlich gut unterteilt. Die Bots sind auch nicht ganz auf den Kopf gefallen und flankieren.
Es gibt auch immer mal wieder einen Frachtabwurf in dem Waffen usw zu finden sind.

Das Handeln:
Es gibt Safezones und weitere Händler auf der Map bei denen man gut Kohle verdienen kann um sich neue Sachen/Ausrüstung/Waffen zu kaufen.

Umgebung/Grafik:
Es gibt genug Städte/Dörfer zum looten. Die Grafik ist auch sehr gut.


Ab und an kommen mal ein paar Updates wie die große Bunkeranlage die echt anspruchsvoll sein kann.


So nun das Negative...

In der heutigen Zeit sollte es möglich sein sich auf die Straße zu kleben um den Konvoi aufzuhalten :p

ne mal ehrlich...

- Die Waffen können ab 75% klemmen
- Es kommt leider zu oft vor das man beim laufen einfach mit einem Fehler gekickt wird
- Es gibt nach jedem großen Update einen Wipe (bei manchen Servern auch nach kleineren Updates)
- Beim Snipen kann er für genau 2 Sek die Luft anhalten... für 2 Sekunden...
- Eine Base knacken geht eigentlich nur dann wenn man den Besitzer gekillt hat und er dann noch
  eine Hundemarke fallen lässt... Ansonsten kann man die Kisten nur sprengen und bekommt den loot nicht.
- Die Bots sehen einen durch Büsche usw und killen einen dann mit einem Schuss
- Die Kleidung/Rüstung zeigen keine Stats wie zb Verteidigung usw an.Man kann lediglich am Verkaufspreis 
   sehen
  ob ein Rüstungsteil besser ist.
- Die Schnellreise ist einfach viel zu teuer. 3 Hundemarken also man muss eine Epische Mission fertig 
   machen
- Kisten in der Base verschwinden nach 7 Tagen wenn man sie nicht nutzt
- Hundemarken sind zu selten. Je nach Mission bekommt man 1-3 Stück
- Es gibt keine Fahrzeuge
- Man kann zwar schwimmen aber nicht tauchen. Also ist man ein leichtes Ziel im Wasser
- Es gibt noch einige Soundfehler. Man hört dann zb einfach mal einen Fluss oder ähnliches
- Bäume oder der Richtungsfinder spiegeln sich im Meer
- Beim Base bauen sind die Kisten auf 6 Stück begrenzt egal wie viele Spieler in einer Base angemeldet sind
- Das Spiel ruckelt ab und zu.
- Die Horde an Fliegen über einer Leiche... Ja wenn man direkt an einer Mission steht sind die doch sehr 
   laut^^
- Missionen verschwinden wenn man sie nicht im direkten Gebiet macht sondern mit etwas Abstand
- Die Waffe zieht einfach beim feuern hoch wenn man zu nah an der Wand steht
- Man kann sich nicht hinlegen was den Ghillie Suit etwas unnötig macht

Ich hoffe ich konnte dem ein oder anderen eine Hilfe sein zwecks dem kauf des Spiels :)

English

So first something positive. There is a duck whistle that's the coolest thing in the game :p
On the negative side, you can kill ducks -.-

no, let's be honest now... Yes, the game is in early access, but it's been almost 3 years now.
It just doesn't happen... Updates are announced and then only installed after months... There are fewer and fewer servers... Players aren't getting any more either...
If you get the game for a euro then buy it, otherwise you'd rather invest your money in another game

I'll start with the positive.

Building:
So from the construction limit it is completely sufficient to build a good and safe base.

The weapons:
There is a wide range of weapons. There are a few melee weapons and lots of MP's, snipers or machine guns.

Surviving:
It's actually quite simple. You can find some meds, food/drink, weapons and enough ammo in every town.
You can also build a radio that warns you of NPCs.

The missions:
Are actually well divided from easy to epic. The bots aren't completely stupid either and are flanking.
There is also a cargo drop from time to time in which weapons etc. can be found.

The Trade:
There are safe zones and other dealers on the map where you can earn good money to buy new things/equipment/weapons.

Environment/Graphics:
There are enough towns/villages to loot. The graphics are also very good.


From time to time there are a few updates such as the large bunker system which can be really demanding.


Now for the negative...

In this day and age it should be possible to stick yourself on the road to stop the convoy :p

no honestly...

- The weapons can jam from 75%
- Unfortunately, it happens too often that you are simply kicked with an error while running
- There is a wipe after every major update (on some servers also after smaller updates)
- When sniping, he can hold his breath for exactly 2 seconds... for 2 seconds...
- Cracking a base is only possible if you have killed the owner and then he still has it
  drops a dog tag... Otherwise you can only blow up the crates and don't get the loot.
- The bots will see you through bushes etc and then kill you with one shot
- The clothes/armor do not show any stats such as defense etc. You can only look at the selling price
   see
  if a piece of armor is better.
- Fast travel is just way too expensive. 3 dog tags so you have to complete an epic mission
   do
- Crates in the base disappear after 7 days if you don't use them
- Dog tags are too rare. Depending on the mission you get 1-3 pieces
- There are no vehicles
- You can swim but not dive. So you're an easy target in the water
- There are still some sound bugs. You just hear a river or something like that
- Trees or the direction finder are reflected in the sea
- When building a base, the boxes are limited to 6 pieces, no matter how many players are registered in a base
- The game stutters from time to time.
- The horde of flies over a corpse... Yes, if you are directly on a mission, they are very
   loud^^
- Missions disappear if you don't do them in the direct area but at a distance
- The weapon simply pulls up when firing if you stand too close to the wall
- You can't lie down, making the ghillie suit a bit unnecessary

Unfortunately that""s where the good stuff ends. The Dev's have made no real progress towards what they stated they wanted the final product to be, there is barely any structure to the world. The Game has been on steam for 3 years now and can barely call itself a competitor in the genre. There is no tangible endgame or anything to grind for as you can acquire any item in the game within a few hour of playtime, the only items that require you to put in time and genuine effort to get are just weapons and gear with camo. The updates are so far and few in between that you'll play for maybe a week before going on a six month hiatus. Only a few of the maps poi's have real cover and the base building is a lesser (although wonderfully less complicated) version of DayZ's. My final complaint in this overly long rage review is with the enemy AI. There is no in game function to tell the AI when they've lost line of sight on a player through something that the player themselves can not see through (I.E. Bushes, shrubbery, and at at night with how dark this game gets.) The AI all have the same accuracy at all levels of difficulty, a simple bandit with a low tier pistol will hit the same amount of shots as an epic difficulty soldier will with a Ar4 (M4) at the same range of 350M, 7 out of 10 shots will hit you on average if you stand still in the middle of a field. They also have ridiculous health with no body armor whatsoever and as soon as one sees you they all be line for you like zombies in WWZ. The AI are supposed to be half of the games combat and way to get loot and they are unbearable to fight.       TLDR: Massive Update gaps, very buggy, very short grind and hellish AI combat after 3 years of development",1680621010,1680621010,False,5,0,0.504940032958984375,1,True,False,True

It's a far more simplified game than either of those two, which to me was refreshing and lots of fun to play. The game runs well (mostly) for still being under development. There is plenty of room to expand the map, content, and features but very fun to play in its current state. I got this on sale and quickly put 60+ hours into it, then went back for the Supporter Pack which expands your storage space and adds a few more items to your respawn kit...a great value for what I spent.Currently there is plenty of map and POI's to explore, loot, and conquer. I played mostly on a PVE server against the AI, which come in different levels of difficulty from easy up to epic. I found it challenging, but not overwhelming. The player community has been great and helpful teaching me the game. They even helped rescue me when I got in over my head at a Hard mission site...probably not what happens on a PVP server lol.In summary, this is more of a gun action game than a survival game, but has elements of survival & base building. There are NPC traders to sell extra loot and store some items like Tarkov, but the gameplay feels more like DayZ running through forests and fields to loot or get into gunfights in villages and military bases. The user interface (UI) is very similar to DayZ and Tarkov, and was easy for me to figure out quickly. I ended up rebinding a few commands, like the in-game chat button, but overall it's very familiar to me.

In terms of gameplay, Deadside offers a unique blend of survival, PvP, and PvE elements. Players can choose to play solo or in groups, and must work together to build bases, craft weapons, and gather resources to survive. The game also features a robust loot system, with various types of gear and weapons that can be found throughout the world.

One of the strengths of Deadside is its emphasis on realism. The game features realistic ballistics, damage models, and environmental effects that make combat feel visceral and intense. The game also has a strong emphasis on tactical gameplay, with players needing to carefully plan their movements and coordinate with their teammates to stay alive.

However, Deadside is not without its issues. The game is still in early access, and as such, it can be buggy and prone to crashes. The game's UI and controls can also be clunky and unintuitive at times, making it difficult for new players to get started.

Overall, Deadside is a solid survival game that offers a unique blend of PvP and PvE elements. While it has its share of issues, it's still an enjoyable game that's worth checking out for fans of the genre.",1588016816,1680141330,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

One of the major downsides is that there are no vehicles available, which makes exploring the large map feel like a chore. Additionally, the game is still in early access, so there are some bugs and glitches that need to be ironed out.

However, I am willing to give it another chance in the future because I love this genre. I understand that the devs are actively working on improving the game, and I hope to see more content and features added soon.

Pros:

+ Performance (runs super well and smoothly, 120+fps on my RTX 2060 SUPER)

+ PVP mechanics (easy to find fights/get into fights, TTK is fast and deadly)
+ No OFFLINE raiding (personally a fan of this, the way they did it you can only online raid)
+ Plenty of cool + modded communities (there's a range of servers from vanilla pve to modded pvp)

Cons:

- AI (they are pretty dumb and simultaneously cracked AF, being stupid accurate and deadly at times, able to see you through bushes, tall grass ect...)
- Lack of transport options = a good chunk of running (Only 3 ways of getting around the map currently; running, killing yourself and respawning, using the overpriced tunnel system to fast travel to the other safezone)

The huge map makes it exhausting  to traverse the entire way. This will be added in the new update (which does not have a release date, was announced Q4 2022)
-AI
AI basically have aimbot. Its so frustrating when I run i get shot every time and die. Also the AI like to do a 180 if you are in 100 feet of them and shoot you.
-Water + Food
On the official servers, food is impossible to find. Water needs to be revamped so you can get water from lakes.
-Devs

Ich wurde aus der Deadside-Community gesperrt, weil sie mich beschuldigen, Cheats zu vermarkten, was überhaupt nicht der Fall ist. Der Name des Anklägers ist Damien. Ich bin gegen jeglichen Betrug in Computerspielen, was ich auch in meinem Youtube-Video deutlich gemacht habe. Die Sprache des Videos ist auf Englisch. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtbwFNeLnpg&ab_channel=vollindiemoehre

Ich denke, dass einige FPS-Spiele-Entwickler Geld für den Verkauf von Cheats verdienen, also wollen sie nicht, dass das Thema Cheats zu weit an die Öffentlichkeit gelangt, um nicht für Unruhe innerhalb der Community Ihres Spiels zu sorgen. Ich kann neuen Spielern empfehlen, nicht auf dem offiziellen Europa-Server 220 FP only zu spielen, da es dort viele Cheater gibt. Es ist eine Gruppe von Cheatern, die sich vermutlich abwechseln mit dem cheaten. Außerdem sollte man als Beweis dafür, dass man von einem Cheater getötet wurde, sein Gameplay aufzeichnen und es anschließend melden, was aber mit einem zeitlichen Aufwand verknüpft ist. Außerdem brauchen die Entwickler und EAC lange, um Spieler zu bannen, wenn sie den wirklich gebannt werden auf den offiziellen Servern. In meinem Fall leider nicht. Einem Cheater ist nichts passiert, nachdem ich ihn bei devs (lucas) und EAC gemeldet habe. Laut der EAC-Website dauerte es 3-14 Tage, um das Steam Profil zu analysieren. Es gibt keine Ingame Funktion, um verdächtige Spieler zu melden, was ziemlich schlecht ist. Auf privaten Servern, sieht die ganze Sache wiederum anders aus (aktive Admins), weshalb ich empfehle auf privaten Servern zu spielen. Es gibt auch Spieler, die mehr als ein Steam-Konto haben und sich damit auf einem Server anmelden und dies zu ihrem Vorteil nutzen (verschiedene Spawn Möglichkeiten). Manchmal bringen sich die Cheater gegenseitig um, damit Sie ihr KD-Verhältnis verringern, um nicht zu verdächtig zu werden und das Anti-Cheat-Programm sie nicht als Cheater registrieren kann.

In diesem Video seht ihr wie ich von den Devs aus der Community gebannt wurde und wie mit anderen Spielern umgegangen wird, die eigentlich nur Gutes im Sinne haben.

Wichtig: Auf den Spints nicht aus den Tradern ausloggen, dadurch rückt man einen Raum nach oben und beim nächsten Login kommt man ohne Suizid nicht mehr raus, man ist also fast gefangen. Das war sehr ärgerlich für einen Freund, da die gesamte Ausrüstung verloren ging. Die Hitbox funktioniert meiner Meinung nach gut - das DevTeam hat sich nach einer Weile verbessert. Außerdem befinden sich die Bots während Missionen meist an der gleichen Stelle, dies müsste mit mehr zufälligen Spawns geändert werden. Ansonsten fühlt sich das Spiel flüssig an. Die Grafik ist okay und wurde mit dem Update 0.2.0 verbessert. Der Militärbunker sieht schön aus, aber leider fällt es mir schwer mit 50 fps zu spielen. Dies sollte angepasst werden.

Gun-play: I have played for around 10 hours now, and I do enjoy the gun-play. I feel as if there is an ok amount of variety currently, but I do believe more weapons/attachments/etc need to be added in order to make this feel fully fleshed out. The actual shooting sounds great, and there have been multiple instances where I have been startled being shot at as I trudged along through the woods looking for more loot to sell. I think shooting is impactful, and leaves me satisfied as I ambush bots around the world, but I also feel as if the lack of variety hinders my feeling of excitement or long-term progression.

Armor/Clothing: I find the aesthetic of the clothing and armor fitting. This point will boil down basically to the same thing as weapons - there just needs to be more variety. Currently, there are three utility vests (vests which provides inventory but no defensive value) and four different armored vests (one that provides inventory as well as a defensive value, while the other three are strictly used as armor). In my 10 hours of gameplay, I have seen them all. Maybe I am being nit-picky, but I do believe to extend the longevity of this games life, it should have more armor variations.

AI: This is an interesting one. The AI in the game has really good aim, but lack the ability to utilize any form of cover. The AI also does not use any form of higher level tactics. This becomes a problem, in my experience, specifically playing solo. As a solo player, if I had planned on completing missions or clearing an AI populated area, I would find myself shooting the first bot from afar, backing up, and then waiting for the rest of the AI to swarm me one by one. This results in repetitive solo fights, as the AI simply charges you while having no other recourse. If a player has little armor, the fact that the AI constantly runs towards you, plus having their above average aim, makes this strategy the most practical yet least enjoyable. As I played I had partied with another random individual in the lobby and we did missions together. This was the most enjoyable period of gameplay I experienced. Even though the AI would charge one of us directly, the other would have a chance to take a shot without being directly assaulted. I believe the solo experience fighting bots is completely different than fighting with partied, and leaves me frustrated some of the time.

Bugs: During my time spent playing I only witnessed a single bug, but in the correct circumstances, it could be devastating. While I had partied with another individual, they had died, and upon relocating their body and attempting to retrieve their loot, they couldn't. I don't remember explicitly what the error said, but it boiled down to ""You cannot access this container at this time."" For a game where the progression of gear is a main point of gameplay, this would be extremely frustrating. You were shot by bots after grinding for however long in order to obtain high level gear, respawn and run *all the way* back to your body to be told you can't have your stuff. Luckily someone in the lobby gave them some replacement gear, but if that wasn't the case, and I was in their shoes, I probably would have stopped playing right there.

Building: In my short time of gameplay, I actually have not attempted building a base on any server, and plan to do so in the upcoming days. At that time, I would like to update my review to better reflect my opinion on this subject. From what I've heard from active players is that it takes an extremely long time, but I would like to get a first hand account.

Development: Looking at the development of this game, mainly, I have positive feelings. Updates are being pushed out at what I would consider, a pretty fast rate. And that is fantastic, but I do have one minor grievance. Vehicles had been announced with their upcoming update of 0.5, with the sneak peak of hoverboats. I have faith in the devs of this game, as they have been seemingly hard at work, but I do hope that more vehicles are added besides hoverboats. The majority of my time was spent running from point A to B. If any form of land vehicle is added, even with the caveat that they are hard to obtain, I would be happy. This would help extend the enjoyable grind of the game, while also minimizing, what I found to be, one of the least enjoyable aspects of gameplay. I do believe that land vehicles will be added, but they have not been shown, and that leaves me slightly worried. Considering I spend way more time running than swimming, the fact they teased hoverboats but not land vehicles leaves me slightly confused, but this could be written away as them building hype for the map extension. (If they add land vehicles, I will most likely revise parts of this section)

Overall, I enjoy this game. The gunfights, looting, community is all enjoyable. I do get frustrated at the amazing aim of AI, but tend to get past this fact by putting my focus on upgrading my gear. I think with the amount of updates the game is receiving, it has the possibility to be a great game. Some bug fixes here, some more content there. In its current state, it is pretty bare bones, and considering the initial release date was April of 2020, there should be higher quality content in the current version of the game. But with the active updates, I think its safe to presume this game will continue to be developed into something great. I recommend it, but with the warning of bugs and the obvious statement: it is early access still

TLDR
AI is whack sometimes, shallow progression, gunplay is good, some bugs which could be a deal breaker if you are worried about losing hours of grinding, but the devs are seemingly lively and active, and whats here is already good.

I don't know who this game is for, I would assume EFT or Rust fans looking for something similar but different. Most of the time I found myself wondering why I wasnt playing Tarkov instead, as the FPS view is very clearly inspired by that game. The PVP was fun and the skill level seems pretty low (I've only lost a fight twice in 13h and it was by AR-4 after I killed the first teammate). 

I would recommend against buying this if you don't own EFT, DayZ or Rust. Those 3 games offer more diverse and complete experiences with larger playerbases. Other than that, the only reason I can see for getting Deadside would be a monetary one. It's cheap (and it's evident by the fact that the main playerbase speaks russian or spanish).

i see you pushing updates to the server files almost everyday last one being 12 hours ago.
i made my review in early 2021
its now literally 2023 this is a joke

the worst part about this is this game could have been in mine and my friends rotation for the last 2 years but instead you wanted to sell a partnership with the worst hosting company in the world you value your own players so little that you need to nickle and dime them over a server lmao


deleting criticism because it hurts your feelings is not ok and i really hope valve does something about this 


small edit i haven't played this game in 2 years i have however looked threw some community posts and noticed peoples issues 
-still massive cheating issue
-devs ban or remove posts that criticize them
-no updates in over 2 years
-no server files
-full of bugs 
-ai is horrible
-no vehicles // i had to do a double take no vehicles in a game like this? lmao what 
-devs cashed out on tinybuild and now do next to nothing 
-cant go prone still 

after reading threw about 100 reviews my god how this has any players is beyond me 

original review below 



tldr game okish g-portal hosting bad

Just for the fact you have the audacity to force people to use a garbage hosting service like g-portal to host a server and tweak settings this game will die. and is dying. 
you need to release the damn server files asap. no game that has done this sort of practice has EVER lasted. 
not to mention even when i say oh well ill spend the money the ONLY SERVER near me is ""sold out"" 

please for the love of god. treat your players with respect and release server hosting files. you clearly have them. its clearly unreal 4 its not hard to make them. stop acting like goofs.

since everyone thinks i hate the game. i don't. 
i think its an alright survival game with a much faster pace. 
my issue is in the fact that companies think its ok to nickel and dime players after release or during early access in this case, i bought an online survival game. if you only wanna allow only ""OFFICIAL SERVERS"" sure ill know that going in. and i wont buy it. but allowing user hosted servers but only allowing ONE server host and not even releasing files for it? why? the only thing i can logically think of is drm. even then, hurting the players to stop the pirates is not the way.


the game also seems to have a cheater issue. for that i'd normally recommend private servers with strict whitelisting / apply / tools to prevent it but this game lacks any of that. so yeah. if cheaters get to bad just play pve i guess. its kinda crap.",1611125398,1678124512,False,300,26,0.822331011295318604,12,True,False,True

This game is as DEAD as the first four letters in the name. Boring, no story, no vehicles on land, so so so embarrassing.

The dev team are morons, tried to partner but partnered with more morons. Pumping out garbage guns and no content of any value. They have bad ratings now and deserve to fail.

You deserve the insults you are getting, you are absolute failures. It's even sadder to block someone because your home country doesn't give you the balls to handle free speech. Go enjoy your goats and dictatorship and give up on video games, just commit insurance fraud like a good russian. 

TL;DR: Game is trash, devs are pansies, pass on this. save your money. Oh, and buy American.


Pre-year-or-more Review: slow development on a good platform, should open ability for modders to work with their hired team to accelerate growth and options. 

dev team is doing an ok job, but hold out for long term for it to likely grow a bit bigger once adoption is there.

THE GOOD

Open world, FPP or TPP, Heavily focused on PVP with ALOT of PVE elements. 
Everyone has a map, Safe zones, towns, events, missions, everything is clearly marked. 
Every town is a re spawn point! (not random) 
The map is generally smaller than DAYZ, meaning  if you die its a maybe a 600m run to your body which only takes a couple minutes to run that distance. 
Survival elements exist, food and water consumption, as well as hunting for food. 
Loot (weapons) much easier to find, maybe a couple minutes looting and you'll have a pistol or shotgun.
Excellent ragdoll physics, and hits on people are clearly visible with ""pink mist"" 
Traders exist in safe zones, and offer storage until you have a base. (good for new players)
A Fast travel system, via rail cart (costs dogtags as payment to use it)
A party system exists, meaning you can team up with friends, and easily see them on your HUD, As well as custom markers. 
Base Building! pretty easily done, without a terrible grind, most items are buyable from safezone traders to construct a base. 

THE BAD

No Prone position, all we can do is either crouch or stand.
Food as in finding items to eat, seems to be scarce. you can hunt for food but that requires time, and crafting or finding a campfire to cook it. 
The holding breath system seems a little wonky, its kinda hard to tell when you are and when you arnt doing it anymore. and it seems to only last maybe a second or so, before its so unstable you couldn't dream of hitting anything. 
Needs more interesting POI's there is definitely a lot to explore on the map, and it's filled with a lot more than i expected, but some towns are maybe a group of 2 or 3 buildings.
Placing a land claim sign, is well difficult.....prepare to run around with it out like a madman, until it turns green and will allow you to place it. (took me an hour) 
Updates, as of recently the devs seem to behind with the road map for 2022. the end of 2022, was suppose to see vehicles added, and currently is about 2 or 3 months behind what we were originally told. (and apparantly will be added, when its added.....)

All in all this game has a TON of potential and plays like the modded DAYZ server or ARMA exiles server youve always dreamed of finding with the right mods.

First up: Body poofing and losing loot

This is 6 FUCKING times now that I have had my body and all the loot ive worked for VANISH or lost due to game crashes, glitchy mechanics of BS within the game.  390 hours of game time, that is an average of 65 hours per time I lose my body and all my loot.  At this point, this game can fuck off and die with this shit.  Why bother playing a game where at any moment, out of the blue, all your game progress can be wiped, not by way of you losing it, but by way of the game glitching it out of existance.  I used to think this game ran well to....no, it runs like shit apparently.  It crashes frequently and out of the blue.  

2: The AI

The AI are bullshit, basic PVP Cheaters stuck in the form of an Artificial intelligence.  Their pathing is trash, all they do is yolo straight at you, killing you with their wall hacks, aim bot and ability to see perfectly fine through 100 layers of trees, or even in pitch black darkness...

-Wallhacks: They will see you and shoot you with precision through dense foliage, bushes, trees and can even track you through a building's wall.  Often times you will start hearing gun fire and taking hits, looking around for the target, but dont realize hes behind 10 layers of dense vegetation that not even the most trained and observant eye could ever have a hope in hell of seeing.  

-Aim Bots: While the regular Scavs are not so bad, in fact, they are fair enough and in some cases, id say could use a very mild accuracy buff, the military guys(namely Helicopter crash crew) and the convoy LMG Boss are complete bullshit.  The convoy boss will sit back there at 250-300+ meters and spam his LMG at you, if he hits you with even 1 bullet, you immediately just DIE.  No chance to move, cover, duck, heal, nothing, just DEAD.......  The Helicopter crash crew are less obnoxious, but still have RPKs and Rifles that they are way to accurate with.  If your unable to snipe them all dead before they get within range and start firing, your fubar.  You absolutely cant out shoot them.  They take many, many, many bullets to kill while you take maybe 3.  You combine it with the wack ass weapon sway we have in this game and getting those follow up shots to kill these guys is nigh on impossible. 

-Their health:  While you the player will take maybe 2-3 hits at most, these AI, even the normal scav can eat upwards of 5-8 hits before dying.  Ive had to put no less than 3 SVD rounds into a single normal SCAV on numerous occasions(Confirmation of my hit being the red blood splat on hit).  

3: Gun play

While ive seen many tout it as really good, id say its good, but has some wack ass issues that are compounded by other things.  First up the weapon sway.  While sure, its realistic, you dont just hold your gun rock steady, this does not seem to be applied to the AI, who, while your trying to get your gun back on target while its wobbling around, the AI are just plugging you in the face.  Then you have extremely high bullet spread even on single shots.  So, you take weapon sway, high bullet spread and fairly severe recoil, it makes getting follow up shots on enemies almost impossible.  All the while guys like the Convoy boss and heli crew are just accurately machine gunning you from 150+ meters out.  Next, lets t alk about that whole mechanic where you put your gun up when your near cover.  Ok, yeah, it makes sense, you cant put a gun through a tree, but it makes using cover insanely annoying.  Get near a good tree and try to lean around it, but oh,your 1 foot step to close and now you cant zoom in, So now you get to play footsies with the tree trying to both stay covered from the enemy firing at you and find a position where you can actually lean out to shoot.......
Gun fire retort and muzzle flashes:  This game is SORELY lacking in this department.  The gun fire sounds are way off.  It will sound like the guy is 100-200m away when hes standing right beside you.  There is very little differentiation in distance inthis game.  Makes finding enemies who are firing through dense vegetation impossible.  Ive literally had a guy who managed to, somehow, sneak across an open field and get right beside me, yet the gun fire(as well as my lack of taking any hits), led me to believe he was still 100+ meters away out in that field....he was right behind me......like wow.  

Sooo, in short, the gun play while not flatly terrible just has many mechanics that combine to make it really quite clunky, especially when compared to the cheats and other AI.....shall we say, enhancements.....

4: The inventory

While I get they dont want you walking around with 20 tons of loot all at once, there are things they could definitely do to improve the overall situation and make it a little less clunky to use.  First thing they could do is let you store more guns in your damn bags.  Your unable to store rifles in your bag.  Your also unable to store attachments ON guns and put them in your bags or bank.  This results in your already very limited stash and bag space being sucked up by multiple attachments.  Then, if you want to say, swap an SVD for an M4, you first have to take the 2 attachments off your SVD, then DROP the SVD on the floor, because you cant take it with you.  Then, equip the M4, then put all the attachments on that.  Its tedious and far more time consuming than it could be. 

The same is true of the actual inventory space.  Unlike almost every other MMO/RPG type game ive played, you can simply drag and drop to swap items.  Say your wearing a heavy assault vest, but want to wear a vest with more space.  You first have to take off the heavy vest, put it in an empty spot in the inventory(hard to do when your already loaded down with loot), then put the other vest ON, then put the heavy vest in the inventory.  Its just really clunky, slow and tedious.  This is the only game ive seen do it this way.....

Like I said, game has solid promise and its got a good foundation, but it needs alot of polish and refinement.  LOsing a weeks worth of top tier gear,(matching Flecktarn facemask, pants, shirt, STALKER backpack, my compensator, a camod M99 out of the bunker, keys for the bunker, among other things), has just absolutely killed the game for me.  That they have that kind of system where you can sol easily lose everything you've worked for is just a solid NO in my book.  FIx this game, make it more intuitive, less clunky, get rid of the AI cheats and you've got yourself a solid game.",1632168330,1676335412,False,8,1,0.602002203464508057,1,True,False,True

Game is good, lacking updates regulary.

If they don't like you or you get on the wrong side with them, for ex. killing them, they will try to get you banned. 
Got banned from Lead community manager with accusation of cheating, he will not talk over it and is refusing to tell or show the alleged proof.
I have never been cheating nor have i lend out my main account. 
Bottomless accusation from the private tester's, who in reality is master of exploits with spread sheets of all the bugs in game who they will use until someone else use it against them, then they will report it in so they look good. 

This game have/had so much potensial but the devs is killing it of on there own by banning legit players with over 2,5k spread over a few account.

They'll lock on and shoot through bushes, trees, etc, also when they lock on they don't unlock on they will pre-aim you through walls. Now this may not be a huge deal but getting pre-aimed point blank with a mosin tends to have its effects. There's also the fact when playing your cursor for whatever reason doesn't lock on to the center of your screen so god forbid you have another monitor. The game is fun especially with friends. But not worth the price tag. Best part is I doubt the AI will get fixed most the community says ""The AI is fine"" ""You just need to get better"" The AI is way too difficult and most likely a huge turn off to a new player. Also the nights are unnecessary dark and last too long. Lastly 90% of the gameplay is gonna be a running simulator since there is no vehicles to get around. So if you like unnecessarily difficult AI, dark nights that last for what feels like an hour, accidentally dragging your cursor off your screen, and running across the map just to play the game.

Edit* so i tried to play this game again since steam refuses to refund my money. huge dick move on their part as they are selling a game that is unplayable. this game is trash and steam has no business offering this to people for money, this game wouldnt be worth it if it was free.

The Trader is a little iffy, if more was added to them, it would be alright but as is certain items cannot be sold (i.e food) and the roaming trader is a decent Idea in concept but needs to be touched up on a bit, bringing all your money to the traveling trader only to find out it's the equipment guy and you need guns or vice versa, gets a bit annoying after a while. The missions are alright, similar to the ones seen in the DayZ mods, but again with the AI, they just tend to be annoying and tedious. The map is beautiful and the ambient sounds are a nice touch but when you can't see the AI doming you with a double barrel from 150ft away through the thick lush boreal forest, it kind've gets a little tedious and repetitive.

The game is really good for the first 10 hours when you have done everything it starts to get boring after that. The game play is good and the graphics are good.

The game needs more content, and when i mean content i don't mean to add duck hunting as more content.

Now that the last patch is live, the game crashes with a fatal error at the start.

A year later and the game is still the same, a survival game with no animals to hunt and eat and a walking simulator because they are incapable of putting one single , simple, working , vehicle. I wont be coming back anytime soon.

I get a lot of random frame dips from around 59/61 to around 48/58 which I just rationalize as map being loaded in.

The previous team, Bad Pixel, developed a visually immaculate third/1st person option shooter survival set in modern post apocalyptic world with real world weaponry and gear. Unfortunately the small dev team (Bad Pixel) couldn't bring their full game to fruition on their own and signed the game over to Tiny Build who promised they shared the common vision and goals as the originators. Since the take over we've seen unpolished mechanics and game play make it's way into game play. For example, an update removed the option to purchase food in the safe zone in lieu of a canteen to assist with hydration, a key feature in survival games. The canteen is a single use item that cannot be filled in any of the bodies of water located on the map. A recoil pattern spray update was also implemented. Has anyone ever heard of a third person shooter with recoil pattern? How would/could this work? While there are many other issues regarding implementations, other pressing issues to discuss exist such as glitches. One of which is a crouch glitch where you crouch and wedge yourself under a overhanging rock or tree branch, log out, log in, and viola, you're now in another part of the map. Another such glitch is when you die from falling, being killed in air, or your body rolls down hill. When this occurs, you cannot loot your body and all those hours of looting are wasted. The last issue at hand is the lack of vehicles. This game is a running simulator so get ready to build up your finger dexterity! The dev team continues to promise the release of vehicles while missing road map release dates time after time with the promise that they're still working on it. Vehicles have actually been down graded to open platform boats and this is somehow supposed to be appeasing. I'm not saying this game is a complete loss but at this rate and with the lack of meaningful updates, it's looking that way. At the end of the day you can always try it out and get a refund.

There's no true objective, there's a very irritating message that pops up on the screen every minute or two letting you know that your mission has failed and a new one has appeared, very limited weapons, 3rd person looks okay but there's no retical if you aim it just goes back first person, bots will shoot you from over 100 km away with a little makarov pistol while hiding in a bush giving you pretty serious damage that takes a while to heal. There is no reward system and all the bots you do manage to kill have zero loot besides their clothes and weapon.

Also the knife you start with only sometimes works. I mean that only occasionally can you even equip the knife in hand and actually swing it, and coincidentally it never works when enemy npcs are nearby.

Pros: 
-Runs extremely smooth on an old pc with limited resources. 
-Graphics are good for early access and game has very little chop.
-Realistic damage. 2 hits and you are done. 12ga early game is a ripper!
-Team play is exciting and communication is essential.
-I personally love the safe zones and trader aspect. 
-Prices of items is steep, as it should be. 
-Loot is pretty available and most items have a use other than just for sale value.
-Map is extremely well thought out and while easy to navigate, has plenty of danger spots and terrain is varied enough to keep the game from suffering the Walking Simulator aspect so many survival games suffer from.
-Health, hunger, and thirst are super simple mechanic and easy to address. Though healing takes some time! shoot, move, medicate, repeat.  
Cons:
-25km/sq seems big, but with more than 10-15 people (50 max per server atm) it gets well chaotic! 
-Base building takes FOREVER to gather enough wood and supplies. It does however force the player to raid towns for nails, tools, and other materials.
-Missions are extremely hard solo. 

Overall i give this game an 8.5/10. It's still early in the dev phase and I see this game easily pulling more casual players from Tarkov, Rust, Miscreated, Scum, and DayZ.  While this game could be a very serious raiding game and pvp, it's simplicity is it's biggest asset. No need to memorize 10,000 different items and their market price etc. Weapons are easily modded and no need for special mounts for EACH weapon. Grab a scope, put it on your 556 bolty and wreak havoc! Missions are extremely fun with a duo or trio but solo ...quite the challenge if you aren't already somewhat Chadded up. I do highly recommend this product WITH the supporter pack as early on...it's almost essential.  My son and I both had the upgrade and still filled our inventory very quickly with bullets, crafting supplies, and construction materials. Despite any of it's downsides, this is probably one of the best and most fun Early access games I have purchased to date.

Update: 450+ hours  -  This game has only gotten better and better. The Devs are super active and responsive to the community and the new weapon sound effects are top notch. The updated building system is much more streamlined and takes much less time to build a base. The map has expended and so much more has been added and vehicles and ANOTHER map addition are being added very shortly, all at ZERO extra cost out of my wallet, aka no paid DLC required. 9/10 and highly recommend.",1597346181,1672620865,True,2,0,0.530685961246490479,0,True,False,True

There is great potential to be the premier go-to that can build on greater modules, designs, blueprints, building partitions, fireplaces and sky lights, and residential concepts.

You won't freeze to death, you won't spend a ton of time searching for food and water, so you get to spend more time doing what you want to do in this game. Shooting people and killing enemies.

The enemy AI in this game are PMC's and Bandit's instead of zombies, which is also a huge plus. First of all, because they can shoot back, and their aim scales to difficulty depending on how well trained they are. Bandits typically can't hit the broadside of a barn, but high armored PMC's can one tap you in the face with a mosin. But you also don't have to worry about some timmy that sucks at every game he plays coming in and third partying you to get a free kill while you are fighting off a hoard of zombies, just to kill you and get an unsupressed pistol with 9 shots in it, because he heard a gunshot from 2 miles away.

The game could use vehicles, but to my understanding that's coming. So, if you want to play a game like Day Z but 1000x better than Day Z, play this game.

After the last patch the game is annoyingly unplayable, with having to eat and drink almost every 30 minutes to sustain yourself. Moreover they removed food from vendors and apparently you got to do duck hunting every day... Better call it 'duck hunting game' now.


2021 Review
For early access it is good and the AI is a formidable opponent. However it has a long way to greatness, as needs more stuff to do and more variety of customization. Frankly after 40h of play there are not so many things to do and missions tend to have a repetitive feeling. If you lose your gear for some reason you are like starting over like any newcomer. A rank system would help, something to distinguish veteran players.",1610301905,1672341936,False,0,0,0.494809657335281372,0,True,False,True

- decent survival mechanics.
- interesting mission area mechanics and dynamic events.
- Weapon/ammo variation available in game is very good.

Cons:
- buttons in game do not line up properly to press correctly.
- AI is either the dumbest in any game, or 2-3 bullet kill LASER you, even if > l l much is barely showing of you, you still get hit. 
- brush is 100% ineffective against AI.
- armor does little to nothing to help you survive, maybe 1 more bullet extra.
- 2x scope has a terrible and unrealistic reticle, as it doesn't even come close to a cross hairs. just a vague open area in the lines.
- sometimes food/water scarcity is too much and not really a lot of opportunities to acquire without a base to cook/get water.
- there is no holding breath for sights/scopes (at least that im aware of) and the scope sways A LOT.
- no real variation in AI weapons, basically the same half a dozen weapon drops, 2 type shotgun, 2 type rifle, 2 type pistol, and 1-2 type smg, MAYBE.
- too many healables take away from water fullness in an already scarce environment.

final assessment- basically only worth maybe 5 dollars, no more than 10, needs a lot of work and things streamlined. kinda clunky in most respects, tries hard with some cool mechanics, but falls short due to ranged weapons being fairly ineffective so a lot of fights are you getting killed in mid-long range fights as due to sway/crummy reticle its hard to make shots connect, or just a shotgun with CQB and cheese any AI that comes around the corner with instant kills. after hours playing, even with a base, the game becomes redundant at best.",1672175735,1672175735,False,28,7,0.601787030696868896,1,True,False,True

This game is my favorite among all those that exist of the same genre (quite similar to stalker). It is hard yes, frustrating yes, but so enjoyable.
It is possible to play fully alone (as I did over +50h) but quite hard when you start and know nothing about game mechanics. The game will punish you if you believe that you're on Call Of Duty and rush like a retard. 

The most enjoyable points : 

* Graphics : quite beautiful BUT don't forget to add dx12 as parameter. It will give you a huge rise of FPS .
* Weapons & customizations : before having all weapons, you will have to play a bit.
* Survival : you can eat & drink like stalker. Building some stuff to cook and the like.
* Frequent updates & devs aware of community.

The most shitty points :

* AI in hard zone & above : they litteraly have an aimbot killing you at 200-300 meters.
* When you die, you need to walk to your stuff and some zones have poor & far respawn points.
* Some zones are so far away from safezones (when you loot good stuff and have 2km to go back, the game evolves to a hiking simulator).

Conclusion : this is not a game everyone will like. You can give it a try at your own risk but don't complain about game's difficulty.

I am not saying it is not a solid game but it is called Early Access for a reason.

My number one gripe is the players themselves.  It is a hardcore survivor PvP so expect death and lots of it. This is what you get but I tried several servers and everyone that had a couple dozen or more players on it had groups patrolling spawn points. 

As a new player more than once I could not make it to the Safe Zone or a few buildings to find a gun for that matter without be hunted down by a group of two or three actual players (not AI which look like players).  When you spawn in you do not have anything of value so to me this is just toxic behaviour that drives away people that would like to give the game a try. This includes me and while from what I experienced it is a great game for the stage of development it is in and has the potential to be a leader in the field but this toxic behaviour has me pausing hitting the Launch button.

The people talking about crashes are too stupid to switch to dx12. Once you run it in dx12 I haven’t had one crash. 

This game deserves a huge player base. Perfect to play with those friends who think DAYZ is too boring and vehicles are about to come out for the game.

Best advice I can give is. Second click clothing and tare it up. 
Clothing on the ground = Tare it up, Clothing on dead NPC = Tare it up, 
Find better clothing than what you have now? = Swap and Tare up the things you were wearing. 
Then when you find alcohol make sterilized bandages from the rags you were collecting.

I also find the best place to live (on a PVE server) is in a bathtub of one of the apartment blocks.
Cans of food and drink spawn all around you. Bad guys spawn on the roof to give you ammo. You are close enough to easy missions and a safezone.

How would you ever know that after barely 30 minutes of gameplay? I'm still in shock Steam haven't implemented a better system for reviews. Shouldn't be possible to make reviews with that little gametime, when you've had ZERO chance to dig deeper into the game.

This game has come a long way from the launch, with regular updates and content being added. Since I started playing they've added way more missions, content, events, AI, vehicles, weapons, attachements, etc and its clear the developers are in it for the long haul. (Compared to other developers.. cough..)

+ PVE/MISSIONS:   Is extremly fun, with a lot of missions with various difficulties and rewards.
+ Building:  Haven't tried too much of it but from what I've seen and heard it's good an being updated regulary.
+ Great developers:  They listen to the feedback given.
+ Updates:  Keep getting content added with almost every update.
+ PVP:  Is extremly fun once engaging with other people.
+ Community: From what I've seen ingame the normy toxicity hasn't reached this game yet. People are very friendly and helpful.
+ Supports official and rented/community servers.
+ VOIP
+ Traders
+ AI:  The game has AI on every map that patrols and defends buildings or zones that are of high loot and ofcourse with the missions and various events.
+ The map is big but in my opinion (compared to some reviews) don't at all feel like its a running simulator compared to other survival games. 


- Does get a bit repetitive after a couple of days of gameplay. But that doesn't mean its a bad game, you just need to figure out what to do once you've achieved the gear that you want etc. Building bases, creating wars with other clans, etc.
- The AI can sometime be a bit buggy and basically aimbot you down through forests where regular players never would see you.
- Wish they'd put more effort into marketing the game. Because it has great potential.
- MORE VEHICLES!! :D  (it's coming)",1670260860,1670260860,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

Primary issues.

1.	The gameplay is buggy and awkward. Some are simple things like glitchy graphics or confusing equipment descriptions (or a total lack of descriptions and instructions for anything). Still, there are programming and stability issues that are horrendous. For example, if you die on a hill and your body ragdolls even an inch from the exact spot of your death, you will not be able to recover the equipment you have been working on and saving for. This would be understandable for an early-release game as it is still being developed, but Steam pages and forums are dedicated to this issue going back over two years, and it is still a problem. The game crashes frequently.

2.	If you thought this game was about monsters, zombies, or anything else in a post-apocalyptic world, you have the same wrong opinion that almost every player I spoke with had. It is technically about the post-apocalyptic world in some undefined eastern European, Russia-like nation, but that is about as generic as it can be. There are no signs of the end of the world or a story to define it. There are just beaten-up buildings and bandits trying to kill you. That is it. Maybe I wasn’t as diligent in my research as I should have been when buying a game called “Deadside” so I assumed that it would have more to do with zombies or monsters or something in this post-apocalyptic world at the very least, not just bandits.

3.	I love that it took some overly complicated parts of a game like Dayz and simplified it for more normal use. Still, it is a rip-off of DayZ using similar assets and everything, but it just doesn’t function properly.

4.	While playing one day, it crashed, as it had been known to do, and I couldn’t rejoin my server. This continued for DAYS; to my knowledge, this official server never returned online. So, I had to start over on a new server because the server just disappeared.

5.	The game can be fun, but with glitches and issues against you already, they updated the AI to become ninjas. When you die, you have a finite amount of time to recover your equipment or lose it. You also have a finite amount of deaths before your body despawns and you lose it. So basically, you will never keep gear because it will be lost due to death or glitches keeping you from recovering it.

TL;DR
	Buy something else or wait until they maybe fix things with 5.0 but don’t expect them to fix the stuff that actually matters.

Came for the PVE experience. Saw it on sale for 10€.

Bots are either braindead or literally godlike aimbot, if you end against AR type of guys, u're dead anyway if you fight or not.

The gunplay is meh, medium to long range fights suck @ss, but close range with a shotgun or SMG is the most enjoyable.
The downside of the gunplay is that your FPS drops significantly so it doesn't feel as good as it should... 

It's a running simulator, at least there is a key to auto-run but still, boring to run for minutes.
Looting can be fun at first, but when u realize how little inventory you got even with some high tier gear, you constantly run to loot and run to sell some stuff and run again for deposing some stuff into your base and then run again and again and again ...

The game needs A LOT of work to be a really enjoyable experience, right now, it is just entertaining for a few hours but not worth it.",1669820706,1669820891,False,1,0,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,True

Things that need fixing :
1) difficulty level needs to be a setting.
2) AI NPCs need to act *real*, not like 13 year old console kiddies who haven't entered puberty yet.  Real combat is not bunny hopping and running back and forth every second.
3) Seriously?  Where is the food and water?  Either get rid of that, or make the food and water more accessible.
4) 1 second breath hold?  That's stupid and unrealistic.  I'm old and I can hold my breath 30 seconds while aiming, from any position.
5) NPC accuracy is unrealistic.
6) I like that you can run forever without having a stamina effect.
7) I don't care about base building, but if I did, I'd want more resources or someway to manipulate the environment to get the resources needed.
8) players should start with more than a knife, because the knife is useless in combat.
9) Maybe save games could be implemented so you don't lose all your progress when you die.

If you've ever played DayZ/SCUM/ArmA Exile/survival base-building game #34678, and cringe at the thought of how crippling emotionally it is when you lose all of your stuff, then this game might be the solution you've been looking for. It definitely was for me.

     Deadside is an open world/basebuilding/survival game that trims all the fat off of the genre and leaves mostly just the fun parts of these games. Most major towns are respawn points, and you can craft and place down respawn beacons(with small limits like no  safezones) for yourself. Weapons are easy to come by. AI is cheesable even solo, and the map is big enough that you aren't getting smoked in the rear constantly by 16 yr old Tanner and his gaggle of fraternity fuckbois. The TTK(time to kill) is very short, almost Tarkov-esque without the non-pen bullet spongyness. A naked freshie with a shotgun can easily solo a 2-man group and even 3-man if they are occupied with mission AI.

     Randomly generated missions keep you on that dopamine drip with ""lootboxes"" that drop good weapons/meds/food/building supplies. AI is laser accurate when they are military bots, but cover and peeking do a really good job of mitigating this. All in all most missions are soloable if you have experience with jiggle peeking and repositioning.

YOU CAN NOT BE RAIDED WHILE OFFLINE (thank God)

     Gone are the days of logging in to an empty base. When players kill you, there is a 20% chance you will drop a ""raid token"". This token will expire and can't be hoarded, but once activated will show the ""general"" location of your base on the map to all players and at that point becomes raidable. The only way to get raided is to die to other players and even then its only a 20% chance each time you die. You can however die, ragequit, and then wake up to an empty base b/c you werent there to defend, when they popped the token. (whoops, happened to me RIP first base)

     Again, this is just DayZ/SCUM, but its actually fun. Downtime spent running and building are greatly minimized to keep you doing the fun stuff. You even get a run speed buff from being above 89 food/water!

     The developers did a really good job of capturing that old ArmA Wasteland feeling, but making it way more accessible to ""gamer dads"" or people who don't want to stare at grass for 3 hours while running somewhere for a can of peaches.

     This game makes open world survival actually fun, and capitalizes on making the player feel good about each gun they pick up, building piece they put down, and kill they bag. Nothing takes extraneous amounts of time. Death isn't a big deal. Hell, even losing your base isnt a big deal b/c you can solo missions with a shotgun that have the best loot as the reward.

     A fun DayZ/SCUM that trims all the ""funk"" from the gameplay model, and focuses on getting the player into whats fun and important. Getting loot and killing players or AI.

CONS
-No zombies (a PRO for me honestly)
-Gunplay can be wonky like holding breath after shift-sprinting too fast will cause you to re-enter ""walk"" 
   mode instead of just ADS'ing like you want it to.
-AI can be bullshit but the harder ones are supposed to be b/c the loot is phenomenal.
-This game is harsh on solos when it comes to PVP, but if you are good at PVP, it can be as much of an 
   adrenaline rush as Tarkov/DayZ fighting and winning against a 2-3 man group.
-I wouldn't say the game ""needs more content"", b/c im having a blast playing it regardless, but it definitely 
   could use more guns/attachments/loot types/points of interest. The PVP is what I stay to play for, but I 
   would love to see a wider variety of tools to kill people and AI with.
-Supporter pack gives skins which sends the wrong message to people. The game doesn't MTX skins at all. 
   The skins in game you can just paint onto your clothes using a workbench and it costs no materials at all, and there are default in-game camos that make more sense and are more concealing than the supporter pack ones.
- The map doesn't let you zoom in far enough, so examining terrain features and building up close on your map is not even possible. Relying on third-party maps is a must if you want to know where the good loot spawns. This should really be addressed by the devs. I should be able to look at the map closely, see a group of buildings that aren't marked as a ""town"" or ""POI"" and realize I've found an unmarked area that might just be ripe for looting. You get robbed of the ability to use these skills by the unzoomable map that lacks alot of terrain detail.


Great game would recommend

7/10, would push Tanner's shit in with my Mosin-Nagant while his homies watch all over again.

Devs should have prioritized vehicles somehow, but they haven't. 

The PVE experience is lacklustre with the same type of missions every single time. Everything else is just a grind. Where are the animals as well? That's missing other than ducks. They didn't even introduce lights or torch + fire for bases. You can only light up campfires if you're cooking.

There is also no real story. Another similar game I used to play had proper animals and vehicles, as well as a story. The only reason why I even play this game is because the gunplay and movement system is a bit better.

-Game looks nice
-Game runs well (for me at least)
-Weapons feel decent
-Base building system is solid and will probably become better in the future
-Events are a fun way to draw players to certain areas for loot
-I haven't seen any cheaters yet

Neutrals:
-Loot is fairly easy to acquire which is a pro and a con because for a game that calls itself hardcore i shouldn't really be finding myself with end game gear in 4-5 hours of playing when i really don't know what i'm doing.

Cons:
-No vehicles as of yet, map is fairly large and will only get bigger and running gets boring fast
-AI is stupid and can be meta gamed fairly easily once you learn how to deal with them, at the same time they are overpowered and will shoot you through bushes, trees, etc and sometimes just absolutely fuck you up, considering they are the main enemy in the world they definitely need to be worked on.
-Game has a very small player base right now, its not hard to find a server with players but at the same time your options are limited, especially if you are from Australia like myself.
-3rd person camera option is a pet peeve for me in these games, you can just play on 1st person camera servers but i don't have the luxury of both that and a solid player count on a server in OCE.

Overall, game is fun, as long as development and becomes more polished i think the game has a chance of success in the open world market.",1608562922,1668751527,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's enough to do and nuanced things to discover that the game will keep you occupied for well worth the current 20$ price tag. Plenty of intense mil-sim like battles between AI and or other Deadsiders. Close quarters fighting in bunkers or well-timed marksman shots at 200m in mountain terrain are very rewarding. Base building is simplistic but deep enough to spend hours crafting a perfect fortress to store your scavenged spoils. Missions keep the game interesting with risk reward choices. Custom camo builds, a very welcome theme to the game keeping a realistic vibe. No hot pink bunny suits with carrot guns hoping through the woods here. Duck hunting! Hunt and scavenge for survival items to stay alive. The dev team genuinely listens to feedback and is engaging with community to make the best game they can.

No game is without fault. Please bear in mind that this game is in early access and many if not all the issues listed below are subject to change. That being said, where this game falls behind is in overall content, stability issues, some bugs, and generally things that come with an early access game. There is a lot to do in the game, but the map is very large. Travel time between events can be very drawn out which can be turn off for those looking for constant action. The AI can feel cheaty sometimes because their accuracy tends to be aim bot level or fresh on the internet noob. Could use general balancing for players’ spawns and default loadout. Many of these issues and more have been discussed by the dev team as in progress work.

Overall, this game is very fun and can only get better as it develops. I have high hopes for this game becoming a common game name to hear in the gaming community.

Dying from dehydration right next to a well that very clearly has water in it, with a backpack full of alcoholic beverages that I can't drink for some reason, and only being 100 feet from a freshwater river.... is pretty bad to say the least. You can literally only drink soda starting off (which is what most players will experience).

Night time is brutally dark, which would be fine if you had any way of countering it at all. You have a lighter which provides a laughably small amount of light and would only give you away anyways. If it's night time and you don't have a base, just log out until morning so you don't go hungry or killed. AI can see fine at night. You cannot and there is nothing you can find or craft to change that to my knowledge. What fun.

I didn't want to complain about the gunfights as I like the realistic, slower fights, but it's an odd choice to have such slow shooting when fighting ai most of the time. It's too much change at once from the normal FPS and makes the gun play boil down to feeling just terrible in comparison to most shooters. Tarkov-style shooting can work in pvp settings. In PvE, it's meh.

The idea of this game isn't terrible but it clearly has such a small dev team behind it that it's hard to pretend there is much real content here. Hopefully over time they'll add enough mechanics to be more interesting.

Until then the shooting is relatively unskilled compared to better shooters, the scavenging is bland, the crafting is simple, and the survival is laughably bad.

TLDR: Game has very little Replayabillity, AI is simple and annoying being either Dumb as Fuck or Botty as Fuck. The Gun Systems are annoying because of the Sway and the PvP is Defined by the M99 as the only gun worth using. 

PvP: The PvP element in this game feels like a game of see someone first and shooting them with your M99 first, The M99 is the primary sniper rifle in the game and can consistently 1 shot any targets at long ranges, this is important due to the ridiculous sway that all guns have, having to put multiple bullets down range becomes exceedingly harder after every shot and the longer you stay scoped, the only other weapon of interest is the UMP which has the most bullet damage of any full auto weapons too, making it the only answer for close quarters.

The Map Is Insanely large and is currently only a fraction of the size of what it's supposed to be, leading to long trips to and from areas, none of which are any different. The only real events in the game are a circle that highlights an area as an event of sorts, basically this spawns a bunch of AI (Which put a pin in that, we'll get to that later) The thing is that almost any one of them are the same. things like Heli Crashes are a bit more interesting in the fact that they can spawn anywhere. The problem is, this is the main gameplay loop between the game past PvP, very little else is available to do in the game. The thing is by having these as the only thing to do it gets very monotonous, even if they change this a bit would be nice and want to compare this to Rust, Rust has several PvE Encounters, With a Cargo shit and Circles the map but ultimately acts as a bunch of AIs, Cargo Rigs that have a bunch of AI, and a crate that calls in a bunch of Super Strong AI and then Launch with a M2 to fight for loot. and also a Heli that roams around the map that spawns occasionally. However I want to point out one thing about all of these above. They are all in support of PvP, Each one includes a PvE Function but afterwards the players need to defend their work, they are designed to support the main system of the game which is PvP. The problem is Deadside can't decide if it wants to be a huge mosh pit of Players or not, most servers can hold around 50, and with the map being so large it's hard for it to work, Cases work in the best way for this whereas events simply announce when they are done. Deadside can't seem to figure out how to add variety to its elements, nor can it decide if it wants those elements to support PvP functions of the game or Not. 

Guns, I'll go ahead and say that i can be fine with an early and basic system for developing a basic frame to get items, i can say that weapons in this game are complete and utter shit, When it comes to aiming there's this huge sway when you aim in for more that 3 seconds, it starts off a little but slowly exaggerates into huge swings, becoming unusable at nearly any range. which is a huge fucking problem when the AI, can Consistently shoot you at range, Scopes on Rifles make Zero fucking sense to use because the sway is massive, the recoil is going to cause this sway to exaggerate more then usual, if you want to run a AR-15 and slap a scope have fun shooting 2 shots, because thats all that you can realistically hit at range. But wait, isn't there a hold breath function, Yes and it's also shit, Its permanently bound to sprinting, meaning that if your are moving congrats your actually going to run instead of aim down sights, whats that your stopping to move to make a shot but your still slightly moving, Wrong your sprinting again. its so fucking annoying and it never feels like it actually helps too. But don't worry even though it's hard for you so use a rifle at long ranges the AI has no Problem perfectly tracing you and spray an ak in burst of 4 to hit you once atleast and can perfectly trace you,

This game simply isnt fun with the AI at the current stand point, They are ethir so little of a threat that you can walk away or so much of one that you cant even run away, i feel like its sometimes impossible to simply take a heli crash from these fucks who are wearing any armor usual with a default Iron AK47 and RPK who can 3 shot me at fucking 200 meters out, yet i struggle to hold a fucking Scar and hit shots consitently with an acog attached to it. It's pointless because the AI is dumber than a brick or Botty as an aimbot. Not to point out but these bots at long range sometimes take more shots that the player does, An RPK can 3 Shot me Wearing the best armor in the game, yet they also take 3 shots wear there fucking fatigues. 

Meds in the game are in abundance and dont do shit, PainKillers and Med sticks are the only good medications in the game and both require you to have Water and Food on hand to heal yourself, Bandages and wrapping exist but are more of a suggestion then anything, they heal minimal amounts over long periods. You can easily get wraps by tearing clothing which is going to be in abundance, and you can easily get the Alcohol to make sterilized rags which are “Better” But wont feel any different, this turns into gunfight with AI you just holding an angle Killing the ones that come through it, though you'll inevitably will get shot, and hope that it's not a mosin because those will one shot you regardless of armor, and then you'll sit in a corner praying that more dont come as you spam your 30 Rags on to your arm and slowly watch the number 30 crawl up to 100, Its meant to make fights tense with AI because you need to get Money to Buy Painkillers or Med Sticks later. But it really just makes fights longer and tedious. In the case of PainKillers you're just going to take 2 to get to max and then shove 3 cokes down your thoughts to make sure that you can take another 2 pain killers laters, it's faster but requires you to have more food which takes up already precious slots in your hotbar. However the cost of them is non-existent as the economy in this game is simple and you can easily rack up several hundreds of thousands of cash. 

All in all the game is fine as an early access, however the problems with me fighting the guns, me sprint when i'm trying to aim a gun, and the AI being able to trace me perfectly through wooded forests and shoot me at long ranges with Irons makes in extremely hard to me to enjoy the game

If you like survival games, but not a fan of when those games that take the survival aspect too far turning it into a chore, this is a good choice.  Think of it more as a shooter with survival elements.  Granted once you get the gameplay loop down, it can get boring, it is still in development after all.  Often referred to as Dayz/Tarkov LITE.  There is base building and a fantastic base raiding system that allows you to log off the game in peace as people can only get a chance to raid your base when you are online.  There are no vehicles on this fairly large map as of yet, but once you get your bearings and paths you want to run down, traveling isn't really as big of a hassle as some people make it out to be.

The project is developing so slowly that it is confidently moving into oblivion. 
We ran into the classic: ""Pay and wait for a possible miracle"".










Good start and sadly extremely slowly development of the game.
A year later, the thought involuntarily comes to mind that this is next creation, which will remain in Early Access sh. 
Probably no need to have a lot of talent to collect content from asset libraries, but to make good mechanics - of course need!
For those who are still planning to purchase this game:
Don't expect anything special. This is an ordinary shooter with elements of soda and stew. You'll have to more run than fight. It will be interesting for you at first time, but then you'ill be greatly disappointed by the emptiness and meaninglessness of the gameplay. Current online has already fallen to the bottom.
Indistinct craft; Pointless shelter build; No any transport; NPCs are mute. NPCs on trade have voice like they no have balls;
Absolute lack of protection against cheats, especially on official servers. Anti-cheat system doesn't work
Buy or not, it's up to you to decide. The devs have already earned enough to make efforts to develop the game, but there are no obvious results so far.
PS. Devs are very touchy, so in communities you can only write compliments to them, otherwise toxic responses or a ban await you.",1601930712,1668005648,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

2) you cant aim properly ( only 1 second to hold your breath before your character acts like a drunken sailor) and is incapable of aiming at any target.
3) its gets really boring after a few days because you find that theres really nothing left to accomplish because theres nothing but repetition after you reach a certain point.
4) if your suicidal then this arcade game would be right up your alley ... because all you seem to do is die , and die , and die over and over and over again so that may very well force you into being a survivalist and change your mind about suicide.
5) that said it did get slightly better because now you can hunt ducks in the game and the ducks act normal unlike the disco dancing NPC's that jump up and down and dance back and forth and shoot you all the time while you cant even aim at anything if your moving at all.

of course, in this genre are already a lot of competitors, so it's very hard to create a game like this and survive, this game has gotten my attention. 

No energy weapons, no bullshit...just shooting in the old fashioned way...i like it and bought the supporters pack. ;) My first session was 9 hours, a good time killer. ;)please keep hanging on to bring that game forward!

Well, to be honest, to remove the food and drinks at the traders wasn't a good decision. For those who play randomly from time to time just for fun it has been a good thing. Especially at PvE-Servers it should be possible to by food stuff from the traders.

The game may seem fun when you first start playing which it is but after a while it gets repetitive and most importantly boring. Keep in mind this game is only in early development so maybe in the next update they might make some bug fixes expand the map add new locations who knows also the game isn't that fun without friends but you can make friends from most likely bumping into another person in a server.

BUYER BEWARE & WARNED: I use to like this game until the recent update where the admins/devs took away the ability for the gamers to buy cans of food & cans of soda from the 2 safezone stores in the North & South part of the map. Now you might think that that would not effect the game much for me, but it did effect the game much for me. What it does is make you die a hell of a lot more from starvation & dehydration because you can't buy cans of food anywhere & cans of soda anywhere & the Deadside admins/devs don't have the spawn rate of cans of food & cans of soda even close to enough to help you stay alive most of the time. So you're literally dying almost all of the time from starvation or dehydration the entire game now since the recent update instead of being able to do the main part of the game the PVE/PVP. So for me I ended up dying way too many times from starvation & dehydration so I decided I'm too frustrated & I decided I'm not going to play this game Deadside anymore. Also the Deadside admins are not helpful at all. They will not listen to you when you post that you're having a problem with the Deadside game & you post about your problem on Discord to get help. If you post in the Deadside Feedback forum in Discord the admins/devs will literally just delete your post if you post anything so don't even try because they won't respond anyway they'll just delete.

They're entire FAQ on their Discord can be summed up as ""thats a really cool feature but its really hard to implement.  if we ever did implement it, we'd likely strip it of X features and even then theres no promise we will add it"".   Seriously.  Their defense for not having female characters is basically ""this would mean we'd have to design more clothes and thats a lot of work so no"".  If you try to criticize anything they flip out and start comparing themselves to Star Citizen for you expecting actual content.

The game is seriously lacking content.  End game can be reached in about 2 days.  Content add ons are sparse and few.  The ""Halloween Event"" is just giving a bunch of NPCS hockey masks(that cant be sold and are lower protection than the good gear).  The boat update has been pushed back twice now and is 2 months behind schedule.  Their reason?  It causes high population servers(50+) to crash.  But you'd be hard pressed to even find a server with more than 10 people playing.

Overall, this game is NOT a survival sim.  It is a first person shooter with some survival elements.  The core of the gameplay is expected to come from PvP and outside of that, the game is a desert.  If you want to play COD with hunger and limited base building, then this game is alright.  But if youre looking for a survival sim, this game is absolutely not that.

Before I start I want to say that Deadside is by no means a *bad* game, it's just a very very mediocre one. The graphics are great and the weapon sounds and animations are pretty good, but thats really all I can pat the game on the back for, overall it's just a very ""meh"" game, it doesn't really have anything unique about it, you'd get the essentially same experience if you played in an Arma 2 DayZ server with the zombies turned off, with the only real difference being that DayZ has WAY more content and things to do. PvE is very boring as you are fighting the same AI Hobos and soldiers that randomly spawn on the roads or at event points, their difficulty ranging from ""A sack of flower would put up a better fight"" to ""You've just been killed from 100m away through thick bushes and trees by the aimbot tier AI who's only gun is a sawn off shotgun from 70 Years ago"". Speaking of shotguns, the gun balance is very frustrating, and shotguns are ridiculously OP even at medium range, whereas a player/AI can soak up 10 rounds out of an AK at close range and still have enough health to gank you in 1 shot with grandpappy's double barrel despite wearing heavy body armor and a steel helmet, the game is very broken in that regard and once you get your hands on a good shotgun you don't really need anything else, and shotguns spawn EVERYWHERE. PvE is bad enough but PvP is even worse.

The comabt isn't the only issue, the lack of loot is aswell, if you are in a moderately populated server then have fun starving to death because every house will be so picked clean of food you'd think you were in a 3rd world country during the 80s. And to add insult to injury the devs have recently removed the ability to buy food in safezones, why might you ask? Well thats because they have added ducks to hunt... Ducks that I have only seen twice and both times have glitched out of existence upon hitting the ground after being shot. So good luck with that.

Though to give credit where it's due that is one of the only bugs I've encountered, the other one being so increadibly frustrating that I've had it happen twice and the last time it happened I uninstalled the game and started writing this review. The bug goes as follows: If you decide you are done playing for the night and disconnect in the wrong place, the next time you log in there is a chance that you have done so in an area that regularly spawns hobos, so when you eventually when you try to rejoin, the AI hobos will kill your character before the loading screen even finishes, meaning that once you are in game you cannot more or even respawn like when you normally die, this forces you to disconnect from the server, wait, and then rejoin a couple times till the game decides you are allowed to be alive again, only to find that because you disconnected before recovering your body, the game despawned it, meaning any loot that was on your body is now gone forever. I lost 10ish hours worth of loot grind to this and there is nothing I can do but start the grind all over again.

Honestly that alone is all you should need to know, I'm not even gonna go into detail on how dumb and frustrating the base system grind is, because the limits on where you can actually place a base are so needlessly restrictive, that I had to wander around for over 2 hours to find a spot to place mine (Which was in the middle of nowhere, a good 10min walk from anywhere notable btw), and by that point I was too annoyed to even care about building a base at that point and just wandered back to civilization instead.

So yeah.

TL;DR: 5/10 game, really not worth the money in my opinion due to the issues I encountered, just buy DayZ instead, but hey, there are worse games to spend money on I guess.

Pros:
Graphics are great
Guns are well modeled and sound good
Game is Cheap
Game is playable I guess

Cons:
Barely any content worth playing for
AI is either too boring to fight, or too obnoxious to fight
PvP is awful
Gun balance is awful and makes no sense
Walking simulator
Looting is boring
The grind is a pain in the ass

They have taken a games that was fun to play and made it so grindy it's just not worth the effort. The game does have high quality graphics and others factors that still make it enjoyable.

Right now, the whole thing is deeeeeeeply janky. 
All my experience is on PVE servers, fwiw:
  - AI bots are both brainless and godlike. Their pathing generally sucks so their aiming ability has been pumped through the roof.  Sometimes the bots will act the way you'd expect, but then you'll run into baddies that require multiple (5+) headshots to take down and have instant-reflex laser-beam accuracy.
 - You can easily lose all of the stuff on your body to any number of bugs or overly punishing mechanics. Sometimes your corpse won't be there when you get back to it (even when you make it in time). Sometimes your corpse will float on water (currently intended because you CANNOT dive beneath the water's surface) but other times your corpse will be underneath the water's surface so you can't actually retrieve your stuff. No, there is no recourse for this.
 - The places where you respawn after dying are also places where baddies tend to spawn, which means it's pretty common to respawn in the middle of a group of hostiles while you're armed with a knife and they've all got shotguns. You can usually outrun them, but not always.
 - Many systems in the game are not properly explained anywhere. For example, if you manage to grab a ""case,"" which is a reasonably difficult thing to get your hands on, you have to immediately take it to a trader to gain any benefit from it. If, for example, you happen to lose your internet connection and have to log back into the game before you've had a chance to sell the case, it's removed from your inventory and you don't get the benefit of that item.
 - Tooltips are not at all informative. Clothing items, weapons, etc., none of them will tell you stats beyond required ammunition or irrelevant flavor text. Want to know the difference between one AK variant and another? You're reliant on the (fairly sparse) wiki. Some people may appreciate the ""realism"" of not having reliable information. I'm not one of those people.
 - Many in-game items have no use, or only a single use, but are so widely available that you may be led to believe those items are fairly important or otherwise valuable. Polyethylene, car batteries, and many other items are only useful for a single crafting recipe that you'll only ever need to make once. Some of them can't even be sold to vendors for cash. Other items have no particular in-game use at all. Spark plugs and machine oil, for example, have no current use and therefore can only be sold to vendors. Again, though, tooltips provide no useful information.
 - Base building is a humongous pain in the ass, but not for any constructive reason. You have to chop wood to build most things, but that's the only resource you can harvest. Anything else has to be found in the environment somehow. Sheet metal, for example, is required in order to build a number of things, but can only be reliably found in one or two locations. Referring back to polyethylene, though, despite only needing that for one recipe, you can find that almost anywhere.
 - In order to even build a base in the first place, you have to find a spot to place a claim. However, the rules for placing a land claim are not spelled out anywhere in game, so you end up just wandering aimlessly around the map, staring at your little plywood sign, waiting for it to turn from red to green. The game provides basically zero guidance on this process and it's easy to become discouraged and feel as if there's nowhere to actually set down a land claim.
 - Travel time in this game is horrendous. The map is WAYYYYY too big and too sparsely populated, such that it takes an excruciatingly long and boring time to make it from point A to point B. I recommend watching youtube videos or something in the background as you make your way between points of interest. 

Ultimately, this game has a lot of potential but it isn't anywhere near to being a finished product. It's an early access title, sure, but there's a lot yet to finish up before I can recommend this title to most people.",1665604153,1666056752,False,4,0,0.56466907262802124,0,True,False,True

Deadside is the only one to have a good balance between crafting, survival, and gunplay. Really fun to play. Bots are challenging. Updates come out on a regular basis. Game looks great. The base raiding system is fair to everyone. All very well done. 

Something I personally would like to see added is a system for distributing loot more fairly after mission/convoy completion and preventing people from stealing the loot/case. The game would look at who has killed the most bots during the mission and gives that player access to the loot/case before the other players, maybe a 30-60 second window to go through the loot or pick up the case before it's opened to everyone. 

Can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. If there was a second supporter pack available I would definitely consider purchasing it.

First reaction went to a DayZ feel off of the graphics, movement and the genuine feel of the game in all.

I was hesitant with buying the game at first but started doing my own research and background of the game and the dev team, really hearing their story throughout YT and Twitch streams. With that research I have found that this dev team is really trying to not only show their fans but the genre in MMO Survival that they care about their product, which you can see in multiple updates/ patch notes since launch. With each update adding more life and pumping more potential into Deadside. As of right now I only have 17 hours into the game and will most likely be putting 1k plus into the game. However, I did spend the better half of 4 days really looking into this game because the genre in MMO Survival as a hole can get these games pumped out and die off so quickly because the numbers go low to Total Online Player, or simply a dev team that didn't put as much time in it to make the game better.

To put it simply I was quite enjoying this game until I found out when someone dies or a group dies they can just respawn in the village where they died and just run straight back. Not sure how the devs thought that was a good idea.

If the thought of another player being able to fight you 2-3 times before you finally stop them coming back annoys you don't play this game. I was trying to solo build a base and its near impossible. You need about 500 nails to build a 2x2 but ontop of that, if a person finds you mid build you may experience what I just had.

You kill a trio trying to fight you, they all respawn in the village 600m away, loot guns and come back to fight you again. Luckily you kill them all again but then they respawn in the village 700m away. Then unsurprisingly you die in the final wave.

Keep in mind they were able to send 9 bodies to fight me in the span of 10 minutes. I wouldn't touch this game unless they added a mechanic where you aren't able to spawn where you just died.",1665499781,1665499781,False,88,4,0.788211345672607422,11,True,False,True

Gun play feels good, base building seems ok (although I haven't got through much yet) and the PvP/base token idea of having to actually kill the player before being able raid their base is a great idea - I played a lot of ark where pointless offline raiding ruined a lot - especially as a solo player. 

I imagine this will have a lot of competition from SCUM - however it's much quicker to enjoy this as guns and loot come sooner. Combat feels better here - just as above, the loot and crafting depth needs expanding.

* I'm going to error on the side of caution and give this game a thumb's down for now as it is another open-world survival/shooter such as; Mistreated, DayZ, Last Day survival, and Romero's aftermath, with nothing unique to set it apart from the mix. Being very similar to the latter with 2 safe zones in which you can store loot and money found out in the world or gathered through trading at said safe zones and a very rudimentary crafting system. PvP is decent with 20 guns and 4 melee weapons along with 2 types of grenades across a medium-sized map, however, the movement across said map and the weapons are in need of a severe overhaul with inertia based momentum to knives being deadlier than a shotgun. Aside from the odd bug or two game play is pretty straight forward spawn, loot, kill, sell, repeat with a death or two thrown in the mix, that's it there's not much else to it. There is a basic base building mechanic but I didn't find a need to build one as each safe zone can store your loot and money, sadly storage is not linked together between the two safe zones, so I would pick one and stick to it if you die to keep spawn cycling till you spawn near the one you prefer (the South one seems more fleshed out IMO). I will continue to play periodically with friends and follow this game to see how this game changes and what it does to set itself apart from the rest.

-Very nice graphics
-Super engaging gun play
-Ok-ish stealth mechanics
-Good lootdrop table all around - not too much, not too little
-Very fun experience IF you find the right people to play with( this will make a comeback on the opposite spectrum in the Cons section)
-Pretty basic and easy to learn gameplay curve - survive, get loot, build a base, get more loot, kill some players if that's your thing or if necessary, go to the bunker and feel good about this achievement.

Now the Cons:
Since this is a DayZ clone, you can expect that some big part of the community is made out of the same kind of people( mostly underage individuals ) that are salty when they loose stuff/get killed repeatedly by better players with more attention to their surroundings, that will call you a cheater for doing so and even get you GAME BANNED, not server banned, just for being better(Yes, the entire analyses process is a bad joke and maybe has something to do with closer relations between the one that got you reported and the person that manually got you banned).
It is generally better to go play in a server where you know people beforehand so you'll have the most fun;
from personal experience playing with or against randoms became boring at some point and then again, you can make new buddies but that's a rare occasion in this game.
Pro tip: If you're from EU, save yourself the trouble and avoid the Official servers.
Apart from the toxic side of the community, this is a russian made game with a dev team of around 5 people, a game which has been in early access since April of 2020 so yeah, take what you will of that information.
Other small cons:
-The environment is not very realistic, the trees don't fall to the ground when you chop them for wood
 ->there is no option to forage for mushrooms for food or even drink water from rivers
-There is no prone position option which could have a good side as well but this game is pretty hardcore at times so it would be useful to add one in the future
-No easy way to report players for ACTUALLY cheating or other toxic/inappropriate behavior, you have to open a ticket the old fashioned way
-Generally a mediocre game that doesn't bring anything special to the table but mostly takes away from it but that's maybe just due to the lack of experience on the dev's part.

I really hope that Deadside will change for the better in the foreseeable future though I will not be surprised if it won't, to only then get overshadowed by bigger and more ambitious projects made by more experienced people AND with a better and more welcoming community behind it. Best of the luck to the devs on making the most out of this project!

I feel a lot of negative reviewers expect too much from so little that is available. The game DOES have bugs/exploits and may lack some fundamental content (end game, story, etc.) but does deliver on what it is - a survival game. Only main issue of mine in-game is the sound design. It's God Awful. I've played half my hours solo and the other half in a squad and I'd definitely recommend playing with friends. Solo play is satisfying once you understand how the game works. 

Devs have been transparent so far with the community and have released several patches and updates since launch addressing some concerns of the players. This is good, Keep it up and great survival game could be on the horizon. Just don't start working on useless stuff before fixes and optimizations like most other survival devs do. Gl out there

Sobre o jogo em si, tá na cara que vai ser um grande nome do gênero. Mas ainda está muito cru, falta muita coisa ainda.
Não me entendam errado, a jogabilidade já está muito boa! E os recursos disponíveis são muito bem feitos (construção de bases, mecânica das armas, etc.). Mas no atual estágio ele se torna repetitivo até ficar monótono. Compra, joga pra conhecer e dê tempo ao tempo. A Dead Pixel fechou parceria com a Tiny Build ano passado, o que traz credibilidade e muita pro projeto. E eu quero acreditar que, vendo os jogos da Tiny Build, esse jogo vai trazer inovações mais do que merecidas/necessárias pra esse gênero que está em morte cerebral faz algum tempo.

Eu acho que Deadside tem um potencial enorme, coisa de virar WoW dos jogos de sobrevivência mesmo. E os elementos de (pseudo) RPG já estão presentes no jogo! Só de ver um jogo desse gênero com NPCs (não só bots inimigos) já me deixa entusiasmado. Espero que os devs caprichem no quesito customização de personagem e variedade de itens, coisa que o Tarkov faz muito bem. 

Legal ver que o anúncio de Stalker 2 remexeu um pouco as coisas no gênero ""zone-like"".

Some trees on the map still float about 1m above the ground, but I found only a few in the world (most on slope areas). About animals *see Survival Elements below.

Weather: I think a weather system would have worked great, it will add to the atmosphere, at the moment it is always clear skies. The day/night cycle works well.

In game Map: The in game map is great, the function of adding multiple marker points on the map to track your user waypoinst/POI's are great, wish every game had it. 

The character: The character looks great, the clothes are nice at the moment, when climbing over objects the character seems to stay on top of the object until you move forward and not just leaping over. You can climb through windows that are very nice for different room access if someone is already in a house building etc. You can set the FOV so that makes the First Person view easier to manage and with a free look button to view realistic angles by moving your neck. Biggest thing I miss in this game regarding the character is to prone (There is no prone), making stealth approaches very difficult. Jumping while running seems like you can’t jump far while running.

Sound: The world sound is nice, for example you can hear the humming noise of a Transmission Tower (Electricity Pylon). But there is an ambient noise that sounds like footsteps, and then you look around and see nothing, you can hear squirrels or small animals in the vegetation which seems realistic. The normal walking in game seems a little bit loud to sneak onto someone. Also making stealth approaches difficult.

Base Building: The base building is still basic but I like it, I think in future updates the base building will be great. You need an axe, saw and hammer to start your build, I think that makes it a bit more realistic and with a team effort you will have a base in no time. (Make sure someone is on guard while you build).Biggest thing that needs to be done on the base building side is for the clan/squad to access the base while the clan/squad leader is offline. 

Survival Elements: You can drink sodas and eat canned foods; I would like to see animals in the world. Maybe to hunt them, or have some fruit trees around to harvest from, it will make the survival aspect easier to manage than to go to the trader and keep on buying food and sodas, and here and there you can find soda and food in houses etc. The dam should be accessible for drinking, maybe have a water container to retrieve the water. (Well this is just a suggestion).

The NPC’s: They come in variety and some are more difficult than others, but I must say they are just perfect.

The Weapons: From Pistols, shotguns, sub machine guns, assault rifles to sniper rifles. A good variety with mod options, on the mod side I would like to see a hunting scope for some of the rifles, and some other new attachments. But we need to wait and see.

The missions: The missions are fun, they also come in different difficulty so that gives you a choice to approach it or not. I would like to see different scenarios of missions; maybe in the future they will add it.

Safe Zone and Traders: There are two safe zones, each with two traders. One where you can buy weapons and gear and other one where you can buy food/soda, tools etc. You can sell looted items to buy new gear etc. There you can also talk to your enemies or friends about what happened in the field.

The Servers: I Personally think the players need access to the server files to host their own servers in the country they reside, playing on a ping of +-200ms with or against players with a ping of 10ms is just unfair but debateable. Not all countries have an Official Server, so consider before you buy, just in case it might be unplayable with excessive high ping. At the moment you need to rent a server but the server will still be hosted elsewhere. A lot of server lags at the moment but I saw the Developers are working on it. 

Buy it/don’t buy it: The game is still early access and has only been released on the 14th Arpil 2020, it is still very new. It is affordable and it comes with a support pack for information on the store page https://store.steampowered.com/app/895400/Deadside/
I will say it is a must buy, the developers are working around the clock to fix the small bugs, they are very interactive with the players and they keep them up to date with what is happening. For a small developer group they have done very well and I think the launch was overwhelming and unsuspected. I see great things for this game. Edit: I am editing this part, on the release I felt that the developers are doing a good job, at the moment they are doing a good job by keeping a selective player base happy and content, on the other hand if you not close to a server you will experience a high ping and will battle to play due to rubberbanding.

Edit: ""on the other hand if you not close to a server you will experience a high ping and will battle to play due to rubberbanding."" I will have to say, I reinstalled this game after a couple of updates to see if the server issues are resolved, due to no local servers playing it makes it almost impossible. There is no change in ping which is understandable due to server location, but the rubberbanding is non existent, I do believe that when Tinybuild bought into Bad PIxel that they saw a lot of small things that can change, especially on the Server side of things. I am still hopeful for a local server but it is at least playable and the game that I was looking for.


Closing Comment: I will update this review as we go along.

There's still hunger and thirst to worry about, no prone; but unlimited stamina and straightforward safezone/trader stuff to grind up the game with. It's a nice game to casually get lost in on a good unofficial server for a couple of days. Get it on sale.",1650640167,1662134226,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

more advanced AI: AI currently will stand out in the open and shoot at you even reload out in the open don't try to seek cover if they are in a building and hear you they will all come out of one doorway even if 5 of them are mowed down in front of them sometimes they will reload and stand right in front of you they don't try to flank you or act in an intelligent way to counteract you they'll just walk straight at you and shoot usually they will also bunch up in one big group I've entered missions before and had all 20 AI from the mission come out in one big cluster and kill me if the AI has an AK or any automatic weapon you're dead because they'll beam you on automatic and 1 shot takes a significant chunk of your health and to add insult to injury the AI has unlimited ammo so they can spray forever and there's nothing you can do about it I think this problem could be fixed by making the AI seek out cover when they take fire make it so they will try to flank the player and coordinate in a way that will support their teammates
current AI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NHyEB5bS44&ab_channel=KennPlaysDeadside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59aZY3KVPyE&ab_channel=Boose47
Vehicles: this is something that should have been in the game on release and the fact it's still not in after 2 years as of currently is ridiculous if you want to get anywhere in the map you have to run there the only saving grace about this is the fact that you have unlimited sprinting and there's an auto run key but this still takes a fair chunk of time around 10-20 minutes and this is going in a straight line combine this with missions that take place all over a map you can be running 5km to the objective just for the mission to end right when you get to it and then you gotta run 5km back which takes a fair chunk of time when a vehicle would resolve this issue it's also worth noting there are players who I've seen openly say they won't be playing the game again until they add vehicles which should be a major call for the developers to listen to their fan base

Developer priorities: the developers priorities are all over the place they should be working on simple things such as vehicles and better AI but they seem to want to work on things such as more realistic indoor gunshots, new camos, and improved bullet impact effects to name a few which is great and all and it is appreciated but it should be of higher priority to get vehicles sorted which is something that should've been present at launch and many have said they want to such a degree that they've stopped playing until they are implemented put in what the player base wants or those players will start looking elsewhere 

Servers:all servers appear to be hosted through gportal which wouldn't to such a big deal to me if it weren't for the fact that this is the only way to host your own game you can't host locally for single player and you can't do a small dedicated server for maybe 4-8 players in case you want to play with just your friends in PVE if you want to do that you either have to play in a public server or rent your own server which will run you at minimum $5.50 per month if you are hosting from US but you can go to the following link to check other prices the way I view it is I've already paid the price for the game if I want to play it on my own or with a small group of friends I shouldn't have to pay per month to host a private game for a small group of friends I get 20 people but for 4-8? plus with the fact we might not want to keep that server running 24/7 because we might wanna play something different? and I presume once we stop paying that server cost and it shuts down we lose everything so then we have to pay again and restart? that's not right we should be able to have a dedicated server which we can have free of charge which we don't have to worry about losing everything on because we didn't pay for said server
server pricing link: https://www.g-portal.com/us/en/order/step/one/deadside 
my solution to this problem is allow us to have a single player mode which will allow us to fiddle with settings and only be able to play solo and allow us to host dedicated servers possibly for a maximum player count of around 4-8 players 

Land Claiming: claiming land in this game to build on is way too restrictive it was to such an extent that I ended up running around for 10-15 minutes trying to find a place I could place my land claim the only solution I have for this is maybe consider loosening up the restrictions more but keep it so that people can't build right outside or in a safe zone and people can't block a road or wall off locations

Extra: from what I've seen from other reviews the devs seem to dislike when people leave bad reviews on their game allegedly doing such things as banning said player in a retaliatory manner in both the game and in their official discord the community is not much better they seem to be a bunch of yes men who approve of everything the developers do and if you raise any kind of issue you find with the game they will belittle you or defend the issue claiming it isn't an issue and it's very noticeable if you look at forum posts on places such as steam and reddit and some of the threads in their official discord as well as in the official discord in general

if they do end up banning me for giving them criticism and solutions to their problem I'll update this and if they work on the major issues that their game has I'll remove this review and maybe I'll consider recommending this but as it stands now this is what I've experienced and I can't recommend this to anyone try other games such as Rust, DayZ, and Scum",1661593174,1661593717,False,11,2,0.614032924175262451,0,True,False,True

Second thing, is that people just seem to generally camp the missions, wait for you to put in the time and effort clearing everything and just camp the loot that spawns since they know the spawn locations, grab it and run away. The crates should really be locked to whoever clears the mission.

Gunplay is solid. Feels like a Day Z - Tarkov clone.

Fast travel is in the game now which helps a lot. Still can feel dead in some spots though. I prefer 1st person servers and if you can find a decent admin it can be a really awesome pvp/pve experience. 

For all of it's faults though, the gunplay is great. The looting system is great. The missions  (although repetitive and cheeseable once you figure them out) are still great too.

i spend 50 hours on a pve server to learn the game, community is wholesome filled with good ppl, and overall i had fun there, but after i got the best gear it started getting boring and here where the problem comes it

cons: the game has no transportation methods at all, no cars, boats or anything, its litreally a running/walking simulator, not only that but missions and convoys spawn very fkn far away from the safe zones, so you be walking 2kilos to get to the missions and another 2 kilos to get back, so when i played on a pvp server after learning the game theres 99% chance youll get sniped on your way back to the safe zone from a player.

2: bots litreally have aim bot, doesnt matter if youre wearing thee best armor in the game youll still get 1 tapped with a fkn pistol.  mission difficulties start from 1 star up to epic, whenever youre going to a hard mission enemies will spot you from 10000000 kilo away and insta snipe you cuz youre out in the open, so youll end up dying about a thousand times before completing the mission (that ofc if no player ever killed you and take your shit) and end up walking kilo and die and walk another kilo and die until finally you finish the mission and now you gotta walk another 3kilos to safezone ( hard missions spawn very far away from safe zone)
pvp servers is filled with toxic russians and i still dont get why russians play on a fkn eu server (theres litreally dedicated server for them) 
on pvp servers you only can do easy or medium missions (has shit loot) if you go to a hard one youll find a russian duo that will fuck you up and take all your shit
when youre doing convoy and you died by the ai theres a chance that your stuff on your corpse will be unavaliabe so you litreally lose all your stuff and has to buy them again.
theres 2 traders one at the safe zone and other that spawn randomly that sells better guns and clothes/gear
he spawns at the edge of the map

Two things to note: no stamina bar so you can sprint infinitely, and if you collect dog tags you can use them as a currency to travel betwixt safe zones, of which there are two - at least in the server I'm playing on. 

It's fun to collect gear and you only have to worry about hunger and thirst as far as survival goes. No sicknesses like in DayZ, atm anyway. I for one hope it remains that way. This game doesn't have zombies so we should be good on that front. 

I hope in the future the map gets at least a big city and another minor city. The villages are cool and feel lived in with some cool detail in the dacha models and vehicles, and the industrial areas are nice, too. However, to make the world seem more real and filled up, a city with apartment blocks, grocers, perhaps a soviet statue and some soviet mosaics, a city square, etc., would be awesome!!

Worst game on steam hands down, get better administration that doesn't rage when they get killed by a noob

EDIT: Ban was lifted. I am still leaving this negative review for the fact that false game bans like this ruins peoples reputations in communities, and gives thought that the person is lying, even in my case, which I was not. (anyone asking about the vac ban I have on file, which is invisible to those who dont have Steam inv manager, was from MW2, the original MW2, 12 years ago, when I was a child) I have no actual way of guaranteeing that it was admin based, but that was the only conceivable conclusion I came to given I played for 36 minutes only, and killed people that were kitted, to then soon after get a ban.

Devs; If you're going to put in an anti-cheat, make sure it actually works before implementation. The reason provided (which you can see in the comments) was ""It looks like there was some kind of technical problem and when one of the cheats was detected, non-cheaters were banned as well"", basically meaning SOMEONE in my game was cheating, and EVERYONE was punished because of it, instead of JUST the cheater.

This game is everything that a PVPVE gamer has been wanting and expecting from developers. Good example is the over scaling issue that DayZ faced during their launch of having to many Zombies within the game, and having them move to quickly. They revamped their game before their official Console release and down scaled so much that the game was no longer challenging to any player and became repetitive and boring.
Your game has a unique balance of easy, medium and hard challenges. Players who wish to have a casual experience can focus in those areas and still be able to achieve a well balanced play through.

9/10.

A very fun and promising survival game, definitely needs some more content and

The character movement and gun play is amazing. Its really fun to get
use to the weapons, recoil, and attachments. The guns and skins look
incredible and its just all around very fun. 
*Recoil being updated soon as well*

The map is too big without vehicles, its an absolute running simulator from mission 
to mission. Glad they may be released before 2023

Base building system just got reworked and its a lot better, still missing
a lot of key building components but, its in the works. Limited storage 
is available which is kind of a bummer. (Only 6 storage bins allowed).

Devs: Yes.

If you like that game, you should like this. I think they went a little hard on making this game as 1:1 with that game (Some stuff, feels like it was straight ripped) This means that instead of improving upon what the other game did, the implementation in deadside is near identical, clunkiness and all.  Animations, progress bars, the way your model looks, the first and 3rd, they even emulated the limitations of Bohemia's Arma 3 Engine inside Unreal Engine 4. I think this team is capable of taking what was good about that game and making it entirely new and polished - leaving the clunkiness behyind.  The UI is far improved in this game than it is in DAYZ, and it's not a frame rate chomper like the ARMA 3 engine.  That being said, I know this is early access but I hope the devs move in the direction of taking what worked with that game, and leaving behind the stuff that sucked about it.  You can see that game's fingerprints all over this game, from the way you look when free looking, to the animations, to the landscape, the buildings etc.

I would also like to be able to run and gun a little better so I didn't have to stop and shoot at these bots.  The aim just goes flying all over.  I get it, you can't run and ADS anyways, but there's a reason most ADS mechanics have you slow down, it's to make movement possible.

I think implementing a way to move while the inventory is open will help players sweep for items.",1659224044,1659226173,True,1,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,True

Initially I thought I had found a very good balanced raiding system, but when someone kills you there is a chance you drop a raid token and people have 1 hour to raid your base.  Let me clarify that, the entire fucking server can come and take your shit.  Died to someone who didn't even come raid my base, another 2 or 3 teams did. They used about 10 C4, destroyed all our locks which aren't easy or cheap to get.  The initial team that raided us had their own stalkers (best backpack in the game) and you can't stack backpacks.  We had 5 stalker backpacks in our base, and lost them all because again EVERYONE can come and loot your shit even if they haven't ran into you.

Spawn system is also so bad.  When we were getting raid, we killed about 3 people like 4 times over and over because they can just spawn instantly close to your base.  Not only that, but every single time they came back, they came back with full gear, so they were hacking if they could just keep spawning back in.  So not only do you have to deal with the normal hackers that have aimbots, you also have to deal with hackers who can just get all the loot they want and just harass you since you actually try to earn the things you have.

A vast majority of the community constantly keeps asking for the devs to change the game to the Tetris inventory system (similar to Escape From Tarkov).  But the devs have never even addressed this.  Haven't said whether they will or they won't.

Repeat the process over and over again. You cant loot more than two guns at once unless you have the biggest backpack. The building system is very bad and claiming land to build on it is a real pain (took me more than 45min of walking around to be able to place down the claim). Looting is fun but you have to walk a lot and you cant loot much. The bots will aggro you from a distance without actually seing you and they will aimbot you to death quickly. You have to cheese them by waiting in corners and trying to glitch them. Overall, the ai in this game is very bad. The gunplay is a bit clunky too ...

So I guess before buying consider carefully if you are a Solo.

it strikes a good compromise between punishment, reward and action as I was never into looting and running for hours without getting into a fire fight ala Dayz. The npc's are better than devs with millions behind them like pubg where they make some aggressive plays on you at times and its a blast when you have 6 of them coming at you. The one shot kills they get are too common though and I haven't found a way to avoid it, eg. its got nothing to do with standing still for to long. You can auto run and get a drink without getting stuck on the first object you hit as well so yeh overall you can relax and enjoy a drink and a chat in between missions with some surprises along the way like running into a roaming convoy of npc's.

So far my biggest criticism is the big fps drops and regular stutters! 
If a game doesn't run smoothly then your on borrowed time in my book no matter how fast you put new content in. Overall I like that its a shooter you can play, get some excitement but not care about dying and have a laugh and chill...Oh and I like that there are a bunch of guns/upgrades you can only get in missions or by killing a player who got them from completing one.

Cons
-Godly AI (They see you from a mile away and through objects. They will snipe you from over 100 meters away with a pistol or pre-aim your head while you take cover and pop you in 0.03 seconds when you stand up to fire.)
-Low amount of loot (Unless you find one of the few servers with x2-max loot enabled, the stock % of world loot in public servers will have you searching a dozen houses before you find ANYTHING and that thing you find will be maybe a few nails or plank of metal but you'll look forever for a gun.)
-Dying of boredom while running everywhere (The distances you run between places or from the edges of the map back to a safe zone will have you auto-running for so long that you will get bored because other than running into a cheap and annoying AI, there's nothing along the way other than more missions against brokenly strong AI. No animals to hunt for food or fear attacks from, no fun way to properly raid bases other than a 60minute window token) Which brings me to my last con.. 
-Server size vs map size (The game takes forever to run across but the servers only hold 50 people with a party limit of 5 people and this makes big clans impossible to form. It takes about 2.5 minutes to run 1km.. the game is currently around 35km large with plans to reach 225sq.km but player size is only projected to increase to 70-80? The map will always feel dead and over filled with AI!  Take what you like from this game and look for it in something else.
Until they add vehicles and not in a ""headache to fix up and only use for 10 minutes"" sort of way and increase server numbers to at least 150, this game will fizzle and close down. Lately it feels like there's only 1 guy working on the game while trying to portrait a larger team.

-The game need vehicles (I know that developers are working on it and it sounds great ) 
-Need to improve the animation a little .
-Need to improve the shooting mechanics a little.
-Make farming in the game.
-Adding zombies or wild animals will be very nice .
-Need to fix fps drop issue my game reach 60 fps but it drop to 50-40-30 need to make it stable at least 60-50 not 60-50-40-30, (I try to reduce video settings to low with resolution small but the game still the same for the fps drop so this is not my PC problem the problem is on the game optimization developers need to fix this I know the game is on early access but it is necessarily to fix this ..
-Adding different missions activity , make some missions that you need to clear the bots and other mission you need  to turn on something or searching for any stuff of the trader and you will got rewarded when you find that thing and like that make missions mixed between a lot of stuff .
last thing I need to say this is some of critical stuff the game must have or improve in the future the developer are doing great job .",1656883277,1656883277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The idea of having NPC's is great in theory but they crank the AI accuracy and aggro WAAAAAAAY too high. The gunplay is super clunky and you find yourself fighting with your character to properly peak a corner without it raising its gun up, or tryna hold your breath for a steady shot without the gun zooming back out of ADS. You get trapped in walls to a point where you have to die and run back to your body which is especially hard if you're in the middle of a mission as NPC aimbot 3000 will hit you almost every time with rifle fire (which is 50 damage per hit and they rack a shot every 2 seconds) Did I mention the AI can see you in pitch black darkness and hit you just as easily? Well they can and they do, every time.
    There are too many guns with too many different ammo types leaving you with a jigsaw puzzle of inventory junk until you find something that works with your loadout. I wouldn't mind the different guns if they could just keep it to maybe 3 to 4 ammo types but there are at least 3 ammo types for each class of gun aside from shotgun with a total of 5 classes for a whopping 12 ammo types that just sit in the inventory. The inventory clutter in this game is ridiculous.
    Building is a nightmare, like for real. You need specific items to build which makes sense but the drop rate of said items is slim to none especially if you got other players strolling through these same places and you can't craft them. materials are another issue, you need TONS of nails (low max stack making it an inventory issue again) and to find an axe which is set in the PRIMARY WEAPON SLOT, you gotta make a choice, ditch your gun, or build a base to store your gun, or just kill everyone and not die heading to a safe zone, easy enough. How are you gonna require so many logs for a scaffold and put 4 per max stack in your inventory? it's gonna take like 20 minutes to lay a scaffold, JUST ONE then you still gotta put up walls and ceiling, too much work to save the items you've been working to get, only to have someone run up on you mid build and drop you. The game relies heavily on having many people working with you because even for 2 people it's a big ask to have them drop their guns in trade for an axe and mule for building materials. Now they do have safe zone storage which gives you about 12 slots which does help, but these safe zones are decently far from eachother, so making a trek to a safe zone takes distance and time while players are stopping people going to safe zones, i see more gun play going on just outside the safe zones than most mission areas. 
    All in all the idea of this game is great and seeing it in the future I am hoping they address a lot of the issues mentioned as it is still early access and I keep tryna tell myself that while I continue to play but until then, it's a no from me chief.",1656785914,1656785914,False,1,0,0.480587601661682129,0,True,False,True

The map is too open, with transport remaining painfully slow running everywhere. The AI is completely broken to the point where cheesing their mechanics to easily dispatch of them is always the optimal strategy. I love the gun-play and the economic mechanics of this game, but the pace of development is abysmal. Before I would have happily recommended it, even after release of the Supporter Pack. The latest addition of paid cosmetic DLC is too egregious for me to look past. In my opinion they simply have not delivered enough progress or meaningful changes to the most pressing issues that this game faces to be able to justify MTX at this point. It should be indicative to anyone looking to purchase this game now that these developers continue to lack the proper priorities. This game has gone and is going nowhere since I purchased it over 2 years ago. The AI is absurd, Base building is consistently buggy, rudimentary and just generally poorly implemented. The ""Missions"" are all just cut and paste in different locations - KIll all NPCs and loot your reward. There is absolutely no depth. Weapon/Armor skins existed in game and were the only thing to seek out once you had decent armor/guns, there is no reason not to continue to expand what you could obtain by playing the game. Clearly, they want additional revenue streams from an early access game that progresses at an absolute snails pace.

There's definitely a few things I really like. It's nice that you can back out of pretty much any animation at any time. The forest sounds are really nice and help with the immersion. I like that the open world map shows missions and events on it, which helps drive player interaction and/or PvP. The UI is pretty straightforward and I was able to puzzle out how most things worked pretty quickly. It's nice that the AI isn't laser accurate, so between that and the longer than Tarkov TTK, you typically have time to react.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of negatives. The reload animations are feel less like a hardened survivor frantically reloading under stress and more like a slow paced tutorial on how to reload each weapon made by someone who is terrified of breaking the gun. There's also no tactical reloads, so every single reload has to go through the same extremely slow process. All of the animations feel slow and require you to watch every last frame of them for them to count instead of having small windows where you can do things like change weapons or shoot back.

There's an utter lack of inertia with the AI, so sniping is astoundingly difficult since the AI can change directions without losing any speed.  The AI also can see through most of the foliage in the game, so while they won't immediately laser you down, breaking line of sight to heal is difficult and results in a lot of deaths. There seems to also be some weirdness with hitboxes and hit registration, but I'm willing to admit that some of that might be user error. The AI also has no alert sounds, so your only warning that you've been spotted tends to be gunfire.

The map itself is around 25km square, which would be really cool with a fully populated 50+ person server, but it feels extremely empty otherwise. It's not unusual for me to have to spend several minutes running between points of interest. This wouldn't be a bad thing, but spending several minutes trudging across the map, followed by slowly clearing a mission and then being rewarded with the same lackluster loot that you've always been getting really kills the fun.

I really hope this game gets the love it deserves. I love the idea of a hardcore open world shooter, but I can't recommend this game until it gets some polish.",1656533159,1656533159,False,1,0,0.500605344772338867,0,True,False,True

This isn't much an issue at short range, and in fact can spice things up by punishing panic fire.
At long range it's annoying but workable since you'll usually be using a high powered rifle and killing in one shot.
But 90% of the time you're gonna be fighting at mid range and you just WILL NOT be able to place accurate followup shots unless you're squinting through ironsights.

 PERFECT!!! this game is just for you!!! because im leaving.
this game consumes a lot of *&^&* time and you wont get anything, because you lost items faster than you get them.
if you try to play just the PvE thinking you don't have to deal with PvP, the AI still gonna one shot you, doesn't matter what armor you have, if the AI have a weapon bigger then a pistol or a double barrel shotgun, you will die in one shot, so i'm not sure is the armor does anything or it's just for looks.

Save your money, move on to anything else until it actually gets somewhere.

I've left my review from a few years ago intact, but take it with a grain of salt.

OLD REVIEW BELOW:
Coming from DayZ, I can already tell this game has the kind of potential to grow into the game I wanted from the start. An engine that works well, is beautiful and has controls that feel fluid.
Simple, but clear survival mechanics. Health, food and water. No strange blood-leaking/pain-shaking/broken-gear mechanics. As much as I enjoy realism, those mechanics do not spark joy.
Enemy AI that is fun to battle against. I love Romero zombies, but they become fairly boring if in the whole town, there are 5 and you have a gun to deal with them. Scavs (as my mates call them) are currently a little silly, but super fun to fight.
Which leads to the next point.
The focus is on fighting, which I can actually respect. The best part of combat is that it's smooth and realistic. 

GUNS THAT SPAWN WITH THEIR AMMO NEXT TO THEM LIKE WHO THE F*CK HAS A SHOTGUN AND DOESN'T OWN AMMO IN THE SAME HOME.

Would recommend playing now, enjoying it with some friends, and then coming back at a later date to see the progress.",1590840998,1655545473,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

BUT, if you're inactive for seven days or more you lose your whole base and everything inside. My father just passed away from acute myloid leukemia so understandably i took a break( prob about 8 days). Only when i try to come back to deadside, everything i stored in my base as well as my base was gone. guns, ammo, rare armor, over 1 mil in cash, 13+ dog tags. it took me weeks to build and stock this base just to have it taken away because i haven't played in a week. it's a good game but that alone is enough to make me not even try until they wipe everything again. i don't really want to waste weeks on something i might lose if my life gets in the way of gaming. Also, there needs to be more PvE servers or more activities added to the map. the same 4 or 5 epics get old and racing people to an event just to get cussed at in chat is old. it's back to the same people doing the same things and not letting anyone else do anything other than easy missions.",1654379625,1654379625,True,19,3,0.709274828433990479,0,True,False,True

The game lacks content theres not much to do after about three hours of playing the missions are boring and theres no need to build a base in the game because of the safe zones however if you choose to do so it will take you hours to build a small base barely big enough for three players. Majority of the game is running for 10 minutes finding some ai killing them scavenging their clothes and selling them and then repeat. Also the ai are like aimbots and will shoot you from over 100 meters away even in the pitch black night. Theres no vehicles to move across the massive map and the only form of transportation is to travel between the two safe zones which costs a ridiculous amount of grinding. Overall the game isnt worth buying as you will run out of things to do after a few hours and the dev team seems to be taking a long time to push any content out which is one of the reasons the game dies and barely comes back when content comes out. Plus most updates are small and meaningless I regret spending 20 dollars on this game it should be 15 at most theres not enough content to justify the price as well as the lack of polish on existing content.,1654371223,1654371223,False,150,16,0.807698309421539307,14,True,False,True

Boy was I wrong. 

It's better.

Why?

Because it takes the best of all of those games and distills crafting, looting, and base building into a simple and approachable game play loop that gets to the heart of what makes those games fun.

The devs continue to improve the game. The player community is ruthless but fun and nothing feels so hopeless when you die that you get salty. It's a very forgiving game that encourages a healthy amount of sweat.

Pros:
-gunplay feels good and having the ability to lean is super nice 
-new spawn system on towns was a really good idea for people starting out or to recover nearby gear
-map is filling out really well with small and large landmarks all around and a nice variety of terrain
-quest pop up right and left so you always have guaranteed high tier loot to go find.
-servers have a good population size. on a pretty filled server I'd say it's fairly easy to run to towns with no quest around and loot a bit safer while you're also able to find the fights on command.
-fast travel from north to south safe zone was a really nice idea
-bases are pretty difficult to get but really worth the difficulty. I feel like it does help bases not appear absolutely everywhere though.

Only con I'd say is the game seems like it's in a fairly fragile state at the moment but if the devs hold to their plans for the game then I think it really has potential.",1609301590,1652543640,True,1,0,0.507692337036132813,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately, the player pool is low at the moment but the game feels right for once. Do not expect a thorough looting experience and there is alleged cheating in PVP, but the PVE experience is a blast. The fighting is intense, and the weapons handle well. The AI can be worse than players in terms of difficulty so there's plenty of action to be had, almost too much sometimes. There are still plenty of things to work out and improve on but if you have the money to burn or uninstalled this title from your library it's worth a second shot.

Update: Just played 10 months later. A better, smoother experience but still very boring. It is still a walking simulator with some random fights sprinkled in. Control defaults are still a bit funky. I really wanted to love this game but it's still not there.

Released too early. It's a free-for-all killing zone with no real direction. The idea feels like a direct rip from DayZ but amateur. Most of the houses I came across were not accessible at all and the loot system albeit clean is garbage. I had three kills in the first five minutes of playing so my lack of fun was not due to lack of competence. The in-game VOIP is set up awfully in terms of keybinding and no one seems to use it as a result. Also, 25 Sq. km was not big enough for a launch. The kill feed continues to read ""[X Person] Knife [Y Person]"" because combat is so frequent post spawn. Save your money for now or buy it early and hope for the best but I don't see myself reinstalling for some months at this point if ever.

- Pvp is fun and tense at times
- Good weapon mechanics
- Fluid movement system
- Whole base idea of the game is good
- Safe zone and trader system is well thought of, as are the missions and events
- Simple player management system that doesn't require you to ration resources as harshly like in Dayz


Cons:

- Can be buggy at times
- Scav AI is far from good
- Map seems very bland, repetitive and not many foliage variations 
- Sound design is meh, particularly directional gunshots and far gunshots, just doesn't sound right.
- Beware you cannot turn of anti-aliasing which was a problem for me as it made the game blurry meaning spotting enemies from far away was difficult

It's a bit more casual than DayZ because you can gear up in minutes rather than hours, and start to make plays and snowball just as soon. Gunplay is solid. 

Even PvE is fun if you want to chill out for a bit. The AI is challenging at times, but not too challenging, which makes missions enjoyable and even really tricky if other players start to show up.

Can't comment on basebuilding, havent felt the need to build one yet - which says a lot after 24 hours of playtime. (In a good way - it means there's a lot more content to be explored)

Deadside has AI that roam around in groups, so it gives you stuff to fight, that isnt PVP. Of course, any player could hear your gunshots while fighting bots, try to ambush you, that hasnt happened to me as of yet. There's missions around the map, where you can obtain better gear and money. I find that I dont suffer from ""gear fear"" in Deadside like i do in Scum, or Dayz. For this reason alone, it makes the game so much more enjoyable. I am much more likely to engage in PVP, than in any of those games. Theres a respawn system that allows you to spawn in different places, I like this, but dont at the same time, i dont like it. Ive always loved how in Dayz, you spawn on the south coast as a new spawn. It makes creates an interesting kind of dynamic where the farther north, into chernarus you go, the more likely you'll run into geared players(at least on official servers)meaning you have to travel quite far, and work your way up to good gear. In deadside acquisition of gear is much easier, majority of players you run into, will be geared. Also, the traders is cool, but people always wait at the border of the safezone, to ambush people as they come out, and thats F*cked imo. Had some dudes that wouldnt stop following me around and harassing me, so i just had to leave the servers. othern than that kind of thing happening with other players, its a great up and coming, survival FPS. I get good kicks out of fighting the AI. The AI is vastly improved since the last time I played. They used to just run at you in a straight line, now they actually manuever, in ways that make you quesion if your fighting other players, or the AI. They will do things like crouch and try to sneak up on you, if you are in a room, and they know where your at. Like they do things that make you question if your fighting a real player.

Instead there were around 15 bots that bloody smoked me. an encounter where it was only bots/NPC's wasn't what i was expecting but that's just life. i remember respawning in a building, outside the building i hear an AK-47 going crazy outside so i do what any sane human would do and i pick up an axe to rush the shooter and i'm not even joking when i say i ran up to him, hit him once with an axe, and he died. i was shocked. so i took the AK and went to the same event where i got smoked by bots and killed everyone there and got all the loot. definitely one of my greatest starting experiences on any survival game. just wanted to start with that anecdote of mine. so the gunplay in this is fairly good i reckon same with the graphics. the map is bloody massive not as big as DayZ but still massive. the world can feel kinda empty at times but they added a cool feature where NPC patrols walk through towns which you can fight if you'd like to. the survival aspect isn't very heavy in this. you can get shot heaps then just consume bandages, your guns and clothes don't degrade and all you need to worry about is food and drinks. it feels like a game where you run around, loot average loot from buildings (you will want to go to events) shoot npcs, rarely encounter players since playerbase is lowkey dead. and repeat. the AI is kinda silly in this, the NPC's will just walk up to you and open fire sometimes if they can't get a shot on you which results in their death since they're point blank and they often just stand fully still which is an easy kill. sometimes i get crazy frame rate glitches too, that's all i can really think of. if you are looking for a survival game like DayZ and stuff maybe don't get this. it would be better if it was more popular. i don't mind playing this every now and then though.",1650891391,1650891391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Deadside gives me the ability to jump on for an hour or so when i get chance and pick up from where I left off, having journeys around finding loot, intense gun fights (admittedly I'm no sharpshooter) and enough of a light survival element to keep me entertained. This is early access and the map could do with fleshing out a bit more, but as for now it keeps me happy.

Generally I'd advise looking up footage of this on YT or something to get the feel for it, the best way to describe this game would be DayZ Lite Edition with bots instead of zombies, the environments are clearly inspired by DayZ and eastern europe but I'm fine with that. In fact I quite like it.

Build a base or don't, having player storage helps players with limited time, such as myself, however I would state that if you just buy the game, then don't expect much in terms of storage, I've brought the supporter pack just so I can have more storage as I doubt I'll ever build a base in this game (I just lack the time)...I don't fancy building a base i can only protect from players once a week, it'd just be raid bait.

You'll find yourself going from easy missions to the harder ones in due course, took me a while to muster the courage for a harder mission.

All in all a solid game and I look forward to what this game will become over time.",1650837565,1650837565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If steam had a mixed recommendation, i would give that.

i was looking for a fps to take some time off tarkov. Deadside is not that fps. its not bad, its just not much.
Gameplay in general, weapon feedback, audio, the IA, everything is kinda meh for lack of a better word. if you want to buy
DS, wait it get out of EA.

with 10h of gameplay i already feel that there is nothing else to do, already got the best gear on the game.
Since the gunplay is not that good, pvp and pve(which have his own problems) aren't that appealing.

Still raw, needs a lot more content, but it's well optimized, map is HUGE, AI enemies are pretty troublesome, looting system is well done and overall is an enjoyable experience.
The only thing I dislike is the storage feature that makes the 'supporters pack' a must have to prevent long runs across the map or an insane grind to build a base in the early game (note that there is fair enough base raiding system with specific rules, where fortunately not everybody can destroy/rob each other buildings, but the base owner drops a raid token when killed that allows the raid)

Casual / PVP action focused survival game. With Ai patrols and missions to challenge your PvE skills.

Basic gear is very simple to get. So you can always get back into the action even if you lose everything. The missions offer a gear stepping stone from basic civilian gear to starting military gear.  

The new overhaul to the spawning system makes the pvp much more enjoyable. If you get in some intense action the fight isn't simply over because you killed the enemy player. You have a chance to make it back to a body get a gun and jump back in to.

The fun I have been having with this game has drastically increased with the past few patched. The development is definitely going in the correct direction!!

Some negatives would be the lack of vehicles and how dense the world is. Some areas feel quite empty. Some fields could definitely use a few more rocks and or static cover of some sort. This is really noticeable when setting up ambushes for case carriers and such. When you engage in longer range pvp fights you begin to notice how much just open fields there are. 

When walking on a 45 angle if you turn you mouse to look left or right the animations kind of overlap causing you to stop walking for a millisecond which feels pretty junk.

All the negatives I mentioned are listed on the road map for this year however.

During that time we were ambushed by multiple NPC Patrols but stayed as a team killing all in our path. We wiped out bunker, completed 2 Medium Difficult missions and 2 Elite Difficulty missions then returned to the Trader Zone and preach more about our Pantsless army. Some of the most fun i have geniuinely ever had in a Multiplayer Survival game. The PVE community seems to be very fun with lots of people just having a good time. Game itself is very well developed and seems to get decent updates. AI isnt too good but isnt too bad and the Gunplay is very satisfying albeit a little wonky on occasion. Game also runs like a dream. Will be recommending this game to lots of other friends!

I don't mean this with any negative connotation either. Even being in beta it's pretty fun. I haven't scratched the surface as I've only about 4 hours in, but there's base building, trading, scavenging, etc. The enemy AI is probably the weakest aspect so far. They can hit you from quite a distance away with accuracy, they seem to swarm your location from any nearby area, but you can always cheese it out by hiding in a building or a shipping container shooting them as they come in the door lol.

The graphics are good. I'm playing on an RX 5500 XT 4GB with maxed settings at 1080p and getting very high frame rates. I have an older card, so anything newer should give you even better performace. There are some hiccups that rear their heads every now and then like dropping to 20-30 FPS for a second or two. Nothing I'd say is game breaking.

Like I said, overall I'm very impressed with Dead Side, even in it's current state is very playable. If you're looking for something similar to Escape From Tarkov, but not as punishing, this quite possibly could be it.",1649564184,1649564184,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

i. Yes, it's a running simulator
ii. It's probably not fun without friends, you'll struggle to maintain interest in this game solo
iii. The game might feel clunky at times especially at the start until you get a grip on the movement, mechanics etc.
iv. You're guaranteed to be frustrated by the bots at times

Dedside isn't a game for everyone. It's punishing, it takes time, it has a steep learning curve and it often might turn into a frustrating experience, the playerbase is a little small and the updates come slow and the game might feel that it's lacking content.

However it can be amazingly rewarding, nothing feels as good as returning to the safezone filled with loot (for us rats) to sell/stash, or hitting a godly snipe or outplaying someone and telling him to go touch grass. Your base will never be raided offline and once you learn how to move in this game it'll open up your horizons for many plays and things to do. PvE servers can be good to learn the game, try gear, exprience with base building but eventually i'd recommend trying PvP. Having a squad or meeting people and joining one enhances the experience by a lot and it's really recommended if not required in order to ensure your survival. The game offers decent accommodation to suit many playstyles (even tho sniping is kinda dominant as of right now).

Even if you eventually get tired of the game you can always come back when big updates drop and have some fun. The potential is undeniable and i'd say it's worth a shot to play this game. Deadside has interesting takes in the respawn, base raiding and NPC/AI system and it woult be nice to see them expanded/tinkered with further. Experiencing and learning about stuff for the 1st time is an unforgettable time and it feels really satisfying and fun. Hopefully the game will pick up and become more active and more private communities with rules (against safezone camping, creative events etc) will appear.",1640877106,1649438853,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

The game is beautiful! The map, the militar locations, the villages, the colors, etc but it has some major issues!

- AI and players do not render up 200m! They become ghosted/foggy mostly impossible to see them in a open field! (I play on a 3080 all maxed out)
- Adding animals to hunt like deers, cows, sheeps and some dangerous ones like bears and wolfs will keep the players in the game
- Also the ablity to cook the meat and craft clothes with pelt 
- Decrease a lot the gun spawn. Getting a gun and ammo needs to worth
- Cars, everyone is asking for that

Every now an then i like to back to Deadside to have some fun but after a few hours I get bored cause the lack of content! There's nothing to do beside spawn, get a gun, kill and get killed. You can do a couple of missons to get better guns but in the end that's the same.

It's a PUBG clone that has added base building elements. 
After 7 hours of grinding dying and losing all progress without being able to explore those elements, I have lost interest in continuing the game. 
The PVE combat is annoying. While enemies are easy to kill, they manage to land god shots leaving you running several klicks to hopefully reclaim your items so long as you survive the ambush that's waiting.
I never got to experience the base building aspect because above, and never finding resources/ having inventory space to do so.
You have to make a choice between building a FOB or aquiring enough equipment to survive the ""Scavs""
I never attempted the PVP element because I wanted to run some relaxed servers to learn the game before branching into that.
Speaking of servers, most have very few players. I have never seen more than 10 players on a server. good or bad you decide.
Personally I believe the designers were attempting to frankenstein PUBG, Escape from Tarkov and fortnight into a hardcore extreme survival. they succeeded in creating a monster.

Keep that in mind if you decide to try it. 

The graphics are beautiful, the concept is near perfect. 

Currently the AI is very dumb,  but also lethal, the whole AI system will need to be re-worked in order for it to be playable long term. 

The idea of random missions is great, but there has to be more variety to the type of missions, not just go kill everything, though that type would still be welcomed. 

The loot system works great, but In just a couple weeks of on and off pay, I have been able to obtain every item in the game. So a little more balancing, it is okay to have super rare items. 

I'd love to see an increase in the random patrols/camps of enemies, Seems with very little planning I can make a 3km hike without seeing an enemy. Make it harder!

Love the day/night cycle, keep it long.

Make it harder to find things on the map, too easy for the whole server to all head for the same objectives.

Don't listen to the negative reviews.  Most of these are posted by people who didn't put in the time to learn the game or aren't running the proper connection/system to handle the game.  I Strongly recommend a PVE server to start,  and learn the mechanics.  It may seem like its just a ""grab a gun and go PVP"" game, but it isn't. 

As far as system performance, I have no idea what people are complaining about.  I have my own server, and play on 3 others.  I never lag,  on any server populated or not.  I can only guess, people aren't running a solid connection,  or are on a sub-par machine or both.  The most that's happen to me is I have been disconnected occasionally, but was always able to log right back in without any loss. 

Take the time to learn what the gear does for you,  armor helps a ton against AI and players, guns have vastly different performances and the different gun mobs change the performance even further.  You want certain equipment for certain types of missions etc.  

Learn the AI -  Military AI is MUCH more dangerous than regular scavengers, and their aim is WAY better shocking I know. Some AI will chase you down, and can camp your corpse making getting your stuff back harder.  Learn how base Spawns work,  learn how the respawning device works,  Learn how to drop boxes to store gear to come back and get to sell or use later.  

If you play for an hour on a PVP server,  die 30 times,  then post a rant and demand a refund,  well .....   that's more about you and not the game.

It plays similar to a modded DayZ server, with a slightly more ""arcade-y"" feel to it. The gunplay is nice and fast-paced, the building is (relative to DayZ) pretty simple and intuitive, and building materials are much easier to gather. The safe zones provide just enough to be a nice little loot locker and places to refill on necessities, without giving you access to too much loot, so you still need to go out and earn the good stuff yourself. The missions are a good idea and are executed well. And the raiding system is something that I, as a somewhat regular rust player, am quite a fan of. They heavily attempt to combat offline raiding. When you kill a player, and that player has a base, there's a chance they drop a ""Raid Token"", which allows you to initiate a raid event on their base, and this event enables structure damage on what they've built, as well as the ability to loot the storage boxes within their base. Though, keep in mind, if a player has your raid token, they can initiate the raid whether you are online or not.

I'm quite a fan of how it's shaping up. It currently lacks vehicles, which I'm sure are going to be added at some point in the future, and the game would benefit from it immensely, in my opinion. Also, some form of visible/interact-able wildlife would do wonders for the game world. It can feel a little dead in the runs between places. You can hear birds, though you can't see any, and there are no animals roaming around in the woods, like elk or deer.

My only gripe really (and it's a small one) is that the AI can be a bit strange to deal with. Sometimes they'll just sit there and die to your weak little pistol, and other times they'll be certified snipers that will OHK you from hundreds of meters away. If they were a little more interesting to deal with, without feeling like you're getting BS'd from aimbot, I think they'd be a really cool little map hazard. Right now, they're mostly just inconveniences in between you and loot.

Right now, I'd recommend at its current price point of $20USD. I imagine that price point will go up as more content is added, rightfully so. As it stands, it's a good break from the hardcore nature of DayZ or Tarkov and serves as a refreshing alternative to both.",1648532280,1648705616,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Despite its few shortcomings, it can be fun, if you accept the few downs you will encounter in any PvP game, where you can loose a lot of stuff after beeing killed by somebody else, but really, thats just like real life, isnt it?
But scavenging the Map, and slowly getting better and better gear and weapons feels so good, and is the fun part. Killing with these weapons is even more fun, and can feel so good, even because it is quite challenging, depending on the situation.
Meeting a lost NPC Scav patrol in the open, is completely different than accidentaly coming over a high tier Military Convoy. But with greater challenge, of course comes greater reward. Much, much greater reward.  

I personally like the Base Building, even if I would love to see it beeing expanded. Things like furniture or decorations to make your base unique would make this game close to perfect for me.

The game looks prettier than ever, despite some graphical limitations. The lighting in peticular is so firicking good, and the sun light is so cinematic, it makes me wanna stand there and just watch, and completely forget about the guy hunting my freshspawned Ass, after my third attempt at getting back my first corpse with the good stuff.

The community differs from server to server, but in the end, its a PvP game, so ... DONT ... TRUST .... ANYONE.
Beeeing killed by someone you gave some leftover bandages in the safe zone, just 10 min ago can feel like betrayel, but a lot of times its not out of spite, but out of panic. Shoot first, or risk getting shot yourself. But if your lucky you can actually meet nice people, and even work together in a squad. 

Overall good game,

+Many weapons,bags,armored vests etc.(But I hope they will and more of all and more weapon mods)
+Building base
+Can play solo or with friends( there is VOIP, so you can play with strangers)
+Missions (like heli crash etc.)
+For EA its have a good optimalization

-Sometimes stupid bots, sometimes super snipers with aimbot (AI need some work on it)

Currently, the majority of the game is PVE loot farming which is far too easy, frequent, and consistent in giving you rare and good loot. I think loot should be slightly harder to acquire, especially the ""heavy"" and military gear. Nametags (team IDs that float above you and your squads' heads) should also be removed from the game as it would discourage playing in large groups or roaming with large groups. I would also like to see that this game wipes bi-monthly at least, preferably monthly. This will give new life to the game as early-game combat is very fun and intense whereas late-game combat is stupid as everyone is using 1-2 hit kill weapons. There is nothing wrong with the weapons themselves, but when this kind of PVP is commonplace as opposed to rare, the game gets kind of stale, as loot hoarding is rampant. Also please add weapon and armor durability. I would love to see more early and middle-tier PVP. Please make PVE events rarer and less farmable. I would love to see base raiding made even more commonplace for some intense and high-stakes PVP and allows for players to feel vulnerable about their loot (maybe make the raid token 100% drop?). I want loot to mean something, not just be farmable or commonplace. Otherwise, this game is VERY fun but I can tell it has a ways to go. In the future, I would hope to see a larger map, more players per server, vehicles, new events, vendor missions, new loot (including armors and weapons), and so on. I wish this game will veer away from being too fast-paced while still retaining the very engaging gun-play that it currently has. The community is super nice and like no other out there. In most survival games if I make a play on someone I would expect to be called a slur, in Deadside it's gg's all around. Of course, there are still some shitters, but for the most part, these gamers are some cool folks.

In summary, very fun, a bit too easy, please make raiding common, and make loot a little bit harder. Lots of fun fast-paced gunplay and a very nice community. I recommend.",1646186525,1647813640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A pretty decent survival multiplayer game that has a Tarkov and DayZ mesh feel to it. The game now is finally getting pretty decent updates every month and is on track to be a good game. The game however in its current state still has a bunch of bugs, the weapons needs to be balanced quite a good amount, the way gunfights are done need to be severely updated and made more smooth and clean, it feels quite chunky at the moment. The AI needs to be toned way down as they are always in groups and when you pop a shot off, all of them open up immediately and you instantly die. Gear needs to be reworked as well as armor isn't very well polished. The game though has a lot of potential, map is huge and new areas are constantly getting added, the bunker system is pretty neat and you can build a base and raid bases. Vehicles are getting added in and there are map events that happen like airdrops, convoys and helo crashes that offer players a chance at good gear. The cosmetics like weapon skins and armor permutations could use some hard work as they look horrendous like someone bought a skin off a 5 year old's Etsy shop.

Well it pains me to see that it is not the case,you can still abuse yourself inside bases,bots will still one tap you through solid walls and the game is still the same piece of garbage it was years ago. 

Only ""new"" i discovered with the 3ish hours of gametime was that the water drains -slightly- faster so you aren't cucked madly for dying. That and the new so called missions which are just copies of the original one with a little fancier name. 

I love hardcore games over anything but this is hardcore without skill involved,purely rng with ""do the bots tap or not"" -through best armor/helmet-

I am more of a survival type game player where this is a more PVP oriented game with base building and such, They do have PVE servers but getting fully geared out within a couple hours there nothing left to do. I wish there were more survival aspects to the game, but for what it is, Loot and shoot(I also wish there were more looting of things like dressers and boxes instead of finding things just laying around), its really well done compared to others I have played. It would be neat if they added a leveling system and you level up the more NPCs and players you kill, would add a good progression system to keep people playing and killing.

I grew up in an area that has similar geography and my raiding partner and I spot a lot of locations that look similar to places from our childhood.  The devs are working hard to add more locations to the existing area and to expand the playable area. A lot of players complain about the how much running you have to do. We usually engage autorun as we head to a location, make an attack plan and just joke around while browsing memes. I highly recommend playing this game with friends as the PvE is brutal and you'll need a low-skill meat shield on your team. The combat is challenging and raiding bunkers and doing hard missions requires patience and planning. We had our fair share of rage moments where the Bots locked onto our heads instantly, but we usually were able to laugh it off, get our stuff back, and try again. 

We play on a PvE server as it tends to be more relaxed. Players are friendly and easy going. Players will trade and share among each other at the safe zones or just give gear away to new players. Players on some servers will build crates in safe zones as a community swap. Take a penny, leave a penny so to speak. Safe zones are a great place to chat with other players, share stories, or troll if you really need to get that out of your system.

 The devs published a roadmap at the start of 2022 and have already pushed multiple updates since than. Deadside has an excellent foundation and I recommend this to players who like Tarkov, Dayz, Stalker etc. Deadside has a bright future and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next.",1645989096,1645989096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Squads are dissbanded when you quit the game and enter it again, so every time you get in game again, you need to add ppl in squad to be able to recognize them. There is no prone option, you cant prone in game. I didnt notice difference between bulletproof wests, some cost more, and some less, but in the end you take loads of damage from ""banana"" weapons. I'll update more when i play it a lil bit longer. All in all, nice game with decent ammount of content. Oh yeah, vehicles would be nice ;)

EDIT:
After arround 80 hours in game.

Base building:
I like the idea of stacking foundations and base building is not bad, one issue is that if you dont have enough space in inventory you cant use items from vicinity, and that could be an problem, specially for new players.
Arround base barbed wire fence is disaster to line up, they dont snap at each other and if you don't have a team mate to check the sided if they line up, its really hard to possition them correctly. It would be nice to be able to snap them for better lineup.

SOUND:
One thing i hate in this game, and its footprints possition arround you, the same sound is if player is on the same floor with you or one floor below or above you, you cant be 100% sure where is he.

Final verdict:
Do not waste you money on this game (at least not for now). Official servers are full of cheaters, deadside community is the most toxic one ive seen so far, most of the players are kids with huge ego. Devs do not care much tbh, reporting cheaters doesnt do anything, eaven when loads of ppl report the same players. Game is buggy as hell, you often stuck on base doors, items dissapear, NPC-s are aiming like crazy and trough obsticles. There is a bug when you get killed you cant spawn any more, you just get stucked on ""loading picture"", restarting game, Steam or even computer doesnt do anything...

Immediately following would be some Yes Man insulting the person directly and acting like hes the victim as soon as he gets whiplash.

I have a total of 36 hrs in the game and I believe I have already experienced the most stressful situations the game can make you feel. I have been killed by the AI using a pistol,  a fully gear squad doing an easy mission and a camper who is waiting for players to finish a specific mission, so he/she can steal the cargo.

My PVE experience has been a mixture of stress and entertainment since I honestly enjoy the hardcore aspects of the missions. There are three level of difficulties; easy, medium, hard and epic. The easy and medium missions can be completed by not using a sophisticated gear, while the hard and epic missions require a better gear and more skills since the AI uses better equipment to resist more and do more damage.  However, I believe the AI still needs some adjustments to allow players to complete the mission in a more tactical form. Sometimes the AI can hear you even when you are trying to complete the mission with a pistol using a suppressor. Besides, experience players have found different tricks that make the AI to be killed more easily. In fact, players can be behind a wall and be constantly picking the AI. 

The PVP aspects of Deadside are still very basic to what the game is designed to be. The PVP fights makes me feel as if I were playing PUBG. Its lack of realism allows players to perform irrational plays. Furthermore, I strongly believe that base building should not be implemented at this state since most of the players have made bases near either looting areas or where all the hard missions are located. The spawn system is another big issue that I have noticed during my game hours. It still needs to be adjusted to avoid infinite fights because players who have a base near the area of a certain mission can spawn back with full gear and kill you.

The shooting physics need to be more oriented to realism. I have constantly been killed by a camper using either a VSD or a mosin at more than 200 mts away. In fact, these two rifles can kill you with one shot at any part of the body, so the devs really have to add some changes to that. Moreover, the map looks as if it were designed for sniping only because most of the missions are located in open areas. 

In conclusion, the game looks very promising, but it still needs a lot of work since it has a lot of unbalances when it comes to PVP. I am hoping the devs fix the issues that I stated above and I am looking forward to keep playing this game in the future. Cheers <3.

However it holds certain details that are frowned upon as of now, Some being no cars or not being able to know what weapons do what damage. Although, the game is still in beta form so the game is not finished in terms of things to do and places to go.

Theres a running joke among the very small player base that they should rename it to cross country running simulator 2020 because really theres only 5 hours of content but you spend 3 of that running across an empty map as there a no vehicles or transport. 
The raiding mechanic sucks, building is clunky.
They have put in some work over time but only some, most of which has been spent fixing bugs that made it nearly unplayable early (weird aim jitters, bad hit reg, bad AI), all that has taken 2 years though which speaks to a larger problem in the industry. Dont support kickstarter style game development, youre doing a lot of their work for free.
I dont recommend the game in the state its in unless youre a early access type of person, if your time is valuable wait until it is released full version before looking again.
They had a discord that they removed all the channels and have read only, theres not really anyway to interact with the community unless they have a reddit or something, and just today decided to make emojis instead of work on the things that matter. 
The as i said small player base are also nearly the most unfriendly group of gamers i have come across (2k hrs in rust) so if you dont have friends to play with the harder missions are just too populated to do smoothly and a lot of time is spent trying to recover your body. They did just ""fix"" they spawn mechanic which reduces the longest runs but still CCRS2020.
It looks and plays really well (2080s) and should be a good game in the future if they can pull it all together. 
ill come back in 6 months and add an update.

I refunded it a while back, not sure how long, maybe a year or so ago. 
It was on sale again,  and the reviews were mostly positive now, so I thought maybe it had improved a lot.
Yes I’ve not got many in game hours and that’s because I just find it boring and frustrating.

Here’s my Negatives….
1. Ai….. They are stupid…... I spawned into a new game after dying and all I had was a knife on me, I went into a building and about 7 Ai enemies came in to try and kill me. They had guns!
All I had to do was stand right next to them and slash away while they were shooting/reloading. I took no damage and killed them all with a knife using this method. Because I was stood right next to them they made no attempt to move away and the bullets never damaged me once.
But…
The other scenario is when at ranged attack they become sharp shooters and you can die easily,…

2. Aiming/Movement…. The whole mouse aiming and movement just feels rough and clunky. Very dayZ like which I hate and don’t find enjoyable at all. I really enjoy my fps games but this just feels rough….

I personally don’t think it’s ever going to be a game I look forward to playing, and I always seem to be a sucker for early access, occasionally they surprise.

I’m over my refund time now but I’m not bothered it wasn’t a fortune and you never know maybe in the future it will improve to a state were even I can enjoy it, but I think that’s many years away if ever imo…

Update: 05/02/2022....
I decided to go to a Medium difficulty zone on the map to take out the Ai and get some loot, I had maybe 2 hours in game and had a little gear, but some idiot who was geared up on a PVP server decided to just come and kill me (Yes that's PVP I understand), so all that work up to that point was wasted. 
Totally unfair fight. 
The game is just pointless in this scenario and I would highly suggest that you play PVE only unless you go on the server when its quite so you stand a chance to get better gear, so these fights are more fair!

I think I'm just used to playing far better games, you cant even reload next to walls, Aim over walls without moving back, It's impossible... 
Just a totally frustrating gaming mechanic that needs fixing imo...

Update: 09/02/2022...

Its Fun at times but Gun play is just too frustrating...
Died in the bunker, Couldn't get back to my body in time, Lost it all, so all my hours of game play, pointless... All because the gun play mechanics are terrible. 

Key Likes/Dislikes:

Likes:
1... The concept of the game, PVE looting/Shooting/Getting better Gear.

2...The World is nice to wander round.

3...It keeps you on your toes as far as engagement with Ai at times.

Dislike:
1...Its basically a running simulator, far too much running back and forth to the traders when you've filled your storage. I mean its constant running.

2...The Gun Play is fun yet so frustrating at the same time.  When you cant stand next to a wall and reload or look down your sight its just frustrating as hell. You have to step back a few steps.

3...Ai are inconsistent.",1643680163,1644966649,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True

Even in beta form it is well optimised and relative bug free, in fact it is more stable than other similar games that have been out of early access for quite some time.

The map is a decent size, and is planned to be expanded later in the year. This, along with various other content that has been added to the road map for the coming year, means there is so much potential for the game to get even better. Personally, I feel like Deadside only loosely fits in the survival genre in its current form, but if you like those type of games and want something a little different from the typical zombie/monster/dinosaur shooters definitely check this out.",1644626469,1644626469,True,7,0,0.556360840797424316,0,True,False,True

CONS so far
1) The enemy and its xray vision, night vision and spidey sense, sneaking up on them or trying to ambush them or even hiding in the bushes wearing a full gillie suit, they will see you and can make tactics very difficult at times. Sometimes you can sneak up behind then and pop off enough shots to kill them without them moving, other times they have their back to you and your 300 feet away, crouch walking, you could hear a mouse fart with the amount of noise your making,  and they will spin and get perfect shots on you. Tactics are a hit and miss to pull off. 
(example) During a Medium Difficulty raid, I had the attention of 3 guys who were all firing and focusing on me. My brother went from behind to flank, took nearly 1.5 to 2 minutes (real time.. and that can feel like a long ass time)  of crouch walking to get into position, started to aim at one person and the target did a instant 180 and killed my brother. 

2) The loot for the medium and hard missions are just not worth it, with the enemy and their awesome gunmanship abilities, you will find yourself going through lots of ammo and bandages with little reward to show for it. Sometimes we (my bro and I) discovered it was faster and more rewarding to tackle 2 easy missions than it was to complete 1 medium and there were more rewards to show for it overall..

3) There are no vehicles (yet) so getting around is time consuming. LOTS and LOTS of running.. specially if your dying a lot.. 

4) scavenging in the towns and communities is pretty bland, kill a few bad guys and search through houses to find that it was a waste of time.. nothing much to show for it.. sometimes you can get lots of ammo and a good supply of guns.. 

5) Respawn is VERY annoying, when you die you can only respawn at a town or community close to you, typically that can put you 800M - 1400M away from your body, and you have to go loot it to get your items back. Most of the time, the people who killed you are camping over your body and that can make it a tremendous pain in the a$$ to get it back. (remember they have spidey sense and xray vision, so trying to sneak to your body can be very VERY tough.. ) and respawn has a cool down, so if you die too quick trying to get your body back, you typically have to wait another minute or 2 before you can respawn in the same town 
NOTE: Be careful too.. you can only have 1 dead body marker on the map at a time, so if you die 1000M away and then die after you respawn in the town, your marker 1000M away will vanish and you will not know where your body was.

There are a few others, but at this time I have only played for 15 hours, this game has a lot of potential and the devs seem to be on top of things with communication with the players. 

So right now I would recommend this game.

I hope a lot of new types of missions (bunkers, large bases like an airport thats been converted, caves and secret dwellings) will be added to make exploring a desirable thing for the PVE players, im sure PVP is fun and all, but im not really into those types of game play, there are always a$$hat people who enjoy ruining a game that is PVP by being jacka$$es.. specially when you have to loot your dead body.

As you can see, I don't have many hours played; but I think I've played enough to generate an early opinion on the game... and there is so much potential here. So much. There are definitely some things holding the game back, but under all of that is something very special.

Some things ""holding the game back"", in my opinion (and some others' as well), would be:

- No vehicles or any way to traverse the map any faster than running.
          / Vehicles are on the Deadside roadmap, planned for 2022. There's many things Bad 
            Pixel need to sort out first (mainly server structure, stability/netcode).

- ""Low"" playerbase, SOMETIMES (depending on the definition of low to you).
          / Though I've never struggled to find a server to play on (NA East), I don't doubt that 
            some people have had some troubles, particularly outside of the US/high-pop parts of 
            the EU.
          / For reference, SteamCharts shows Deadside's AVG concurrent players to stay at 
            around ~600 when there hasn't been an update for a bit, and roughly ~1,000 when the 
            hype resurfaces. 

- Slow update pacing/consistency.
          / Update pacing & communication consistency has gotten insanely better as of late, 
            and I suspect that has something to do with the dev team (Bad Pixel) being acquired 
            by publisher TinyBuild, who are known to be quite the indie game publisher (Hello 
            Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, SpeedRunners, and Hellpoint to be their most notable 
            titles as of late).

Despite the things I stated above, the game is very good, and there's no need to worry about things such as how the game is in Early Access. $20 (and even $30 for the supporter edition) is definitely a fair price for the content and fun you receive in return.

NOTE: As for all server-browser based games like Deadside, I recommend joining a non-official server. This way, there are general rules people have to follow (no safe zone camping, for example) & admins enforcing them; and there are also community discords to interact. As for the community: in my experiences, everybody has been extremely kind and welcoming. Almost every server I've joined, I get someone asking if I'm new, giving me tips/a guide to the game, and in some instances even offering me some amazing loot (weapons, armour, etc).

TL;DR: Good game with a good, welcoming community and good devs. Lots of potential and only going to get better throughout 2022 and beyond. Well worth the price, especially if you enjoy games like this.",1624992763,1644268427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So basically I written a bad review after DeadSide came out of the alpha stage. In my review I complained about ""No servers loading, which means I can't play the game at all!""

After a lengthy conversation with the devs in Twitter DM's they said that they were ""currently working on a fix along with more features & optimizations."" BTW I just want to say it wasn't just me with this issue!

I uninstalled the game until the issue was fixed but then never installed it till today. Now the game has had so many optimizations, totally new features & now on the PTS they have a totally new ""Recoil System"" which makes the game more refined but still familiar to the community.

It's nice to see that this company looks and acts on issues that the community witnesses. Not many AAA companies have the motivation to act on issues that plague their games *coughs* Daybreak & Raven Software.",1590267203,1644000810,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Edited review 

So the only reason I'm not downvoting this game is because it has fantastic potential to be a huge game. It just comes down to not enough content in this game to keep people entertained, the dev team is doesn't say anything or push any updates, I get that its a small dev team but this game will die out soon if they don't do anything about it. Its a glorified walking sim and to go back and forth to the same landmarks/missions (and maybe if you have a base). I really do want to continue playing and enjoy the game but with such little content that's not going to happen.

Edited Feb 2nd*

Yeah downvoting this time, don't waste your time and money, devs just make broken promises and don't say anything, the fanbase is filled with idiots and d1ckriders who think the bare minimum suffices. The ""roadmap"" they have has been said 1000 times over and nothing is fixed or added, I can't even state my opinion correctly cause the amount of frustration towards this game just overpowers everything I'm thinking of, verdict is just don't even bother.",1610130568,1643819250,False,0,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,True

Anyways. to the review like i said only 2 hours, but i think i already had some exciting experiences. 
the graphics are nice, but on long range you cant really see anybody and just see some pixels (graphs on max btw) 
unreal engine 5. its wonderful. 
The gameplay is so good. You wont be frustrated when loosing your char, because unlike in other games it doesent take 10 hours to find a somewhat decent weapon. There is no durability luckily, the bot fights are really good. For an early access its alot of fun. But map and item wise, the game is really a early access title, not alot to have, still that doesent break it.
The game is more than good.
Gunplay: it needs tweaking. It feels just rough. (a bit) still the  game is fun weapon wise.

My opinion: its a game i wished for a long time to exist, even on dayz servers with high loot you wont have as much fun as in deadside.

-Player base is actually aids,some of the worst humans beings you will ever meet and im not even saying that towards the gaming aspect of the review, have met people who have threatened/bragged about breaching desktops and DDOSing you...pretty pathetic
-Void of any form of content, this games a running simulator with AI that have either 0 or 100% aim
-""Badmins"" are notoriously power hungry, forget about trying to help out, they scream into your ear like your being paid to help if you slip up on something. Majority of them are grown children and this is their only form of excitement. Not to mention they just spawn themselves loot and inflate the economy of the server.
-Cheaters GALORE, this game spits cheaters out its ass end
-Base building is actually a joke,takes way too long to gather the basic materials needed and only admins have the power to build something actually decent due to the sheer time it takes normally while they just spawn everything in.
-Armor is almost fucking useless, whoopty fucking doo i can take 2 shots from a basic shotgun with the highest tier armor, sometimes STILL getting 1 shotted.

All in all i just cannot recommend this game, I hope it fucking dies or stays in the steam trashcan of games.

The game is well developed, probably more developed than DayZ, but! There is more to do as well as it's easier to build, pvp and do pve stuff. Don't get me wrong, the game is really good for an early access game, but there is always room for improvements. 

Cons: 
When you open doors while standing to close, it teleports you away from the spot you were standing. Just now I opened a jail door in the bunker and got teleported in the wall and had to kill myself to get unstuck. I did lose all my best stuff and I was really angry because it took me a while to get all of that stuff. When you're 200m+ away from the bots, they still are able to kill you with any weapon.

- Door teleporting you when too close.

When I first saw Deadside show up on my recommended queue, I looked straight past it. To me, it looked like another DayZ and from the 'Mostly Positive' reviews I caught a bad drift. So in the end I ended up not buying it. 
But, I decided to take another look recently, and I actually just bought it as there was really not much else that interested me. I thought I'd give it a try and I was hoping for the best. My god, I am glad I took another look at this gem of a game and bought it.
So far, it has been the most extreme fun I have had (gaming-wise) in many months, maybe even longer.
The combat in this game, whether it be against 'Scavs' or other 'real-players' is super intense and leaves you satisfied after any gunfight you may get in to. The movement is fresh and so is the shooting.
Going on loot runs is super fun too!
It has a very welcoming community, and upon first playing, I was a solo player who knew absolutely nothing about the game, and everybody I met gave me gear, helped me out, told me so many great information. Just from playing the past 3 days, I have felt welcomed and have met many great people who I would be thrilled to play more with!

There are tons of things to grind for and looting is far more fun than other survival games.

I play on the EU 200 Server, hopefully I'll see you there!

This beats any other survival game in my opinion and I would highly recommend to get this game ASAP.#

Its honestly sad because i do really enjoy this game even tho guns dont feel very good and AI are bad, its just annoying when i try everything i know and see online and still just do to an AI thats shooting me from 100m away through all the trees. hope you can actually fix this to be a somewhat enjoyable game and not the heap of frustration it is currently",1642524966,1642524966,False,3,0,0.504491746425628662,0,True,False,True
895400,108276503,76561198298268871,0,6,629,0,616,1642644144,"The game in general is pretty bare bones and a good starting game for those who are new to the open world survival shooter. Do I recommend it? That would depend on what are you expecting, when I got it, I was expecting a DayZ like experience, and wouldnt you know it, that was exactly what I got with a twist slash bonus. Game doesnt revolve on PVP interactions to get loot. There are missions and constant events to keep you entertained without the need of other playes, though, keep in mind other players can got to the event site without notice and engage you. Crafting is pretty simple yet a bit tedious considering that there a no hints or guides for new players. The survival aspects is pretty basic, just eat and drink and you are pretty much good to go. The AI can be either stupid or damn right cracked and will at times flank you and pursue you if you are not aware of your surroundings.

Now my problem starts with one of its core mechanics, the shooting part. Along side its movement which feels clunky and unresponsive. You definitely need to practice alot i order to get the hang of things specially in firefight with both AI and players. Most times you are gonna be standing still so your aim doesnt jump all over the place. Another issue is the performance, this I might expressing on my personal side of things but the game crashes a lot despite having a decent rig. FPS goes all over and one second Im over 100 fps on low settings and then drops to low 30s maybe at times 20s. Sounds and animations need a ton of work cause it feels, looks and sounds trashy. like PS1 era trashy. Guns sound borderline the same across the board, might only identify if its rifle or pistol. thats it. It does not matter if its a shotgun, hunting rifle or ar it will sound the same, only give away would the rate of fire on some occasions. 

Over all, I give this game a 6/10 and im being generous due it having potential despite being simplistic. Hopefully the devs get their act together and rise to the ocassion.",1642524828,1642524828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I bought deadside roughly a year ago and I absolutely LOVE this game. For an early access game, the graphics are stunning, there are so many features, base building feels flawless, the proximity chat makes this game an absolute blast, and the ability to host your own servers off of GPortal is amazing for customizability! No server is alike and I absolutely love that. Some servers have loot drops cranked to high so you're always in the action with high tier loot, and some servers are a little more grindy and laid back. Some servers even host events with their communities! The game on its own if it didnt have these servers would be bland 100%. I just love that fact that even once you've done everything the game has to offer, you can also bank off of communities to make even more fun out of the game with their own ideas. This game is utterly stunning visually, and I 100% recommend it if you are looking to get into a rust/tarkov style game.

My only issues with this game is the scavs having deadshot accuracy through foliage. I could be through trees, bushes, and tall grass and one dude with a Mosin will absolutely destroy me without me even being able to see him. They do 100% need to adjust that because I've died more times than I'd like to admit because of that. Base building, although I said it was flawless, is REALLY tedious. Some servers can make it less tedious by having a starter kit that gives you some stuff to build your base, but not all servers do that. Loads of people complain about trees not falling down when you cut them, but I see that as a feature as you can build around a tree and have it inside your base so you can gather wood from safety to build up your base with ease. It does however take a really long time to gather wood from trees, and convert it from logs to planks, and from planks to either beams or plywood depending on whatever you're planning on making. I've noticed when cutting trees that sometimes it will say that you gain ""2x Logs"" or ""4x logs"" from hitting the tree. However it only actually gives you one log per 2 tree hits. If they actually incorporated RNG into the trees to make you have a chance to get more logs per hit, it would make the base process SO MUCH EASIER. My last complaint is with travelling. I have no clue if vehicles will become a thing, I saw the devs say that adding vehicles would take a long time because of hitboxes or something along those lines (which makes sense). But if they do actually incorporate vehicles I will literally be glued to this game permanently. Travelling is torture sometimes especially as they grow the map to be even bigger with every update. As they expand even more, boats and cars would be greatly appreciated.  

Never said this game is perfect, as it is in early access. I will say though, the developers seem extremely committed to the project, and I have no doubts that this game will go far once a few more vital updates release. I 100% suggest this game if you're on the fence about buying it. Just know what you're getting into when you buy it as it is in Early Access.",1641617500,1641617500,True,10,0,0.662798702716827393,1,True,False,True

I want to start with saying I understand this is a small dev team and that I knew that going in. This game is not (to me) worth $15 - YET. Could it be? Sure, I see potential, but the issue is this game is a freakin running simulator at this point. 

The map is pretty large but super sparse. There are few buildings and what buildings there are I'd wager to say half are blocked off or severely limited (think like OG stalker). 

I was torn between this and SCUM and I wish I'd gone that route, there seem to be more players and more than just roving scavs. I am irritated about having to spend the majority of my time running around the map. It is mostly trees and fields - the ""towns"" are kind of a joke, we're talking 2-3 sheds in most cases. 

The gunplay is decent - not Insurgency or Rising Storm good... but decent. 

Graphics - real nice, no complaints there. 

Gear? Eh... could be more of a selection or customization. 

This is NOT Tarkov. It is like the step-child murder-hobo sim. If that. 

I hope this game gets better, we see cars and gear ubiquitous, and maybe even warring factions, idk, but as it stands, WAIT. Give this game a year or two or three (if it lasts that long - they can pull the plug at any point because as I said earlier I think this company is like 5 people?). 

If you love running in games - this game is for you. Not saying it can't be good but right now it feels like proof of concept at best and has no business being over $10. 

Oh well... will update if game improves and stops being running simulator 2022. I DO NOT recommend this game at this time.",1640795894,1640795894,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are no obnoxious, annoying and pointless zombies running around, The gun play is fun, realistic enough, without being overly done and annoying. The inventory system could be better, there is no auto splitting when trying to stack items like ammo, So if you have a stack of 84 ammo, and a stack of 24  ammo that are the same type, and want to create a stack of 100, you cant just drag and drop, you have to do the math, split it so that it hits 100 on the dot. Super annoying and not neccesary. You cannot put guns in bags which is extremely silly, if you want to balance it then you should have the guns take up more space or have them encumber the player. while reloading you cannot close or open doors, you cannot look in your inventory, its rather annoying. I love the map and ping system, it provides a ton of value and information to the player, and showing team mate position is extremely nice. I cannot wait for vehicles to be added to the game, as having to run 3-5 km everytime you die gets very boring and exhausting. Also not being able to put an EMPTY bag into an open inventory slot makes no sense at all. I would understand not being able to put a full bag into an inventory  space, but its current state doesn't make sense. All in all this game is great, with some patches, UI optimization, and added content, this game could easily be the best in the genre, It just doesn't have enough content to hold the attention of the player base for very long, and i think this is a contributor of why the servers seem empty.

The good:
+Its good looking
+it has a very simple gameplay loop
+easy to get a weapon and kill something
+guns and gunplay feeling allright

The bad:
-camping save zones is a thing
-spawning next to players or npc is a thing
-logging somewhere else in than you logged out is a thing
-obtaining food and drink is only possible with buying..
-building a base needs a ton of stuff and endless hours of time
-cant turn of damn annoying mission notifications
-climbing works very unreliable (can cost your life in some situations)

I dont know?

But the game overall feels empty and doesn't have a lot to do in it. Transportation is also problematic since the map is big, somewhat empty, plain looking and there's nothing to drive either, at least not yet. Inventory management like item stacking, swapping and crafting needs to be reworked as it is also quite tedious and somewhat clunky. Base building is needlessly tedious and hard to do as well as not worth it because the trader is just the superior way to store your items since it cannot be raided. Lastly, it could use a better hitreg and net code.

Overall the game needs a lot work for me to invest more hours into. But it has a lot of potential that i don't want to see go wasted.",1640051599,1640052086,True,24,2,0.675153017044067383,0,True,False,True

So until they change server providers i cannot recommend this game to anyone.

Edit: Bad Pixel has really stepped up they have put out many announcements for in-game content, they have given a sneak peek of vehicles and for the most part their servers aren't that bad anymore, this makes me very happy and i will once again be playing this game :)

Deadside is a game I have come back to multiple times but has the same flaws that make me leave after a few hours of play. The lack of reliable strafing and shooting leads to a very slow pace with a very fast time to kill, yet when playing to the games strengths as a solo you are quite frequently met with backlash from the community and server admins (since high pop 1st person only servers are mostly private) which commonly leads to a server wide witch hunt or a swift server ban. So if you are looking for a slow paced early development 1st/3rd person shooter which favors taking time and positioning over ego pushes and raw aim fights Deadside is a great game. Deadside is also very fun with friends and has a variety of servers tailored by private owners to make the game as fun as possible. However if you are like me and want something 1st person, skill intensive (specifically aim wise), and with a survival twist this isn't the game for that.

Reasons:
1. 1026 hours in game and they Ban you because of people with no skills mass reporting you.
2. Game is dieng slowly, player base is going lower and lower daily. now there is less than 690 players globally in 100 different servers and going down all the time. https://steamcharts.com/app/895400 link for stats.
3. Updates comes very slowly and usually when there is an update nothing really changes.
4. In a good day server might be almoust full few hours of the day or mostly in nighttime. (European time) So if you want to play around 8am - 18.00 pm you hardly see any players only bots. 
5. Real cheaters can roam free without fear getting banned, Devs dont do shait about it and when you try to discuss about it in Discord they ban you there for talking about the real problems. 
6. Very toxic players 
7. Racism is cool in this game you can write chat what ever you want without getting penalty, beleive when i say anything.
N-words flying all the time. 
8. Official servers there is no Admin support anykind and private server Admins usually protecs their little puppets who are clearly using cheats. UNITED GUNNERS Server is good example of this.
9. If cheater gets banned usually hes back in few hours or maybe it takes 1 day.

Few other reason.

10. FPS drops in high pvp areas even with high end PC
11. Hit Registery issues.
12. Running simulator, no cars, no nothing. If you die in wrong place you need to run 10 min back to your body.
13. alot of glitches, people can still steal your loot in base in small boxes.
14. you can shoot through walls, if you know how. sometimes even through floors.
15. Bots are fucked up, you get 1 shot to head even you have full gear (lvl3 helmet and armor). i am not saying they should make them easy but sometimes its impossible to see where bots is and he can see you.
16. If you want to play this game Solo its not game for you unless you play PVE server. 
17. Constant Gun nerving, People are complaining about getting killed because someone has better weapon. (Grenade launcher and snipers for example.)
18. Raid token that players drop wont always work. 
19. sometimes you drop raid token almoust every time even the change is like 10-20%
20. building glitches, if you open door you are stuck and you need to log out and log back in.
21. Teleport glitch. (You can teleport if you know how).
22. No Step sound glitch on stairs and bunker.
23. Raiding is way too easy. 
24. you get hackusate almoust everytime you kill someone.
25. Nighttime you can change your graphics card settings to make it look like a day so you can easily kill players who think they are safe because of the nighttime.
Alot of more Problems that will not be fixed never.

Game is aight

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A game with a lot of potential but is killed by the people who run the servers. 

For the overall experience, even after playing well over 5 servers, I'm going to use the Sweet Baby Wayne's server for reference. We had just bought the game, loaded in, and had went to go look at the safe zones. When we got to one, on the Sweet Baby Wayne server, we were harassed by admins and moderators for being ""poor"" and not having much supplies or gear. Again, we had JUST bought the game no more than 20 minutes prior. We didn't say anything back and let them talk their smack. We left and came back to the safe zone a second time to STILL be harassed by the admins and mods. Finally we spoke up and called them out for treating new players like that and called them ""tools"". No more than 10 seconds later, myself along with 4 friends were all banned from the server.

We thought.. ""Okay, it was just a bad server lets try another one"". Got on the new server, meanwhile trying to figure out the entire game and the clunky mechanics, and began farming. We had made our way to the next safe zone to sell some stuff. Spoke once in game chat, and the SAME ADMIN FROM THE LAST SERVER is the admin of THAT server as well. He heard my voice and said ""Oh I know who that is"" and banned my friends and I for LITERALLY no reason.

That was my experience on Deadside and it pushed my entire group away. Sucks I played just slightly longer than the refundable amount because I would have instantly returned the game. Shitty communities on games ruin the chances for games to grow.",1591675977,1638410927,False,2149,175,0.911896824836730957,0,True,False,True

Gun Play
Animation
Challenging Bots that flank you

Con's:
Dead World
Running Simulator
Weak Customization (Guns, Character)
Weak Base Building
Weak Survival Options


Let's be real... after playing this game for a while, I gotta say that Deadside needs a serious increase of CONTENT. There's just simply not enough to do on the game and Deadside just can't compete content wise with other games like DayZ, SCUM, Rust, etc.

What's the solution? Honestly... here me out. I think they should forget the DayZ clone and ""Tarkov the ♥♥♥♥"" out of this game! Make Deadside darker, grittier, increase the bots in areas. Add more zones, some type of extract system, give us more guns and customization options. Add more locations, make a base system or something similar to Tarkov's (a place to store loot). Simply put... make an ""Open World"" Tarkov Game.

That didn't fix many of the underlying problems in my opinion, even though it was a good addition to the game. But with that being said, I want to like this game, so that's why I'm putting the time into this text wall in hopes the devs see it and make changes.

The biggest problem in my opinion is the world being way too big to have to run everywhere. I feel like 2/3 of my play time is spent running. I had a cargo drop 4km away and ran toward it, got 3k in and it disappeared. I was the only one on the server. Add a timer for events/missions please.
I see car batteries and spark plugs to loot and sell, so I'm assuming they will be adding vehicles at some point. When I see that update I'll be excited to check it out and possibly change my review.

Another glaring problem is the bots having sniper rifles, and almost no items adding armor until late game(I think?). Matter of fact, you lose half your storage if you wear a vest that has armor, because it doesn't have storage slots, which is a useless mechanic imo. It's frustrating to run an easy mission and get one-tapped by a bot with a sniper rifle because I have no armor. Maybe only allow bots in epic missions to have snipers.

Speaking of storage, you can't carry extra guns. Guns are what you sell to make the most money from what I've seen, and if you take a good gun out to use, you can't loot other guns to sell. It says you can use a special backpack to store them in but I haven't found it yet. I had the most expensive backpack I could buy and still couldn't store guns.

Items have no tooltips displaying stats. I have no idea what's an upgrade and what isn't. Is military clothing better than others, or is it all cosmetic? Is the gun I found better than what I have equipped? I have no idea, and I don't want to have to watch youtube videos and memorize what people have tested.

I don't like the respawn system. You have to use tokens to respawn at set locations, which isn't a bad idea, but if I do a mission that's close to my base and die, I can't respawn at my base because it's too close. That's really annoying to random spawn on the other side of the map or at a trader that's way further than my base.

You can only have 3 storage chests in your base (6 if you count the three tiny chests you can also get) I like to hoard items, so this is a minor problem for me.

With that being said, I really like how the game looks, and the wide variety of guns.

 I like how you can't be offline raided like in Rust. You have to be killed and drop a raid token, creating an hour window that your base is able to be raided. The base building is different, and a grind, but I do like that too. Building scaffolding to attach your walls/floor/roofs to, it's a cool idea. Even if 100k for a single lock to secure your base is very high. 

The game is well optimized and runs smooth. Active devs and solid servers.

I feel bad leaving a negative review on this game, knowing that if a few of these major problems were fixed, it would easily be a great game that I'd put hundreds of hours into. But I just can't recommend it now. I was going to buy it for a friend, but I'll wait until vehicles are added. Keep up the good work devs, you're on to something with this game.

Let's be real... after playing this game for a while, I gotta say that Deadside needs a serious increase of CONTENT. There's just simply not enough to do on the game and Deadside just can't compete content wise with other games like DayZ, SCUM, Rust, etc. 

What's the solution? Honestly... here me out. I think they should forget the DayZ clone and ""Tarkov the Fuck"" out of this game! Make Deadside darker, grittier, increase the bots in areas. Add more zones, some type of extract system, give us more guns and customization options. Add more locations, make a base system or something similar to Tarkov's (a place to store loot). Simply put... make an ""Open World"" Tarkov Game. 

If the developers do that... this game will have a huge market of hungry players logging in all the time. Instead of empty servers or servers with a maximum of 10 players.

PROs:
~ Decent starting challenge. Fighting enemies and finding weapons and resources is not a cake walk having only a knife.
~ Large, open, detailed map.
~ All the general survival game stuff. Resource collecting, base building, etc.
~ Combat is a good challenge. The lack of hit markers and hit direction indicators makes you use caution instead of just run and gunning it. 

NEUTRAL:
~ Inventory space is very limited. This leads to some aggravation when looting, but makes you stop and consider what would be more useful.

CONs:
~ The large map makes it a pain to get around at times.
~ Lack of weapon/gear stats in descriptions sometimes makes it difficult to make gear decisions.
~ Land claiming is a bit too restrictive, especially on PVE servers.
~ The AI enemies are pretty aggressive and the lack of markers occasionally lead to deaths without even knowing where you're shot from.",1636679853,1636679853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Maybe not in depth, but more like in the whole package category. 

The gameplay loop is simple enough - you do a couple of missions, and once you have a decent inventory at the trader,
it will take you a very short time to loot up and be back in the action with the most geared guys in your server.

Thank god hunger isn´t a problem in this game (it´s very basic, theres a plenty of food and i´d love for it to stay that way.

At around 15-hour mark I felt like I´ve done almost everything this game has to offer. Endgame and raiding for me is also very basic at the moment and personally I would play something else if I was looking to raid.

The AI is a bit weird at the moment, bots shhoting trough the bushes while being completely invisible to the player
isn´t fun. At least for the player.

The game is far from ready, but there´s much fun to be had right now. Can´t wait to see what this game will be in a year
or so. The budget Tarkov + budget DayZ approach hits the spot for me. Just please don´t ruin it.

Any moron can follow a YouTube guide and go in this game just to grief others. I deleted the game after 3 hours, I consider it a waste of $20. Hope I can save you the cash with an honest review.

 the safe zones take that feel away.

 they should show some missions for people to do and you should be able to select missions that not everyone can see on map.

First and foremost, let's discuss the pros:

-Combat is very much like any hardcore combat game, Tarkov, PUBG, etc. there is a minimal hud so you know what you're doing, but it doesn't interfere with gameplay to the point where it feels arcade-y.
-The world is well developed to an extent. I'm guessing some of the map is either undeveloped and is roadmapped for a later date, but it's sort of a weird shape. Also, from what I found there's no transportation other than foot travel, so you best be okay with running long distances. I'm okay with this, but it definitely feels like there should be better modes of transportation.
-The inventory system is unique and I kind of like it. You don't have infinite space in your backpack and thankfully not limited by a weight system. Each equipment item you use has inventory space, so it's not like you're limited to a small backpack.

Again, the game has promise, however after playing under 2 hours with someone else, I refunded the game. Here's why:

-The crafting and building system is probably the worst I've ever experienced (and I play a lot of crafting games). I could have been doing something wrong, but at the root of the system, there are glaring flaws. For instance, placing a land claim was incredibly difficult. It's literally just a sign you put in the ground somewhere, and it took us 15 mins just to find an acceptable place to the game. The logic behind building a base seemed incredibly complex. I can understand needing a ""scaffold"" to build on top of, but you can't place walls on top of a scaffold with an existing deck. You'd think that a wall would sit nicely on top of a deck right? Wrong. If the game is going to claim anything about base building/survival, this needs to be fixed. This was the main reason I refunded my purchase.
-The AI is kind of broken. I actually enjoyed being randomly ambushed by AI, but they usually held pistols/shotguns and tried to shoot me from a 100 yards away giving up their position before I could easy kill them. On the other hand, attacking events/missions and the AI would headshot me from 300 yards out. It just seemed like you either fought AI turned down to 1 or turned up to 100.
-After just short of 2 hours of gameplay, my friend and I felt like we've already seen all the game has to offer. The missions were short lived, simple go here, attack this... Perhaps we were missing the premise, but at its core, the game felt one dimensional and empty. This is where I hope to see the most improvement. Well, this and crafting/building.

All said, I really hope this game takes off. It is fun, but fundamentally broken in its current state. I would love for the devs to release server files for private servers, because this is something I could see myself and friends sinking tons of hours into someday.",1635427733,1635427733,False,4,0,0.517985641956329346,0,True,False,True

The game is well optimized and pretty nice at times. The content is a bit lacking now but it's already very enjoyable if you like games like Tarkov, Dayz or even Rust. Here in contrary to some other multiplayer openworld survival games no need to run a long time, or risking a flu, for looting deadly weapons and have great gunfights in this game.

The sound system could be improve and the world could be deeper but nothing really important is missing or really broken from what I saw. The core gameplay loop is good and rewarding.
