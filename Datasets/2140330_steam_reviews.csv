I bought this game and I turned the FPS to uncapped and made the graphics high as my PC should be able to handle it. It immediately sounded like a spaceship taking off. I looked at my CPU temps and it was peaking at 90 degrees Celsius. I looked on the EA forums and it is a bug that the game runs entirely off you CPU and not on your GPU. The EA staff member replied telling people to check BIOS and there was nine pages of people telling him he's wrong and not a single reply. This apparently existed in Madden 23 for PC and was never fixed. Don't fry your CPU trying to play a cash grab of a football game,1708920035,1708920035,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even for my friends who HAVE been able to get the game running, it's SO unoptimized and poorly ported. We've experienced constant severe graphical issues (so bad they could potentially be a seizure risk), and just TERRIBLE performance even on monstrously high spec PCs.

The announcers are calling out the wrong names for players. They have no algorithm to match you against similar teams. The only way you can play with friends using an NFL team is through superstar mode (just make it an option in exhibition to play with friends). I think it would be so cool to do 7v7 or 11v11 in a game with dedicated positions. Anyways EA literally sucks at making anything nowadays so my advice is to avoid. Next year I will buy it when it is half off. I love football and hate what this piece of shit company has done.,1708525386,1708525386,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For example: I created a QB with the undrafted rookie option. His overall was about 61. It put me at 3rd on the depth chart but for some reason, at the beginning of every preseason game, the coach sends me a message talking about his expectations for me for the game and which quarters I'm going to be playing. Problem with that is that my guy never sees the field. Then the game registers that as my character underperforming and then I get negative messages from the coach about my performance (even though I didn't play a single snap) and this goes on for a few weeks into the regular season about how poor my performance has been until, one week, you get a message for the OC saying that if you don't perform well in the next game you are going to get cut. Don't play a single snap. I apparently didn't meet expectations from my spot on the bench. Get cut a few weeks into regular season. Stuck at an overall of about 65. Can't practice or do anything else to raise overall while on the Free Agent list. Nobody wants a QB with such a low overall. Stuck on Free Agents without any offers for a couple years without any contract offers (even as a backup) before giving up. Tried this a few different times with a few different teams with the same exact result every time. Fix this by making the game recognize that your character isn't a starter (or even getting any snaps for that matter) and I might be able to enjoy this.

EDIT: Apparently the game crashes every time I try to do training camp as a coach in franchise mode as well.",1707364704,1708395055,False,5,1,0.571099400520324707,0,True,False,False

It goes further than any other madden to not feel ""animation locked""  The running, passing and contact between the players feel organic and dynamic.  Not perfect, but pretty darn good.  Free form passing is great - it opens up the playbook and makes variety of routes more viable.  I haven't ran into any game breaking bugs yet.  Menus are slowish to respond.  Routinely get small stutters when returning kicks, but other than that, performance seems passable. about a 6/10.  Running around 100 fps on a 4080 with ultra graphics.

Moreover, Madden 24 fails to innovate or introduce any significant new features to the franchise. Instead, it feels like a rehash of previous games with minor tweaks and updates. This lack of innovation makes the game feel stale and outdated, especially when compared to other sports games that are constantly pushing the boundaries of gameplay and realism.In conclusion, Madden 24 can be considered a terrible video game due to its lackluster gameplay, and poor graphics and presentation. Rather than building upon the strengths of previous iterations, Madden 24 fails to innovate or deliver a compelling experience for players. As a result, many fans of the franchise have been left feeling disappointed and disillusioned, longing for the days when Madden was synonymous with excellence in sports gaming.",1708029378,1708029378,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I went through this bullshit for over an hour, only to be met with the single worst camera angle I have ever seen. I have no idea why, but EA thought it would be a fantastic idea to completely remove the classic camera angle when playing superstar as a QB. I do not want a ""realistic"" QB camera angle. I am not a QB, let alone an NFL QB. Give me the classic camera angle, not this stupid shit that makes it hard to see. As far as I can tell this camera angle only exists in superstar mode. Which makes the whole thing even more astounding. It wouldn't be a problem if you could change it to the normal angle; after all, there is nothing wrong with giving the player more options. But you do not have any options, you are forced into this stupid ass camera. It is possible to zoom out using the dpad, but this is not changing the angle, it is just zooming out. Which is a band-aid solution to a stupid ass problem that EA created. This is the first time I have played a new Madden since Madden 25.

If you don't have a prior version, and you've $20 to toss at something unimportant, then go for it.
Otherwise, stay away.

If you play a special mode, like SuperStar, be prepared for horrible UI moments, where you want to skip to the end of the post game XP/Commercials - only to find it seemingly go to the end, and then back to the beginning, so you have to skip to the end once more.
It's almost like they think that flashy animated splash images and whooshing sounds are needed to constantly stimulate our brain, and if you try to avoid them, the game gets angry. As though you skipping the items is invalidating the life's work of someone, so you MUST/WILL be exposed to them and you SHALL enjoy them!
I used to dabble in Ultimate Team mode, however, the UI special effects in that one seem to require more CPU/Video Card power than the actual game with how lag ridden it can be, and heavens forbid you try to navigate faster than it's effects want you to, as when it catches up, you've shot right past where you wanted to be, or reset things to start back at the beginning.",1707658172,1707658172,False,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

Defensive coverage mechanics being the first that comes to mind. Receivers can often get bumped by covering defenders, which is fine, however the game does not have an animation for this sometimes. This leads to the ball being sent to where the receiver SHOULD be, based on their route, but does not account for the models colliding. This almost always leads to an interception, or just missed pass (labeled perfect accuracy). It is extremely frustrating in close games where every down counts, too many games have been lost due to this bug. 

Also, there are still plays and schemes that allow defenders to breach the line of scrimmage unimpeded by blockers. This obviously makes sense when the defense sends 5-7 on a blitz, but there is some scheme to have a free rusher when only sending 4...

EA is fucking garbage, buying this game is worse than literally taking a shit and wiping your ass with $100 and flushing it away.

*Edit 2* as i sit here waiting 20 minutes for this garbage to load i just cant help but think how terrible of a job EA does with everything they touch. there is no excuse for games that dont even launch when youve made them every year for over 25 years. EA is the worst company ever. 

*EDIT* they keep asking me to revise my review so I will. this game doesnt even launch because of this garbage EA App. dont give shitty companies like them your money, they cant even make a game that will launch. now when it does load i have no audio. the controls are absolute garbage,they are super clunky and never go where you want the character to, they expect you to change to the defenders to make the play but you have no idea what character your going to switch to so it almost alwasy causes you to give up a touchdown, Fuck EA, they only make games perform like shit because they know we are stupid enough to buy it. Dont be a complete fucking moron like me, tell them this garbage is unacceptable by not buying it. i cant believe they can make a game over 25 times and have this inexcusably terribly executed piece of shit they left us with. 


for $70 and being a reskin of the same game every year, youd think theyd be able to make it run better. my PC specs blow away the recommended settings yet my game constantly crashes (atleast it autosaves every play mid game) but it takes forever to load because the EA app is garbage. the EA app causes all sorts of issues, its why im constantly crashing, its why im giving this a negative review. 
on top of that, the menus are terribly slow. there is no reason the menus should be this slow when everyhting is running off of SSD's. it makes the franchise mode an absolute chore because its half games that crash and the other half is slow menus. 
and the worst part it takes forever to start, its been trying to launch on my computer for over 10 minutes right now and the bar is around 15%.

All those issues are technically fixable, but they wont fix it, its EA. if you can get this at a discount and havent played a madden game in years, i am having fun when it works still

In online games (and even in offline games versus the CPU), the game play suddenly transitions into slow motion at the exact moment the ball is snapped, on top of imposing input lag, rendering the game essentially unplayable. I have tried time and time again to resolve this issue by verifying the game files and running the application as an administrator to no avail. Furthermore, while the application is running, I have attempted to set the affinity in task manager for the application in an attempt to reduce the CPU utilization, just for the program to notify me that I don't have permission to do so, despite the fact that I am logged in on this PC as an administrator, and can set the affinity for other applications while they are running. Everything I have done to aid in helping the game operate as intended (including adjusting the in game graphics settings to the lowest possible, along with prioritizing high performance in the NVIDIA control panel) has led to no change in performance whatsoever. I am not the only one experiencing these issues as well, as plenty others are having the same issue as me. EA has offered no solution to this problem, despite the game having been released in August of 2023. 

If there was any video game company that should not have the sole rights to make an NFL game, it would be EA. As it turns out, EA has procured the sole license to produce these games, and it doesn't take a genius to realize that EA is the ONE company that should not be afforded this privilege considering their track record. Year after year, EA releases this unplayable, creatively bankrupt, and downright execrable garbage and demands 60 (now 70) dollars for it. The most concerning part about this practice is that it works, because EA understands that the NFL is the golden goose of the sports entertainment industry in the United States, and by extension know that this industry is incredibly profitable. Fans of the NFL want an engaging and realistic experience to let their passion for football be expressed through the medium of gaming. Once again, EA knows this and expends the bare minimum effort because EA knows that their product is the closest thing that the average NFL fan will get to expressing this previously mentioned passion. As a result, the fans have no choice but to submit to the morally corrupt institution that is EA.",1707335500,1707335500,False,3,0,0.50109410285949707,0,True,False,False

My PC is what myself and others would consider to be a very nice build that can handle just about any game on maximum settings. And I know this to be true because I have played every single game in my library (including other Maddens) on this exact PC and have had hardly any performance issues. However, this game is absolutely atrocious and simply not playable. Upon start up of the game, my frame rate drops from 120 to 8, and stays that way until the game is fully loaded. Not a huge deal though, as once I get through all of the bullshit advertisements for Ultimate Team that I'm not interested in are gone, I can then select the game mode I want to play. Here's where things start to go sour. No matter what game mode I select to play, my frame rate will immediately cut in half. The game also stutters and freezes throughout this entire process, but the best is yet to come. Once I've loaded the game that I want to play, (which only takes about 10 minutes) my game will freeze after the first few plays, if not sooner, and my frames will never hit over 5 fps.  EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. Without fail. I have put just over 30 hours onto this game, and for this to be an issue for not only myself, but a multitude of others that I have seen complain about similar issues on Discord and Reddit is unacceptable. I deserve a full refund for a piss poor product that doesn't function, however I don't expect to receive one from the money hungry suits at EA.

EDIT


Madden 24, the latest blunder from the illustrious EA, continues the trend of disappointment and frustration, underscoring the company's blatant disregard for its player base. As we dissect the wreckage of this game, it's impossible to ignore the stranglehold EA maintains on the NFL license, turning a once-thriving franchise into a predictable and lackluster cash grab.

EA's Monopolistic Stranglehold:
A talking point that screams from the mountaintops - EA's exclusive grip on the NFL license is nothing short of a slap in the face to gaming enthusiasts. The absence of competition has left Madden gamers at the mercy of a company more interested in profit margins than delivering a cutting-edge gaming experience. The monopoly not only stifles innovation but also extinguishes any hope of a fresh, competitive alternative to challenge Madden's mediocrity.

Stagnation and Apathy:
EA's monopolistic position has transformed the Madden series into a breeding ground for stagnation and apathy. Why bother innovating when there's no one else in the arena? Madden 24 is a prime example of this lackadaisical approach, with recycled features, half-baked improvements, and an overall sense that the company is content to coast on its exclusive NFL license without pushing the boundaries of gaming excellence.

Player Feedback, or Lack Thereof:
With no competitors nipping at their heels, EA seems to have plugged its ears to the cries of Madden gamers. Glaring issues persist from one release to the next, and the company's indifference to player feedback is as glaring as the flaws in their games. The lack of choice leaves fans with the bitter taste of neglect, as they witness their concerns falling on deaf corporate ears.

A Call for Change:
It's high time for gamers to demand more from EA. The monopolistic hold on the NFL license has given rise to a culture of complacency, where profit takes precedence over player satisfaction. As Madden 24 languishes in its sea of glitches and unfulfilled promises, it's clear that a shake-up is needed. NFL gaming enthusiasts deserve more than a company that treats them like captive customers in a one-sided relationship.

Conclusion:
Madden 24's failings are not just the result of EA's neglect; they are amplified by the company's monopolistic grasp on the NFL license. It's a disheartening reality for gamers who yearn for innovation, competition, and a gaming experience that reflects the passion they have for the sport. EA's actions speak louder than their marketing promises, and as long as they maintain this stranglehold, Madden gamers are left with a bitter taste of disappointment and a company that couldn't care less.",1692854974,1706760136,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're open? no you're not, because the db that u just smoked by 15 yards WILL catch up to u and fly high like prime Jordan and 360 swat that ball. Also mind you, your QB will purposely throw at the DB even when they're not pressured, JUST so they can swat the ball.
BUT, the opponent's AI qb WILL make every throw on STRIDE, and ur guy will just wait until they catch to TRY to tackle them, and then get planted on the floor with stiff arm.

They have completely removed the fun out of a football game. They want you to rely on penalties and screens every game, to make it ""realistic"" How about you just let me fucking play how i want madden, huh?

Every mode is a mind-numbingly awful experience and a massive waste of time. The career/superstar mode has no immersion in terms of story line and they refuse to fix the early retirement glitch. If I rush for 8000 yards and 84 TDs on All Madden you better fucking believe I'm gonna ask for more money than you're offering me. MUT, in my opinion, is only fun for MUT Squads. However, if you dare to play cross-platform with friends you'll be in for a world of fun with about 2-3 seconds worth of input delay that makes the game nearly unplayable. They also do nothing to Superstar or Franchise mode so they're barely worth even looking at. Just another fucking stinker by EA. I guess that shouldn't surprise anyone though considering that Madden is probably just some experiment conducted by the government to see if zoo animals are smart enough to code a functioning game. And while I'm at it too I'll say that this is a ridiculously disrespectful way to honor John Madden. Please stop making him roll over in his grave with this series and just end it or just call it ""Football Game _"". I guess the one good thing about this game is that I'd rather take my fat ass outside and touch grass before I load this shit up again so thanks for that EA. Maybe that was their plan all along. Just make a really shit game to encourage people to actually go outside or something. But that's just speculation and they're probably not smart enough to do that anyway! Now that I'm done ranting I hope the people that read this pick something up from my review and save themselves some money cause I sure as hell didn't. But yeah fuck madden and fuck EA.

Decided to finally give this one a shot despite the many poor reviews from people who buy this every single year. Overall, there are legitimately some great aspects to the game and I really wanted to like it but unfortunately the bugs and issues just completely outweigh any semblance of a good game. 

1) The whole progressive fatigue/auto sub thing is just game breaking. Even with progressive fatigue turned off, my week 18 game subs out all of my starters after the first play. If i sim a play, they come back but then are gone after the next play again. I have tried countless ""fixes"" but can't for the life of me get my starters to play the games at random times. No point to play the game if you can't even get it to put your correct players on the field

2) FAR too turnovers. Its like EA decided that every game would have 4-5 turnovers collectively and require one team to have a 2 minute offense for a chance to win the game. Just completely breaks the immersion of the game when a cornerback on another WR and whose back is to the QB will immediately turn around and cover 15 yards to a contested INT. Not fun when they advertise ""smarter AI"" CPU when all that really means is the CPU has a hive mind. People who would be considered wide open in an actual NFL game are consistently INT throws.

3) Gameplay sliders as an attempt to fix the issues above just simply don't work (minimal impacts on the game)

There are countless other issues with the game, like weak tackling, dumb blocking due to animations, etc. Sucks that such a fun sport has its game held hostage by an EA monopoly.",1706060436,1706060436,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

that aside there a few flaws that should be highlighted:

first of all yes the ultimate team mode is a money grab but you could mange to build a team slowly without spending money on it, people that waste tons of money on it are usually the one that are a bit over invested in it.
in addition you could easily get away playing only the normal mode to have just as much fun.

second yes there are some minor inconviences at times when it comes to the general usage of the game but if we are being honest what game nowadays doesn't have similier issues personally I don't think it ruins the game just annoying when you do eventually face it. 


its honestly a breath of fresh air to see a game that really just gives you a casual vibe its something I can appriciate in a sea of try hard games.

- Playing an online Franchise with friends is 100% pointless, unless you're ABSOLUTELY sure you're gonna make the Super Bowl cause you DO NOT get to play Pro Bowl, regardless if you get selected or not. I've played 4 seasons of OLB and 2 seasons of QB, while winning DPOY/OPOY & DROY/OROY every time so this is TRUE information.

- Trying to play a Head to Head against those friends within the Franchise causes the game to crash at right around Halftime every time or one person has to deal with less than 30fps gameplay.

- Tattoos? Y'all worried so much about the ""visual"" aspect of the game, yet we STILL don't have the option to do something so minor as tattoos but you allow some of the players (OBJ, Mike Evans) to have their lifelike tattoos? 

FIX THE GAME OR GIVE UP RIGHTS. This is getting ridiculous. 100% is NOT worth anything more than $25 IF that, don't waste your money.

AFTER AN ADDITIONAL 30 Hours I can still fully say that this game is ABSOLUTE TRASH.

-85% CPU use for no reason at UHD with an i9 9900k at 4.7 GHz stock turbo clock.
-Freezing randomly.
-STUTTERING. THE STUTTERING! Anytime you try to evade or make a catch the game just randomly skips frames and stutters making precision inputs impossible to control.
-Poor graphical optimisation. 70 fps with an RTX 4090 at 4K with 85% CPU use....
-Secure boot in BIOS required. Something your operating system doesn't require. This is going to cause issues on older machines or non-technical users. Instead of actually patching the issue, they simply send out a quiet news article that doesn't even explain how to do it. This is terrible! What next, am I going to require a third-party TPM module and USB key to play my $100 AUD game??
-Tutorials are terrible for new players. You'll be left wondering what actually went wrong in the drill which makes it very difficult to learn. Turns out I was performing a hit stick perfectly, but the players weren't lined up. So my guy just didn't have the size against the player he was up against, swapped teams and it landed everytime... this is silly when you're just trying to learn the mechanics. Or at least give you a 'pass' for performing the move correctly even if the outcome was unsuccessful on a technicality...

Now many people complaining about previous iterations, well I can't comment on that as I haven't touched a PC version in years. But if this is reflective of previous games, it's justified.

EA, you are still the same shocking company from the 90's. What's worse is gaming is so high profile now that the NFL will sell the licence to them all because of the money.

I love the game of football, and unfortunately, EA has an exclusive license on this. This is, by FAR, the WORST Madden game I have ever played.

I purchased this game for $30 and still feel ripped off. I have NVIDIA Geforce 3060 Ti and this game looks like garbage. Frame rate is all over the place, graphics are not good, sound keeps turning on and off, loading screens take forever, game  continually keeps crashing, etc. I usually don't review games, but this was so bad that I had to. Cross play keeps having issue with XBOX and Playstation users so I couldn't even play with my friends even if I wanted to (yes, I checked every reddit forum to help me fix the issue, nothing helped).

EA has been putting games out for years and have done alright most of the time. The play ability of the game works well for me, the thing is you might want to look up up play packages online for offense and defense because it seems like players that can read defenses do well.

I'm a Franchise-mode enthusiast (dating all the way back to when EA Sports first got the exclusive license), I don't touch MUT or online multiplayer. There are some editions of Madden that I played for several hundred hours, including >5 full seasons of Franchise, doing excel sheets to run my draft. There's not much to say that hasn't already been said by other long-time Madden players (""fans"" is the wrong word) -- the pace of progress from year-to-year is just incredibly frustrating. 

The gameplay *HAS* gotten better over the last 10 years. the movement is more fluid and realistic, the pass defense AI is smarter and plays the ball in the air more realistically, the run blocking is smarter, and the tools for controlling your team, pre- and-post snap, have gradually expanded to give more control, in satisfying ways.  The problem is (a) it's been *so* incremental from year to year, and (b) the experience outside of the gameplay hasn't gotten better *at all*. Both with the presentation elements of the game (the interstitial stuff, the UI of the graphics on the screen, the play-by-play calls), and with the menus outside of the game (which are terribly designed, with way too many layers, and that are infuriatingly slow to navigate). Over the years they've tried a lot of different ideas with roster management (draft, trades, depth chart, etc...), and it's just never gotten better. I think this may actually be worse than it was 10 years ago. This could be so crisp and fast with modern hardware, especially on PC, and instead it's just maddeningly sluggish, and important information is buried 8 layers deep in menus.

I'm not going to pretend it doesn't scratch an itch, as a football fan. Making the correct reads and playcalls to dice up a defence is fantastically satisfying. Chasing down a quarterback for a sack triggers an irresistible fist pump. Being in a tight game and trying to orchestrate a game-winning or game-tying drive as the clock ticks down is thrilling.

If another company could get their hands on the rights to make a football game, Madden would fade into irrelevancy, bc EA can not compete with real gaming studios, real gaming studios that put effort into their creations, and understand how magical gaming production should be. Shame on EA for being sellouts, and trying to squeeze every dollar possible from their customer base. when I see ""EA"" I think bad faith. and my opinion has not changed with madden24.",1704307461,1704307461,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, after awhile you find a team and playbook that works for you, and you can become difficult to stop on offense. This game actually allows less cheese-plays than previous titles, and both zone and man coverage have weaknesses you can exploit naturally, as in real football. However, as a previous top ranked Madden player, I think Madden is mostly going in the exact wrong direction for the average player. The controls are clunkier than ever, and the play is less-arcadelike than ever. The fact is, Madden should not be a simulation type sports game. The whole concept of switching and playing players is unrealistic. If we think back to the sports games that were a blast - Griffey Baseball on N64, NHL 95 and NFL 95 of Genesis, NFL Blitz and NBA Street, they put fun first and sought to appeal to the average sports fan, and not the top 0.1% of players who want to play the game in an esoteric fashion. I expect Madden to continue to lose fans. Furthermore, the commentary and graphics are nearly unchanged from even Madden 18. The animations are better, but also more exploitable than ever before. This is not a game you can invite your buddy over for and fan some fun with for a few hours with beers, your average sportsbro just won't get it and will get wrecked and have a bad time. I only recommend the game because I personally enjoy playing at the top end of the player base and I like how they made it more about strategy and a little less about animation exploits and cheese plays. I am disappointed that it's most a roster update and the gameplay is not something I'd excitedly bring my friends to. EA having an exclusive right to the NFL license, I am hoping someone can replicate Retrobowl's success and make a game more akin to NFL Blitz or older Madden titles, but with modern graphics. I would not mind if they could not use official team or player names. Madden also seems to lose features with each release. You have to reset your playbooks now every time you start a new game or log in. For example, if I select the Pats offense and the Bills defense for playbooks, every time I start a new game I have to manually select those if I am playing as say, the Bucs. Mind you, this is a franchise that used to let you play as NFL Europe teams and see what uniforms looked like when selecting them...  I never mess with MUT because it is an amoral money pit, never have, so I cannot review that part of the game. My recommendation is to stick to franchise play, or online head to head. This game is purely for the Madden superfan who plays the game every year and a high level.

This game looks much better that the last madden i bought (2008) but it is optimized so poorly, it should be considered a disgrace to EA. I bought this because it was on sale for $27 and i feel more ripped off than the 4th time i bought Skyrim at full price. If it ever drops to under $10, it might be worth it. I read a bunch of mixed reviews saying various things about it but one common thing was people complaining about the lack of new stuff. I thought since i hadn't played a Madden title in 16 years that I would be surprised by a few new things and not experience the same disappointment. But damn, a new mode designed to extract micro-transactions and a new engine (new for me, it came out in 2017 apparently) that feels like the old engine. I suppose one new feature is you can choose specialties for your team to focus on before the game (run middle, run outside, short, medium, or long pass) but then there's downsides to it too (focusing run middle makes your o-line better at that but worse at picking up blocks on the outside), this seems cool but at first until you realize there is no option to skip this choice all together meaning you have to choose a strategy that your AI controlled teammates will more or less automatically fail at. On top of all that, there's a weird bug that I experienced in the 2 games I played before refunding, after selecting teams and starting to load the game, it would automatically move my controller back to ""no team"" (idk what the proper term for this is but it would take me off my team and I would have to open the start menu and reassign myself to my team) which is not only annoying but since the game automatically readies up the opening kick off now (there's no coin flip in game, you decide all that while choosing teams focus, playbook, and jerseys now, for some reason) you can pause the game and select your team but the teams already have lined up for the kickoff and the game says ""the effect will take place after the current play"" which means there is no way (at least on pc in exhibition mode) that you can play the opening kick off. I know that 1 play is small in the grand scheme of a whole game but come on, how can this be in the game in December, so long after release. I bought this game because I was dying to play a football game, I never played as much of Madden as I did the NCAA series and I was hoping this would scratch that itch, now I'm left hoping that EA never releases that NCAA game they said they were going to do again because I'm sure that despite once being my favorite game series, it will be a disappointment now.",1704126032,1704126032,False,1,0,0.50659632682800293,0,True,False,False

UPDATE: I requested a refund after trying all game formats, making sure there wasn't something that I could salvage out of this purchase, and STEAM said no. They would not give me a refund stating that I had played too many hours... 9 hours.

Been playing madden since the days of old. I’m 42. Seen em all. Passed on some, bought some twice (multiple platforms)

Always say I hate it. And normally I do. But $27 is hard to pass on especially when there is nothing else during this years sale that interest me. Had store credit and not wanting to miss out on the winter sale (refunded about 8 games this holiday, what a terrible game dev year this has been…)

But! I had a hard time getting M24 to work at all! All most refunded. Direct x crash on first start. Followed by the game refusing to start at all for hours. Until I remembered EA is a terrible company and their game infrastructure sucks! 

I pushed though the pain because I’m stubborn and I have been here before. Not my first EA debacle. 

After hours of troubleshooting and no online solutions working, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I thought hard and went old school on it. 

Anyone having issues with the game crashing on start, LISTEN UP.!!!

== Gameplay ==

Gameplay is improved this year, the game does play better, but the overall modes are lackluster. Running the ball actually feels more fun than in years passed.

The passing controls overhaul has been an interesting add to the strategy of the game when it works correctly. Essentially you can either control the power or accuracy of your passes, and also control the placement of your passes. When it works, it add a rewarding element to offensive play. However, there are several instances of passes going haywire that are labelled as perfect accuracy or perfect power (depending on your control scheme), this occurs due to Madden NFL 24's animations. But overall, this is probably the highlight of this year's game to me.

The AI tweaks to offensive line play makes the game play better if you actually know how to utilize it (you have to avoid pressing the triggers on snapping the ball and also step up into the pocket when appropriate), it actually is starting to resemble real football, which is an incredibly low-bar. 

The gameplay tweaks are probably the best part of Madden NFL 24, and that's huge for a football game. However, it's still behind even earlier games in this series and the occasional issues related to passing makes this feel like 1.5 steps forward. 

For a series with this patient userbase, it should be ridiculed that the best EA can do is a marginal step forward. And this is the best part of the game. 

== Modes ==

And this is where Madden NFL 24 truly falls off the rails. In short, the modes are barren. Madden NFL 24 has to remember that it isn't just competing with sports games, it's competing with all video games. And the package that players get for up to $69.99 is just subpar. 

Superstar mode, which got an overhaul from last year's Face of the Franchise, is subpar and loses most of its bells and whistles after the first season. The Maddencast concept provides interesting ideas but doesn't go beyond a novelty. The NFL Combine is an interesting add, but its only in the mode at the start of the player's career and takes 10 minutes. 

Franchise mode still pales in comparison to other sports games such as EA's NHL series, Sony San Diego's MLB The Show series, and especially NBA 2k. The big addition to Franchise mode this year is an extra trade slot and more draft pick trading, which tells you the level of effort (or lack thereof) that went into the mode. 

Mini-games are back for the first time since Madden 11, and they're incredibly milquetoast, banal, dull, lifeless. And in Superstar and Franchise mode, they're used for player XP. So in franchise, expect to do these boring modes over-and-over. I wish EA had made it like EA Sports FC's training in manager career, where you only had to do it ONCE and you could sim with the same level of reward. 

Ultimate Team is a cynical cash-grab that no one should play, but if you did want to play this gambling simulator, you should know that online performance in this game is horrendous. 


== Performance == 

This game is just not well optimized for the PC.

Routine issues with CPU management is a constant issue for this game. Frame skipping is a problem, and it's basically a necessity to put frame locks on (usually 120) and turn VSync off. 

It's so bad that I think EA should make the frame locks and VSync off a default.  

I would love to see Digital Foundry make a video about Madden NFL 24 because it would be scathing. I just lack the specific jargon to explain why this game performs so poorly. 

Stadiums with lighting effects such as fireworks may also occasionally dim the game's lighting to practically dim. Resource management is a nightmare.



== Online ==

This game is fundamentally unplayable online. The game regularly goes into what I call ""slow mo"" football when playing against players online, which makes Online H2H, Ultimate Team and especially Superstar Showdown virtually unplayable for most players. 

For reference, my internet speed is about 300 mbps down and 30 mbps up. And while that is unimpressive, it is more than enough for an online game in 2023/24.

If any part of you wants to buy this game play online, do not. I strongly recommend not buying this game if online gameplay is the biggest selling point for you. 

== Graphics and other visual details == 

This is the first year that Madden has had raytracing on the PC version of the game, and honestly, it's nothing to write home about. The performance tradeoff is simply not worth it. If the game was better optimized, then I'd consider trying it more. But otherwise, meh. 

""Sapien"" technology, EA's corporate phrase relating to the skeletal meshes of player models in this game, is better than in years past and makes players look more true to form. But it looks horrendous on offensive linemen. And for players who lack scans, it doesn't add much ""authenticity"" to the game. 

== Overall == 

Madden NFL 24 is the equivalent of a team starting at their own 25, getting to the redzone, and throwing an interception. It's a game with a few interesting additions, interesting bells and whistles that are brought down by its snoozefest game modes, its performance issues on the PC, and its unacceptable online performance. 

The only way I could recommend someone Madden NFL 24 is if they only wanted to play single player play now and nothing else. 

It's unfortunate how bad the state of Sports games are these days especially as we've seen incredible games come out in 2023, but that's the fun of exclusive licenses.

I have bought Madden since about Madden 02, when I was 11 years old. I always just made do with whatever they added or took away from the game. It was never really anything to gripe about. They added features that were really cool, and took away things that I was upset because it was fun.

I can officially say, that buying every single Madden has come to an end for me. I will not be purchasing Madden beyond this year. The developers have officially lost my trust and are now in the category of ""Money Hungry"".

The game-play itself, I have to admit, is very bad. The animations are not better from last year, they're about the same, if not worse at some instances. I play mostly Offline Franchise, so I can only really speak on those features, and they didn't really improve from last year. The addition of the Training Camp Mini-Games is very nice, that was a fresh addition, but other than that, it's the same Franchise mode from last year. 

The animations are very bad, as far as throwing the ball to any receiver, you either lead them too far and it gets intercepted, or you under throw them, and it gets intercepted. The running game in Madden is more or less the same, blockers barely block, the CPU D-Line just barrels through and gets you for a short gain, or causes a fumble.

The player editing (which I always did for draft picks in franchise) has completely deterred me from playing this game, this is what did it for me. They made it so just editing a players helmet takes about 4-5 minutes, rather than 2-3 seconds from previous years. Just editing a player now takes 4-5 minutes (that is not an exaggeration), and it takes all the fun of just setting your new draft picks in some actual proper gear and make them look like real players. 

All in all, I would give this game a 2/10, there are so many things I would change, animations, editing players, franchise mode salary caps, AI field sense and real game feel. 

This franchise has lost a true fan for more than 20 years. 

I am excited for NCAA when it comes out in summer of 2024, but I am cautiously optimistic because of EA.

i started in superstar mode or whatever the face of the franchise is as a 73 ovr QB for the vikings. i set my settings to all-pro. within my first few games i instantly knew something was wrong. i would have 3 - 8 ints per game. before you say it, i'm not that bad at the game. i have multiple medal clips of wr's juggling the ball and it becoming intercepted. my TE was on a slant route, he had a 5 yd separation from his defender. i threw perfect accuracy and somehow i threw the ball behind him. the same TE was on another slant route, i threw perfect accuracy and he runs behind a defender and it gets picked. i threw to justin jefferson on a slant, the defender literally tapped his foot with a single finger and jefferson completely drops the pass and acts like he just got layed out by aaron donald. i've had a problem with this type of stuff in other maddens, start-like players being unable to complete simple passes or catch the ball. this got so bad that my first 6 games including pre season we lost by 20 or more points, its honestly frustrating and just stupid.

in my opinion, this game isnt worth it even on sale, 70 dollars is outrageous considering the quality these developers put out every year. i think ill stick with madden 23 face of the franchise even though that game isnt too good either. tbh im just waiting for a ncaa game to come out.",1703827998,1703827998,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's online play, a crucial aspect for any modern title, is a mess. It's as if the developers completely ignored the evolution of online gaming over the past decade. The experience is plagued with issues that make it feel like we're still stuck in the early 2010s.

Madden 2024's AI, especially in the trenches, is a mixed bag. While playing against All-Pro AI can sometimes offer a semblance of challenge and strategy, it's overshadowed by the glaring flaws that emerge once you take the game online. The online gameplay is not just disappointing; it's frustratingly unrealistic. It's a far cry from the authentic football experience we were promised.

The game mechanics feel outdated, and the lack of innovation is apparent. It's as if the developers decided to play it safe, rehashing old ideas instead of bringing something fresh to the table.

But if you start playing and go deeper into playing you’ll start to notice all the things that’ve gone wrong with the programming. When you play Superstar WR Mode (without Home Field Advantage) on Pro it’s way to easy, nearly every 2nd catch is a big one and you get TD after TD while winning every game 35:12 or something. But when you put it one Difficulty up to All-Pro it becomes hell, because then it gets unplayable. Not because the defense is better or is blocking you better, but because of so many unrealistic things that happen again and again that make you wanna quit the game. 
Your QB starts to throw an completely unrealistic amount of Interceptions (Mahomes threw 5 INTs in the first half to my other teammates, the other QB of course threw not even one). Your teammates seem to drop the ball every two seconds in the redzone too, if it isn’t an interception in the first place. And you lose the ball every two seconds because it’ll get knocked out of your hands or your QB underthrows the ball a couple of yards and just hammers it into the ground in a direction you weren’t even running, like he badly miscalculated the ball. 
So at the end of the game I had 350 passing yards and one TD because of 5 INTs in the redzone (and a missed field goal and extra point), the other team had 80 passing yards and won because of two TDs and a field goal. Also you miss like 50 or 60 Percent of your Field Goals and Extra Points, while the enemy team barely misses anything. 
So instead of making the defenders just do a better job they make your QB throw complete shit to stop you that way, like they want to mess with you and make you angry. 
And I didn’t even mention all the times your teammates just ran into you and were stuck with you for a couple of second, so you couldn’t catch your ball because of errors in the programming. 
I still recommend the game because it is a lot of fun playing, but only if you get the difficulties and settings right.",1703801992,1703801992,True,9,2,0.55221933126449585,0,True,False,False

It's football. It won't change much over time. The one thing about a football game that should get better though is player physics and AI intelligence.

And well.. The AI and throwing mechanics are simply horrific. The bullet vs touch vs lob pass controls are extremely inconsistent, or if they aren't inconsistent they are so precise that it feels like you're playing more of a rhythm game than a football game.

Meanwhile as you struggle to comprehend how to correctly throw a pass the way you want at any given moment the AI is terrible. Your guys will just consistently blow their routes on offense. Meanwhile the defensive AI is capable of basically immediately getting to every ball they possibly can. Worse yet there seems to be some unexplained or just bad programming on receivers where they drop or have passes knocked loose extraordinary often. Even if they are passes that would otherwise be caught with ease, even while contacted in the NFL.

Awful game and physics mechanics make what should be the most fun part of football at best complete boring, at worse extremely frustrating. Dropping back to pass feels like a crap shoot every time.

It is night and day playing this game vs FC24. FC24 isn't perfect but the actual games feel fun and like they've got a high skill ceiling, this is a dice roll.",1703791465,1703791465,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The exact thing happened with FIFA and it's why I'm not going even give EA another chance when it comes to game optimizations and compatibility.

    I'm really only interested in franchise, so I can't comment on any other game modes as of this writing. I do appreciate that they seem to be TRYING to improve, with certain aspects of franchise mode upgraded. As far as a franchise/sim experience goes, I would say this is the best in many years.
    As for the gameplay- meh. It's vastly improved from 22/23, thanks in large part to the next gen features. However, it still leaves much to be desired. The sliders take some SERIOUS tweaking to even make playing the game enjoyable. Running the ball is fine- passing, however, is virtually IMPOSSIBLE. If you like throwing 40 interceptions in a season, this is for you. 
    The new passing mechanics, while I appreciate what they're trying to accomplish- are just bad. One of the reasons I feel Madden has been in decline the past decade or so is because they always seem to be ""fixing"" things that aren't broken. Give me classic, simplistic gameplay controls, and put work into features that matter to make the game more engaging. Just my opinion.

As we say in California, I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. A zit on the butt of society. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.

You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you. You are a bloody nardless newbie twit protohominid chromosomally aberrant caricature of a coprophagic cloacal parasitic pond scum and I wish you would go away.

You're a putrescence mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.

You are a bleating fool, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.

I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. Because off your face the rabbit population actually decreased. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?

You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.

You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.

You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.

On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.

Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ""challenged"" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

The throwing mechanics are god-awful if you're below a 80 overall, which is a good chunk of the league, thus half the game is essentially void. The defenders play off your controller movements and its very evident as you're controlling the quarterback and playing against....lets say the 49ers!!!! COULD YOU MAKE THEM ANYMORE BETTER?!?!?!

Some things you must know.  
1.) i rarely play it online
2.) Ultimate team is not something i get into because it just feels like those PTW ""free"" games on a mobile ap that means whoever has the biggest wallet wins.  
3.) i enjoy playing franchise mode
4.) i play on simulation
5.) I dont use the sticks for much of the hitting or ball placements except in rare occasions as its just to much to relearn all the time 

Its a solid football game.    Its far from perfect and there can be a lot of things that could be improved, but its got the players in the NFL, its got stats, whether you agree with them or not is subjective, tit plays well.  I run the game on my laptop and i use my Refurbished deck, which the only reason i even got it was the sale price and the additional 20% refurbished version was a steal for this madden game.  I do have to run it in streaming mode but once i run it in streaming mode the deck controls work perfectly and its fantastic.  Now if they made it work fully just on the Deck Alone... i feel like they might hit another market out there.   

I say all this so you understand, i run the game on my LAPTOP gaming computer with 16 gigs of ram a 3050 and a I5 CPU, that streams the game to my Deck and i just turn the deck to 10 fps and watts to use it as a controller only and get 6-8 hours of battery off of it and watch the game on my laptop or use an HDMI cord to plus the laptop into the TV and play it that way.   

I don't experience input lag, in fact this is the first madden in such a long time i can remember enjoying the running game A LOT in.  Blockers picking up blocks is a huge thing.  Having a shitty blocker in front of you with bad awareness or run block stats is really noticeable.   (Makes me really wish they would put more love in to the full backs so that they would be as effective as they are in game but small gripe)   The running in the game is just crisp.  the days of tacklers just brushing against you to tackle you while engaged must have stopped a while ago.  The holes open and close in zone running schemes in ways that feel like you can pick the hole and run through.  

The passing can seem pretty interesting as i have seen line backers vary their depth against the same play, albeit very rarely but  i have seen it, and the speed of receivers and route running ability is still pretty damn paramount.  I quite enjoy taking the game, and just playing it.  Its not a game i want to buy at 70$ USD, honestly id buy it at launch if they made the single player game 30 or 40$ USD at launch and sold the multiplayer separately.  Madden to me is best played in the house with people around so that if you want to talk shit or be bitter you have to do it face to face.  Want to try to run out the clock?  take the verbal barbs of being called all kinds of names for ""not playing the game"".  

This game is not transcendent or some kind of perfect football game by any means but for fans of teams... especially those teams that are not playing great in a  season it certainly quenches the thirst for sure.  I wont bu the game at full price  maybe ever again, but all these reviews that say its terrible?  Just don't buy it for a few years and keep playing the same one, eventually the game will feel good again.  Its not an every year purchase unless you want to chase that ultimate team money sink...

The only other maddens I've played are '07 and '21. 

great:
- presentation is great and graphics look good. commentary is quite accurate and sounds great.

good:
- menu system is fine
- ball handling controls etc. are good overall. feels ok to run with the ball and is relatively responsive except when getting tackled from behind..
- the momentum mechanic that messes with routes/buttons/shakes camera is interesting and a fun new part of the game
- coach play calling is good and tends to do ""more of whats working"", and is generally situationally aware
- team ratings, player ratings, and superstars make the game more fun and seem more accurate. a lot of positions matter and having good o-line makes running offense easier, while having good d line causes confusion and mayhem for offenses. overall, well done

meh:
- tackling animations have been improved and now there is a momentum-like system that makes the tackles bearable. still not great, but its fine and an improvement over the older maddens ive played
- the skill passing mechanic is interesting but frustrating. sort of a good first step in the right direction but i still prefer classic passing
- adjusting cpu skill in settings takes care of some of the issues and makes the game more playable

bad:
- qb scrambles cause the AI to totally lose its mind, causing some lbs to watch QBs run for 50+yds or tds because they are stuck in their zone and seemingly unable to leave.
- blockers will just randomly miss blocks on defenders 5 inches away from them
- similarly, AI defenders will miss tackles in similar fashion. there is not a good ""proximity"" system for determining whether players should be hit, slowed down, or missed
- with no more qb vision it makes the passing seem more random and less skill based. maybe there is a way to enable it but i have not found it

horrendous:
- player ball tracking/catching (for passing) is horrendous. your receivers might just watch a ball sail 2 feet from their face while a db right behind them steals it away. other times players will simply not be looking when they should be and the ball will hit them in the back of the head. other times your receiver will make impossible grabs in quadruple coverage with 2dbs in front of them. other times dbs will get sucked to the ball from 10 yards away to swat the ball away. overall, 50% of the time passing just feels like total BS, no matter if you throw a horrendous interception or perfect TD. it doesnt feel right. 
- coach suggestions for playmaking just make NO sense and seem to repeat the same 5 plays over and over and over.

I didn't buy last year but did this year and I don't know why people like me keep falling for it. I've had multiple games (franchise mode/franchise player) where I win the game, press ""finish game"" and it doesn't load or crashes and the game results are not recorded. Offensive line play is horrendous and does not represent actual offensive line play. I can't find an offensive lineman in the NFL that won't get on his block and just stay at the line of scrimmage blocking the hole that the runningback needs to get through. Their is no AI intelligence whatsoever. If you ever rushed to get a play off before quarter 1 or 3 or even the 2 minute warning, you know its a crap shoot. You break huddle and have 5 seconds before one of those comes up? Not enough time.

1. The auction hub for PC is separate than Playstation or Xbox. On PC there is a smaller player base and therefore less players to complete sets, find players if you want to build an NFL team themed team which boosts player stats. I've also encountered a few cheaters on the game who use this pause glitch where you sit on the pause screen for an indefinite amount of time... happened in my super bowl which was awesome. 

2. This is the most important thing to note is that MADDEN RUNS HORRIBLE ON PC with Steam. I didn't do enough research into the specific reasons behind it, but there is an issue with connecting your Steam account to EA which means your game literally cannot launch. I've been trying for two days to launch it, have gone through a dozen different reddit recommendations and nothing. 

I'm currently writing this review while talking to Vaishali with EA support. It feels like you're talking to Chat GPT, they take 5 minutes to reply and do nothing useful. Waste of money.",1701542370,1701542370,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For a company like EA, this is expected. But it's incredibly frustrating to deal with, especially since it means that this game is now, for all intents and purposes, unplayable, but I won't be able to receive a refund due to the hours I've played and the time since initial purchase.

I love NFL and football but this game shouldn't exist it's so bad.

Currently I was attempting ""competitive play""  which means run the most broken things you can find, use the cheapest plays/players, and adapt as ea continues to ruin the game every ""patch""

IT's so bad in it's current state that you can't progress in the game if you have one of the literal hundreds of bugs in the game.  

Right now if you play Seasons in H2H mode to earn packs the only way you can stay competitive in NMS... The seasons won't reset.  You can lose 3 which would usually reset, it won't do anything, you can win 5 which should take you to playoffs... it won't.  You're stuck getting 5k coins a win and supposed to buy 1.5m + players to stay competitive.  Fun times. 

You go to EA help forums and see that it's been outsourced to India and the people you talk to have 0 ability to help do anything.

The game is a disgrace.  Even though I've qualified for tournaments, I'm quitting as the game and most of it's modes are actually broken broken.

There is no real ""scene"" other than 20-30 guys in a discord who all hate the game, yet can make a few thousand playing it on a ""pro"" level.  There is a reason no one watches or cares as most of the ""pro"" players are degens who have failed at everything else in life.  There is a reason the tournament and players got shot up , you connect the dots when you see the types of people who take a game this broken seriously. 


There are currently more people watching animal Crossing than there are madden on twitch.   Oh and if you want certain players? They make you register and watch the ""competitive"" MCS crap on twitch for hours to get said player.   These are just some of the wonderful tactics madden has used to boost temporary watch #'s, yet on average you can see no one cares, or will care about this game because at the end of the day, the game is trash.

The game is pay to win, there is no way around it.

IN the current promo ""blitz"" to 100% get a 93 LTD, the min price you pay is 200.00 Dollars.   Imagine paying over 3x the game price for a single player.


EA IS TRASH.   It can't be stated enough how awful they've become and how totally terrible Madden is.   Instead of making a competitive game, they milk the whales over and over again, so they have a little more speed, a little more ability to glitch blitz rushes, and this is the state of madden for as long as they can get away with it.  In this game the extra stats mean everything when your guy is 1 step ahead and you can make the 5-10 adjustments before every play to give them advantage.

I HIGHLY suspect the positive reviews on this game are bought and paid for by EA marketing.  There is no one who could seriously try to play this at a high rate and not run into 100's literally of bugs/glitches.   Kick meters being blocked? Been happening all year, they've done nothing to fix it.  ""Can't connect to server to process game?""  This bug has lasted YEARS, yet is still happening. 

Mention a boycott/lawsuit/petition on ea help forums?  That equals a ban.  How dare people mention viable ways to put pressure on a game company that is soulless and doing every scummy thing in the book to hook kids on gambling while pushing a product that qualifies in my mind as fraudulent.  



TLDR ;  This game is TRASH, borderline fraud, and without the exclusive license from NFL wouldn't even still exist. 


Someone at EA needs to be held accountable for taking a product with so much potential and running it headfirst into the ground all while trying to milk the last drops of blood from whales / credit card carls / and mentally slow to play it.",1694171377,1701130457,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played since they started and bought out the rights so there was no competition.
They do not care about game play as much as money, they want money and always have wanted money, they do not allow fair competition and all the sports leagues have sold out to EA.
This game is just as sucky, yes, very much so, graphics bounce and are not stable, defense does not move on its own, a person is always wanting me to control them and I just want to coach. The Quarterback takes 80% sacks for standing there and not throwing because it wants me to control it and I just want to coach. The kickers suck because they want me to control them and I just want to coach. It has been this way for years, hey, at least we dont have that goddamn ambulance coming on the field year after year.
I just want to fantasize of coaching and allowing my little fucking people do their shit, but no, these folk at EA think I want to partake even after I UNCHECKED the option in settings to have control on the field, and that has never worked since they put that in years ago. Oh look no time left and they called a time out and now I am trying for a field goal and it goes blank and I miss cause I could not see cause EA thought I needed to have control when I only wanted to fucking coach, what happened to open markets?

No way to stop auto timeouts, softlocks the entire client every time a player levels up (any of your 50+, so after every game) requiring a restart, forces you to download the EA launcher so they can collect and sell your data, incorrect penalty and first down determinations, incorrect commentary, bad commentary, reused commentary from the last Madden I played (17). Poor AI management, so that they are always perfectly in a run blitz during a draw play, or stacking the flat on a sweep. 
When I played too well on regular, the game started spamming holding calls to slow me down.

 I lost a game because the AI wasted all of my timeouts without telling me, there's no way to change this. 
Horrendous clock management too- you have to watch entire 5 second animations play before you can snap the ball. Horrible no huddle calls, which still wastes 10-15 seconds (the real life average is below 5). Disabling any of this in settings doesn't work. The animations WILL play, and the clock WILL drain. No time outs either, because the AI auto wasted them in the 3rd quarter. 

After every 2nd play of the game, the game will force you into an ""injuries update"" animation where Charles Davis will say one of three possible lines about the ""Next man up"". My Franchise had players out for the season, meaning this will play 17+ times, unavoidably. 

Most of the game play is RNG to determine what animation plays. If a defensive lineman gets near your QB, a sack animation plays regardless of your input.  I was sacked multiple times by touching a blocked defensive lineman's ankle, because when his hitbox is touched it plays the sack animation regardless of context. 

The only redeeming quality is the passing itself can be fun, and I liked spamming play action bootlegs to roll out as Josh Allen, Mahomes, or CJ Stroud.

First option on the main menu is MUT even if you've never played it. It's beyond ridiculous.

I haven't bought a Madden game in a decade, and I'm still seeing more glitches in this game than there were on Madden 13 for the WiiU. The fucking WiiU. Sometimes simming practice in franchse mode will put you in loading screen purgatory where your only option is to close the game and reopen it (just to be greeted by another MUT ad, mind you).

i play it because i am addicted to watching jonathan taylor run through the A gap for 10 yards a carry

maybe its because i am playing on all madden, but i swear half of my throws are labeled as poor accuracy with an 80 OVR qb and there isnt anything i can do to affect that. the passing system just doesnt reward you for doing anything right, and fails to lead the receiver on any corner route, lots of in routes, and just at random times in general

the running game is laughably easy, and the best way to beat the AI is to just run inside zone 30 times, EA thought that instead of just having a realistic spectrum of play recognition ability, it boils down to: are you a superstar with 85 awareness and play rec or better? no? you're just a random bum? okay you're gonna watch jonathan taylor zoom through the A gap 20 times a game and wait until hes breathing down your neck to do something about it. like i said, i am addicted to doing this, but its horrible game design.

the sim engine is just absolute trash, you get animation locked at times that just ruin the feel of the game, you can throw the ball to a receiver on a hitch or curl and if it isnt going right to him he'll just stand there and watch the ball zip into a db's hands, juke move is broken, pass blocking assignments are unrealistic, players run past blocks they very obviously should attempt to make all. the. time.

and now that ive got the gameplay problems off my chest, the absolute kicker is the ui/menus/load times. the franchise menu is abysmal, and why do i need to get a 3 second loading screen every time i want to just look at my roster. and how come when i am looking at my defensive unit, and i go into a player card to see a guy and find out that he doesnt wanna play for me anymore because he isnt in california (fuck you michael pittman jr), and i exit the player card, IT TAKES ME TO THE OFFENSE, I WASNT LOOKING AT THE OFFENSE, HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE, THEN THERE IS 3 SECOND LOAD SCREEN TO PULL UP DEFENSE like shit man

I pick up Madden about once every 5 years because they have a monopoly on football games, and just about every single problem from the past is still alive and well, and with more to add to the collection.

Playing defense gets worse every year, the NFL is becoming more offensive so it is understandable, but I am genuinely concerned if a lot of these problems are actually design choices. I have watched defensive scheme videos out the ass, made coverage changes, made a defense with DBs that are 99 on every relevant attribute and they get cooked by no-names in man coverage on every other play, match coverage requires a bunch of workarounds to not leave about 2 players open by a margin of at least 10 yards. Pretty sure there is nearly an instant release bonus for any receiver with 90+ speed against press coverage. 
Blitzing is more cheese than football and taking advantage of how bad players get stuck on each other. Post-play animations are possibly the worst I have seen in recent years, and bumping into one of your lineman as a runner might as well call the play dead, you’re glued to them at that point.

Offensive schemes are based around manipulating AI or getting defensive players stuck on each other, which is not difficult in this game, but the CPU’s DBs and linebackers have superpowers compared to a player teams AI-controlled players to artificially increase the difficulty to mask how bad defense as a whole runs in this.

Franchise still has the same appearance as years ago, so they aren’t even changing superficial things which is wild to me. Contract negotiation is the only improvement I see present in the last 3-4 years of releases. Trading is insanely easy on the default difficulty (I admittedly haven’t toyed with the setting much at this point). Scouting is identical to how it was years ago, and it was unacceptably bad then. Commentators can’t or at least won’t say common names like “Harrison”, so after 2 or 3 years of decent drafts, 90% of game commentary is the generic filler dialogues, which if you can guess, are also the same as multiple years ago. Gear-wise, rookies are not set to follow any form of trend from the looks of things- little 5’10 wideouts wearing linebacker facemasks, a lot of loose sleeves and tall pads, which might just be funky to me, but I’m already complaining, so fuck it.

I have tried modding the game, and it makes the game a bit more tolerable. However, games (ESPECIALLY FULL-PRICED AAA GAMES THAT HAVE A LOCK ON THE ENTIRE COMPETING MARKET) shouldn’t feel like an experience that you tolerate. I don’t think that is a wild statement and will guarantee those who disagree are reliant on Madden having a concurrent playerbase for their own security, profit, or genuinely need a copium intervention. This is an issue that is much larger than the unfortunate result that Madden happens to represent remarkably well, but this one pissed me off while I had a lot of free time.

It is almost lost on me at this point that in order to even play this game, I had to troubleshoot controller issues and EA app issues for multiple hours. A majority of issues I have tried to troubleshoot have been rabbit holes that haven’t answered my questions, but have shown me that these issues have been ongoing for a minimum of 3 years/releases. These are structural issues, these are not nitpicky issues. Everything that is wrong in the gaming industry is on full display with this game, and I presume all the other years I steered clear of the franchise. Please, for the love god, stop buying this MUT shit if you are committed to playing sim-style football games. EA can pay the NFL to re-release this garbage every year, and it is not just the fat cat upper management at EA’s fault that this trend has been going on in the gaming industry as a whole.

TLDR: The whole meme of “EA just releases a roster update for $60 every year” is actually being generous to EA. Most updates are to player likeness, and they are banging those out at a rate that seems like they have one intern on the job. This is the worst game I have played in recent memory that didn't have routine stability concerns and crashes. This is not an acceptable product, not an acceptable business practice, and an insult to its own playerbase, and probably the developers that want to make a better game. Speak with your wallet, that's all they hear.

I was unsure if I should get it or not because of all the negative reviews, I'm not sure what they are experiencing that is so bad but this is my experience 40 hours in.

This game isn't 100% optimized for PC to say the least, obviously they prioritize optimization for consoles, but PC isn't terrible, on my laptop the game can be a bit laggy, it has a 1660Ti, but on my PC with a 3070Ti, it runs smooth as butter, but that being said, even on a very good PC, I can't run max graphics like I can with most other games, I have to run it on medium settings, which is a bit disappointing because I know it should be able to handle better than that.

I've experienced 2 glitches, I audibled to a blitz right before a snap and the Center hiked the ball way over the QBs head and out of the endzone, and after that it was just 2nd and 10 like nothing happened. Another was a TD celebration where the upright was in the way and the players were glitching around it.

Franchise mode is awesome, and the feature where you can download draft classes that other people have made is really cool.

I know people complain that Madden is always the same game every year, but they would complain more if it changed too much. I like how I can just pick up the newest Madden and be able to play it right away because the controls are pretty much the same and everything.

I'm having a good time playing the game at the end of the day, and you probably will too.

I recently got into football (2021) and decided I may as well pick up a Madden game for fun and this one was half off despite only being a few months old. Thats a massive red flag, but honestly I'd say it was worth it.

I only play franchise and superstar modes, I'm not interested in h2h or MUT. So far the experience has been great. The game works well enough that I have an enjoyable time.

That said, this is not me recommending the game to you, the average Madden player. If you play these games a lot more than I do than I'm sure you'll run into infuriating issues nonstop. The other day I was unable to play superstar mode because I couldn't connect to the league (????) and so I had to either play a quick match or play nothing. I only loaded up madden to play this (what should be an offline) experience and I couldn't. Other things of note are that people constantly get stuck on each other and it just ruins the timings of routes and the expectations of where a receiver should be when the ball is thrown. This wouldn't be a problem if there was adequate feedback that they were stuck, but they continue whatever running animation they're in, but just stuck in place.

Overall I cannot recommend a yearly sports game. That's to be expected. If you keep letting EA and 2k defecate in your mouth and then start chewing after, they're going to continue making bad games.

You will be able to score, but you'll never get closer than being down 7 for the win. You ""outplayed""/cheesed the AI? Welllll, there's a holding flag or your star player is now out for the rest of the season. Got a scrambling QB?

If you're meant to lose the game, you won't win it. All-Pro or All-Madden. At least Sim Stats seem much better than they've been in the past, no more 20+ QBs passing for 4k+ in a season.

So weird because I swear this game felt so much better than this at release, so I'm genuinely confused how gameplay got so apparently decided within the few months it's been out. Maybe I'm just wearing rose colored glasses, or EA saw some metrics and tweaked a few things to try and push players towards MUT's money sink.

This is the first year they have forced you to do this even outside the Halloween event where you cant play MUT squads without first grinding to get these strat cards it makes the game extremely unrealistic and no longer a simulation game its basically like playing NFL Street. If I wanted to play NFL street I would just go back and play NFL Street. I buy madden for the simulation experience and to be able to play MUT Squads 3v3. however forcing your player base to have to play with these unrealistic strat cards is a disaster and not everyone wants to grind 100 challenges to earn enough XP to get the strat items either. I dont feel like I have explained this issue well but in short DO NOT THINK YOU CAN JUST GO PLAY MUT SQUADS THIS YEAR BECAUSE YOU CANT. YOU WILL HAVE TO GRIND ENOUGH XP FOR THE CURRENT PROMOTION TO EARN THE DUMB STRAT CARD. LAST MADDEN IM BUYING SERIOUSLY. if you like head to head (1v1) you are fine they did not change the requirements this year for head to head your not forced to go get these stupid strat items to play the game they only forced this on the MUT SQUAD community. good bye EA,1699122510,1699122510,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Repurchased the game after it went on sale for about 30% off and it is now playable. Genuinely happy to have the next-gen updates (about 3 years past due). The game stutters occasionally, but that is more or less to be expected with an EA game. This is the first Madden since Madden 20 that is actually worth picking up on PC if you can catch a sale. Not worth the full price unless you haven't played in a few years.

- features like Progressive Fatigue don't work and have been buggy for 2-3 years
- you are forced to use the new passing because classic passing feels like your QB is blind
- the performance is horrible even with an RTX 4080
- there are features like dynamic momentum, which do not belong into a simulation (I mean are the players on crack or why is the camera starting to shake, passing routes going blurry, or the kicking meter is fading away?)
- the menus are slower than a granny in a wheelchair and full of useless animations which slow everything down even more
- the gameplay is scripted af, which means it's extremely difficult to get a win if the game doesn't want you to win (receivers are dropping every ball, the ball is landing out of reach even when thrown with perfect accuracy or being swatted away by the defense, pass rush will run you over like your O-line is on vacation etc.)

I noticed fairly early on that like 80-90% of the negative reviews are from people who have bought every single iteration of the game for the last decade-plus. the last one i played was Madden 2000 for the Playstation 1 back when i was 6 years old. I have absolutely no frame of reference for all the little (again, to ME they're little) details with which most of them have complaints.
My friend and I were looking for non-shooter games we could play cross-platform PC to PS5, and since we've been watching more college and NFL games together and i've been teaching him the little i know about it, he said he'd like to try a football game. As luck would have it, this game gives us exactly what we were looking for - cross-platform football.
Is it a perfectly refined and polished game? no. sadly, very few games today are. some of the menus are a little laggy and unresponsive, and there are occasional moments where you have to ask yourself ""just what the hell happened on that play?"" but overall, i've been having a great deal of fun jumping back into the Madden franchise with this game.
If you're like me and haven't played a Madden game in a long time and are just looking to get back into some football, don't let the negative reviews put you off.

The new passing mechanics are pretty neat as they have become more skill-based, although the feature can be reverted to the original passing mechanics if you are more comfortable. The collision system feels more natural which adds to the immersion of the game as well.

My only complaint with the Madden series as a whole is that sometimes I wish they'd bring back QB vision. When playing as a DB, reading the QBs eyes and head movements are a crucial part to playing well and jumping routes but they cannot seem to translate this into any Madden game anymore as they had in the past.

Otherwise, this game shares a lot of similarity with the previous title so this will feel like a roster update with some new bells and whistles but overall I am enjoying the game.

However, with simulation mode, and Matt10's sliders, the game is pretty fun. It's still way too animation-dependent, and the physics and logic needs updating, and inertia doesn't really exist (at least for AI defenders lol)... but... it's fun, I gotta say. The draft is pretty good, I like scouting, free agent period is interesting. Of the Madden's I played since 19, this is the best so far. 

I have found that there is a bit of a secret with having fun in franchise mode with this game. Don't play with your favorite team. I know, I know, that's the main reason most franchise players get the game - they want to mold their IRL favorite team into a dynasty. Trust me, the flaws in this game, such as hilariously awful QB accuracy on All-Madden, and superhuman cornerbacks who can turn off a route and undercut a receiver that they weren't even covering, are much more forgivable when you don't really know the team you're playing as. For example, my favorite team are the 49ers, and playing as Brock Purdy in this game, I'd have 15 interceptions by week 8, and most of them would be the game randomly deciding that Purdy is going to overthrow a slant by fifteen yards directly into the hands of a safety while under pressure from one guy. I've seen this guy hurl perfect passes with five guys in his face, but the game makes him look like a FCS QB. But, if I play on the Broncos, a team I don't know much about nor have any strong feelings towards, it suddenly stings much less when I throw 20 picks in a season.

Anyways, those are my two cents. The franchise mode non-gameplay stuff is pretty good and engaging now (I didn't even mention practice drills or minicamp, it's fine I guess, it gives you something to do if you're a sim-only player) and the gameplay is... passable. With Matt10 sliders.

Never played a Madden game, or any other NFL title. So if that's what it's supposed to be; then they nailed it. 

[b]The rate of play is slower than golf. [/b]  The game did a great job making a bunch or cut scenes between plays that mimic an NFL game. However I quickly found these displays arduous to sit through and started meeting them with the same patience of a YouTube ad and mashing the keyboard to skip. 

Clearly a lot of work went into this game and at its core, the football mechanics are stellar. It offers a lot of control and nuance that can be very satisfying when done correctly. The problem is that the whole game seems disjointed, unauthentic, and is trying too hard to mimic what football LOOKS like. Because of the emphasis on presentation rather than game-play, it creates a rather underwhelming gaming experience.

With all the money they have, I cant believe how far this series has fallen backwards.  I am one of the minority here as I could care less about online features or ultimate team.  I just play franchise, and it is pathetic.  Gameplay is unrealistic as all heck, if you like just arcadey gameplay like 400 yards passing or rushing in a quarter like Blitz then this is it, but if you want a simulation its not.  You can try to tweak sliders ans waste your time just like the old days to make the game feel better (now you can only do it outside of the game).  
I will add a positive and thank you for finally adding in injuries in games and one aspect of sports and how you deal with these to gameplan.  Im sure the argument is who wants to play with bench players, but to me thats where the light shines.  Then these players make a name for themselves.  Penalties are still nowhere to be seen, thats all NFL is now are penalties and crying about how you got tackled or defended.  Amazing how you will go eight games (full length quarters) before a flag is even thrown with penalties set to max.  
Welp, I tried and hoped the next gen play would be something different, its not and even more pathetic than one would expect after not really playing madden for four+ years.  The last Madden I pick up for another 4-6 years.  The UI is so clunky now, and just amazing how they have taken features and menus out of the game and have literally upgraded nothing but some player and field models and add in some nonsense rpg stuff.

However, the only thing more disgraceful than EA’s treatment of this series is putting an overrated fraud like J*sh A*len on the cover. J*sh is a chubby, pencil-mustache-wearing, physically repulsive crybaby who is persistently overrated by a sycophantic media. Despite having never even reached a Super Bowl, they treat him like he’s John Elway reborn. The collective delusion would be hilarious if J*sh himself wasn’t so revolting as a player and a human being. In reality, the pest is a turnover machine with a massive ego, and his most noteworthy accomplishment is getting wrecked by Patrick Mahomes in the comically hilarious final 13 seconds of the 2021 AFC divisional round game. Seeing him so thoroughly humiliated on the national stage was delightful, and the subsequent complaining about the supposed unfairness of the overtime rules was the cherry on top of the schadenfreude sundae. If I must suffer his existence, then I will take solace in the many years of him getting slapped around by Mahomes/Burrow/Lawrence/Jackson until such time as he mercifully retires an overrated, pencil-mustache-wearing, ringless crybaby who was never once in danger of accomplishing anything of significance. Those four are superior players with more impressive resumes who have earned the adoration of their fans, unlike J*sh. He’s best known for flopping and complaining to the refs when things don’t go exactly as he wants.

In conclusion, don’t buy these terrible games. If you want a quality football video game experience, play some of the PS2-era Madden games or NFL Street, but more importantly, don’t put your faith in J*sh. He hasn’t earned a single ounce of the love poured upon him daily by the media, and he will only fail you. B*lls fans, I wish I could say I was sorry. This was the time for your laughable excuse of a franchise to shine; the Patriots were fading, and you didn’t ask to have this dunce drafted to your team, but you helped prop him up. I once mused that I would rather see the Eagles and Cowboys split the next 10 Super Bowls than the B*lls make a single appearance, but I never have to worry about that; they’ll never achieve anything.

EA, here's a tip to make you a bunch more money, hire competent UX designers for your menus and you will make a lot more in your cash grab attempts. This is a VERY specific thing to go off on but why when I play an hour of UT I spend 30-40% of that time just navigating your garbage menus?

The lag when you play in an offline mode is crazy. Before every big play or big throw there's a massive lag spike and players almost ""reset"". Makes the game look and play like garbage. Some of the new passing mechanics just flat out don't work and it doesn't matter where your crosshair is on the throw. They said ""We revamped the D-backs!"" but just playing an AI wide-out is impossible because it all depends on the random animations you get from the EA engine. You can have perfect coverage and it just doesn't matter. Running the football on both sides is crazy too. Again, every tackle has some bullshit animation and once you're in it you can't be knocked out. So a RB running the ball up the middle could get hit at the line of scrimmage then hit by 4 more defensive players but since he's locked in an animation it just doesn't matter. The ball carrier will just stumble forward for another 6 yards. 


The game is ugly, Un-playable in offline modes and even more un-playable in online modes. The only highlight is the Franchise mode that's been exactly the same for the last 6 years. The features become annoying and you just end up turning off any new content and the only reason i still play it is to build and draft random teams. I mean...they completely gave up on the ""be a superstar"" mode. They just added a combine mini game the pretty much the same thing as the 2k gym practice and said ""fuck it, lets made millions"". 

its such a lazy game franchise and I hate myself for buying and playing every new game. Youre so lucky to have a contract with the NFL because if it was any other gaming industry i would never play another EA madden game again. I'm gonna go back to simming entire seasons and building rosters because it's really the only feature that works most the time and is worth playing.

I look forward to practicing my passing skills more. There's also home field advantage back after all these years! You can even listen to the entire Eagles fight song! There's also more penalties such as illegal man down field!

Cons:
- No up-to-date rosters. You have to find custom community rosters to get a more accurate roster.
- The music is still horrible rap music, all 42 songs
- QB sneak looks nothing like it does in real life. It's pretty awful

I have been playing Madden since it was on Nintendo 64 and I feel like a complete sucker every year. I enjoy playing franchise mode, simulating seasons, creating draft classes, and trying to create a dynasty. I am just going to name a few little bugs and glitches I have noticed.
1. Franchise stats, for some reason, some players like Nick Bosa do not show up in the NFL defensive statistics
2. Draft class edits, the editor is slow and laggy, and doesn't even save any of the equipment edits you make, causing all of the draft classes to be super generic.
3. Player numbers randomly change for a lot of the drafted players to number 9, and there will be like 4 players with the same number. 
4. The game just lags randomly midplay when passing or kicking field goals. Super frustrating
5. As a PC user, its nice to have access to the next gen systems, but why do they lag the game so much? 
6. Why can't they bring old systems back like pro bowl voting and maybe give a seasonal reward for best tight end! If I make the super bowl, my players should still be pro bowlers and alternates should be announced
7. All storylines get super plain after the first completed season. As a 49er fan, its pretty much always just Trent Williams retiring in the offseason and then that is it. There are way less press conferences and such in following seasons

It is a real shame they have no competition and take advantage of us consumers by not even updating or fixing the game. They have a monopoly, and EA is absolutely exploiting us by making bare minimal changes to the same product and repackaging and selling it like a new product. All they care about is micro transactions.

I came to the conclusion that 99% of the people who work on these games have never watched a game of football .  Why you might ask, well jump balls in this game are nonexistent because the db's always knock the ball away where in real life they are usually 50/50 but in this game its more like 90\10 for the db's, the ai pass coverage is as bad as its ever been because watching the safeties and corners play as if they never should've made it past high school is pretty frustrating, and overall the game is just another spit in the face to all the fans who have been playing these games there whole lives.  After years of being on the frostbite engine you would expect a lot of fixes to be made but no, they ""fix"" issues by creating other problems.  If I was John Madden I would be upset if I knew a company was using my name for something as embarrassing as this game.  The only positive and the reason I have so many hours is because of the franchise mode which is a lot of fun.  Don't buy this game if you only play games but if you like franchise mode and simulating I would reccomend this game for you.  If they could maybe spend time on one game and make it look like an actual football game then EA would have an absoulte hit.  Until that happens I won't be giving madden another shot.

Updated rosters, with new rookies. It's always fun.
The new Superstar game mode, that has its many fun things, you get to be a rookie going through the combine and ultimately getting drafted, to whatever team you like, or leave it up to your draft stock to decide.
Field sense, as a person who doesn't have a Next Gen Console, I was let down by Madden 23 choice not to include it for PC users. But now that it is in the PC version of Madden 24, it is a big relief. And is a fun addition to the game.

Dislikes:
Players will get stuck on opponents and not know what to do, just run in place and screw up routes.
Opponent players have a crazy jump and reaction time, and pick your QB's throw in the most unrealistic moments ever.
It is poorly optimized, and eats a lot of your CPU, and the game goes into a slow-motion state, which screws up plays and reads.

All in all, the game needs some optimization updates for the game to run more fluid.
The AI needs some tweaks, so we don't get obvious PI's because the AI get stuck in each other, and for the crazy INT catches that happen.

Even with all these things to consider, it's a very fun game.
But 69,99? Come on... No way inflation has this big of an impact on the video game industry. Bring back the 59,99 please

this is a shit game all around, where do i even start
pros
* Superstar showdown is good i guess with it being fun to play
big head mode is OK
they took out the play ball feature reset the defensive playbooks 
cons
where do i even start because this is a con barrage
* refs can't ref worth a shit e.g i got called for pass interference after getting an INT on a zone coverage with my LB
*blockers can't block
* coaches lack playbook IQ to call plays it's as if madden is doing it on purpose and that brings me to superstar mode where you are  made to call the plays,audible, hot route regardless of position. basically madden expects you to do the Job of both the offensive and defensive coordinator and head coach combined as a player in your career mode which shouldn't happen
* MUT killed the game so much that franchise mode sucks and that mode is bare bones as well. plus mut is already on cellphones with madden mobile so why is this mode still on console for a $70+ game.
* Menu and UI is lagging that it doesn't matter what mode you play. i literally lagged in every mode even superstar showdown and while playing the league.
* EA doesn't have a customer service team to respond to customer issues which is horrible for  a company unlike 2k who actually have one as a competitor  to ea especially if you're a pc player.
* superstar mode is basically face of the franchise 2.0 literally especially when you have access to the entire playbook from day 1 which isn't football. madden 11 had game-flow and when you're drafted regardless of game flow, your'e given 5 plays to start with where in one is a run play
* Player nickname is barebones like really CAP like bruh anyone with a brain can understand that means create a player
* franchise mode is basically copy and paste. no customised contract especially when you're trying to spend within the cap space.
*No training camp in superstar mode despite previous madden games before madden 13.
* anticheat crahses games and hurts save files especially with me i lost three save files and now my QB file is missing due to this decrepit engine. i had multiple crashes with this game. i recommend removing this engine especially when it comes to modding the game for improving the performance of this horrible piece of shit from corporate commander
* defensive IQ is awful, they rarely follow the assignment on their play
*resetting the playbook ain't it especially if you want to gain customer satisfaction
* literally everything sucks in this game and yet this game is called a step in the right direction by ea's puppets IGN every year
this company must fire their ceo or force him to resign because he's the one who caused this problem with erroneous micro-transactions especially to children
solutions
fire Andrew Wilson, you need a new CEO with a new vision that doesn't include exploiting children mentally through gambling
Clint Oldenburg got to go. as a former OL, he doesn't know jack about a player on the gridiron
mut should be permanently on cell phones as a mobile game so that all mut players enjoy that while the franchise guys enjoy madden on consoles. both parties win. you already have madden mobile remove mut from consoles
get a customer support team literally like how does a billion dollar company not have a customer service team for every console including pc
refine anti-cheat to focus on cheat engines not mods or better remove the software itself
the most needed one of them all get rid of the frostbite engine which actually doesn't help the game and is the root cause of this game's issues especially when the engine is for first person shooter games
lastly stop copying fortnite, fortnite succeeded because it's a free to play game not because it had a free to play business model.
this game is not a step forward, it's a step backwards and in a make or break year, you might as well tell your ceo to resign because he's killing this company's gaming franchise.",1692877207,1697517418,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think; because of how little content the developer provided for the fun game modes like franchise and superstar and how STUPIDLY hard they push their micro-transaction crap. Saw a trailer for this game and its ""new and improved superstar mode"" and was hopeful that they would have actually improved (stupid I know.) 

EA has NOT improved... superstar mode is generic and crappy, your choices in the locker room and/or during events do NOT matter at all except for a very lack-luster stat progression mechanic. Your player character is flat and lacks any charisma and most importantly, has VERY FEW dialog options AND those options are all delivered in this same, boring, flat, ""yo dog I'm so cool because I talk like this bro"" crap way of speaking. 

THE GOOD
-I actually do like the tackling... much improved from last I played. That is all I can say good about it. 

THE BAD
-PC control scheme is ******* STUPID. Give us the ability to do our own key binding!!! ITS NOT HARD! Just about semi-decent game dev gives their players the ability to do their own keybinding on PC. I know EA and the Madden devs in particular are now where near being semi-decent game devs but it would be nice to see them try. 
-Camera for superstar mode is STUPID. 
-Receivers drop the ball ENTIRELY too much for NO reason. Drop pass on big hit? Sure I'm for that. Drop the ball on EVERY gentle, from behind grab? Yes... yes they do that too. 
-Receivers also quite often drop the ball with NO interference... (my receivers might just happen to have CRAP catching skills so grain of salt there.)
-AI pathing is a MESS. My receiver will be running towards an open spot on the field... I hit him with a bullet. Unfortunately right as I throw the receiver will run into a defender who is chasing another receiver... the defender will then proceed to either dead stop or DRAG MY RECEIVER BACKWARDS as the ball is on the way... not only is this STUPID design... the game doesn't even have the decency to call pass interference or illegal touching or whatever for the defender literally throwing around a receiver who is running a route well down field. 
-REALLY REALLY HATE EA's non-stop advertising of their stupid ""give us money to receiver ""super-ultra-legendary player card (insert player here)"" that they CONSTANTLY redirect you to when returning to the menu. 
-REALLY REALLY HATE how poorly optimized the menu and UI is for this game. Frame drops, slow loading, stutters etc... though the actual game runs smooth on my PC.",1697495866,1697495866,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Speaking strictly on PC, Madden 24 is an improvement over 23. The addition of next gen features feel so much better over the old gen and you have a LOT more control over your characters. 

Added tackle animations make it feel alive again over old gen and the presentation I think is superior.

This is after one game and some practice, but I recommend this game to PC players simply for the new gen mechanics. 

People are rightfully complaining over things that should not exist in this product, and it is certainly glitchy, but accounting for the fact that this is your only choice, it is a lot more fun than 23.

Introduction:
Madden 24, the latest installment of the renowned Madden NFL video game series, has left many fans feeling underwhelmed and dissatisfied. While the franchise has had a long-standing reputation for delivering innovative and immersive football gaming experiences, Madden 24 falls short in multiple aspects. This essay aims to explore the reasons why Madden 24 fails to meet the expectations of its ardent fanbase.

Lack of Significant Improvements:
One of the primary issues with Madden 24 is the lack of significant improvements compared to its predecessors. While fans eagerly anticipate each new installment, hoping for groundbreaking features that enhance their gaming experience, Madden 24 fails to deliver in this regard. The developers seem to have merely focused on superficial changes, such as updated player rosters and improved graphics, rather than addressing the core gameplay elements that need attention.

Repetitive Gameplay Mechanics:
Another notable drawback of Madden 24 is the repetitive nature of its gameplay mechanics. It appears that the developers either failed to introduce fresh ideas or were unable to successfully implement them. As a result, players are left with a sense of monotony as they find themselves performing the same plays, executing identical strategies, and encountering few challenges in their gameplay journey. This lack of variety and innovation ultimately fails to engage and captivate fans, leaving them feeling disinterested and frustrated.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Flaws:
Furthermore, Madden 24 proves to be a disappointment due to significant flaws in its AI system. While realistic AI plays a crucial role in maintaining the immersive nature of sports video games, Madden 24 struggles to offer a competent and believable AI experience. Players frequently witness unrealistic behaviors from both their teammates and opponents, ranging from nonsensical decision-making to inconsistency in their performance. These AI flaws profoundly impact the overall authenticity and enjoyment of the game, leading to considerable disappointment among fans.

Neglected User Feedback:
A crucial aspect contributing to the dissatisfaction surrounding Madden 24 is the apparent negligence of user feedback. Developers typically rely on input from the community to identify areas of improvement and address glaring issues in subsequent releases. However, it appears that the developers of Madden 24 have overlooked or disregarded many valuable suggestions articulated by the players. This failure to actively listen and incorporate user feedback has resulted in a game that disregards the desires and needs of its dedicated fanbase, further cementing Madden 24 as a lackluster addition to the franchise.

Conclusion:
Madden 24, sadly, fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors and ultimately disappoints fans. The lack of significant improvements, repetitive gameplay mechanics, flawed AI, and the overlooked user feedback collectively contribute to the overall poor reception of this game. As fans continue to seek authentic and innovative experiences in their football gaming endeavors, Madden 24's shortcomings highlight the need for the franchise to refocus its efforts on delivering engaging, immersive, and intelligently designed gaming experiences that satisfy the expectations of its loyal fanbase.",1697328002,1697328002,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest one I've noticed this time is the controller works just fine when I am on the play selections or any other screen but on the field when it is time to play If i am QB and I press the button to snap the ball it won't do it or if I press the button to audible the play or change control to a different player the game won't let me change. I have to pause the game and then quickly press the button im needing when it unpauses and then it goes back to being terrible.

I sat on not buying it for a while due to people poorly reviewing it and the hefty price of $70. Eventually I sucked it up and bought it as I wanted to try it out and my friend was enjoying it. I still have not been able to try everything it offers as I have mostly stayed to Ultimate Team and Franchise anyways. 

I do not have the best rig and so it was very laggy at first when I was put into stadiums to where I would get 5-10fps and 3 fps at the worst. Although it was a mix of just the game being poorly optimized it seemed because as soon as I broke into the game more and season two came out, I saw a boost in my FPS boost to upwards of 20 and 30, but an upgrade to my pc would probably be needed to make it overall better but that is besides the point.

Some specs for people who care

Computer is on Windows 10 Pro
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (4gb VRAM)
64-bit operating system/x64-based processor
16gb of Ram

For Ultimate Team, I know EA is known for being cash hungry when it comes to the shop and I can obviously see that with the offers they have, enticing you to buy them. Does that mean you can't have a good team if you don't buy those packs? Absolutely not. I have been able to build a pretty good team without spending a dime on the special currency. Yes it requires you to grind out challenges and the pass but for me, that makes it fun to an extent. I will admit I am a noob and I don't really enjoy playing head 2 head as I am always outskilled and out framed but I find ways to enjoy ultimate team nevertheless. There are some things I wish the game taught me earlier but I have been able to work around it.

Franchise is the mode I knew to an extent already and I got what I expected. It obviously takes time to get decent at but I have had a decent amount fun for the hours I have played on it,

Do I recommend this for computers on the lower/older end? It would depend your specs and what not. I have old ass  and low vram on it so that contributes to the lag but as I mentioned earlier I have worked around it and it has been made better. I can not recommend waiting for a price dip and if it's worth changing from 23 to 24 because as I said, this is my first ever madden game. 

Although to end this off, I do overall enjoy the game contrary to some of the reviews. Is the game still buggy and needs fixes. Hell yes it does, but it's not to the point where it doesn't make me want to play it, and from what it seems EA has helped fix some of the bugs already. This review will obviously be subject to change but as of now this is my opinion on it.",1696920892,1696920892,True,2,0,0.54314720630645752,1,True,False,False

I hadn't played Madden in a number of years and wanted to pick this one up, remembering the fun I used to have playing franchise and head to head.  While it doesn't seem as though there's been much (if any) development in those areas, I guess I can say that it feels much the same as I recall.  So, if you enjoy playing an NFL game, this is decently good for that.  Unfortunately, it's currently your only option and therefore, lacks improvement.  Monopolies are never good.  For me, this satisfied my desire to play an NFL-based game.

Also, after reading others' reviews, I can say that I don't experience many of the same gripes they do.  My game isn't nearly as laggy as people make it out to be, and the AI players aren't nearly as bad as I recall them being in earlier versions of the game.  Sure the menus are slightly sluggish, but not nearly as bad ass people made them out to be in my opinion.

Madden NFL 24 Superstar Mode Review: A Missed Opportunity in Football's Virtual Spotlight

Madden NFL 24's Superstar mode makes a return, but falls short of expectations, leaving fans yearning for more from this cherished feature.

Pros:

Reintroduction of Superstar Mode:
It's a positive move to bring back Superstar mode, catering to fans who enjoyed it in previous iterations. The familiarity is a welcome sight for long-time enthusiasts of the franchise.

Cons:

Lackluster Storyline:
The mode disappoints in terms of narrative depth and meaningful choice dialogs, resulting in a less engaging experience. The potential for a compelling story arc is left largely untapped.

Repetitiveness Takes Its Toll:
Repetitive elements within the mode diminish its enjoyability, making it feel like a chore rather than an engaging experience. Players find themselves in a loop, craving more variety and unpredictability.

Stagnant Commentary:
The recycled announcer lines contribute to a sense of staleness, highlighting a need for more dynamic and varied commentary. A fresh perspective on commentary would greatly enhance immersion.

Untapped Potential:
Madden NFL 24's Superstar mode could benefit from a more ambitious approach, akin to NBA 2K's open-world concept, offering greater player interaction and customization options. A deeper level of engagement and personalization is sorely missed.

Need for Innovation:
There's a call for a fresh perspective in the development team to infuse new life into this mode, as the current iteration lacks the spark needed to captivate players. Innovative ideas and execution are needed to breathe vitality into this once-vibrant mode.

Conclusion:
Madden NFL 24's Superstar mode feels like a missed opportunity in football's virtual spotlight. While it's positive that the mode has returned, the lackluster storyline, repetitiveness, and stagnant commentary leave much to be desired. There's a clear need for more innovation and ambition in the development process to elevate this mode to its full potential and reignite the excitement it once generated among players.

Some other things i forgot to mention. The way to earn Cred or XP is just down right stupid. That's where the repetitive comes into play. The training's never changes and are just down right boring and stupid and has nothing to do with football. Why would i want to throw at a target instead of a real receiver or defense to help me get better at reading the defense and what not. The combine is decent. Would've liked more little mini games.",1696465615,1696466776,False,3,0,0.546263337135314941,0,True,False,False

But the game isn't broken. The problem was my old PC I was trying to run the game on that was the problem. 

I just upgraded my motherboard and CPU to a ryzen 5 5600X 3D with 16 gb of ram and decided to fire up Madden once again and give the gane another shot.

The game runs silky smooth now with absolutely no lag or that slow-mo gameplay I was getting before. 

I'm now loving the game! It's awesome. The gameplay on the field is fast now! and very responsive. The in game menues no longer have lag too.

I hadn't purchased a Madden game since Madden 2007. And I wasn't going to buy it on PC until EA implemented all the features that are on console. So that's the only reason why I bought Madden this year.

If you're having trouble running the game maybe the time has come to upgrade your system. My system isn't the greatest. My GPU is an XFX RX6600. But it was the CPU upgrade that has made the difference.

This game is the worst maddens ever been, the other games were at least tolerable and you had a bit of fun laughing at some of the stupid things that happneded in those games but this one there is no joy there is no happiness, it is just pain. With the other maddens by the time I had as much play time as I have in this madden I was like ok this just seems to be another madden experience it's tolerable enough for this to serve as my football gaming expeirence for this year. Now this madden, I genuinely don't know if I can continue playing it, it is that bad. I don't want to continue playing it if I am to be honest, but this is basically the only game a good friend of mine and me play together to I suffer through it so that we can game together, but I just don't know if I can do it, not with this madden.

It's Madden, if you have played Madden you know what to expect. Can be a lot of fun and can also feel super cheap. Announcers get cut off mid sentence on occasion after drives and the commentary has moments where it makes no sense. I played as the Bucs and you would hear the announcers say that the ""Bucs coming off a win over Tampa Bay last week"". It pulls you out of it. The first season has the analysts talking about you in a general way and there is some pretty good production value. As always the first season is the most flashy then the following ones are just football. Nothing wrong with that at all. Where the game loses me is when I faced the Bears with Justin Herbert, the Falcons with Dak Prescott, the Saints with Joe Burrow, the Panthers with Derek Carr. The following season I ended up with Nick Bosa on my defense, DHop and McCaffery on the offense and the NFL QB situation was even more random.

After 4 seasons I was offered a 1 year contract, which I thought was strange because they could have just used the 5th year options but I accepted. Went through that season and I was offered a 2 year... Really? So at this point I decided to see what would happen if I declined the contract just to see what teams I could go to. (I had won 5 straight Superbowls at this point as QB and had broken the season passing and passing TD records). I had only 1 team offer me a contract, I accepted. The screen flashed a couple times and apparently I was never added to the roster because it kept having a blank window when I advanced the week and the game forced me to retire after 5 seasons.

This mode, while functional, feels broken, the team you are on never makes you a team captain and only gives you 1 to 2 year contracts at a time. If this is intended then there should be an actual option to increase the number of years you want to play for the team. If they don't want that added work fix the team bidding option or put negotiations during the season like in Franchise mode. The lack of contract negotiations for a mode like this is pretty lacking.

Overall... it is what it is. I would suggest playing franchise with a player you make yourself. it feels much better than this mode.",1696297371,1696297371,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

     The actual gameplay is terrible. Passing is terrible, and throws are about 20 less mph than real life. If you bullet pass it into an area withing 10 feet of a defender it will get intercepted. Blocking is worse than its ever been. Blockers will miss assignments right in front of them simply because the animation doesnt happen. Speaking of animations, nothing will go right with a 100% animation based game. Countless in game bugs, like players kicking the football 50 yards, or failing to pick up a ball on the ground 10 times. Dbs in this game are also worse than ever before. In the NFL, the best of the best completion percentages are just under 80 percent, which is incredible. Quarterbacks will average 80 percent against you in this. Drag routes are uncoverable in man, along with slants zigs C routes, which are all extremely basic routes even college Dbs can cover. Jump balls always seem to go to the defender unless its you defending. Tackling is impossible, when playing on all madden you have about a 15 percent chance of an open field tackle, no matter who the players, even when secure tackling. Movement behind the line of scrimmage is terrible, you cant do anything but run, despite numerous qbs being known for maneuvering around the pocket with ease. If a defender is coming to sack you the only thing you can do is run away or throw it. Throwing the ball away is stupid, the qb usually has about 10 brain cells when trying to do it. fumbling is terrible, despite it happening almost every game, regular tackles never seem to force fumbles ever. throwing is stupid, and overly complex. players look like woody  when they are running, and speed is nothing like the real nfl. 
   Now, outside of the actual gameplay, there is unsuprisingly numerous issues. First, overalls are always stupid, but thats just a madden norm now. Keeping old players like Chandler Jones and Eric Kendricks high overalls with abilities despite underperformance. The servers are down just about once a day it seems. But my main issue that i am extremley upset about is superstar mode. First of all, it took me about 20 hours to actually get into the mode, because when I click start career it sticks me into a blue loading screen, continues to play music, but never loads despite how long you wait. This happens about 90-100% of the time. Then, sometimes when you are trying to reenter your current career, it just keeps bringing  you out of it. This alone makes superstar career basically unplayable. But I am not finished. I made a running back career and got put on the Bengals. The Bengals have an excellent qb incase you dont know. Well I got through about 4 games and Joe Burrow already threw 16 interceptions. I dont know why the AI does this, but it makes the actual gameplay  extremely frustrating. I also made a qb career, and for some reason it is extremely laggy when i actually play the qb games, and i basically never lag outside of that mode. Another slightly but less important thing is that there is no setting to turn off manual play calling in career mode. I feel it would make the whole you are a player not the whole team thing more real, but that isnt that important. Another issue is just the bugs in general. I wont dive deep into this but there are numerous, numerous bugs. 
   In conclusion, for a 70 dollar game, the most expensive its ever been, to make an unplayable game is inexcusable, and Madden needs to be boycotted. DO  NOT BUY THIS GAME DO NOT BUY IT UNTIL THAT MAKE IT PLAYABLE( NEW ENGINE, NO ANIMATIONS, NO BUGS, NOT PAY TO WIN, ACTUAL FUN MECHANICS, REALISTIC). this game gives me low expectations for the new college football game they are making on the same engine.",1693107299,1696118140,False,1,0,0.51971888542175293,0,True,False,False

This Bug just occurred to me today.  I turned down my fist extension and did have offers (very poor ones might I add as well) and ended up signing back with my original team (Raiders) for 2 years. 

After those 2 years were up I declined their offer (which was even worse then last time) and went to free agency. 

When I selected the option to look at offers and sign with a team, it automatically took me to a screen telling me to sign with the Bears and could not go back.

I do just that until a new option appears on my screen. ""Retire Player""  I tried advancing couple extra weeks to see if more options would come up, but no.

This is the first year that the PC port of Madden is matched to the current gen versions of the game, so I was super stoked for this. Unfortunately I hyped myself into buying the deluxe edition to play it three days early and coughed up the $90 just to end up with a stuttery/jittery mess. Obviously with the new technology Madden devs have been showcasing leading up to this, it takes some time to adjust to the new gameplay and learn the details of the mechanics, but unfortunately it's next to impossible when the game consistently dips to less than 15 FPS before and during every single play, along with the menu screens taking an obnoxiously long time to load. I run RDR 2 and Baldurs Gate 3 on max settings flawlessly, but who would have thought that the PC port of Madden 24 on low settings would perform this way. Very disappointed.

Pros:
- Brought next gen to PC (only reason I bought it)
- Run blocking is improved
- The preorder bonuses came with a minimum $50 USD worth of in game currency for M.U.T.

Cons:
- They announced cross-play but didn't bring it to Franchise mode
- Server bugs out frequently and doesn't give you card packs you earned for M.U.T.
- Card packs to improve your team in M.U.T. can cost hundreds of dollars with minimal return on your investment (its literal gambling)
- Some cards that you spend real money on can't be 'quicksold' back into in-game currency
- Game stutters horribly on the best video cards available
- Menu UI is absolutely lethargic
- Gameplay is riddled with bugs
- There are three different systems to pass the ball and none of them 'feel' quite right
- No in-game UI for managing tournaments. You literally queue up through a third party app and then have to manually add your opponent as a friend and play them that way. An honor system follows to record the winner on the third-party website (are you kidding me?)
- Zero customer support. I've opened many help tickets to try and get my card packs reimbursed and all they do is 'punt' the ticket around.

They also need to increase community cross-play. Allowing Franchise players to FINALLY be able to play with their friends on other systems.

[b]Context / back story[/b]

So, I live in the Netherlands (Europe?) where soccer is basically the national sports; (NFL) football is non-existant. Me being a bit of a geek and all I never really cared about sports, [i]until[/i] Steam pointed me at ""Madden '22"". Still remembering my football curiosity courtesy of Al ""4 touchdowns in a single game"" Bundy from the Married with Children sitcom I decided to grab '22.

That changed [u]everything[/u] for me. Not only did I really enjoy playing the game of Madden '22 itself, I [i]also[/i] developed a [b]serious[/b] appreciation / love for the sports of NFL football itself. An NFL gamepass subscription soon followed (renewed this season!) and I can honestly say that Superbowl LVII was a [b]major[/b] highlight for both my girlfriend and myself (I managed to drag her into this big time!).

Why all the backstory you ask? Because I care about honest reviews, and I want to make sure that you (yes, [i]you[/i] random reader!) know where my review is coming from: driven by a passion for NFL football.

[b]An improved Madden![/b]

Some people will tell you that if you buy a new Madden game you're basically buying into a roster update. And honestly? They're not completely wrong perse [i]but[/i].. I also wonder if those critics realize the impact such a roster update has on the game? In Madden '23 my favorite team of the Panthers were ranked at 81. Now we're down to 80.

So here's a thing that stood out for me: while the Panthers are off to a bad start so far (= time of writing) their [i]defense[/i] is close to unstoppable. Within context...  and somehow that seriously manifests itself within this version of Madden as well. Look... if I (as a rookie) can stop the 49'ers offense even though I actually dislike playing defense? On exhibition with a simulation game style?

There's much [b]more[/b] involved with ""a mere roster update"" than just a bunch of new names you know...

[h1]Training camp & new passing mechanics![/h1]

How do you ""step up"" from a game like Madden '23 I wondered... a game that paid homage to one of the greatest names within the sports: John Madden himsef? Well, IMO EA managed to do just that: the game opens with a famous quote from Mr. Madden and then we're down to business! The first thing that stood out for me was the new red/purple colour scheme (not bad IMO) but also... the longer loading times. Ugh! Fortunately it seems that 'caching' is a thing and after having played more games those loading times did get somewhat better for me. Still.. what's up with all that?

When you get in the main menu you'll see many familiar names from the past... franchise, ultimate team, quick play and then we have [i]training camp[/i]? Yah, this isn't just the help section anymore: while you can (and should!) play through the ""skill drills"" (as I like to call it) there's more than just learning how to play the game..  As before ""team practice"" allows you to try out every possible situation within a game to see how you can get the best results. If you know how to play Madden but want to get better? You need to spend some time here...

But second.. ""Mini games""! Yah, it looks silly at first glimpse and no: you don't earn any useful rewards like with the practices (these can get you rewards which you can use in UT?). [i]...or do you?[/i] Seriously: try looking at the bigger picture here, this isn't just about running around and earning medals: if you pay attention to what you're doing you're bound to use these experiences to get better in your regular games also!  IMO these mini games are a great way to practice very specific skills in very specific situations.

[b]New passing mechanic![/b]

I love this one!  EA has been touting their ""field sense"" ever since '23 and what did us PC players get? ZIP! Not anymore: there's a new passing mechanic and it is [u]good[/u]! Takes getting used to, can be tricky to master (I play with my trusty Steam controller btw) but DARN is this good => They added a skill based 'mini game' (don't worry: player stats are still held into account as well), and this basically means that you get better and more direct control over the way you pass a ball to another player.

There are 3 options:
[list]
[*] Placement & accuracy => Not only do you need to control the strength and way of passing: you [i]also[/i] get control over where around the receiver you want to pass the ball. If he's covered and you think he may break out on his left... why not pass the ball just over him around his left side?  Very hard to master, but very rewarding too.
[*] Placement + power => This doesn't give you any contol over where you want to try and make the ball land, but you do get to control the type of passing, and the power you put behind it. This is what I like to play with and it can still make a difference: a high lob on full power is still way different than a soft straight ball....
[*] Classic mode => Don't like all this fancy pancy stuff? No worries: this keeps things the way they were back in '23.
[/list]

[h1]The commentators are even more into the game than before![/h1]

I know not everyone appreciates this part as much as I do but [i]darn[/i] are they good! For me this is yet another reason why you may enjoy a ""current"" Madden game to back the current NFL season... it's but a detail for sure but I love how much factual knowledge these guys have and throw at us during a game. Take for example my favorite team of the Panthers? These guys know all too well about our new coach and rookie quarterback, and they're not only eager to share... I think some of their comments make darn good sense from a realistic perspective as well!  Picture me surprised to hear they mentioning how our (= Panthers) defense is sometimes better than the offense?!

Sometimes I just let the computer play itself while I sit back and enjoy the match [u]and[/u] the commentating.

However, that also brings us to...

[h1]This game is far from perfect though![/h1]

Readers beware... there are issues. I already mentioned the loading times, another issue being that this game is obviously in more demand of resources that its predecessor. Now, there is a good explanation for that I think... you no longer see half your team making the exact same gesture in perfect choreography which is a good thing but still. It seems a bit odd if you check the basics stats on the store page (or so I think).

Another immediately noticeable issue: the NFL agenda. At the time of writing Madden '24 is already one week behind the official season which I think is plain out sloppy, especially if you consider that this is an ""officially supported' game.

In addition I am also aware that many players suffer from rather extreme issues such as a full stall of the game, and even full crashes! While I do not experience these myself I really understand how frustrating this must be. See; ""another"" game I recently bought (unrelated to football) manages to stall and crash the very moment I press F12 to make a screenshot!

Still....

[b]In conclusion....[/b]

Maybe bias is in effect here, who knows, but I can honestly say that I'm having a great time with the new Madden '24. However, do keep in mind that I'm a very casual player first and foremost. I mostly play single player, I enjoy the atmosphere and general vibe and love to check stats and make screenshots.

As always in this series... If you're new to the Madden franchise then I think you should ignore all reviews, even mine, and just give it a try for yourselves. While I [b]don't[/b] recommend using Steam's refund policy to demo games I also don't think that any bad can come from it assuming you don't refund games all that often. In full honesty: 90 minutes should be more than enough to give you a good impression of what this game is all about... way within the safety margin of the 120 deadline.

But it still gets a 2 thumbs up from me!

Pros: 
Next Gen on PC is huge!
Superstar Mode is back for the first time in YEARS! (Kinda)
The movement is really nice.
The animations are a ton better imo. 
Cross Platform is awesome.
EA actually has a Anti Cheat vs like 2k....
Player customization is pretty sick once you figure it out. 
Mod support on PC is AWESOME ALREADY! 
EA really made an attempt at doing something new for once bigger than just 1 mode the whole game seems to be modernized and revolutionized. You have to give this game and EA credit for that for once this year. 
Hits actually make you jump out of your seat again like they did back in the day with the added ragdoll like physics. 

***BEST PART IMO*** ALL MADDEN ON SIMULATION STYLE IS ACTUALLY HARD! I HAVE NEVER BEEN 0-9 EVER IN MADDEN BECAUSE IT TENDS TO BE SUPER EASY TO WIN WITH A MOBILE QB THIS YEAR NOT SO MUCH AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING OF YOUR CAREER!***

Cons: 
Still a ton of the same bugs. (One you see every game in career or superstar/franchise mode is the camera goes to a weird angle making you have to call a timeout or run the play to fix it, gets really annoying in big game situations.)
There really isn't a ton of other cons in my opinion besides the bugs the game is actually pretty fresh but I will update this if I find things I do not like.

-Training pack prices have doubled
-They've introduced a new gamble your training away at worse than Vegas Odds option
-They've reduced the ability to get coins in general
-Increased the odds of a favorable player for cash currency packs and reduced CPU based solo games

Every player I face online is God Squad, like catch the ball with an 86 receiver and get caught from a 10+ yard behind defender. Honestly I'm done, hated this game from the get go and thought ""if I grind it out I'll get a little bit better"" while at the same time they've introduced $20+ packs to get the ""pay-to-play"" whales even better and force the free players into the slaughter with ""win only challenges"" like the book ""animal farm"" describes.

Recommendations for improvement: Add the ability to set the draft order in fantasy please. If 2k can do it, so can you EA. I believe in you. Remove pass rush point system, either add 1,000 animations for catching and tackling or remove them all together because the current 5 are bad, whatever was done to passing; revert all changes.

Thank You EA Sports for finally adding the new version (Next Gen) of Madden NFL to the PC for fans of Football.

Secondly: Thanks Again.


Rating based on the 2 modes I play that are relevant to the majority of people who play Madden NFL by EA Tiburon.

Franchise Mode: 8/10
Madden Ultimate Team Mode: 1/10


Franchise Mode is good and a lot of fun, but after 1 month of the game releasing, MUT (Madden Ultimate Team Mode) added an option to pay real money to level up your Field Passes.
So, EA Tiburon basically took away any rewarding feeling of actually playing and building your MUT team. It is 99% pay to play now,  So I can't, just can not recommend this game if your a MUT fan that likes to grind out rewards from Challenges and Field Passes to  build your MUT team as a NMS (No Money Spent) Player..

If your part of the community that mostly plays franchise Mode Connected or Offline, its fun with lots of variety as a Coach/ Owner.

I've been playing Madden football since Madden 94 so I'm pretty old.  I've watched the Angry Joe reviews and read a lot of the negative reviews for the last few years of Copy and Paste Football.  STILL... I decided after weighing the pros and cons (and after a strong pint of Sierra Nevada Imperial Stout) that maybe, just maybe, it has gotten better and maybe things have changed and the people being salty about it are just spoiled.  So I bought it.

After taking forever to download, I loaded the game which allowed me to pick my team (Raiders) and adjust the QB throwing accuracy mechanisms.  Cool right?  Well, after I completed that pass from Jimmy G to Davante... it freezes.  It just froze.  OK, no problem, I'll just run task manager, shut it off and restart right?  Open the game again, attempt a practice mode, game freezes while on the load screen.  I try again, restart game, pick practice mode, loading screen, game freezes again.  WTF?!?

Other than my CPU being a bit old which hasn't affected my gaming experience with games like Red Dead Redemption 2, NBA 2k23, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 etc..., I have all of the recommended specs on my computer.  Nvidia Geforce 1660, 32GB of RAM, well over 50GB of HD space, all the software requirements with DirectX and this game just freezes every time I try to play some NFL football.  

Fine, I'll lower the graphics requirements on the settings menu so I do that and IT STILL FREEZES!!! I updated my drivers on Geforce Experience, same freezing.  After an hour or so of this, I've had enough.  I'm not going to spend more time on this game trying to trial and error why it's freezing so before I'm ineligible to do so, I request a refund from Steam.

The bad

-Cant change uniforms, will automatically reset to original Home or Away. So old uniforms or color rush or anything else you cannot do
-Massive lag spikes during games, I have a good PC build, should be able to easily run this game with how little Madden actually puts into it but there are multiple occasions where the game will slow down to a crawl during the game in the middle of plays
-Receivers still don't feel like they will play for jump balls, but that has always been an issue
-Recycled announcer commentary, and downgrades too with announcers talking about the team winning or losing a week ago, even though my team was on a bye week
-overall nothing really blew me away in game-play, with it just feeling like a new madden roster on the same old game engine
-the drafting process is still overly complicated and kind of useless, but that is my opinion some may like it

The good

-Celebrations are cool with the animations being alright
-Run game feels good, linemen don't feel like brain dead AI, but sometimes they will let a defensive player fly through for a free sack or TFL
-you can restructure contracts to free cap space, no customization into it as it is just done by the game but still a nice touch
-Mini games for players you try to upgrade with the weekly strategy practice, but the rewards are not really worth the time put in
-new stadiums or moving the team and changing the name is pretty easy and cool, with new locations and team names, but most are just the old ones we have seen before

Overall
-Not worth 70$, maybe in time if they fix some of the game-play issues and glitches I would say its worth more around 35-40$.",1694707717,1694707717,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game cannot run on my high end PC without constant stutters. I tried all of the proposed ""fixes"" but they do not work. I finally gave up and tried to just play coach mode and let the AI play while I manage and develop the team to get my football fix. I figure both sides would be impacted by the lag, right? LOL NO! That is broken as well because the AI doesn't take control consistently. I suspect it is due to the lag (in a single player game where I'm not even trying to play...) and the AI not realizing I haven't pressed an input but cannot confirm.

Every single thing in this game is trash. I would only recommend this game if you love hanging out in laggy menus and have horrible taste in music. I turned off the music in the sound options but now the intro to games is super awkward and silent. 

0/10 - please do not buy this. I am an idiot for buying it.

I got the game shortly after it was released, it was a okay basic madden copy-paste of last year but they added the ""next-gen"" features they held from us master race last year. At first he game barely ran half the time and would take several PC restarts to even get the game to run. Another issue was that the superstar mode didn't work for the first two weeks of the games release, and I've come to learn that is was a issue on all platforms. They seem to have somewhat fixed these issues with me not having a problem with either of those anymore, but I digress, the reason I'm writing this review is because of the crashing. Even from the very start this game had crashing issues, not even just the application crashing, Madden 24 would freeze and crash my ENTIRE PC, meaning I would have to hard reset my PC my holding the power button. This is almost a guarantee thing after running the game for a hour or two. I have never had issues like this with ANY of my games, compared to this. Never. Then today, this game forcefully shutdown my computer, BLUE SCREENED it and rendered my computer useless because it would simply boot up my bios and when I would try to exit the bios, It would simply boot it back up. After several hours of fiddling with my PC I got it to boot up windows. I am seriously scared of opening this game and having to deal with that mess again.
I tell you all that just to say that this game is another blatant cash grab from EA while they still have the license, if you still want the game then I would recommend waiting a couple months until they fix all the bullshit that they released. Hell that's thinking positively, I mean if they do EVER fix these issues because it is known that EA turns a blind eye to the PC consumers.

BUT, as a PC player, this game isn't bad. (speaking ONLY of franchise mode, I refuse to play ULT Team or anything i need to pay to win)

is it different then it was last year on current gen consoles? idk, i never played it on them.

but it is better for PC players than it was last year

Pros - 
- Graphics are better, not amazing, but better
- Animations are better
- Blocking feels better
- Catching seems more realistic
- kickoffs are actually kinda fun with the better blocking
- Trade offers seem more realistic, no longer are you getting offered a 65 overall player for a 83 ovr 23 year old qb
- It's next gen on PC which SHOULD be something they added years ago but its nice it's finally here

Cons
- Soundtrack is once again, terrible. idk why they insist on the same mumble rap soundtrack every year.
- graphics aren't great, again not bad but not $70 worth.
- outside the on-field game, there is like NO change. it's just a very basic UI. nothing really changed


Overall- 

I genuinely am enjoying my time with this game, the animations are better, the game feels smoother, and anything i was annoyed with before seems to at least have had an attempt at fixing. it may not be perfect but it IS better and i'd say for >$50 it's worth it.",1694295956,1694295956,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Worst game to come over to PC,
 
I'm running a RTX 3070 with a i7-11700F and this game struggles to reach 60fps on medium settings,

 when you do have FPS stutters any time you snap the ball you begin to play in slow motion as their fix to the problem so pretty much all the time, 

game wouldn't even start when i first downloaded it, i had to go to the file itself and launch the game from there,

 story mode seems like it was made back in 2010 with how horrible the script is and overall character design is garbage there is so much room for improvement if EA would stop listening to business investors and people who actually have passion for the game because this game feels like the most soulless cash grab.

This will literally give you a random player EQUALLY instead of a Tight end every fucking round. Tell your devs to be better. Also, stop building the game in C++. It's an ass language and makes you all a bunch of fuckin nerds. Atleast my code asks you if you want to continue before ass fucking you with another tight end selection.

I can confidently say this is the worse one I've ever played. The user interface is horrible everything is buggy and delayed, i could look past this if the game play was good. The game play is where it is really a joke. i have a 3080 graphics card and have tried no fps limit and locked fps at 120 and every option there is and the input delay when you play online is so bad it's damn near unplayable, if you are someone like me that's super competitive and grinds the ultimate team don't even bother wasting your time. Even though its ""crossplay"" auction block is trash and hardly any cards on it. On top of that it's horrible how bad this game is pay to win, every game you load into is probably gonna have the highest overall cards in the game and that's so ""fair"". Its pointless to because even if you do grind and get a good team don't expect to play good because of all the input delay. This is the worst when you are usering someone on defense or being the QB and cant get the ball out of your hand when you literately pressed the button 2 seconds ago. So if you still are gonna bite the bullet and get this horrible excuse of a game i would just be looking forward to having fun playing franchise cause that's about all its good for. The superstar mode is semi fun but just constantly repetitive. The superstar mode is what finally pushed me to my breaking point and writing this review. Go to try to play a new superstar and game wont load in every time. This is funny scenes  how it'll keep playing the stupid garbage music they have on every year but wont load my game. Hope this helps just on person, please take what i say into consideration. If you wanna spend 60$ or 100$ just go spend it on something else or another game instead. Take it from me, the dumb guy who's already wasted 200$ on this pathetic excuse of a game.",1694160987,1694160987,False,2,1,0,0,True,False,False

However, the EA mindset is a seriously problem. I grinded MUT for multiple weeks to learn the hard way that packs just ruin the gameplay. It was tolerable until this week when a bunch of 87 overalls realeased and the only consistent way to get them is to spend $50-100 jon packs.

Be aware that the QB fumbles if he runs and gets tackled. It is too unrealistic for it happens more than it should. 2. The game will not kick a field goal when its a critical 4th down at the end of the game. If you want ensure a field goal choose it on the 3rd down. Also with Madden 24 some of the receivers do not run their full route at times and they are interfered with on the run and no penalty is ever called.

Some presentation issues, but it looks better this year with the TD cameras and stats. Where is the Nex Gen Stats? That feature looked cool to me when I saw it on consoles and am disappointed it's not here.

Haven't tried Superstar mode yet, but will update if I do. 

Game-play feels so much better and I'm having fun with it. Blocking looks improved, catching, running, etc. I put 100s of hours in '23 and this feels like a drastic improvement game-play wise. Presentation needs cleaning up, and Franchise mode still needs constant additions to make it feel better.

This is not your Madden from a decade ago where you can just spam long bombs, have endless pick 6's, punt and kick return TDs, and the animations feeling really scripted. This just feels so much better overall than what I was used to in the past. 

Graphics are really nice overall

Gameplay feels fluid

Running the ball is actually possible (and fun!) versus previous Maddens where I felt like really the only course of action was to throw the ball or scramble for big gains with someone like a Michael Vick every other play and just cheese it. The blocking is pretty good now as well!

I have a 13900k and a 4090 for reference and I'm running the game at 120 fps locked. Aside from a few cutscene hitches and audio not being present sometimes for certain aspects of the pre-game, etc, it's a pretty nice experience.

Anyway, I'm completely happy with my purchase.

This game still doesn't even run for half the people who bought it on PC, and EA's only comments are that they want to fix menu lag and passing in ultimate team mode, because those are 2 things directly tied to how much more money they can milk out of players with microtransactions.

(espn weekly review) (custom plays) (pregame coin toss). small but noticeable issues like if a player is injuried and you tell madden you want to sub them out rather than risking a injury they still come in the game. Also, I had 2 players get injuried in my superbowl and left the game and when we won the superbowl the players were out on the field celebrating because they are listed as the first stringers on the depth chart... same with the announcers in the game having the same 3 voicelines every year for every emotion that could happen during a play... game winning touchdown in the preseason? ""and its caught for a touchdown!"" game winning touchdown in the superbowl? ""and its caught for a touchdown!"" maybe get new announcers for the game so it feels fresh considering you have to listen to them in every game mode you play. maybe consider making AI qbs not be complete robots in the pocket. I played franchise mode games against justin fields, lamar jackson, and josh allen and whenever they didnt have a guy open they still wouldnt even consider running the ball. Also, your face scans for rookies makes the game laughable. the most noticeable one being jahmyr gibbs not looking like his real life self at all. another thing you could add back that was in a previous madden is a audible description of the player when you draft them (madden 25). player QBs consitentely miss ""perfect accuarcy perfect timing throws"" which is fine for realism in franchise but when im playing online h2h this is very frustrating. the game also being completely based off of animations is still a thing regardless of what madden tells you. are you in perfect postion to tackle a superstar x factor running back? sucks to be you he has super star x factor abilitys and will run you over. the is truly a copy paste every single year it feels and openly calling this a make or break game and releasing this as the game you have been working on is just awful",1693599374,1693599374,False,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

Madden 18 was so bad that I vowed to take a break for years to let them sort some shit out. Surely waiting 6 years would make M24 feel like an actual upgrade right? Nope, same old shit. For reference I am a franchise only player so IDGAF about MUT or anything else, my review is ""offline"" (it's actually forced online) franchise centric, considering this is supposed to be the official simulation experience of the NFL.

-Players feel sluggish, and just making them do what you want them to do is a struggle. Making these players do things they could do in real life is the whole point of a football game, but it still feels like running in quicksand. 

-Aggressive catch was useless in M18 and before, it's still useless. Same goes for possession WRs. Madden somewhere along the line decided that it should simply be impossible to complete a pass in traffic unless you're in MUT using Moss. An elite 95+ spec and CIT receiver 1 on 1 with a corner 6 inches shorter in real life is an auto throw and very likely a huge completion. In madden, it is either just dropped inexplicably, picked, or popped up in the air. There just isn't really an animation for catching a pass over a defender. It's utterly bizarre that this has gone unaddressed for a half a decade+. A very common type of receiver and play is simply not viable even 10% of the time in madden. I play with the Colts mostly, and Michael Pittman Jr. isn't Tyreek Hill, but he should be able to separate and make tough catches. But in madden there's simply no value in receivers who win via anything but speed and he isn't any fun to use. Make it make sense.

-these are NFL players, but sometimes it feels like I can't get them to do something I would be able to as a regular person because controls are so sluggish and unpolished. It isn't fun to control these guys, which is a pretty major part of a sports game.

-trench play still doesn't feel realistic. I have Quenton Nelson on my team but he doesn't feel powerful or smart at all.

-it's still very noticeable that the AI has very different rules for itself vs you, which is a terrible piece of game design. The beauty of the NFL is how coldly equal it is for everyone, and you don't get that from madden. Balls my players can reach they'll inexplicably short arm, while the CPU makes plays you know your players never would. 

-The commentators are still the worst in sports games. Delayed and nonsensical reactions. Massive moments don't feel like it, whereas they'll treat a missed preseason FG like it lost the super bowl. Madden should have multiple teams of commentators to keep it fresh, and have much more grandiose of a scope of lines recorded to pull from. If they were innovative I'd say they should start to look into use of AI to help make realistic real time reactions to stuff, I think the possibilities there are so exciting, but we all know EA doesn't innovate.

-still animation based gameplay

Now the thing I am even more qualified to comment on is the inner workings of franchise and team building. OOTP is the gold standard for this and I'll reference it a bunch because of that, but every sports franchise blows madden out of the water here. And again, disappointingly little progress has been made here, sometimes it is worse. 

-AI still feels less alive than any other sports video game. No game is perfect at immersion, but madden is truly bottom tier still. No adjustments are ever made by the CPU. Baffling team building logic. OOTP transports me to a new world, madden makes it painfully clear at all stops that it is a soulless video game made by a company that wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. 

-Bugs everywhere, and the menu is sooo slow. I'm running a 3070/5800x build and the gameplay runs fine fps wise, but the menus still are like pulling teeth. I have heard people with worse computers not even being able to open the game.

-Compounding slow menus, the UI is somehow worse than when I quit madden half a decade back. 

-Scouting, also somehow worse. You literally have to fire your whole scouting department and rehire a new one every preseason to scout effectively. If madden doesn't care to make scouting realistic or fun (this iteration of scouting is neither) then why make it part of the game at all? OOTP doesn't have a scouting mechanic- you hire a scout, with money that you could have used elsewhere, and then you simply have to put trust into that scout that their evaluations are better than other teams' scouts. If you skimped on paying for a great scout you'll have consequences, but paying for the best scout means less money for players, developments, etc. It is different, but 100X more immersive and realistic than madden. I love scouting if done right, but if you don't care to do it right, you end up with a process that just feels painful as it does in M24 and would be better off without it entirely.

-I heard some say madden's created draft classes are improved, but I don't really see it. It's still a shell of what it could be, and still isn't realistic at all. I don't see varied enough skillsets, I still see far too many bad athletes, I see unrealistic skillsets, the terrible scouting system. I did enjoy that scouting grades aren't so specific anymore-""day 3"" as a designation rather than ""round 5"" leaves it open to that player going anywhere from round 3 to undrafted, so if you like a guy you gotta take him. More realistic than before at least.

-not franchise specific per se, but one of my biggest sticking points that I honestly cannot believe has still not been addressed- positional designations. Mind mindbogglingly, draft prospects are *still* shoehorned into being ""LG"" or ""ROLB"" or ""FS,"" when in real life guys are seen much more generally as an OT prospect, an off ball LB prospect, a pass rusher, etc. It makes absolutely no sense, all it does is needlessly complicate things. How has this still not been made more realistic? Get rid of the left vs right BS, that is not how any draft analyst actually looks at prospects, and all it does it add multiple extra menus to scouting that are needless. Especially when madden lets you edit any offensive lineman to any other position with no penalty- another thing they should address.

-Not only do they still bizarrely specify things like left vs right guard, they use positional names out of 2001. LE/RE/DT/OLB/MLB for every team and scheme still? No edge rusher designation? Absolutely embarrassing for everyone involved with this game that this has not been updated in 20 years. Players on defense should be listed as such- interior defenders, pass rushers, off ball linebackers, safeties, corners, with variations within- tweener iDL-edge players, LB/S hybrids, etc. This has been how it works for a long time now IRL, and updating it would simplify it so much! Instead, we *still* have 4-3 teams signing pass rushers with 40 coverage to play off ball, or 3-4 teams with 240 pound 3techs. It hurts my brain how little effort and knowledge it would take for madden to make this change, and what a difference it would make in the quality of their product, and they still haven't. Shameful. 


I could go on, but what's the point? Whoever is making decisions for this franchise decided long ago that integrity or pride was much less important than the bottom line, so they'll keep putting out $70 roster updates designed to take money from small children via MUT. If the NFL understood the importance of a good official video game for a sport, they'd have some standards for EA, but it doesn't look like that will ever happen. TL;DR- buggy, boring, soulless, don't buy. I'll get my hours in, if only to get my money's worth and see if I can get a workable experience to last me another half decade before I give this company money again.

This is the first year on pc in ages we have had an up to date game matching console(yawn). The running and movement in the game is weird to an extent. The players have inertia so for anyone who has played tarkov if you are heavy or are moving fast one way you don't stop on dime. Meaning the momentum you have will carry you a a little further. You cant just sprint full speed at the qb around the edge and expect to stay tight and swing up to tackle him. You have to let off the speed boost so you can make the cut up. Once you get that figured out and when to use speed boost and not its a decent game. I don't play mut cause its boring to me to play with a full team of superstars all 99. The real fun of the game is head to head or in franchise mode with friends. I would recommend this game only if you have played in the past few years of madden. I'm still learning this game and complain about it. I'm leaving this as a positive review cause the game is good just takes time to relearn the physics engine. Yeah sadly its EA but till someone else comes along (cough) 2K we have to deal with EA putting the same game out year after year and taking out good features to put in crap that doesn't work or makes the game worse.,1693142959,1693142959,True,1,3,0.417317092418670654,0,True,False,False

Removed relocation teams, lack of custom/generic playbooks in coaching menus, player editing that doesn't allow for body-type edits, unrealistic auto-sim stats, lots of little things like that which add up over any significant playtime.

We got really drunk, danced to Irish music, had boxty, enjoyed many a fine and rowdy conversation, and as the night wrapped we ended up walking into a cute little Pho joint. 

The Pho we got from this place was the worst Pho I've ever had in my entire life. It was like they forgot salt. It was just beef water. There weren't even vegetables. It was meat in water. It was so bad we weren't even mad, we just laughed and decided to get something else later. 

For some reason I will never be able to explain, I took my chopsticks back to the hotel with me. And then home. They were good chopsticks. I ended up losing one of them at some point, but the other...it became my guiding light in life. If I needed a good back scratch, it could reach. If there was a spider web, it had me covered. I played with my cat with it. I even used it as a chopstick occasionally, though it often complained quietly about the dishwasher being too hot. My point is, it held a place of honor on my desk, standing alone, a champion above lesser inanimate objects. A companion tool that earned its place by my side for life through dedication and support.

pros
-visuals 
-thats about it

cons
- game play feels clunky 
- new and improved AI looks like a bunch of middle schoolers playing football for the first time
- hit stick shouldn't even be a option anymore when everyone and their mother bounce right off of it and keep moving forward
- shit company 
- be nice to have a game with would have full controller support and not default every 10 seconds to Xbox controller settings. 
- still a dog shit company 
- its 2023 why the hell is lineman still out running WR and RB if theres a fumble or they get a pick????

Its a Madden game, its different than Madden 23, its actually better in alot of ways and yes the same in others, but its overall a Madden game a football game, not sure what more you would want, maybe some shirtless people running around on the field? or some rockets shooting enemy players? Come on people. Lets get into pros and cons.

Pros:
- Madden/NFL game
- Fluid franchise lots of improvements
- MUT is still fun as heck
- Gameplay is alot better, can almost suplex people now.
- Next GEN
- Crossplay
- Anti-cheat

Cons:
- Laggy for alot of people
- Needs a major update to fix some of the issues
- UI needs a fix aswell
- MUT paywall again, needs more freebies
- Give us a patch EA 

Now I haven't bought Madden in many years, i've been using the EA sub to get them all for free, but I bought this years as its Next GEN and Crossplay, this is something that even 2K refuses to do, 2K refuses to even add a Anti-cheat program to get rid of the thousands of hackers on their games, but here EA takes the biggest step and throws in Anti-cheat and Crossplay. Give them credit where credit is due.

Again its a Madden/NFL game at the core of it, you get what you pay for and more, is it worth $70, of course to me it is, but in reality no its not. But im not a pirate and I love Madden football. I have already gotten my moniez worth believe me. 

7/10 Might be best to wait until a major update is tossed in before getting, as yes there is quite a few issues.

Come on EA, don't let us down.",1692859724,1692859724,True,14,4,0.526952028274536133,3,True,False,False

First, an anticheat message pops up whether or not I have any anticheat software running. At first, i thought it was complaining that anticheat software was disabled, but now I'm not sure. It's not like I was planning to cheat since I don't play head to head and don't play MUT at all. Then I'm told Secure Boot is not enabled. Well, guess what/ the Steam page does not state that you must have Secure Boot enabled, so many of us spent money on this game with rigs that greatly exceed the posted specs and STILL cannot run it. So, I spent hours trying to learn about secure Boot and enabling it. Turns out, I could not find any such setting in my BIOS despite this being one of the most recent and expensive motherboards available. I spent well over a thousand dollars on an upgrade just a few weeks back. So far this is the first game that doesn't like my new CPU, RAM and/or motherboard. Why EA would care about Secure Boot or any anticheat software in a game I want to play solo, I don't know. If they are so worried about cheats, they could simply grey out the mutliplayer game options if you don't have Secure Boot running and the anticheat operating how they want. But this way I'm likely to just get a refund if they don't make their game playable on my system. So, they would be out money on a game I'd really like to play. I'll update this review if these things ever get fixed and I get a chance to play.

So, after almost a week, I FINALLY get Secure Boot working and Madden 24 runs, which means it asks me a skill level, wants to know my favorite football team, asks about sending my personal data around, and then places me in a mandatory passing tutorial, which I tried for hours and cannot get by. There are five kinds of passing in Madden 24. I don't know. Maybe the game is misinterpreting some of my keypresses. I don't use all the different kinds of passes in Madden anyway. I can find no way to get past or around this tutorial. So now I'm stuck. I didn't spend all this money to play nearly impossible tutorials. I paid to actually play a game. When can I get to that?

Bad things:
The UI or any and all menus.
The play tried to make offense worse but not you just have Defenders with speed boost that can fall, trail a reciever and then catch up and no look int a ball in the air.
Receivers always run into defenders and decide the play is over and will walk deciding that the play is over with the ball in the QB hand still. 
That even with the multiplayer pay to win micro transactions and the extra 10 dollars EA will still decide to screw you instead of a fancy paid worker.

Good things:
you can still cry in the corner.

A lot of the times, offensive and defensive AI are just absolute braindead idiots that do not react to plays like an actual human would. All of these problems are IMMERSION BREAKING.

Look at how many hours I put into this game and see that I am giving a really honest opinion.  On top of that, I have over 1TB of recordings from Madden 22 until now to prove what I am saying is nothing but the truth.  

This game seemed playable at first, in fact it felt like I was having fun for a bit.  Until certain plays started to not make sense much sense.  I mean, I have recording showing players literally transporting to a specific part of the field without even moving their feet!  Like, WOW!  

If starts to feel like its scripted for specific scenarios in the game, like players will glide to an area and make a play.  Even worse, I play DT most of the time, and the game will sometimes make me swim left, when I purposely swim moved right lol, like its so obvious at this point that it makes me and my entire family not want to play a football game since this is the only choice at the moment.

Early days, there are still gameplay glitches here and there, I will wait for a proper roster update by regular season, week four to start a franchise but Superstar and other game modes are fine since updating my hardware.

It won't help anything to sit and rave about this game, especially given EA's many issues.
I can't say I'm impressed, but I can say this is how the game should be. There's room for improvements and specific gripes, but as a whole, this is definitely the most functional (and fun) Madden has looked in probably  over half a decade.

Superstar mode is good again, Franchise has received consistent actual attention and updates, the graphics and gameplay are better than the last years - and the attention to PC gamers by finally giving us the long-overdue Next Gen edition is what made this the first Madden I've actually wanted to buy at full price.

So far Navigating the menus has been painfully slow. In superstar mode something as simple as hitting ""advance week"" takes 10-15 seconds to register, than it does the sim of the other teams games, than another 10-15 second wait while it appears to just lag, than the week will finally start. Every menu you try and open, ie. settings, roster, upgrades, also have a massive delay after trying to enter them. This doesn't seem like much when you are used to games that navigate quickly or just don't feel like letting time just sitting there looking at a frozen screen add up it can be quite aggravating, especially with the price tag this game came with. 

The gameplay is more of the same from madden. When you hold A to skip through scenes you also end up sitting there waiting at a minimum of 20 seconds, which is almost not even worth it to hold A at that point. The screen freezes so you're basically watching a still frame of something for almost 30 seconds. If they could find a way to fix this lag I would say this is a decent step up from previous years but right now it just seems like more of the same from the madden franchise. 

Another thing I would like to bring up / complain about is that when your team accepts a penalty, the announcers will say really weird stuff like ""Why would they accept that and give the ball back to the offense"", when the penalty was like a pass interference on the defense and the context of their sentence makes absolutely no sense. I also had the announcers tell me that ""The Ravens are coming into this game after their loss to Baltimore last week"" which... I don't even understand how that happens. I also heard that ""The Cowboys defense did an excellent job against the run last week against Dallas"". On another side note in superstar mode it says that all of my stats are 1st in the league on the stat hotbar, however they are definitely not first in the league. ie I have 32 catches at this point and both Travis Kelce and Cooper Kupp have more than 32 catches but it still says I'm first in the league in receptions. I'm sure if I wanted to author a book I could sit here and give more reasons why I am yet again disappointed with madden and its single player experience but this was enough of a rant.

I will happily change my stance if some of these issues get addressed but I know madden has a history of not listening to the community or fixing problems that don't adhere to them making more money so not holding my breath.",1692370345,1692585053,False,15,1,0.656812846660614014,0,True,False,False

I had Madden 19.  Just got Madden 24.  Madden 24 has better player control.  I like the slowdown mode when QB passing.  Graphics and overall play (tackles, blocking, hits, catching, interceptions, etc.) are way more realistic.  

I am convinced these are the reasons for the bad reviews:

1.)  The game requires 20GB RAM for ultimate performance.  I have 16GB, gameplay is fine.

2.)  I have a 2.5GHz machine.  Forget what the minimum is.

3.)  My hunch is the negative reviewers for this game don't have a machine capable of running this game.

4.)  Secure boot - if you're getting the ""secure boot is not enabled for this machine"" error, your motherboard and/or CPU BIOS aren't up to date.  

First, check if ""secure boot"" is ""off"":

4a.)  Type ""msinfo32"" in the search bar.

4b.)  Under ""system summary"" on left pane, look for ""secure boot state"" on right pane.  It's about halfway down.  It probably says ""off"".  

To fix, try the below (Win 11 in this example):

4c.)  Type ""settings"" in search bar

4d.)  Under ""system"" on left, click on ""recovery"", then click on ""restart now"".  

4e.)  Machine reboots.  On restart, click ""troubleshoot"", click ""advanced options"", click ""uefi firmware settings"".  Click ""restart"".  Machine reboots again.  Your system should now read ""secure boot = on"" (see 4a., above).  

Hopefully this saves people time, and from going down the rabbit hole of trying to find BIOS update files that need to be booted from a floppy disk (A: drive).  For those of you who may not know, floppy disks were invented by dinosaurs.

UEFI is Windows firmware updating utility, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).  It's baked into Windows and saves us from the dinosaurs.  That's the 2 sentence explanation (for you purists out there), but one thing's for sure, if you don't have UEFI, get a new machine, it will save you the frustration in the long run.

Obviously, next gen has been brought to PC, but it adds a whole lot more to single-player modes. They brought back drills and they're actually fun now instead of being a grind like they were in the past. The DB/WR battles are a lot of fun to play, especially. Franchise added a bunch of features, relocation is a lot easier, CPU coaches actually do clock management correctly, passing mechanics are a lot more fluid, draft generation is more developed, your franchise coordinators are actually unique and matter. I've yet to run into any major bugs or issues while playing.

The biggest improvement, in my opinion, has been difficulty, though. In previous Madden games, even on All-Madden, I was able to run up the score on the CPU, so I had to adjust the sliders to a ridiculous level. When I first launched this game and started a franchise, I set it to All-Madden, assuming I'd be fine. I lost 62-7, and it was my fault, not a bunch of bullshit CPU picks. I've switched back to All-Madden again after a quick tour in All-Pro, and now I actually have realistic records on the season and most wins are close games.

I don't give a shit about Ultimate Team and never have, and I'm still happy about this release. I feel like the game genuinely took a step forward. 

If you're not a chronic complainer and you just like Madden, at worst, this game will be fine for you. Even the FOTF replacement, Superstar Mode, is actually fun.

Also, if you notice, the vast majority of negative reviews have less than 5 hours of gameplay. I imagine I have a better understanding of the game after about 30 hours than those reviews do.

The input delay is tragic, I've never seen anything this bad EVER, I mean you cant even try to think about making a tackle in the open field without you missing or simply just running past the ball carrier and looking like a you've never played a game of madden in your life. Somehow PS5 controller controls show up as XBOX controls only while playing in Head 2 Head games at least in MUT. While It clearly knowns im using a PS5 Controller, cause when picking plays and adjusting them it shows PS5 controls. (didn't help using PS4 controller either and I've set my controller to PS in Steam Settings) **THE MARKET IS BROKEN** it shows only 40% of the actual cards that are available in game, I've literally watched 6-10 of the same card just vanish from the market as I was going to purchase them, and this happened on multiple cards (for example 84 OVR Mike Evans, 84 OVR St. Brown and 85 OVR Montez Sweat) then when you even try to search that card again, its says none were, or are even on the market, LIKE HELLO? HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE? BTW Dont even try to pass in this game right now, Again controls feel like I hot-wired and NES controller to my pc and am trying to use that, So throwing an INT every other drive is unstoppable, (granted im not pro at this game, I consider myself Average to just above average so I expect to make some bad reads). Throwing animations feel so bad IMO too, they take years to wind up and throw the ball leaving me to get Sacked much more often then in past Maddens (tried 80 OVR Jalen Hurts, 83 OVR Josh Allen, and also 87 OVR Kenny Pickett all were tragic) CB's as always just run into your receivers making them stop completely mid route with no flag throw, (it feels much worse this year than in years past too)  thus causing more INT's. God forbid you accidentally graze the receiver though while trying to run with them, not even making them move or stop while playing user on defense, and its an automatic flag throw. Linemen just allow defense to run right past them every 2-5 plays, I mean they just completely miss/ignore the block somehow, even though the guy is literally standing right in front of them. The fact this game is $70 F'ing dollars is beyond me, nearly criminal IMO, I mean its been also copy paste every single year and somehow they still manage to F it up and not properly optimize/build the game. IMO it is no where near complete, and it probably will never will be. Creators spend too much time caring about the Console Experience, leaving everyone on PC out to dry and to play this massive pile of Horse S***.  ( I just hope they take the criticism the right way, to fix and finish what they started cause this is a terrible look for future games to come).",1692547436,1692547436,False,10,0,0.608050704002380371,0,True,False,False

I think I read that they’re about to get competition from Maximum Football and another game so I suspect that’s why. This is one of those rare years they actually make some changes. If you want a Madden, buy this one and expect the next 3-5 releases will be exactly the same. 

All that said, the lag is def there rn. The menus are slow af the games have some lag but I wouldn’t call it “unplayable,” but it is close. If it were any worse, it would be unplayable. I expect and hope they’ll fix some of this. 

Next Gen is def cool. Superstar is pretty low and it’s dumb af that you need online. I get disconnected mid game every 1-4 games and it doesn’t save. I like the 6 slot trading in franchise, but otherwise there doesn’t seem to be much different that I’ve seen. The depth chart autoreorder can be turned off so it doesn’t reset after every game (why tf did it take them 6-7 years to implement this???). 

The o-line play seems to be improved. The defense doesn’t catch every single ball that goes near them for the CPU. The animations, on Next Gen, are better. The precision passing seems a lil overly challenging as far as throwing a perfect ball.

Honestly, if we’re calling the last iterations (all being the same exact going back to 18) a 2/10, I think I’d give this a 5/10. It’s definitely got some improvements, but don’t expect a stellar game.",1692542735,1692542735,True,2,0,0.474226802587509155,0,True,False,False

The amount of stupid things that happen throughout your gaming experience is enough to give a 23 year old a heart attack. I primarily play Franchise mode with friends in my time on this game and the amount of problems are truly insane that I must break them down by literal aspects of the game. 

For starters, if it wasn't obvious I play as the Miami Dolphins for my franchise primarily on All-Madden and the defense is literally broken naturally that you must alter damn near every aspect of it to play it properly, unless you want Bradley Chubb and Jaelen Phillips dropping into coverage... Now, lets continue with the defensive issues. You cannot tackle. It's literally impossible. The running backs break every fucking tackle - whether its aggressive, conservative or hit stick, they're bouncing off dudes like crazy and the receivers are only slightly easier to tackle. CPU pass blocking is unparalleled in strength, they get so much time in the pocket its crazy, 85 overall speed rusher Jaelen Philips has a whopping 3 sacks through 10 games and 80 overall power rusher Bradley Chubb has just 4 on the other side of the line. The pass coverage reaction is abysmal which is disappointing as I had seen many clips that showed it being improved for this years version of the game, however my DB's who are literally Jalen Ramsay, Jevon Holland and Xavien Howard, get smoked every fucking play and don't play the ball at all; then if you make the coaching adjustments to play the ball you can write off every possible tackle after catch you even had a chance of as they will soar right by them without hesitation. Now, lets by chance say you get an interception... the CPU doesn't worry because the ancient tight end Mercedes Lewis will run down Jalen Ramsay in a straight away going the other direction. No fucking way that ever happens. 

Now lets discuss the offense, going inversely to the issues on defense. My players never break a tackle, only time it happens is if I get the spam A break tackle prompt and i hit it, but even then it only shows up when I am smack in the center of 5 defenders so whats the use. My pass blocking is horrendous, like last year I notice moments where my tackle doesn't even touch the defender rushing. I'm running for my life and get unbelievable negative plays as a result and even with adjustments being made such as keeping a tight end in or a half back to pick up some stray blocks it just doesn't matter. Then this fucking momentum meter has some severely stupid enhancements - and let me be clear, I do like the momentum meter. However - in what situation does momentum make it so I don't even know my receivers??? That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Another issue I run into is in my season with the Denver Broncos I can't throw a go route to save my life. Dude will be wide open with 5 yards separation from the receiver and that sucker gets under thrown every time - its amazing. I have been Tyreek Hill with the ball in my hands on a straight away and a man chased me down running at an angle up the field, again, never going to happen. 

Even special teams is broken. I had 3 games in the rain and windy, the wind is not accurate. Playing in clear conditions my kicker can hit from 62 going full power, playing with 13 mph winds going in favor of me the ball came up way short from 59 out. Playing in rain with the wind going 16 mph up and to the right, aimed the kick ever so slightly to the left to adjust for it and the ball went hard left like i was aiming in to section G on my left hand side. 

Fix the fucking game. Make the game fair. Make harder difficulties be harder because they play smarter not make them broken and literally impossible to tackle. Make it so they have fucking clock management for fuck sake, for yet another year the CPU will run out of time going into half time on the 25 yard line in clear field goal range when they started their drive with 3 full time-outs. Game has promise but has sever game breaking issues in key spots that make it no fun. I've played madden every year since 2005 on All Madden and I'm 1-9 with the most overpowered team in the game specifically because ""I can't play defense"" because my players can't make a tackle with  3 people to assist them.",1692540954,1692540954,False,93,17,0.81284785270690918,7,True,False,False

This is quite possibly the worst Madden game EVER produced. I haven't bought one in a few years so I figured I was due. BIG MISTAKE. Do not believe the lies about improved anything or added features. The features added are either useless, broken or both. They're also just re-added features from old Madden games that are poorly re-implemented. 

-1 out of 5 running plays will have a holding penalty so it's basically pointless. I had to turn off holding completely to be able to run the ball.
-Controller will drop input at random either in menus or during plays. Happens more often in menus resulting in random scrolling.
-Route running gets broken during press coverage and receivers just run around random directions or right out of bounds. They also just stop running routes at random. Slant route? You meant stop running at the hash mark right? Picked.
-Random frame rate drops for no reason at all.
-Constant mini-freezing in menus when trying to call plays.
-Probably removed more features from franchise mode than they added, and the implementation on those added are awful copy and pastes from past games. 
-""Manage team"" is a whole menu just to rebuild your entire stadium, to the same 6 templates they had 10 years ago, or relocate. No upgrades, no renovations. Absolutely nothing new at all, just half way re-added features from old games.
-Absolutely ridiculous glitchy ball carriers breaking 10 tackles, spinning out of a massive pile up and running 80 yards for a TD. Don't worry though, most long runs get called back for holding even if it's 50 yards behind the play.
-The training camp drills are broken. They're either glithched to the point of being pointless (Pass rush tunnel drill. The linemen will follow you down the tunnel and get in the way) Or just about learning to exploit buggy AI (WR Red Zone Drill. The only way to get the top score is to run whip routes over and over again). The ""drills"" are pointless and have no application on how to play Madden or football.
-Commentary is the worst I've ever heard. Pointless rambling that has nothing to do with what is happening. Or things like ""That Ravens defense was really great last week in their win against Baltimore."" Zero quality control as usual.

My first instinct was to refund immediately and I should have listened. I'm going to play a few seasons of franchise mode and go back to College Football Revamped because NCAA 14 is a better game than any Madden in the last decade.

They make decent points, but today there is a culture around bashing developers because a game isn't perfect. EA is EA and we know where their priorities in developing games. Unfortunately, nothing will change unless they lose the NFL license and get some competition. I'm a firm believer that the blame should not be placed on the developers, as most of them simply want to make a good game. This is undermined by a lack of consistency in the dev team, money-first decisions from higher-ups, and EA's complacency knowing NFL fans will buy it simply because there are no other licensed options. Welcome to 21st century capitalism.

Is the game buggy? Yes. Is there still missing features that were included in Madden games 10+ years ago? Also, yes.

Good:
Graphics have improved - ultra settings look better than ever IMO.

Playcalling - Texans vs Chiefs - believable play calling.

Animations / Tackling - Improved

Replays - There are less and they didn't show a replay of a kick going out of bounds inside the 20.

Bad:
When a team scores, before kicking off to the opposing team - WHY is their offense and opposing teams defense shown huddling on the field? Why does it last for 30 seconds or so? If KC scores - their offense should be on the sidelines - but nope, they're out on the field yakking for 30 seconds. Immersion breaking. Plus, regardless of who is on the field - seriously, 30 seconds or so - let's get on with it! 
   
Scoreboard celebrating 1st down - on 2nd down.

After a play, the ball is observed with the player's hand stuck through the middle of the ball.

Music - turned off immediately. Rap / hip-hop is as divisive as you can get. The little that I heard was ""better"" than previous Maddens, but so is sticking pencils in my ears.

Graphics - Yes, they look nice - but there is pretty significant stutter when camera is switched from time to time - my hardware isn't quite top of the line - but it should never stutter like this.

Commentary - Does EA pay again for reused voice lines? Also, not every play needs color commentary - it's just too much IMO. Maybe watch a few games with Madden / Summerall to see how it's done properly. Also, quite often the commentary doesn't match the play - commentary talking about how Kelce was wide open / green grass during a 75 yard play when, in fact, he broke 2 tackles almost immediately after catching the ball.

Replays - Nice that there are less - too bad that it doesn't replay the big plays (interceptions for example) but will replay a 6 yard run.

Heavy Rain Game - Bright and sunny. Holdover from Madden 23 - you couldn't even fix this EA?

Starting the game - WAY too many ""Ultimate Team"" and whatever ads - just take me to the damn menu, thanks.

Controls - Same as last few years - controls are entirely favored for controllers, not mouse / keyboard. Had to close the game from desktop as no matter what keys I tried on the keyboard the game wouldn't stop (and I tried everything that made any sense at all).


Understand - I rarely ""play"" Madden - I tend to WATCH Madden. For me, it's about immersion - does it feel like I'm watching an NFL game. Replays should be shown when it's appropriate, commentary should be limited to where it is interesting and adds to the experience, teams don't have their offense on the field after scoring, etc. Oh, and have to have a commercial break every 3 minutes (okay, thankfully that isn't part of the game).
   
I'm sure I'll come up with more. I don't think it's as bad as some of the reviews would have a person believe, and I see potential once the game is patched (assuming it actually addresses the issues). It needs ""polish"" - it really gives me the feeling that it was rushed for the PC version - as in the PC version is an afterthought (not comforting as I'll never have a game console). I'll say that it's recommended but I would completely understand if folks wait until some patches come out as the game could use some serious polish.

Edit: After further review, cannot recommend this in its current state of ""optimization"". Madden 23 ran on ultra settings on my laptop, peaked CPU temps at about 72 degrees. Madden 24, running on medium settings, CPU temps hitting 89 - it's not using the GPU as it should. This game is currently not optimized for PC and seriously needs a patch ASAP.",1692436096,1692463092,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since I have gotten a PC I have never gotten the Madden games because of reputation, poor optimization, etc. But I was excited for this year since PC  is getting the next gen port, which it should anyway. My PC, and many others, rig is entirely capable and would smash a PS5 or Xbox any day of the week. Let me get off of my soap box and tell you about why you are here. Look first and foremost is it the greatest football game  ever... NO of course not. But when it works, which is the big issue right now, I thoroughly enjoy this game.  The secure boot issue was the first problem I ran into. Honestly for me at least wasn't a big deal even if you don't know what you are doing which I didn't. Thankfully the internet exists and YouTube is a thing. Secondly and this is a problem that I haven't been able to fix just yet.  The game runs fine for me for the most part. You see like I said I have been a Madden fan for a long time and since Ultimate Team in Madden 10 I have loved UT for the most part. Ultimate Team has seen it's better days in the past, but it is still an enjoyable experience nonetheless.  I have been playing Ultimate Team solo, I never was interested in online play, and with the challenges and solo battles like I said they run well for the most part, but there is some issues. For some reason no matter how beefy your rig is there is some lag/slowdown in game. For me this mostly occurs while on the offensive side of the ball, but I have seen it on defense. Mostly I see the lag right after a score when I am trying to go for the extra point. Which you can see can become a massive pain in the ass due to precise kicking timer not syncing up due to slowdown. Leading to a losing score on my end not due to my own accord. But like I said this is my first Madden and I am enjoying this game very well when it does work especially with the new passing mechanics. And I don't know how long this has been in the game or it is just the new ""field sense"" mechanic but it does feel a bit more on the Simulation side of things now, which I enjoy a lot. I know this is crazy but at some point I believe that EA will patch the bugs up and this game will run a lot better.

I'll start with the pros:
1. Gameplay compared to last years steam version is a million times better with the implication of the skill based passing alone. Running the ball feels sooo much better with quicker cuts you can hit holes so much more efficiently
2. Graphically with the updated player models it looks so much realistic and simply just more visually appealing.
3. The ui layout is super simple and easy to find things especially in Ultimate Team.

Now the cons:
1. Menus are super laggy and unresponsive when swiching menus in UT.
2. Rewards for UT not showing up, mainly in house rules
3. Online games sometimes feel really slow and laggy

So the reason I am giving this a positive review is that they have a lot of things right and if they can keep building off that and adding new content this year could be my favorite Madden in years. However if they can't fix simple issues quickly and effectively so that we aren't affected by the same issues 5 or 6 times like last year I have no issue not buying the game next year. With that being said I am hopeful that EA finally turns it around this year and Madden games will finally be fun again.

Pros:
Next Gen
Fun gameplay
Upgraded Superstar Mode
Upgraded Franchise Mode (Still behind 2K)
MUT is much quicker.

Cons
You can't fix cheese without changing the engine.
The menus are horribly slow, I counted 35 seconds to get to the options menu. 
It's not well optimized. (But this is basically prerelease.) 
I hate the EA app.

Why? because Sony and MS will keep the cash incentives going strong for EA to keep future games on console for the online subscription paywall payouts.

My review as a long time franchise player (over 20 years).
Pros:
-Best animations and attention to detail on the field yet. 
This was long overdue and is here now.
-Overall graphic qualities are solid.
-Commentary although eventually repetitive actually has smoother dynamic lines this year.

Cons:
-Clunky menu actions. It shouldn't be so un-optimized on my high-end pc. The reason is simple lots of network comms going on in the background causing the UI to be sluggish. Really annoying.
-Not impressed with the interface at all, seems very little effort was made to make it stand out as new or fresh.
-on field sound fx are weak in terms of variety etc. I do hear some decent player voice chatter but the default settings are set too low.
Overall I give it a 7.5. A decent showing for pc.

Well I'm going to enjoy it while I can because chances are EA will put this game back into console jail next year. They have done it before and will probably do it again.

I really dont agree with EA’s antics and how they don’t care about their consumers. However, coming from 23, this game is, in my opinion an upgrade. I’m playing before release (August 17th) and it’s been a lot of fun! The only downside, is that the game has stuttering issues and needs to be optimized on PC, as well as having some graphical glitches. I really wish they’d get rid of their anti cheat, or fix it in some way, to lessen the load. 

The game looks good, it plays okay, but overall it’s just another madden. I put 178 hours into 23, and I know I’ll put a couple hundred into this as well because I’m a big football fan and it does it’s job. So, spending $70 was worth it to me. 

Would I recommend buying it? Maybe. If you don’t like jank, if you hate EA with a passion, no. If you enjoy madden even though it sucks, and jank doesn’t bother you too much, id say go for it.

Yet there is always two negatives for every positive. The presentation has yet to change in about 10 years. There is no love and care for the details on the field. No real time weather, no field changes in rain or snow. Its the same stupid footprints that were introduced years ago. Commentary remains unchanged, same repeated sentences over and over.

Backstory: I was super excited for the dedicated Superstar mode improvements.  It always seemed like that was the first mode to suffer(or be removed entirely), yet it was why I bought these games.  I loved making a player and following their journey.  Good times.  I skipped M23, so I'm sorry if anything was already implemented/redundant.

Review TLDR:  Overall the game IS fun.  But there are several things that make that fun short lived.  If you love the Madden franchise, wait for the sale.

PROS: 
-The skills and progression system seem fun and exciting, and reward different play-styles at the same position.  Leaves it open to more replayability and customizing. 
-A lot of customization options for gear.

CONS:
-With all the control they added, the game just feels less responsive and more sluggish.  Juking with a character that has less than 85 stat, looks like they attempting a line dance on the field... My 75 year old uncle could perform a more convincing juke.
-The camera is a nightmare situation.  When the ball goes to anyone but you, the camera leaves you behind making it so you can't see what you're doing or where you're going.  I've had several block in the backs called on my guy because I'm either running my route still for that split second, and then run into the back of the guy that's covering me, BOOM flag.  Extremely Frustrating.
-the game stuttering is the killer for me.  When running drills the game stutters when your get right to a defender, making it really hard to juke, spin or truck properly.
-The progression tree and skills are cool, but there's little explanation on what the benefit is for each skill and the impact they will make, the stats are a little better.  Some are straight forward, but some are worded a little more confusingly.

If I think of anything else or they massively overhaul things (lol)... I'll update this.

The positives are that rosters have been updated, and they changed the physics a bit in game.
