but also you get to play as these really cute animal FurSona characters and can wear clothing such as: maid outfit. its so cool to be able to customize your FurSona animal character and me personally?

Well i choose to play as a ""super fox"" FurSona in the pink variant with some good cosmetics that i unlocked years ago. Because the game has been around for many years and all my cosmetics which i got when i bought this game?
well they are still there. because i paid for the game so i can keep it forever (a very long time).

Well now some info on the FurSona character, because you may not be familiar with this. What is a furry? A furry is an individual who was unfortunately raised by animals and so they believe they are one. Just like a normal animal they might sleep in a crate, use a litter box, and require regular flea treatments. If a furry is to get lost, it is important to always check for a microchip before sending them to the pound.

and its a fun game for everyone. so thank you for making it and also for reading my thoughts on this game, the ""Super Animal Battle Royale"" type of looter shooter with multiplayer features. And did i mention there are dances like the floss from fortnite and the disco fever from fortnite?

BUT one small downside is that there are vbucks in this game. And they cost as much as the Fortnite vbucks, and there isnt a save the world so you dont get any for free :/// how am i supposed to get my battle pass?

I am however not the best at it, and quite a few people get very sweaty playing it (including me). I did play this game quite a bit in early access (I even bought the founder edition back then), and while the current state of the game is certainly better, not a ton has been changed/added.

It has battle passes, but you can purchase and play older ones. It has a kinda aggressive grind, but the daily and weekly quests help quite a bit. It has cosmetics/dlc that are limited time and never show up again, but it also gives you free cosmetics every time you level up and has a ton of coupon codes that give you free ones as well. There are also in game milestones you can hit, and even without super edition (which adds a ton of milestone rewards) there is still a pretty reasonable amount of things you can try. 

At the end of it, the game is free for a lot of stuff, and if you buy the dlcs when they come up you should be able to get enough of the premium currency to play the battle passes when you want with some additional throw ins.

One good thing, though, is the invite system uses steam's friend list feature, though it doesn't filter to those who share the game with you, a downside of that system.

Firstly, Super Animal Royale managed to make the genre of superfluous fps monotony (battle royale) actually fun. The top-down ""Hotline Miami-like"" composition combined with a variety of balanced shooting mechanics and features make the battles quick and engaging; the matches usually take no longer than around 8 minutes. There's incentive for the player to stay active for hours, mostly the milestones, experience, and the wide variety of animal unlocks and customization.

Here's a quick rundown of some pros and cons but I would deffo give the game like a 9/10


> Pros:
+ 2D game so it is not really confusing to move and also shoot like in 3D games, it is a lot easier to get into but also does have room for skill differential etc.

+ Quick matches, roughly 7 minutes from match start to match end maximum, so if you feel like typical Battle Royales go on for too long with the amount of weapon RNG there is, Super Animal Royale (SAR) helps to mitigate that by being a more arcade-y game with the quick matches.

+ Animal Pass (AKA Battle Pass, Season Pass, etc.) is amazing value! in-season it costs 550 tickets to buy and you get 350 back, you get lots of items and it NEVER EXPIRES! In other games if you buy a pass such as this, it will expire come the end of the season no matter if you completed it or not. In SAR, once you have bought the animal pass you have it forever. You can also buy previous past-season passes for 750 tickets (basically a 200 ticket late fee) so if you see an item you really like from a previous season, you aren't locked out from getting it.

+ Super Edition DLC very good value but also even without any DLC the game gives you a large choice of cosmetics and animal characters to choose from.

+ Devs are active and open to feedback, they will read feedback and such and try to add in what many people want (the dev team is small so only a few things can be added at a time however).

+ Bonus modes: SAW vs Rebels, Mystery, Bwoking Dead. They come round every so often and spice up the gameplay if you're getting bored of the standard Battle Royale modes.


> Cons:
- SAW Shop overpriced on a lot of items. Glasses, bundles and emotes are the 3 categories of items that are worth it the others tend to be too expensive unless they're uncommon rarity.

- SAW Tickets aren't purchasable in quantities lower than 1,000. The Starter Packs give you 600 but they're a 1 timer per season. I think the game needs to add 100 and 500 ticket bundle options.

- Game does not have UK English option only US English, I mean I can still understand the game lol but it's annoying.

- Rotating store kinda annoying, it's also kinda sus on the paid items (SAW Shop) cos you are putting a timer on paid items (even if they come back the timer is still there).

- If you're a big fan of a particular animal but it doesn't come until later in the unlock order, you have to play for a long time until you can use it, which may feel like a grind depending on how much you value playing as a favourite animal right from the start if it has a higher unlock level requirement. (For this I would suggest not burning yourself out to get your favourite animal, no matter what level it is at)


> Pro/Con: Starter Packs are good value, however they go away forever at the end of the season which is not very good.


But as you can see from what I have as Pros and Cons, the Pros tend to be gameplay related and the Cons tend to be cosmetic (and minor regional language) related. The gameplay is what is most important to a game and additional cosmetics can be ignored if desired and so these cons, although I do strongly feel that they need addressing, don't detract very much from the experience as a whole.",1561772626,1700616961,True,4,0,0.565442323684692383,0,True,False,False

The games are quick (about 5-7 minute long matches) and loot is readily available the moment you land. Deaths aren't as frustrating thanks to the short match length and the top-down gunplay feels really nice and fairly balanced.

The game's also free to play, to top it off. No additional payment necessary, besides the typical premium cosmetics from the shop or the battlepass. 

And speaking of the battlepass, I appreciate the devs for not leaning too hard on the FOMO (with the exception of starter pack dlcs); you can buy and unlock previous seasons anytime via the archive for a couple tickets more than the current season. Though, i'm not too keen on being able to skip levels with tickets since you're never locked out of resuming a purchased pass once it goes off-season.

Best thing about this game is that you can download the free version and play it just as long as you want, you just can't access any of the accessories until you decide to purchase it. Then you can unlock everything you earned in the free version which doesn't really do anything for the game.

However.. The community sucks and there are a lot of minor things making this game hard to play. The few things that are the games fault itself:

-art contest(s) are rigged and pretty much a top 7 not a top 21 (the same people win over and over, and I have a hard time believing with 500+ entries that that was a mistake). I feel like it's just a way to not pay the artists they want to win, but who knows. I think they should avoid having the same people win cuz it gives people (ESPCIALLY KIDS) false hope of winning the contest, and trying their best just for flavorrr and Pome to win for the 6th time in a row.

-Im not sure about damage or gun balance but, from my personal experience, it's pretty badly balanced if surviving on a pixel of HP is common in your game, you can survive by a pixel in other games, however it's shocking and fun/funny when you do. In SAR it just feels like you got scammed or scammed someone else.

-The hamster balls are laggy af, and half the time I die to them, on my screen they were no where near me (this is also on my closest server).

-They have pride stuff in game, but if you say ""im gay"" or anything similar. You get a warning and possibly muted for 24hours. That.. is disgusting. When I complained about it they told me ""i was engaging in adult conversation"" which just sounds like the homophobic argument of ""don't tell the kids the ""gay"" word. Just overall disappointing and gross. 

-There are NO IN GAME PENALTIES for dipping on your teammates, or DCing right as a match starts. This is even in other non-competitive games like DBD and such. I have literally seen people DC over and over for HOURS in squads. Just to make it where you are a person down.

-Last big one. When your teammate DCs mid match they aren't replaced by a bot, or anything. They just sit there. Idle. Until they die. Meaning that you, if you are dead, just have to sit and wait. You can't DC because if you do you get none of your ""rewards"" for the match (drops, DNA, XP, ect). That is.. the dumbest thing ever lol.

I love and am passionate about this game, but GOD does it need a clean up.

This isn't even mentioning the lack of balancing, the sweat try hards that ruin playing this game for fun, and.. many other things. 

What I do like about this game:

-The gun play is AMAZING. It is SUPER addictive and fun, the guns feel nice to shoot, and that's a key thing in.. yaknow.. a SHOOTING game.

-The devs seem VERY invested in their community and the game they have created. Every update as of late really shows the talent of the team and how hard they work on this game, I cannot say enough this game is amazingly made.

-the gamemode saw vs rebellion was legit the best addition to SAR for me, its my favorite game mode. It's so fun.

-The overall style/aesthetic, SAR is so unique and interesting. I love the world, the art style, really almost everything. Its fun, silly and well put together

Would I recommend this game?

Yes and no. I really think they things that need to be fixed NEED fixing, and to not be rewarded. However, I don't see that happening. So if the things listed aren't a make or break for ya, go for it. The game is fun, and I am sure most people would like SAR.",1695478618,1695478618,False,100,8,0.671381652355194092,0,True,False,False

I want to give this a thumbs up, but it's really hard to outright recommend this as anything other than a casual fling type game, as the gameplay loop can get a bit lack luster after a few rounds.

Sync is also still kind of an issue, with players sometimes teleporting post-roll, so it's hit and miss when it comes to quality of rounds, especially with how silly strong shotguns and the emu are still (even years down the road).",1593843638,1687295359,False,3,0,0.431430727243423462,2,True,False,True

However, this game is REALLY fun and the fact that there's a Super Free Edition so that you can play the game and see if you like it was a huge plus.

Now here are some things I LOVE about the game.

- The Community: There's a lot of nice people, so wether you do some small take or make friendships it's always gonna be a nice experience. They even have a Discord!
Trust me, I've made a lot of great friends because of this game, the only bad people you'll find are the toxic people with no life who are unnecesarily salty for no reason or the people who just appear one or two games to say how much they hate furries.

- The gameplay: It's simple and fun, the matches are not so long so it's not frustrating for me to lose when I'm going on a 1v1 with someone and lose.

- The Artstyle: It's so cute and adorable! And the fact that there's a lot of animals, clothes and emotes that you can get the more you play is awesome! 
Adittionally, other than the game itself, all kinds of cosmetics, emotes and animals are free! I always appreciate a game that rewards me with cosmetics the more I play and that doesn't keep some behind a paywall.


This game's development cycle is quiet active as well! You'll often find updates like new animals, new cosmetics, events, etc. For such a simple game, it's worth buying it and support the developers. Maybe even buying the Founder's Edition if you're ever feeling generous!


I am a furry, but playable character looks aside, this game is really fun, it's cute and it has a nice community. I totally recommend it for anyone who feels the slightest bit of curiosity or interest towards this game. Wether you like Battle Royales or not, this game does things in its own unique way. So please try the Super Free Edition of the game to see if you like it!

SaR is quite an unique take on the BR genre. It does have over a hundred customizations that players could pick and choose. Not to mention the game itself is easy to pickup and hard to master, which is cool in concept.

But, obviously, we also have a lot of cons.
- While the community is mostly friendly, I've been seeing people getting silenced for voicing their opinion regarding the game. Not to mention a bunch of clip events and art contest tend to obviously favor the exact same popufur or well-known players.
- Poor latency and tick system still causes lag.
- Questionable monetization and shop system is still there (No changes for months, now).
- Obvious skill ceiling issue that ruins the enjoyment of custom modes in general.
- Poor balancing on SvR custom mode, the addition of giant mole nullifies team's skill and effort even further.


Update on Apr-23
- ""Fixed"" netcode now screws over anyone with about 20 more ping than you. 
(Great work, that does not fix the issue; because apparently their weapons are hitscan while yours are not, thus a trade kill did not happen.)

- Damage halving mechanic on slight packet loss was awful. 
(Now your shot might randomly not kill someone, even on pointblank. Very nice, that certainly won't lead to frustration and confusion.)",1637820734,1680476976,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The customization is nice, but that's about it.
The loot distribution seemed pretty bad in the few matches I played.
The weapon variety is nothing special, and most of them don't match with the animal character theme (aside from skunk grenades).
The map seemed to have way too much cover, promoting camping.
The environment wasn't all that destructible aside from some crates. 
Gun fighting was sloppy and dull.
At the end of the day, I'll stick with Zombsroyale.


===== UPDATED REVIEW (2023) =====
This game is irritating due to the wacky damage calculations and chaotic ending that happens in just about every match. Some weapons in the game seem useless and other times direct hits don't even deal much damage?

Sometimes I feel you'd have the same level of success if you just closed your eyes and hit buttons randomly.

Since there is no instant health recovery upon winning a fight (""syphon"" mechanic as another royale game calls it) you're better off camping (being bored) because 3rd parties happen in an instant. Winning becomes a matter of being ""in the right place at the right time"".

===== FINAL REVIEW (MARCH 2023) =====

Game might as well be called ""Find the Tommy Gun"" not Super Animal Royale.
It kills in a fraction of a second and someone dusted 3 opponents in a row for the win in one match. Broken, bad game. I mentioned that the devs shouldn't make another game, but the post got taken down because it was ""disrespectful"" you know what's disrespectful? Censoring the people who find obvious flaws in your lame game. I'm done with this game and refuse to buy anything that these devs might spit out in the future.",1563661236,1679186396,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love it. It is silly and what I enjoy the most about it is that matches are quick and the game functions really smoothly. 
It's really a simple game. Formula is typical for a Battle Royale: Pregame lobby has people to smack with marshmallow sticks, everyone loads into an eagle, then drops to the destination of choice, loots up, dies or comes out on top. 
It is a blast and I hope that as many people as possible join in on the fun as I can't wait for squads. That is going to be insane. 
Thank you to the devs and everyone involved in making this game. 

Also animals with moustaches... 

Buy it for that if nothing else....

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Definitely at least try the Super Free edition first. If you find you like it, I'd recommend buying a full version. You can join parties (for duos and/or squads) through Discord or Steam, but the Steam option is only available if you have a full edition of the game.

Support these devs! They've put a lot of hard work into this game!

EDIT: The game remains free, but there are microtransactions now in the form of in-game currency, for certain cosmetic items, as well as battle passes. HOWEVER, battle passes can be purchased and progressed through at ANY time, and the overwhelming majority of items in the game are still free and randomly acquired through drops.

The game is actually a top down 2D shooter and uses fog of war mechanics so you can't see enemy players beyond your actual line of sight, and it's in a very cute and fun art style with animal characters. You have your standard BR modes of Solos, Duos, and Squads but after a recent update they've also constantly got special modes in rotation as well such as: 

SAW vs Rebellion (32v32 domination type mode where you gotta take over the flags in the play area, and respawns are enabled)

The Bwoking Dead (zombie gamemode which plays almost exactly like your usual Infected match, some players start as zombies and the zombies have to infect all survivors, while survivors must survive to the end and reach extraction)

Mystery Mode (standard battle royale, but a random modifier is applied. Such as slow bullets, pistols only, etc)


The game does also have lore which is neat too if you're interested in that, it's not the most in depth and deep story so don't expect anything on the levels of something like Destiny but it's there nontheless. The basic story to set the game up is pretty much this:

The ""Super Animals"" are genetically created in a lab by some human scientists and then they're used to open a theme park called Super Animal World (the game's setting during gameplay), but the Super animals eventually become more self aware and begin feeling more like people of their own and form a rebellion against SAW (while some other super animals still remain loyal and employed to SAW), and then after the Rebellion somehow find guns they initiate an attack on the park which is now known as ""The incident"" leading to the park's shut down

Now with the park shut down the super animals basically took over the whole island and live on it and do whatever they please, but the company behind SAW still finds a way to salvage their business by instead now broadcasting these battle royale events to TV for people's entertainment

There's more lore than that if you wanna dig deeper and explore the ingame map and watch the game's animated series on YouTube but that's the basic lore that leads into the whole game itself taking place

The developers themselves also actively engage with the community and are genuinely nice people, they frequently host art contests where artists can get their art featured in the ingame art museum and sometimes you get to to find devs and moderators ingame and play with them and stuff like that.

EDIT: [Some updates]
1. DO NOT try play at evening in ASIA server, you won't get victory in the match. Many pro players might try to kill you there. You will lost your fun after you try again.
Trust no one.
2. Let's just say the devs team. They're still weak community than overpopulated games where most active community and opened mind to everyone, giving awards for users to contribute, and free topics to apply it (no transparency).
3. Friends there are lies, you won't play with them again for next days.
4. I just having fun with against bots only in solo, making my confidence has been woke up. The Bot players are good enough. I mean single-player mode for training mission. I want it.
5. Some friends have been unfriended me or blocked me after gotten friends in 1-2 weeks.
6. The servers had been DDOS twice and insecure game, so the players cannot play game for hours and risk to get data stolen.
7. When you play, be careful with opponent named players prefix: UD or [zᶻ²] Sleepy. They are expert and cannot bring you to victory.
8. What is your purpose to disable another game mode?
9. Server still buggin and Where is reroll challenge? (Same as other Games)
10. Is there cheating player in the game? Very lol [especially cross-play matchmaking between PC and consoles, that makes unbalanced play control]
11. Alright Night mode is better now for balanced some light environment.
12. Ok i got it all legacy dances now. [updated]
13. Make sure custom lobby are available now. ASAP
14. The game was fun, but sometimes not fun, if there is cheating making some players won in a row (keep win in chain, the pro player doesn't give a chance to a newbie player to win).
15. I'm trying to keep positive for this review, but mostly still unchanged expectation for this game.
16. Small community and not opened transparency topics, even it is small studios.
17. If you are looking for Girlfriend, i DO NOT recommended it in this game, you will have only temporary with her for playing the game together. [Update]",1590556588,1670283610,False,11,5,0.572121143341064453,1,True,False,False

Personally, I'd rate the game a solid 9/10, no game is perfect but this game is coming pretty close already while still being in early access.

fun take on br genre. 

okay cosmetics

small playerbase leaves most matches with 50% or more bots. (bots are very primitive, but appreciated that they are there) 

quite a few gameplay choices that make a low skill ceiling. this also makes it hard to say its better than some .IO battle royales. this game is just aesthetically better than them. 

many quality of life things are missing pre-release. (no kicking players from parties, no party privacy on steam parties, no “previous teammates” tab, etc.) 

also worst progression system on the market. slow, not rewarding.

EDIT Nov 2nd 2019: New shooting model has lowered the skill ceiling even more substantially. I can no longer recommend this game.

EDIT June 19th 2021: Playerbase is no longer dead due to game going free and is now released on xbox with crossplay. Matches are full and fun, and the game feels good to play, even if the skill cap is extremely low.",1570490716,1660045430,False,0,0,0.555873751640319824,0,True,False,False

The battle pass for this game is not too grindy, but they don't give you a lot of missions to work with to earn exp, but the game allows you to keep earning progress up to 2 battle pass since they don't expire which means you don't have to miss out on items, this is a really big plus, and i wish other games would also do this!

pros:
- different weapons, throwables, power ups to find on map
-lots of animal breeds with extra cool skins to collect
-item drops to earn cool cosmetics/emotes
-different game modes
-cute art style

Cons:
- some weapons tend to be better than others in almost every way making the game having a stale meta
-not a lot of variety which makes the game feel repetitive.
-some micro transactions, like needing to get the super edition dlc to earn milestone prizes, pets being overpriced for doing almost nothing but walk and sit they don't even get on vehicles with you,
-weekly events can be unbalanced and unfun sometimes like the bwoking dead.

Overall, its fine for what it is a top down battle royale shooter, that thing that holds it back is the variety of items you can mix and match weapon loadouts, which makes the game go stale really quick. hopefully later it will add more weapons, items or cool game mechanics and not just cosmetics. 5/10",1658282234,1659572680,False,5,1,0.452478200197219849,0,True,False,False

I was introduced to this game a few days ago by a friend. Watched video. Then figured it's free to try. So why not try it? It's for free after all! I'm basically going to say a lot of things that people have said in the review section already! It's addictive, quick to play, appealing cute art style, and inventory management doesn't feel as much of a chore. match lengths are also much quicker! This BR has a lot of charm to it.

After sinking many hours on PUBG, trying Fortnite, Realm Royale, and yes, even Apex Legends. I figured I was at that point my passion for BR was dwindling away. It's not because I was bored with the game genre. There were a lot factors.  Some were related to changes in my personal life, what my computer can handle, and what ultimately fits my style, just to name a few. However, this game hits most, if not all, my gamer bells just right!! I'm getting that feeling of being addicted to a BR title all over again!

Mind you, because of the nature of how short the matches are compared to your typical BR, psychologically, because of the length of the match, it doesn't feel quite as rewarding when you win a match. However, it comes at a very welcoming trade-off of MASSIVELY not feeling as punishing when you lose either. WHICH I'LL GLADLY TAKE THAT TRADEOFF. 

And man. Besides it being 2D and they somehow make it work really well with BR mechanics. This is what also sets this game apart from others. I really like the cute characters and there is dozens of animals to choose from and plenty of customizable options. It just feels rewarding playing matches so you get stuff to unlock animals in research lab.

With all that said, Super Animal Royale was a near instant seller for me, espiecally when it went on sale a couple days after I tried it. It was worth every dollar.

I could talk way more about this game, but I'll leave it at that. 

I'm only shocked I didn't find out about this game or tried out this sooner! Such an excellently polished game!

(for me it is far better than most Battle Royale's that I've played these last few years and that is counting Cuisine Royale which doesn't go by that name anymore)

Pro's:

Weapons are by far the staple of this game and each weapon added changes the game in ways that make it better. First weapon I recall being added was the Deagle which when it was released was basically a direct upgrade to the Revolver having 1 more round and doing more damage (though back then the purple revolver was still a thing) that would be the earliest weapon added that I can remember from back then. Now we have bows, Crossbows, Gas Grenades, Jag-7's, Hunting rifles, and even a Egg launcher which changed the game so so much and I love it.

Outfits use to be the biggest pain in the ass to get and when they updated the game to have at least a store that does a round out and also has two functioning currencies which doesn't feel like you have to pay to get. I think it was the best change for the game to have this be added and it definitely serves its purpose well.

Accessory Features like booties and belt are quite a game changer that makes every time you jump in different rather than the original ""Grab that gun and shoot"", you have to be very particularly patient with almost every encounter you go in, if not you will ultimately suffer and die easily.

Con's:

Map for me has been almost changed to the detriment of it with new locations feeling unneeded to absolute nightmare and with the game mode Rebel vs SAW it is no joke a problem. The biggest criminal to this is Superite Mines which by far favors the Rebels by way too much giving them access to the middle without really needing to worry bout any enemy fire and having wider openings to allow more dodging and movement while SAW are stuck to narrow Corridors which makes for hell without a medic being behind you at all times which doesn't solve the problem but just delays it. 

Some of the players in this game are narrow minded when it comes to Rebel vs SAW to the point of making the Banana grenades actually really useless as a tool to trap the enemy into fighting in your lane and taking them out, usually a teammate will just meander right into it and not only waste a banana for you but also just get themselves killed (This is actually been a problem for me for a while when playing Rebel vs SAW currently) other than that the bots that play as teammates are kind of dumb and fall for the same stuff that I just talked about before. I think an easy fix could be to either A. Make it only register a slip for enemy team players or B. make a new grenade that heals any teammates within its perimeter. Don't give me that ""We can't do that"" line, we know you have that capability to make it happen and you can make it RVS only. 

over all from when I did play SAR has been evolving and impressing me for a while I just hope some changes and fixes to some RVS maps are included.

Last Review I made of this Game was Short and stupid.
This Review... Is also Stupid, but less short.

I have put Numerous Hours into this game and for a good reason, because its fun and it has a good community.
One of the Quotes that I agree on most regarding this game is ""A Battle Royale for people who dont like Battle Royales"" Which is true in a literal and mental sense.
The Community is Incredible, WAAAAAAAAY Less toxic than any other Battle Royale I have ever played.
The Matches are around 6-7 Minutes long which allows you to get Much more value for your time compared to the 83 Years Other battle royale matches have.
Another thing is that this game has a sort of Tf2 Esc Community in a sense that not everyone in a match is going to be going Uber Tryhard Mach 9 to try to kill Little Timmy playing the game for the first time just to Min Max his XP Gain. There are People who just meme around
An Example is that I could be in a match and the match comes to around 3 people left me included, Im preparing for a huge fight when I see Two Pacifists sitting on an emu hop off the emu and come over and Point at me intensly. OBVIOUSLY, due to their Raw Power I had to grenade myself because like come on, what am I supposed to do there.
Another thing is that Their Pass system allows you to get previous pass items because a very large part of the community desires as many cosmetics as possible because its a battle royale where you can give a Walrus a Detective cap and a Raincoat, and you can give a Possum Warpaint, a Maid outfit, and a Stack of pancakes on their head.
The game does not force you in the slightest to buy anything, and coming from me, the person who has 4$ on them at literally anygiven time, Whenever I got money id still put it into the cosmetics because I have that Much Respect for the game, the devs, and the community. 
The Reason I have put so much time into this game is due to the fact that It is the only battle royale I love because its not turbo serious yet you can still be serious. I have played this game all throughout my college years and will continue to do so.

This has been my review and for some comedy, I did a Power Point presentation on this game in my Business class. Im not joking, I got an 87%

8/10 Helped me get a good grade. 
Go try the game for like 10 Hours Total time, If you like it, Welcome to the community, If you dont, thank you for atleast giving it a try.

If you're looking for a more goofy version of fortnite, then this is the right game for you. However, buying the full game doesn't really expand much more than just extra cosmetics. That being said, buying the full game really isn't a requirement to enjoy it fully, and I wouldn't exactly say it's entirely worth the $15 cost. This applies for most of the DLC as well, so unless you're crazy about flexing how much money you have to your pals, it's not that big of a deal.
Putting that info aside, the game is generally very easy to pick up, casual, and has some fun game modes that were added post early access. The matches aren't long enough to keep you bored, and the community's generally a lot more sweet and easygoing compared to that of other battle royale games; a lot less tryhard-ish than fortnite as well, so it's a great game to play if you're just bored with some buddies.",1652243225,1652243225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The 2d nature of the game gives it a very fun twist compared to other games in the genre, and there are semi-frequent updates to the balancing of the game to ensure that not one fully-upgraded weapon type is strictly better than another. Each weapon compliments a different play style, which keeps gameplay fresh. If you tire of your usual strategy, why not try another weapon? Don't like grenades for zoning out opponents? Use bananas to block off escape routes!

Outside of the main BR mode, there are rotating game modes to enjoy. 32v32, SAR vs Rebellion (Capture the Flag), and a Halloween survival mode have begun rotating. Wait times seem to always be improving, where the very recent introduction of the rotating modes have not considerably increased wait times for a match in my experience.

There are many free cosmetics that can be unlocked by leveling up, collecting certain collectibles, entering codes from social media, and the like. All animal species are (to my knowledge) completely obtainable without spending money. Certain breeds do require the purchase of a limited-time Season Pass or the Super Edition of the game, but these are a very infrequent exception rather than the rule. The amount of cosmetic options I've personally accrued is quite expansive, which is [u] very [/u] refreshing to see from a F2P Battle Royale game.

Finally, the game and its community has a lot of charm as of writing this review. It is clear that the developers of SAR care about not just the game, but its community as well. The in-game dialogue is very charming and nice, and the setting of a theme park all about animals leads to a lot of funny jokes that can be found in the game's ever-updating environment.

This is [b] easily the best fast-paced shooter [/b] I've played, and I typically highly dislike the Battle Royale genre. I highly suggest anyone who is interested in Battle Royale games or drawn to the very unique mechanics or style of SAR to try it. It's a super fun game available at an unbeatable price, and is ever updating around the community's wishes.

1) The other player or you is going to frantically run away.
2) The other player or you is going to curb stomp the other person.

There really isn't any in between.  The fighting is not satisfying.  The hamster balls have the jankiest physics and you will either hit someone a mile off or roll someone directly over and do nothing.  The emu update was, quite frankly, pointless.  The game is fun at first, but I can see why a chunk of their super content creators stopped playing.

Maybe that's a game for you.  But it gets dull after having one unsatisfying game after another.




EDIT (April 4th, 2020):

I took a break from the game and tried it again after a while. My original thoughts on the game remain the same, but I want to make it clear:

This is not a bad game.  I would not have put so much time into this game if it were not a good game.  It really is a good game, and it's very disheartening that these feelings have come up for me.  With a clearer head, I've been able to really narrow down the issues that I have with the game.

1) Vehicles.  Yeah, the emus got nerfed since the original publishing of this review.  Still feels ridiculous to go against them and to have them since you're essentially adding so many hit points to a player for free.  But I think both Emus and Hamster Balls do not have a place in Super Animal Royale.  You can outrun the skunk gas on foot easily enough.  Ball hitboxes are still janky as hell, which I know is because of clientside ping.  Still bullshit.

2) Time to Kill.  This is what makes me the most unsatisfied in the game, I believe.  The time to kill (ttk) feels very, very short.  Too short, in a lot of cases.  Players can melt each other in a flash and there is no saving grace or anything about what just happened.  I get that the game is about positioning and mobility.  But sometimes I would like to have a longer gunfight with other players.  Doesn't have to last over a minute, but when one or the other gets KO'd in less than a second?  Doesn't feel fun to me at all, even if I'm the one doing the curb stomping.


Play the game.  Enjoy the game.  I highly, highly recommend playing the free version to try the game out and see if you like it.  If you do enjoy it, buy the game.  Heck, get the Founder's Edition - I think Pixile did a good job with this game.  These are just the gripes of a sky pirate at this point, anyways.

EDIT (February 15th, 2021)

I can't play the game alone anymore. But I don't want people to shy away from the game. Give it a try, see if you like it. Maybe the game's gotten stale for me after the 600+ hours I've put into it. But I still catch myself getting on the game with friends.

This game is virtually unplayable if you live in Oceania, as the devs refuse to add OCE servers, as well as the game having little to no lag compensation, making the game a laggy, unplayable mess for basically all of Australia and New Zealand.

I have scoured threads and forums to find a reason, and the only reason I've found is ""there are currently not enough players in the OCE region to warrant adding OCE servers.""

Gee. I wonder why there aren't many OCE players? Could it have something to do with the game being completely unplayable in OCE?

The game used to be playable in OCE before they made hitreg serverside/removed lag compensation or whatever. I can't recall exactly what they did under the hood, but that's why I have 150 hours despite claiming the game is unplayable. It was playable, but it no longer is.

It's been a year since I bought the paid edition, and I loved the serenity of this game.
what are the advantages I can highlight?
1. Nice and cute atmosphere in the game
2. A pretty thoughtful world
3. Pleasant management
4. Nice graphics
5. Excellent gaming community
6 fast and fun matches
7.Private fun and free updates
8. Beautifully drawn animals

I can't see the cons, because this is a fairly balanced game to my account, maybe there are small shoals, but I don't notice them
I have never regretted that I bought the full edition

Now it is free and as for me it is already completely different emotions, since there are more players and battles are more difficult and dangerous

1.) To date a game that is my favorite game, even if I'm going to play less and less
2.) More and more costumes, achievements, animals,
3.) Daily / weekly missions for better EXP development (this is not a novelty but useful)
4.) Multiple modes: Solo / Duo / Squad / 32vs32 / BWOKING DEAD / MYSTERY MODE / CUSTOM MODE
(Of course, average players can only join Solo / Duo or Squad games, Custom Mode only received this permission,
The other modes varies when which server is active). For me, Solo and Mystery Mode I do not like at all.
5.) Crossplay mode, that is, almost every platform can be played on the game, PC (Windows / MAC), Xbox, PS, Switch, Nintendo
(Also it works perfectly on Linux, but only Proton/Wine, so with the exception of Steam Play and Cross Shore Discord does not work, unfortunately).
6.) Inside game there is no sound chat and I hope you will never be, discord voice is perfect altenative,
If someone uses Voice Chat
7.) Animal Pass I think it can be completely correct for 550 tickets 49 levels to fulfill a Pass series,
And the old Animal Pass are also available when someone has not fulfilled everything.
8.) DisCord community for me wonderful place, many rooms, sharing drawings, help request,
developers are also very friendly and helpful,
Of course, not all developers or admin answers DM messages.
9.) The game can play almost free anyone, but there are restrictions needed for Super Edition DLC,
But for me, it's absolutely worth the price and if I remember us, we received the Super Edition DLC for free who was bought in PTR before the game.
10.) Report system if someone is irregular in the game, Team Work, Using Bad Words or Anything. It is very useful, but Discord Support continues to be suggested and easier to show evidence.
11.) And I could still write to see why this game was grabbed and why I loved it very much.

But yet, what has changed really?
1.) 3 years when I join in July 2019 I immediately bought the game,
I really enjoyed Solo games, in 2020 I also loved duo and Squad games,
Of course, if I could connect to my old friends and had a free slot,
But many of my old friends hate me because of my bad ill behavior ...
2.) More and more players, especially Solo, so it's much harder to play,
It is much more difficult to pacifists that more and more players have a lobby like a stick,
and they still remained very toxic players,
For those who I immediately leave the lobby and join another lobby, I'm out of the game, I do not like playing a lobby with a terminator players that are impossible to kill and they even chase me.
3.) If you try to help a pacifist with it
How do you do not kill, then players can report with Team Work title and you may receive a warning or not. It's a legitimate of course this Team Work is counting, only at this time you really have to play careful when someone is a pacifist friend like me.
4.) I played the Solo game only when I was a few players and I could develop more easily (2020 when he was dying of the server), but when we are a lot of people, it's good, of course, it's just much harder to evolve if I'm not a good player,
But apart from this, it is always possible to search for friends and play with anyone.
5. In 2019, the experience was much better than now,
I would like to continue to play and continue the Pass,
But alone I do not care about the game,
There are no Hungarian players with whom I could play Voice Chat,
In every game I really like Voice Chat, but I do not speak English, Hungarian players are almost few ... Very few Hungarian players play ...

I say after 1500+ hours (the real play time and not steam playing time)
The time I came to get tired and I can't continue the game,
Maybe I play up to 1 hour per week sometimes,
But I alone really does not make any sense to start the game,
Because Solo mode is almost suicide for me, it is impossible to enjoy Solo mode.

I think I will leave the game for a short time but not permanently.

And the greatest thank you for the game that I always love,
How were my friends and played together with them.

And a single (pacifist) friend left after 2 years, with whom I had the best friend today, so I'm grateful to the SAR game.
and it was a huge happiness for me when I was Super Artist, this was real happiness to I join,
Unfortunately, due to problems, I can not continue with the drawings,
I've had ideas in vain. 

And now I just made a negative assessment,
Because I had friends who liked to spend my time together,
But because of many drama and depressing problems I lost almost all my friends,
And my favorite game just poisoned me and had bad memories, especially 2020 and 2021 ...

This is the main reason why I do not play SAR.
Of course, if I have a friend I could play together, I play Sar of course, just unfortunately not every day ...

I miss the SAR when I first played in 2019.

It's adorable when you hear quiet ""nyas"", sneakily rolling as you blow the head off of some fool getting in the way of your minigun.

You can play as 48+ different races of creatures; foxes, cats, dogs, hyenas, wolves, birds, seals, raccoons, you name it. To compliment the number of playable races, there's also hundreds of cosmetics to unlock and they all look so cute.

Not only is it a really fun sugar apocalypse, it loads a surprising amount of subtle lore and creates a need to uncover all the game's dark secrets...

BUT

One thing that keeps me from giving a 10/10? It seems the devs think Australia doesn't exist.

I went into every server available and recorded the average ping. It's a little insane.

NA - 246 ping
EU - 371 ping
AS - 284 ping
SA - 394 ping

At first look I thought of it as a normal 2d battle royale game, but after I played it for the first time I coudnt stop playing because of how amazing this game was. Im playing this game for over a year and I must say that it grew a lot and in a good way. Of course there are some thinks that I personally dont like.

I like how the map changed from when I started playing, it looks more alive then it was before. The gamemodes (not solo, duo, squads) are very interessting and fun to play and I like idea of the battle pass and that you can buy previous ones any time you want. I like the graphic style, music, Youtube series of SAR and how amazing community is. But of course there are some thinks that I dont like.

Lets start with SAW shop, some items feel overpriced in my opinion, a lot of people would say that pets are and I agree. Would you buy a pet or battle pass where you can get more stuff for the same price and also you would get some tickets back? I would definitely buy Battle Pass. Some regions dont get as much love as other ""more EU love UwU"". And I think one most frustrating think in this game that exists is ""High Ping Mode"". It most likely forces you to keep playing in one region and not learn more amazing and pro players, it basically takes away fun and will to play in other regions because of how much impossible is to hit someone, even if it looks that you hit but you didnt and how easy everyone can hit you and unfair hitboxes are. High Ping Mode needs to be reworked or compleatly deleted, because it is not fun to play with it.

Overall more ideas and thoughts that I have is for small thinks that could be added in future updates, for example: New gems or a star under a gem for those that already have over lvl999+, more pets ""Hyena UwU"", more steam achievements and In game achievements, Official in game Tournaments or season leaderboards for a chance to win prizes for the placement ""Carl coins, customization stuff, Titles, tickets etc.""

Its a nice and fun game to play, of course it has some issues about couple stuff, but I still recommend to give it a try and play with your friends. Praise Banan",1638370526,1638370526,True,4,0,0.513544440269470215,1,True,False,False

Super Animal Royal (SAR) is your typical Battle Royal game.....  [b] But also not. [/b]

SAR is a top-down 2D game,mixing battle royal and gameplay of some old 2D shooters,allowing you to see the map around you at all times while making all enemies and items hidden until they enter your character's line-of-sight,helping you keep track of your surroundings while keeping a tension when you hear those shots from afar....

But what's so special about it? Let's start from the top:

You have first three options: 
* The Super Free edition,which allows you to play for as long as you like with default gear,allowing you get gear and unlock them in the full version.
* The normal game.
* And the Founder's Bundle,giving you beta-only gear,an orange name in-game,and helps support the devs!

Once in the game,you get introduced to your little fluffy avatar,which leads up to my favorite part:

[b] CUSTOMIZATION! [/b]

There is an AMAZING amount of way to customize your character,and since its baiscally an animal from Animal Crossing with a gun,you get lots of shapes and ways to dress said character.
You got your guns,you got your shirts,hats,emotes,melee weapon,etc.

And in the ""Research Lab"",you create more species to play as using Animal DNA and Super Serum,one of the few rewards you get per game,which the game won't be greedy on.

[b] If you like cute animals,you're about to melt,and if you like bloodshed,well..... This leads us to my next point! [/b]

The thing with this Battle Royal game is.... [b] ITS 90% FREE! [/b]

All you need is to buy any version of the game,and you can get everythign else for free!
No lootbox,no access pass,no nothing.... But one thing:
[b] REWARD YOUR SKILL CURVE! [/b]

You get most items by RNG,but the more you play,and the better you play,the more chances you'll get to win something!
Either survive long enough through games (or get kills if you like EXP) and you'll get ACTUALLY REWARDED FOR PLAYING!

You also have  your Achievement system called ""Milestones"",allowing you get more items after,say,use a specific item enough times or do a special action somewhere on the map (Good luck if you want to find those on your own!).
And you also have you daily chalenges if you want extra DNA,Serum or Super Magnet (used to boost the number of DNA you get for specific specie in the lab).

And the devs reward players that help making the  community grow too!
If you make video content on Youtube or Twitch,or make Art,you get rewarded for it too!
YOU TOO can be in those clips shown on top! And all you need is a short clip of you playing the game and that the devs agree to show during their next in-univers TV Show!

To resume. [list] 
SAR is: 
[*] A cool and orignal  2D Battle Royal.
[*] Cute,silly,,violent and even spooky at times (Which is everything i like,also making people trip on bananas is always a fun game mechanic)
[*] You buy the game,and then all you need to do to get stuff is skills,and even if you don't,the game always tries to reward you for trying.
[*] As long as you're fine with this game being the obvious furry-magnet it is at times (Which i think deserves to be more than just that,come on gamers!) ,i don't see any CONS besides it being Early Access still! So go on and yeet some money and cheers their way so they get to work faster! [/list]



[i] This is the end of this review,down below is my personal experience with the game,if you don't wish to read more piles of text,feel free to move on,but if you need some extra convincing and that you're  new like me to the  Battle Royal genre,this might help you: [/i] 
[spoiler] i'll add a last personal note that's interestingly orignal compared to most of these multiplayer games....
is that you can actually win a game by being a PACIFIST,i won my first game like that,its a legit way how to win,so you are also rewarded for any playstyles you want,not just for your gunplay!  

And finally,this game is way more community based and friendly,they have a discord,the devs pay attention to their players and players seem to interact with each other a lot more,that it is in lobby,or even in the fight....

Just the other day,i landed in a certain potassium-filled cave,and grabbed everything but a weak pistol as they came down,harmless.....
Instead of shooting them in the face,i saw them hide in the corner..... Not moving.... And i just moved away... And we never saw again.....
 
Couldn't clip it,but this kind of thing is what makes this game special to me more than ever now.[/spoiler]

This top-down battle royale acts as a sort of counter-argument to the AAA titans of the genre by being much more bite sized, balanced, and ethical. In other words, matches are short by design--maybe about 10-15 minutes at most--,are not immediately decided by whoever found the sniper rifle first, and while there are season passes and some cosmetics that are pay-only there are no loot boxes or ""pay-to-win"" schemes. 

While I don't know if the developers have a strategy on how to keep it fresh, the seasonal events and occasional new sections of the map suggest that they are in here for the long haul; that this is still a labor of love. My only real complaints--""super complaints"" if you  will--is that the map doesn't really change per round aside from pickup spawns and where the cloud of skunk gas (SAR's version of 'The Storm') will circle in on. Potentially, they could have the map have buildings or areas that are either barricated/trapped one round and safe the next. But these are only minor nitpicks.

It's a super cute top-down Battle Royale shooter that's nice and easy to pick up.

The variety in cosmetic choices is fantastic, containing a vast quantity of animals and costume items to pick from. You could have a different loadout for every day of the year.

The gameplay feels fair and rewarding for those who learn and pick it up. Each weapon has its own benefits and drawbacks (e.g. The AK/M16 are good all-rounders but SMGs and Shotguns will always outdo them at close range)

The community is fun and inviting, I've rarely had an experience that was anything less than pleasant with them.

But that's not the best part. The gameplay is simple, yet does have its own complex way of playing, but still inviting to newer players. The wide range of weapons allows for all types of ways to fight others. There are also custom gamemodes the devs add to SAR temporarily and give the game a new spin of fun. 

There is the SAR shop that uses tickets in exchange for real money but that does not give an edge to any player. No pay to win here. There are also season passes that can be accessed at any time, provided you have the SAR tickets to gain access. Sure, the game does wave fancy cosmetics in your face. But it does not force you to indulge in animal dressup.

But this game is quick, fast paced and you can jump in and jump out of as many games as you want, you can also practically run this on a potato.

It doesn't tread new ground, but it does have charm, and I like the charm it has.

Additionally, try the demo, it's completely free and while you may not get cosmetics, you'll get to experience the game!

SAR is a cute little battle royale that is easy to pick up and play. While I am someone who doesn't particularly like BR's, what I love about SAR is that matches are quick, meaning that when you lose a game you don't feel like you lost half an hour doing nothing. The gameplay is simplistic, meaning that both battle royale veterans and noobs will quickly learn controls and strategy with an equal chance of winning.

If you are playing the free version of the game, some cosmetics are unlockable and you have the ability to unlock any animal that is not DLC specific. For premium players, there is a large variety of cosmetics available and if you purchase any battle pass, you will be able to complete them even after that season has passed, removing the fear of FOMO and the stress of rushing to complete a battle pass.

Overall, I recommend this game for it's simple but engaging gameplay, it's cute art style and unlockable/premiun cosmetics and the generally kind community of players

Original: Cute unlockables for clothing, weapon skins, and even death markers and solid gameplay that is improving with each update

- You like battle royale games and want to murder adorable animals

I've met a ton of friends on this game as well, some insanely close friends and I always look forward to playing it with them. The developers of this game are also so kind and caring and I'm glad to even know a couple.

You can play alone or with a team of up to four. The game is divided up into 3 game modes: Solos, Duos, and Squads, based on the number of players in your party. A fourth game mode, SAW vs. Rebels, is a 32 vs 32 mode that is occasionally available as well.

The gameplay is pretty fun. There are a variety of weapons to find and choose from in the world, so there are options to suit your play style. The Epic and Legendary weapons are hard to find in the world, so you won't find them every game, but all of the weapons in the lowest 3 tiers are pretty abundant, so it shouldn't be too hard to explore and find what you need. It definitely takes some practice to get to know the map and get better at surviving, but winning is definitely possible, especially in the modes where you have teammates to back you up.

The backstory to the game is fun and is subtly incorporated into the map. There are fun little Easter eggs you can find, some of which come with bonus skins you can wear in game. The gameplay itself really doesn't have any story-related elements to it, even SAW vs. Rebels, but the backstory you can get from exploring the map is a fun bonus on top of the gameplay.

The biggest weakness of the game is the small playerbase. Almost every game you get will have some bots in the match. At peak times there might only be 10-20 bots needed to fill a 60 player lobby, but in off hours there might only be 10-20 human players in the lobby. Games with bots aren't that bad, as the bots usually end up killing each other or getting killed by players early on and the end of the game has a bunch of human players facing off. However, the games with more humans are much more unpredictable and fun, so more players will help the game improve.

The game has gone completely free-to-play in an effort to expand the player base, and in that regard it has been somewhat successful, as the player numbers have gone up from what they were when there was a paid version. Now the game is monetized through sales of cosmetics. There are some cosmetics you can obtain for free by playing the game and some that you have to pay for using SAW tickets, a paid in-game currency. I personally have no problem with these kinds of microtransactions, as they don't affect gameplay and you can earn some of the cosmetics through playing. There are also DLC packs which have exclusive animals breeds, emotes, cosmetics, and SAW tickets, or you can just buy the SAW tickets on their own.

Overall, Super Animal Royale is a really fun battle royale shooter that's great to play on your own or with your friends. The game is pretty great now, and I can't wait to see it improve as the player base expands and it's able to support more game modes. 9/10",1611783652,1637798197,True,21,2,0.718856632709503174,0,True,False,False

-------------------------------------------

Despite everyone leaving the park in disarray, I quite enjoy working on the park to try to bring it up to its former glory. Its a rough job, being paid in bits of kibble but dedication is what this park needs. I have to go through safety vests a lot, constantly getting holes in them from the local population always fighting.

Some people think that getting shot at is not worth trying to make Super Animal World a clean and well lit instillation, but I am just use to it. If no one else picks up all this litter, cleans the crab grass and tries to repair the roads, then who will?

If I left, Karen the cactus would be all alone. She has two kids she is putting through college. She needs a friend, especially since cactus don't get hugged much. Its a rough life in the Sahara and by golly I will ensure she gets her support.

FromGameplay:
NOCROSSPLAY - Quick big one as this game is on all platforms. But has no private servers or crossplay avaliable.
Little variety to gameplay - Only one game mode. Other modes are bi-monthly so come back again when they're on later.
Wait time is about two minutes - one to load in players, another to load in bots to fill in the constant gaps.
Weapon's are unbalanced - Shotguns have little downsides even with short range. And some are never used.
Ping is bad - Maybe a year by now, If you have high ping you have an advantage in combat.
Cosmetics are hard to get - Constant RNG from the shop/levels in hopes of that one item you want.
Bad report system - Only reportable from main menu. Have to dig through at least 20 names for one idiot.
No individual mute system - If one person's being a bother you have to deal with it, or have no chat at all.

From Development:
Lack of update logs - Hard to find ANY information of the game or any changes made unless it's a ""Major"" update.
Reliance on third party resources - If you don't use them your out of luck with any kind of feedback or updates.
Lack of developer response - Usually moderators respond as rarely do you see developers engaged with the community

Much like another popular review here on steam, I cannot recommend the game due to a bad experience on the official Discord server. 

Battle royale games typically bring in toxicity with their competitive nature. This is expected. I typically block people and move on. An issue arose where I had my own randomly assigned teammates, constantly call me trash, and told me to kill myself while back-seat gaming the whole time. They were dead while I was alive, because they made bad plays after I revived them twice. My issue wasn't that they were toxic, my issue was I had no option of muting them, because they were teammates. When I brought this up on the Discord, asking how I can mute dead teammates (and also permanently mute them, because, at the time, muting only persisted during the round and would unmute next round) I was flamed with, ""you shouldn't be playing online games. People are mean."" ""lol. Get thicker skinned."" and even had a Dev tell me that I should, ""just play the game with all chat disabled if you can't stand mean players."" I still had 1 teammate that was decent, so I didn't want to cut them off.

Wow. I was taken aback. I was bringing up the issue of not being able to mute toxic teammates, and was told to just stop playing with chat enabled by a DEV. Instead of acknowledging the issue that their game can breed some serious toxicity and there needs to be a way to block players, the blame was forced onto the recipient of toxicity for ""not having thicker skin.""

Horrible mindset. Horrible treatment of players on their discord. Buy the game on key reselling websites for much cheaper if you want to have skins.


Editing since some people mistake this as me complaining about toxicity from matches:
The main issue here is the dev encouraging the discord to flame me from my valid criticism of the lack of muting/blocking teammates. 

Never was an issue of, ""I'm sad"". The whole issue was, ""This teammate is terrible person. How can I mute/block them or report them?"" The option was already there for opponents.

Hard to enjoy a game with a group of devs that flame you for such a small question.",1634621537,1635066529,False,7,1,0.479781746864318848,6,True,False,False

It's really bad I can't play full version with people who play free version. Like REALLY bad. Disappointing as hell. And I can't even buy a game for person who I wanted to play with.

This game is no longer the game I once loved. The game is plagued with continually more questionable choices in how games are handled, the game went from being a singular pay thing to being free-to-play with countless premium microtransaction costumes added, predatory game design implemented, removal of most items from the drop table to being in the game's daily rotating shop so you now have to acquire in-game currency.

Event items are also getting progressively lazier in favor of making premium-only items better, often defaulting to just a pair of glasses with a random trinket to remind you what holiday it's making a hollow effort to show, a male and a female bland dress and shirt w/ pants, an umbrella, a gravestone, and a couple melee items. The soul is gone.

I don't know if greed finally got to the devs, or if it was the mistake of selling out to a publisher, but this game just isn't the same anymore. The community behind this game has mostly moved on for better or worse, few stick around anymore. There are newcomers, sure, especially with console release, but the game just isn't what it once was. I'll leave the old review in here to see where this game once was. It was good while it lasted, but it just isn't worth playing anymore. Not in the longrun.

Also, they're purposefully censoring negative reviews.


Old review:
After playing the free version, I knew instantly that I wanted to support this game and hurled cash at it. I'm a sucker for cute things, and this game has that in spades. There are several animals to collect and play as, along with dozens of cosmetic items to earn via challenges, events, and even just playing matches. The game gets frequent updates, and the devs are very interactive with players, and there's even a large positive community around this game that makes it worth to keep coming back to.

Игра является продолжением DotA — пользовательской карты-модификации для игры Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos и дополнения к ней Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. Игра изображает сражение на карте особого вида; в каждом матче участвуют две команды по пять игроков, управляющих «героями» — персонажами с различными наборами способностей. Для победы в матче команда должна уничтожить особый объект-«крепость», принадлежащий вражеской стороне, и защитить от уничтожения собственную «крепость». Dota 2 работает по модели free-to-play с элементами микроплатежей.

Разработка игры началась в 2009 году, когда компания Valve приняла на работу основного разработчика DotA — IceFrog, а летом 2010 года подала заявку на регистрацию этой торговой марки[4][5]. 13 октября 2010 года на игровом портале Game Informer игра была анонсирована к выходу в 2011 году[6]. 15 августа 2011 года в официальном блоге был опубликован трейлер к игре[7]. Dota 2 вышла в июле 2013 года после того, как два года находилась в стадии бета-тестирования[8][9].

Изначально Dota 2 была выпущена на игровом движке Source, после чего в 2015 году была портирована на Source 2, став первой работающей на нём игрой[10][11]. В Dota 2 предусмотрена возможность создавать пользовательские режимы игры, оформление карты и косметические предметы для героев, после чего добавить их в Dota 2 при помощи Steam Workshop. Dota 2 является одной из наиболее популярных игр в Steam и получила в целом положительные отзывы критиков за игровой процесс, качество производства и сохранение положительных сторон своей предшественницы[12].

Dota 2 является активной киберспортивной дисциплиной, в которой профессиональные команды со всего мира соревнуются в различных лигах и турнирах. Премиум-турниры по Dota 2 имеют призовые фонды в миллионы долларов, не раз становившиеся крупнейшими в истории киберспорта[13][14]. Самый крупный турнир по игре — The International, ежегодно проводимый Valve. Начиная с сезона 2017/18 Valve также организует Dota Pro Circuit — профессиональный сезон, проводящийся в течение года. Крупные профессиональные турниры по Dota 2 транслируются на видеостриминговых сервисах, иногда набирая свыше миллиона зрителей одновременно[15]. Людей, играющих в Dota 2, часто называют «дотерами»[16].",1630515337,1630515337,False,1,0,0.45722430944442749,0,True,False,False

It's extremely shallow and greedy, ever since mid 2019 the updates slowed to a crawl, and the devs started being more quiet. 

They finally release a big update in september 2020 we find out the game is now owned by Modus, ""free to play"" meaning those who paid 15 dollars for a full experience with no microtransactions can go fuck themselves, and of course it's FILLED with microtransactions that cost absurd amounts of money for comparatively nothing. 

After this the devs become downright aggressive to the response from those not happy with this, the community built around it starts to crumble, and the majority of updates shift their focus to more microtransation bait.

400 hours later, I still adore this game for all of the reasons I listed originally, and now for new things:

[*]This has to be the fairest use of 100% optional microtransactions I have ever seen. This game is not pay-to-win; this game IS pay-to-look-good-but-really-there-are-a-ton-of-great-free-cosmetics-if-not.
[*]Season passes are great for getting a ton of new cosmetic loot, and there's no time-limit on completing them – you can even work on two passes at once!
[*]The developers have continued to make consistent and timely patches with ever-increasing content. 
[*]The island has been modified several times, each time making unique spaces that create different environmental challenges, increasing the sense that each game is different
[*]New items and weapons have diversified tactical gameplay options; weapons have been rebalanced as necessary to prevent OP metas - it really is possible to prefer different classes of weapons and still have an equal chance to win.
[*]And of course... [b]dancing crabs[/b].

Just try it. There is still literally no reason not to. 

(Original Review)

I'll get to why I like S.A.R. below, but first let me be clear that I've tried this genre heavily:  

[list]
[*]I tried Fortnite several times but hated that every match was decided by who could build faster than a coked-out beaver.
[*]I found Black Ops 4 Blackout too boring and glitchy.
[*]I liked the aesthetics and balance of Apex Legends, but wanted to play solo.
[*]I even kinda liked the Nuclear Winter on Fallout 76, but teams are lumped in with solo players at this point.
[/list]

Super Animal Royale is everything I wanted from battle royale. It's fast-paced, almost entirely decided by player aiming skill, reasonably well-balanced (although the AK remains a bit OP), and doesn't take itself too seriously. For an Early Access game it's remarkably polished and I've experienced no obvious glitches. The unlocks are completely cosmetic and have no impacts on gameplay (aside from contrast of brighter colors, if you so choose). Solos, Duos, and Squads are separate.

I think three critical things set SAR above other battle royales, however: time spent, art, and community. First, the game's graphics are low-resource: exiting ended games to the menu and then loading into new games takes only a few seconds. I think this prevents you from seething over a close loss very long because you're almost immediately in setup for the next game, which brings us directly to the second and third parts: you really can't get that angry (or stay however angry you are) when you and everyone around you are embodied by ridiculously cute animals in thousands of different permutations of species/breed/color and dorky accessories. I haven't had a single toxic interaction yet; most players are content to chat amiably and dance around the fire or Party Bush, and it's common to see compliments or sympathy exchanged over the outcome of the last match. This game is the ultimate chill time-kill.

The concept is simple, a top down battle royale with cute animals in the mix. Don't let its simple aesthetic fool you though, there is serious depth to this game. It will take hundreds of hours to compete at the top level, and stand toe to toe with the best players in the game. If there is one concern I have, it's that this widening skill gap could cause some new players to shy away. I have to say though, that the journey is worth it and some of the most amazing competitive gaming experiences I've had were in this game. And yes, there is a competitive side to this game with tournaments organized, etc.

Everybody has their one game, the game that just sinks its claws into you and grips you in a way that no other games can. SAR was that game for me. I went from casually playing for fun, to streaming the game, to becoming a content creator, then becoming an officially partnered content creator for the game. I fell in love with this game's mechanics, its community and its development. It has given me so, so much and is responsible for kicking off my streaming career. 

I wholeheartedly recommend SAR to everybody I know, and those I don't.

Pros: 
Gameplay has surprising depth due to well structured mechanics.
Fun for casual players and competitive players
Fun for playing with friends in duos or squads
Is in active development so new stuff being added
Dev team really cares about the game

Cons:
Some specific monetization I feel could be adjusted.
The community has taken a hit from console releases, but is being policed.
Might take some time for new players to win a match.",1588800588,1630099620,True,8,0,0.61848139762878418,0,True,False,False

Everyone use to be pretty friendly with only a few tryhards but now its all wannabee TTVs and toxic shitheads. I bought the super edition but now that is completely useless since it gives practically nothing. A great example of taking a fun light hearted game then transitioning to a cash grab.

Due to the random nature of the game and item spawns; you could get royally screwed over due to bad RNG and other players/bots just corning you without having a chance. Some matches end in 20 seconds if you are unlucky.

But, despite this, it is a really fun game to play with friends, and isn't majorly irritating unless players make it such. Even still; I do think the weapons need to be rebalanced majorly (Automatics run this game right now because they are literally good at everything; making most other weapons rather hard to make use of without a lot more effort). Armor basically serves to just block 3 hits, which is fine when melee fighting, or fighting single-shot guns; but an Automatic or Shotgun shreds Armor to bits; and Snipers just ignore armor. It feels like Armor needs it's own health bars before parts of it break. Maybe 3 small bars worth 30 hp each? Just a suggestion?

Weapon re-balance and some new game modes are a must. For one thing; why can the Tommygun outrange the Sniper Rifle? This makes literally no sense. Guns built for long range confrontation are outclassed by an SMG. Also; new game modes would help keep players interested. You can only drop on the same map, for so long... before it gets boring.

Overall, I recommend this game if you're the type who just wants to relax, play a fun game with some friends; and mess around. There are also daily challenges, and the game is constantly being updated; so that helps matters out. Overall; it has a big future, if more players start playing it; please, tell your friends about Super Animal Royale.

Currently this game's biggest problem is the lack of players. Every game has about maybe 15 players, and the other 35 are all bots. You'll be playing with the same 15 players, which means the person who won last round will likely be the winner every time. This wouldn't be an issue if there were more players, as then it would be more interesting. Every game played recently results in the same 2-3 people winning every round.

UPDATE: The newest release has finally come out, with cross compatibility with other platforms, and a new store and everything. And sadly; few of the things I've mentioned have been addressed. The game still suffers from unexplained mechanics, no tutorial (just quick tool tips), and new items that you have to guess the effectiveness of on the fly, or look up on the wiki to understand what they do. This makes SAR rather tricky to approach, and even then; the weapons are still unbalanced.

Ultimately, victory will often fall into the lap of whoever plays chicken the longest, not fighting enemies is more a beneficial tactic then fighting; and with the addition of items like the Cupgrade, and Skunk Gas snorkel; you can actually win matches by just camping somewhere and healing up until your enemies die from it before you do. To say the least; many rounds end this way, or end with you engaging in a brutal beatdown that ends in half a second; because the closing area makes Shotguns far too OP compared to other options. 90% of winners use either the Jag or the M4, because they are ridiculously powerful and easy to use.",1576933210,1630038309,True,6,0,0.593881845474243164,0,True,False,False

- You get MAAAD 90's arcade nostalgia if you were alive for that era. The top down Volumetric shadows or whatever its called is a great twist in gameplay and adds another fun style of ""point n click"" if you want to call it that. I cannot reccomend this game enough. It is casual enough to play with friends and not feel worried about winning. Flip that coin and you get a strong competition game that is small sure, but there is a lot to learn mechanics wise.

- Now, remember that whole community thing? Yeah they have a discord which, in and of itself isnt special everyone has one. Here's what makes it different. YOU CAN TALK. DIRECTLY. TO DEVS AND THE OWNER OF PIXILE. They WANT you feedback. You can just sit in general, meet 50 new people, all of which will say Hi to you as soon as you say ""hey everyone"" and there is a 90% chance of someone offering you feedback and help to get better at the game. 

- Over all, 10/10 community, 10/10 gameplay. PLUS ITS *FREE*


**EDIT**

After 1,000+hrs I'm updating this review. While I no longer play the game anymore I felt I needed to update this as I missed a lot of points from newer updates. The game no longer held my attention like it use to, more of a me issue and not on the game itself. I got burned out is all. 

- Yes there are ""microtransactions"" for cosmetic items, that do nothing but change your looks. They are some of the better implemented transactions I've seen used. They may be pricey for some items sure, but at the end of the day developers, Social Media teams, artists, sound/music team, they need a way to make money as well from the FREE game. The game is great in that sense, and it was still fun to play. The charm wasn't lost from it. 

Overall I would still strongly recommend the game, even with the new microtransactions in them. It is still a fun, charming top down shooter that you can easily sink time into and still have fun with.

It's quirky, yet addicting, especially playing with your friends. The amount of Super Animals you can create and the customization make this game more enticing for the player to enjoy. Sometimes, I forget I am supposed to be defeating the other animals and instead just like to look at how everyone customized their own Super Animals. 

The gunplay and combat are quick and can be quite frustrating when going up against someone with a much more extreme game time than you, i.e. sniper bullets always hitting from so far away, ak-47s being the best rifle, but I digress because I probably just suck at the game, to be honest.

This game has so much to offer and is a masterpiece to be played by anyone who enjoys video games. The fact that you can even download the Free Edition and your progress will be transferred (if you buy the full edition) is something that more games should take the initiative on. You will want to unlock more Super Animals and the game will give you a sense of enjoyment not found in many other games in the genre.

This makes the overall combat experience fairer for players, but means high ping players will need to lead shots (and hamster ball squashes). Previous high-ping mechanisms like damage reduction have been removed in favor of this.

because of this i can no longer play given i've got ping over 300, it's the most un fair thing i've ever seen added, and i paid money for this.

given if you're not on discord they don't care to fix anything, or hear you, do to this i cannot recommend if you get over 200 ping just don't play it, at 315 ping i can't hit a thing do to the last update.

is that all you ask? nah it's got a lot of aim bot users,before the so called ping fix, so much for fair for all

ps dev i don't have\use discord so that wouldn't work, 2nd im a older  gamer i've played games with high ping,390\420 i can still land hits

Typically I don't like battle royal but the top down gameplay with charismatic cute animals gives this game a much more fun vibe which isn't meant to be taken seriously or competitively, and I'm pleased to say it is reflected in the player base which is often light-hearted and playful.

Weapons come in a range of rarities/qualities including: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary.
While there is only the single map, the different biomes offer different strategic challenges which the players will have to adapt to.

The game loop is very simple, and very repetitive. The main draw to the game is working towards getting fun cosmetic items. And now you have to spend more money to get those. 
It's not like Fortnite where you can complete a battle pass and buy the next one, and then save for shop items or buy more currency.

Cons: Constantly updated, so that means certain updates break the game. You will need high speed internet or you will be out played simply because of internet speeds. So yes, a player with worse weapons and armor can kill you, despite you having the best weapons and armor. There are players who run Aim bots.

Final Vote: Changed because the game devs keep the game in constant state of being broken (see every game on Steam.) They also reserve the right to take away functions, including chat, weapon function, and everyone is running bots. You can run bot, but post mild criticism and you are censored and they terminate chat function. This kind of scummy crap is why I quit video games and drink. Thanks for proving alcoholism is better than video games. I hope you all end up homeless.

Edit to add: Now the servers keep crashing and there are microtransactions. I am not a happy customer and I regret buying this game. Stop making all the worst business decisions.

Because I dared to use the adjective ""scummy"" twice the game is threatening to revoke my chatting privileges permanently. I am a paying customer and I do NOT care for your arbitrary censorship policies changing every time I play the game. 

Hey hot dog vendor, make me my hot dog and shut the fuck up!

Edit to add: I have determined gun jamming is just the game dropping connectivity. So congratulations! The guns aren't reliable and there's a bug where a fully loaded gun will decided to reload instead when you press the fire button. 

Please stop breaking the game. If it continues to degrade in quality, I will uninstall.

To anyone reading this, just switch to Epic Games. They apparently use their nefarious corporate scamming practices to weed out utter garbage games. If you're gonna sell your soul, at least sell it for something that works, I guess.

It's actually a really easy to grasp and simple game to pickup. At first glance it might seem like ""oh this looks like an EZ game I can sweep the floor and dumpster other players no problem"". No, not even close, it can be really intense and crazy despite the looks of the game. And when you down to the wire everyone flying over the place maneuvering and trying to outshout and outplay you it's such an adrenaline rush sometimes. And when you come out on top whether solo or with a squad and the match is over. It just makes you go ""whew, that was crazy!"", then you just want to keep playing more. 

Also, matches are pretty quick too (5-10 minutes if you were to reach it to the end) and thats a major thing I like. Also, unlike most BR/Multiplayer games where if you quit you may get a temporary suspension or put into a ""bad player lobby"" like major retail games, you don't get penalized other than you won't recieve XP/drops. Not that I like quitters, but if you are a person with bad internet/disconnection, or if something comes up urgently, or if you have to get off the computer expecting an average game of ~45 minutes turns into a 2 hour match for no real good reason  (*cough cough* Dota 2, LoL, etc. etc.), its the worst feeling getting penalized for it.",1621801702,1623381360,True,6,1,0.545127451419830322,1,True,False,True

Fear the Gun Wielding Fox! Seriously, this game is absolutely amazing. From the simple graphic and map layout design. To the locations of guns, ammo, healing from campire/coconuts/health juice, banan(as) vs. grenades, variety of cosmetics and weapons. 

There is always something to do. Grinding for more DNA and Serum to unlock skins for different animals in the game. Level Up, Collect DNA and Serum to get them all! More animals, skins, DNA conversion, etc in the future.

This truly is a game worth buying. Try out the demo and see for yourself! It also has controller support, solo/duo/SQUAD - Cross Platform (Xbox - PSN - PC)!

For an early access game, there is small bugs that the Devs are truly passionate about listening for feedback and their discord is a great place to hang out in and get to know the community and staff.

**NOT P2W (Pay 2 Win)** - You can get cosmetics through simply playing the game, earning coins and getting items from the Carl's Shop, or spend money on Tickets to get items. There is also a battle pass that may change in ticket price over time. This is the early stages of these concepts currently! Cosmetics is for visual only, nothing will help gain wins/skill.

Simply play, learn the ropes, look at YouTube and steam community guides to help.

Moderators and Dev team are there to help the community. If there is a issue in game/discord - contact a Moderator that can assist immediately.

To explain this, there was no other way to put on the cosmetics you were to use over the course of time over playing the game, not even switching your animal was possible without paying the 14 dollar gap. Initially on launch the game was told to never/always in its lifetime have 
-Premium Currencies that you would need to pay for
-Updates that would help balance the game
-Constant feedback intake 
and much more broken promises...
Though I don't want this whole review to be a list so I'll summarize the game as a whole.
The people who paid for the game because they believed that the game was good enough to be paid for is now in a ditch of a ""DLC"" that doesn't really provide much to the people that revved up the game in the first place. 1300 of the premium currency (SAR TICKETS In comparison, 100 tickets = 1 dollar), 10 cosmetics (in which only 3/10 you'll actually use) and 4 animal skins to use (yet again, only 2 at most you'll actually use.)
Now knowing the developers/mods of the game. This review will probably be taken down/marked as spam for them being picky picky/goodie goodie with the reviews of this game. 
As of now giving the players as much taped together cosmetics is possible is their supposed content that they're only willing to provide meanwhile their ""balancing"" is just bullet spread and putting numbers where they shouldn't go.  For example: The Magnum in the earlier version of the game dealt around 50 damage and had 1 point of armor break. Now it's the equivalent of the deagle (same as the magnum) except you could get it much earlier and finish fights in as little as 2 seconds if you land your shots. This is only a foot into the rabbit hole and I haven't even began to talk about the glitches, exploits and strategies weapons can give due to it being so unbalanced.
The game now comprises of the many people who bought the game for when they wanted to support and in term be fucked over with a XL STAN or people that bought the game, liked it and still play it despite being shafted.

[h1] TL:DR: Buy a commission instead, it's worth more than this game at its current state. [/h1]

EDIT: With the direction this game is going looking into the Twitter of this game, it's looking more as people who normally play the game are accepting the cosmetic-only handouts that the developers offer. Though hey, at least you could make your super shiny pink otter wear a 
blue mohawk instead of a red one, right?... I want this game to succeed but it keeps drowning itself with the pointless updates that don't provide anything actually new to the player except for a quick paint . NET change at most. Hell. Maybe that will change but my stance on the game itself still stands.

EDIT #2 (4/9/2021): ""I want this game to succeed but it keeps drowning itself with the pointless updates that don't provide anything actually new to the player except for a quick paint . NET change at most. Hell. Maybe that will change but my stance on the game itself still stands.""
These are the words I said when I had hope for the game. All of that is basically gone out the window with the adding of not one but two cosmetic species, an update for a S I N G U L A R on-the-field healing item and the main focus on the content creator appeal. The creators of this absolutely WILL NOT SHUT UP about the content creators and for good reason! They're aware that players like them will eat anything they throw and that they're the only reason the game's still alive. Expect this game to die in the next 7-8 months when the game has as much content as a wolf fursonas color palette.",1605998757,1618024256,False,13,1,0.577084362506866455,5,True,False,True

I thought it was good... then the Matty-kun incident happened.  How Pixile handled it at first was so horrific that I actually cringed and took a ""break"" from the game. They basically welcomed pedophiles into the game just by their inaction while Matty was getting outed for being one. This isn't the first time it happened which only lowered my trust of Pixile...

Anyway... months later, I returned to the game to see what was different. Never thought I'd say it, but the break actually opened my eyes to the most glaring flaws of the game. I have no time to explain it all in detail so have some pro and con list.

Pros:
-Very simplistic
-Accidentally furry (I'll get back to that one in a moment)
-Pretty much all I can think of

Cons:
-Too repetitive, the night time isn't enough to shake things up.
-You can't really enjoy the game if you're not sweaty
-The community.... see the first paragraph of this review.
-Balance is too wonky. Might be just be me being a Halo player, but I want more utility over lethality.
-Microtransactions, and how it feels like the devs are focused on trying to squeeze the furry community dry with those (will visit this in a moment, too)
-Big updates are okay, but they're often minuscule to even improve the experience which stays stagnant despite that.

I remember seeing some sort of interview where the developers did not intend to attract a part of the furry community to the game, which cool I understand. But I feel like, with the developers knowing this sort of stuff, they put up the microtransaction store and battle pass to try and line their pockets from said community. Felt like many flaws with this game are overlooked by them cause of how the store and battle pass exists. The cosmetics aren't even good either, which is a shame because otherwise, this would've been a fun game if the developers handled shitty people better and actually shake things up.

As a post-mortem for this review, as much as it hurts me saying this, you'd get more entertainment value from playing Fortnite than SAR. Epic may be shit, but if you have the Epic launcher (or any other consoles) only for Fortnite, it's honestly fun if you aren't willing to do it seriously and... who would've guessed, they actually shake it up which I very much appreciate. 

Ok but really, if you're a furry, you probably won't be missing much if you skip playing this game. Just move on with your life. Support the small game developers who would definitely appreciate your money a lot instead.",1548782355,1617422840,False,2,0,0.464788734912872314,1,True,False,True

They broke the game so it no longer works in proton. The game is practically a brick now. DO NOT buy this. I will be requesting a refund.
-----EDIT-----
here is also no ability whatsoever to host your own server. You MUST use the game company's servers only which there are only three of, one for each major continent. This also means that unless you live in the same state as the server your going to suffer from excessively high pings, like 50-80+ms for me. low pings are very important for a reaction based shooter game. There is no fix for this because you can't host your own server. If something were to happen to the devs, the game company, or anything else related your copy of the game will very well become nothing more than a brick.
There is also no integrated way to have your friends join your session besides Steam and Discord, which Discord is centralized spyware and Steam not always being the most convenient way. I'd really like to see some URL format way so that I could invite friends regardless of what social platform they are using for example: sar://animalserver1.example.com/session1234 . 
There are also very restrictive (some may consider excessive) restrictions on what can be said in chat or what your player name can be with restrictions including names of specific cities in china.

If you can get over all that (Please fix these things devs) the game is alright and at contains no microtransactions. All avatar personalization is done by leveling up and getting points from winning matches. The game gets updates every other few months with new content like new avatar items or new areas on the map.

Until some of the more core issues I've expressed above are resolved I can NOT recommend getting this game. Especially with the risk of something happening to the always-online DRM and no player servers the risk of the game becoming nothing more than a brick is very real with no recourse whatsoever.",1576904399,1616482698,False,2,0,0.473684221506118774,0,True,False,True

Expect something that's way more casual than other battle royales, but with a high skill ceiling. The game is very polished and it runs great. Lag issues are very rare and are usually caused by network problems, meaning it's not the game's fault. Cosmetics are plentiful but the game never tries to upsell you like every other BR game.

The only complaints I have ever had with this game are these:
- There are usually too many bots. It's fun to style on the bots and it helps make the game fun, but it also can throw you off if you want to improve and be challenged.
- The hamster balls used to be very broken. They would kill you if they *glanced* you at full speed and the hitbox seemed way too big. I'm not sure if this is still a problem.

One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst drBetaing around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the Supewr Animal Island mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 1 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.
I could go on like this for ages. SAR has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make Supewr Animal Island – the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas – feel like a lBetaing world where anything can happen. It both gBetaes you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well-realised world and tells a story that’s gripping, thrilling, and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narratBetae sophistication for the series, and there’s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn’t been improved over Super Animal Royal BETA. It’s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto-aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last, Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons, mission checkpointing, ensuring that you never have to do a long, tedious drBetae six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.
Super Animal Royal is also an intelligent, wickedly comic, and bitingly relevant commentary on contemporary, post-economic crisis America. Everything about it drips satire: it rips into the Millennial generation, celebrities, the far right, the far left, the middle class, the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar’s sharp tongue, including modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset whilst playing a first-person shooter called Righteous Slaughter (“Rated PG – pretty much the same as the last game.”) It’s not exactly subtle – he literally has the word “Entitled” tattooed on his neck, and the in-game radio and TV’s outright piss-takes don’t leave much to the imagination – but it is often extremely funny, and sometimes provocatBetae with it. Super Animal Royal’s Supewr Animal Island is a fantasy, but the things it satirises – greed, corruption, hypocrisy, the abuse of power – are all very real. If SAR BETA was a targeted assassination of the American dream, SAR takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alBetae and believable is also what makes its satire so biting.
Super Animal Royal’s plot happily operates at the boundaries of plausibility, sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of trains, hijack military aircraft, and engage in absurd shootouts with scores of policemen, but its three main characters are what keep it relatable even at its most extreme. The well-written and acted interplay between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments, and the way that their relationships with one another developed and my opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narratBetae its power. They feel like people – albeit extraordinarily f***ed-up people.
Dogna the Lab Lab is a retired con man in his 40s, filling out around the middle as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout son, air-headed daughter, serially unfaithful wife, and very expensBetae therapist – all of whom hate him. Hal The Monkey is a young man from downtown Los Santos who laments the gang-banger stereotype even as he’s reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there’s Donk, a volatile career criminal who lBetaes in the desert selling drugs and murdering rednecks; a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed-up childhood.
The missions flit between their indBetaidual stories and an overarching plotline that involves all three, and it’s a credit to SAR’s versatility and unBetaersal quality that each character has his share of standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about each of them at different times – they’re not entirely the archetypes that they seem to be.
This three-character structure makes for excellent pacing and great variety in the storyline, but it also allows Rockstar to compartmentalise different aspects of Super Animal Royal’s personality. In doing so, it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti-violent philosophising and sociopathic killing sprees in SAR BETA. Here, many of Dogna the Lab Lab’s missions revolve around his family and his past, Hal The Monkey is usually on call for vehicular mayhem, and extreme murderous rampages are left to Donk. Each has a special ability suited to his skills – Hal The Monkey can to slow time while drBetaing, for example – which gBetaes them a unique touch. NarratBetaely, it’s effectBetae – even off-mission I found myself playing in character, acting like a mid-life-crisis guy with anger issues as Dogna the Lab Lab, a thrill-seeker as Hal The Monkey, and a maniac as Donk. The first thing I did when Hal The Monkey finally made some good money was buy him an awesome car, because I felt like that’s what he’d want.
Donk feels a like a bit of a get-out-of-jail-free card for Rockstar, providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with SAR’s narratBetae ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome at first. As get-out clauses go, though, it’s pretty effectBetae, and Donk’s over-the-top missions are some of SAR’s action-packed highlights. It’s a successful way of solving a problem that’s prevalent in open-world games: the tension between the story that the writers are trying to tell, and the story you create yourself within its systems and its world. Super Animal Royal accommodates both, masterfully, allowing neither to undermine the other.
The actual act of switching between them also provides a window into their indBetaidual lBetaes and habits, fleshing out their personalities in a way that feels natural and novel. Pick a character and the camera zooms out over the Supewr Animal Island map, closing back in on wherever they happen to be. Dogna the Lab Lab might be at home watching TV when you drop in on him, or speeding along the motorway blasting ‘80s hits, or having a cigarette at the golf club; Hal The Monkey might be walking out of a strip club, munching a bag of snacks at home, or arguing with his ex-girlfriend; there’s a good chance that Donk could be passed out half naked on a beach surrounded by dead bodies or, on one memorable occasion, drunk in a stolen police helicopter.
It could be nearly anything, because there is a bewildering multiplicity of things to do in the new Supewr Animal Island – tennis, yoga, hiking, racing on sea and on land, flying planes, golfing, cycling, dBetaing, hunting, and more. The missions are an able guide to both Supewr Animal Island’ locations and its actBetaities, touring you around the map and whetting your appetite for independent exploration of it all. The way that we’re introduced to Supewr Animal Island never feels artificial – the map is completely open from the start, for example – which contributes to the impression that it’s a real place, somewhere you can get to know. If SAR BETA’s Liberty City feels like a lBetaing city, Supewr Animal Island feels like a lBetaing world. I saw people walking their dogs a",1590303890,1614134342,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,True

I love the art style and the silly uniqueness of the game.

Out of all the new games I played in 2020, SAR is the game of the year for me. 
I wish I had found out about this game in 2019, would of been amazing getting to play though and see things progress in development. 

Sometimes it's nice to just slow down and look at the little details in some parts of the map, like listening to the ambient sounds in some areas.

I mostly like to play for fun or as a helper to my team, other times I just goof around or explore.

843380,76705870,76561198103261705,0,7,16019,0,8498,1704525870,"In September of last year I wrote a review for this game. Overall it was positive giving the game a '7/10.' After a series of updates I feel enough has changed about the game that a new, updated review is warranted.

In my previous review, my key concerns were regarding the lack of other game modes and the games small player base. In regard to other game modes this has sort of changed. Since my previous review Pixile have added the 32 vs 32 'SAW vs Rebellion' game mode. The basic premise is that both teams deploy the same way you would in the normal BR mode and fight for dominance over four flags. Its a pretty fun game mode and add some variety to the previously BR focused game. 

However, as mentioned this is only 'sort of a change.' While this game mode has been implemented, so far it has only been implemented during special events and is not available outside of them. Making the game mode a permanent fixture would be an appreciated change as it adds some variety, and breaks up the repetitive nature of BR games.

My other key concern was the low player counts. As mentioned previously, when I wrote my last review the player base was laughably small. At peak there would be around 300 players online at anyone time, with this number dropping to around one hundred within a day or two of these peaks. Lobbies as well would mostly consist of bots, with human players only accounting for, at most, around 10 out of the 64 available player slots.

I am very pleased to say that this has been, for the most part, changed. Previously the primary barrier for entry to the full game was roughly $20 AUD. Since my previous review the game has gone free to play seeing massive increases in player numbers, which are normally hovering around 1,000 players during lulls, and 1,500 during peaks. The free to play aspect however has given rise to another concern, the monetisation.

A key feature of BR games is their items stores and Battlepasses. Such systems have also been added into Super Animal Royale. In regards to the in game items store, I am once again pleased to say the monetisation is reasonably low and fair. There are two stores, one for in game currency, another for the premium currency, and another temporary one for seasonal/event items.

First of all the event items store. As mentioned this store is temporary, only appearing during special events. Fortunately the currency used in this store is earned in game and can be gained relatively quickly, getting all of the available items within the given time frame, normally two or three weeks, is doable without grinding.

The in game currency store, Carl's Cart, uses currency, Carl Coins, earned through playing the game. The items provided by the store will cycle every few days, or every week. Luckily Carl Coins are earned easily, and in sufficient enough quantities to prevent grind.

Finally is the premium currency store. The game's premium currency called tickets is, as the name suggests, only available by paying real money. Like with Carl's Cart, the items in the store cycle every few days or weekly. The monetisation for this store are reasonable, at very least cheaper than some of its counterparts such as Fortnite. The highest prices for this store are normally aroung $6 - 7 USD, which is a massive improvement over the $12 USD it cost during the public test phase of the stores.

Ultimately the store prices are reasonable, with the time investment required for the in game currency not being too high. The game also uses random drops, meaning at the end of each match, there is a chance you will earn an item. I have noticed some random drop items appearing in the stores, so the system is very much paying for convenience, you could purchase them in the stores or you could wait to see if you get them through random drops.

As per usual with BR games, they have also added in a Battle Pass system. A Battle Pass is essentially an item purchased with premium money/real money to give you unique in game items only available through completing various tiers on the pass. This where most of my concerns about the monetisation lie. Battle Passes in BR games normally market themselves through FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). This is a marketing practice that generates a demand for an item or service by making said item/service available for a limited time, artificially creating a sense of exclusivity. The problem with this marketing practice is that it pressures the consumer into spending, often absurd amounts of money, on a service, or alternatively creating an excessively long grind which can quickly turn a fun pass time into chore. This is something that should be avoided.

However, regarding the Super Animal Royale Battle Pass, the Animal Pass, the Pixile team has publicly stated that they have been looking into adopting a Permanent Pass system. Such a system would make an Animal Pass permanently available for purchase and completion. This would stop any concerns about FOMO as it remove the key driving force behind it. Whether or not it will be implemented however, I'm not certain. At present, the Pixile team has been very good with community feedback and has implemented a number of changes suggested by the community. Ultimately my attitude towards the possibility of the Permanent Pass is best descried as 'cautious optimism.' The Pixile team has been good with adressing the communities concerns about monetisation, e.g. the premium store price decrease, however, their lack of any definitive statements on the topic do not fill me with confidence.

Another key issue that is being raised by the community is the lack of any real anti-cheat. Due to the recent increase in players and lowered bar for entry there has been an, alleged, influx of hackers and cheats. On the discord for the game, and even in the in game chat, you will often find at least one person with a story about aim bots or players tanking hits that should kill them. The game does not appear to have much in the way of an anti-cheat outside of the report button. While this was sufficient when the game was still small, now that it is growing it is not enough. If you are a hacker/cheater playing this game I have two things to say, firstly **** you, and secondly have fun, you're going to have a field day.
PIXILE PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As for my overall thoughts on the game. It is a very fun, very accessible BR game that is an excellent alternative to larger titles such as Fortnite and Warzone. Its anthropomorphic characters and top down 2D art style give it a unique and fantastic style giving the game no lack of charm and personality. The fast pace of its rounds and game play ensure its not too time consuming and keeps you coming back for at least one more round. A small gripe is the $21.50 AUD it cost for the Super Edition, however it does give you access to Milestone items and 1000 tickets.

This is a game I will normally play for at least 20 - 30 minutes a day. Its a fun and charming alternative to the more main stream BRs out there and I highly recommend giving it a try.

My current score is 8/10

The wait times to start another game are quicker than other Battle Royals so even if you suck at it and die a lot, you can get back in easy. There is some bots but only to fill the matches and I believe that when this comes out of Early Access, I think there will be more actual people to play against.

And gunfights are also surprisingly short and even intense at times, feels like the game respects my time, and lastly, 3) The art style of this game is genuinely cute (Contrasts really well with all of the gunfights and killing) and the community is genuinely super amazing, not perfect but the community does add quite a bit to this game as well. 

I love this game, but my only concern is how expensive the microtransactions are and how much everything costs, I wanna support this game but the asking price for 5000 tickets is 54.95AUD (Daily rotating stock of items tend to cost from 150 and all the way to 550 tickets) and because of that, I ran out of tickets surprisingly quickly and still had new items to buy (I even brought the 5000 tickets during the PTR beta tests, so I received an extra 25% on top of those tickets). If the asking prices were changed or even just adjusted, then I would be more inclined to back this game regularly.

[b]This is one of the most finely tuned, easy to get into battle royale games on the market right now. And it just went completely free.[/b]

Super Animal Royale is a fusion of PUBG, Enter the Gungeon, and furries; this results in a top-down BR game where you shoot each other as cute mouthless animals that make noises. It's pretty simple, easy to get into, and this is where the part where the skill curve hits the new player like a truck, turning them away from the BR experience. Not as much here. Yes, SAR does indeed have a skill curve, but it isn't as merciless as a game like Fortnite's would be. You can still compete and put up a fight, even if you're a fresh player. 

Gunplay is pretty solid, with a decent array of weapons to use without being too overwhelming. You have the AK/M16 as an all-rounder, the SMG/Thomas Gun for close-range shredding, Snipers, Shotguns, even some unusual ones such as a silenced pistol and a Deagle. Each weapon is viable in some way. Some more than others, but each gun doesn't feel objectively bad here. Coupled with the easy to understand movement (WASD and Spacebar to dodge roll) and you've got yourself a winner.

Speaking of winners; you'll be sure to get one in lightning-quick time. Games are fast. They usually last no longer than 7 minutes, and queue times are fast between matches.IT takes away the one gripe I have with most BR gaes, and that is downtime. You won't get much of that here, and because you can jump right back into another round after you perish, losses don't feel as harsh. Yet at the same time, it doesn't take away from the sweet feeling of victory. You'll want to keep going on streaks for a while.

Cosmetics are all free to earn, mostly at least. Recently, there was an update in progression systems, doing away with the old random drop/tradeup system for a currency-based one: Get the items you want through a shop that rotates its wares every few days/week. There is also a premium shop where you can spend tickets (these cost money) for more cosmetic options, or a seasonal pass to earn them through leveling. Now, this is a recent change I disagree with, as previously you could earn every cosmetic in the game at no additional cost, but with the microtransaction-ening introduced, I feel a little ""eh"" about this change. I was able to get the first season's pass free when this update launched. I'm not sure if this was because I was a founder, but I figued I'd put that on this review. Overall, the cosmetic system isn't bad right now, although I much prefer the system that was before this one.

That one gripe aside, Super Animal Royale is an EASY recommend. IF you want to try a fast, easy-to-get-into BR game, this game's free to install. Give it a shot!",1575306048,1606166267,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Alright so well this game is hugely fantastic and I think you still should grab this game I feel like it's slowly going in the wrong direction

-There's been some frequent and major updates with no changes to server, or expansion to servers especially with a 32v32 mode now here it's a real bummer to see that there's been no changes and very unlikely to happen to anytime soon
NOTE: This is in Early Access still

-The past few updates have been lackluster to put it bluntly it's been very counter-productive and new weapons and whatnot that have gotten added have been very weak and have either broken concepts or are just useless after the first week.

-32v32, although really fun it's got horrible lag and a lot of framedrop issues as well as having 4 flags.. but only needing 3 to win (an even then it's still 1 minute until the win)
Teams are highly unbalanced and one usually and frequently gets decimated.

-32v32 replacing Sqauds?! why? it's a horrible decision and quite frankly it's hurt my opinion greatly of this game, it used to be super fun and light and now it's heading head first into competitive territory, no gamemode should replace your core gamemodes even in Early Access

-Animal Pass and Shop, apparently it rotates on a bi-daily basis which is quite jank and tickets for the animal pass/store are hella expensive for what it's worth

[i] Super animal royale has the potential to be a great alternatives top-down battle royal. However, the development was badly executed and the vocal players seem to be blissfully ignorant [/i]

[b]1.bad genre combination[/b]
Devs aim to create casual-friendly battle royal. what that actually does; It kills the game depth.
Battle royal is genre that is fun because it's challenging. Most BR game offers some sort of depth for players to master and use it to gain advantage in the fight. Apex offers super fast pace gameplay with relatively high TTK. PUBG offers realism and strategical planing. Fortnite offers building mechanics and bunch of situation gadget. what does SAR has to offers as a battle royal game? nothing much. there's NO unique mechanic that separate this game from other top-down BR shooter. 


[b] 2. devs are too optimistic and naive[/b]
They know what good is for the game but their execution is deeply flawed. First, the devs team is too small to deliver substantial amount of contents/changes in economically viable time-frame. It took them almost 6 months for them to patch up the bad RNG reward system and it took them another whole year release this much needed reward system rework. Second, they prioritized the wrong thing. for example. they patch in emu subspecies for some reason. the emus barely spice up the gameplay for how much effort it take to create them. the time and resources are better spend to make this huge patch come out faster. 



[b]3. social media like community[/b]
The SAR official discord community is fake as fuck. it may looks wholesome and positive but goddamn. the positivity is fake. there's barely anyone who is truly passionate about the game. those players quit. or refuse to speak up because there's positivity image gatekeepers in the feedbacks. you can give all sort of criticism for sure. but you cannot argue or debate about them. don't believe me? try argue why sniper should be buff or why there's bias in server. you'll get mute or ban. It's a hellhole, for players actually care about the game and it's a heaven for devs simps/whiteknights.    

[b]4.shallow gameplay[/b]
The game is fun and coloful for like 100 matches. after that, It gets old real fast. the gameplay loop consist of collecting cosmetics and achieving sense of accomplishment. if you're not into that then you're doomed with just 6 mins casualized top-down battle royal. not mention the way that weapons and movement are implemented into this game, you either stomp other players ( mostly bots) or get absolutely destroy by tryhard. you rarely will find a good fair fight and actually fun to engage. why? because the meta weapon is so boring. It's assault rifle and shotgun fest. you either will two/ three shot someone with shotgun or get yourself kill other shotgun user. alternatively, you could chase or be chase with assault rifle users to death, slowly but surely. sometime you'll get some annoying smg spread that will shredded your armor from afar.",1555944475,1605682732,False,5,0,0.528732895851135254,2,True,False,True

I'm not usually into BR type games, usually sticking to niche or simulation/sandbox types. As soon as I picked up the standard version, I played this NON-STOP for like 20hrs. I'm not even kidding. 

The people you play with are generally super friendly and good sports whether you win or lose. The items you randomly unlock are cool and you constantly feel like you are getting rewarded which is nice. Especially when you lose, you can say ""Hey, look at least I got a BANANA to slap on my head!""

The game is now implementing a Battle Pass. However the developers have seemingly tried to balance this addition out by giving free players the perks that came with purchasing the title. I'm not thrilled by the Battle Pass's inclusion, however the game is still worthwhile.

When I first started playing the Super Free Edition of SAR, I was skeptical. I don't typically like BR type games (full disclosure: it's because I am BAD at them). But I decided to try it because it was free, why not right? I was pleasantly surprised to find a lighthearted top-down BR filled with cute animals violently killing each other. It was like playing a game based on Happy Tree Friends. 

I had originally only planned on trying SAR for an hour or so, but ended up playing for five hours. I kept getting cosmetic item drops, but on the free version, those items were tied to my account but could not actually be equipped. A friend gifted me the Founder's Edition of the game, and I haven't looked back since. I highly recommend this game, especially if you don't typically like Battle Royale style games. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised!

It is a fairly new genre, and PUBG was the game that kicked it off about four years ago. When all my friends were playing that, I figured I would get it as well. It was very fun, and that is what got me into the genre. Fortnite is extremely controversial, so I will try to be avoiding that game. Apex Legends came out about 2 years ago, introducing new mechanics that had never been seen by a battle royale genre, and it has to be one of the best game's graphics wise. Most of the guns were balanced on initial release, and it is just overall better than PUBG in my opinion. Then, one day while I was scrolling through Mixer, [the now dead streaming platform I used to use], I saw a relatively new game called Super Animal Royale. It had only ten viewers, and that amount made me intrigued. I quickly looked it up on the internet to see if I could join in on this tiny community, and saw that yes, it was free! So I quickly downloaded it on Steam. This game is absolutely amazing in my opinion, because I had never seen any top down shooter before. I knew they existed, but I was not really a fan of them, and I do not have very much money. This particular game took the cake for me because it was easy to learn and hard to master. Now, a lot of people might hear that all the time and be like, well then it is not worth my time because I want it to be easy to master. But there are rewards for literally everything, so you can have fun without even being good at Super Animal Royale. This game is an absolute blast with friends too, and forming a full squad while talking about dumb things is super (haha) fun. Using discord, you can have free game invites too, which was released right when I picked it up. Buying the full game will support Pixile and their team, and give you full access to a growing number of cosmetics for guns, hats, and even facial hair. All of these must be earned though, by playing matches. As with most other battle royales there is a solo, duo, and squad mode. The game promotes finishing a squad via killing the last player rather than finishing individual people, because when you are downed in a team mode, you have 300% bleed out health. This also makes it so that it is easier to revive your teammate if they are far away and get forgotten about. Overall, it is well polished, having little to no frame drops or issues. The public Discord for SAR also takes suggestions 24/7, so if you think something can be better or revamped, you can tell the developers at any time.",1584403526,1604176170,True,1,0,0.502074658870697021,0,True,False,True

It's a top down Battle Royale you can buy for free, just don't buy the full package.
Love the game and it's style and all but it's just not worth it.

Edit: After seeing some other related stuff from these reviews; the favoritism between players in *SOLO* matches that are teaming and with mods that don't care for it because they're buddy buddy with said players AND how the weapons are just overpowered in some cases when it came to reworks of them in the past just ruins somethings, like the Shotgun and Sniper Rifle being in ones that just destroy you due to how the guns work with fire speed with jumping/rolling.

A normal Blue Rarity Shotgun can destroy you with quick speeds to that of the Auto Shotgun in the game (aka The Jag) OR The Sniper Rifle which can destroy your ENTIRE armor then 80 to 100% of your Health due to how much damage there is and abusing the rolling/jumping exploit to fire a second shot out faster than normal.

Playing a cute little fluffy animal... with GRENADES AND A MINIGUN? Being able to dress them up in ridiculous outfits?

Beats Fortnite skins anyday.

The DNA crafting system is really good, providing lots of options of what you want. And there's so many adorable animals to unlock and play.

Even Red Pandas!

It's also easier to play on older computers and the shorter matches make for a more punchy playstyle~

And it's a very decently priced game too.

A definite Must Buy and Play!

--

Edit: It's now October 2020 and they've  added even more Super Animals, Super Powerups, Giant Emu you can ride, more varied weapons...

And the 32vs32 matches are awesome.

I guess you could call this PawBG or Furtnite? It's a battle-royale game with cute animal characters. Concept-wise, it uses a venerable media motif - cute fluffy animal characters in violent situations (think Happy Tree Friends or Conker's Bad Fur Day). If you're that kind of person that's into that kind of thing, this game is for you, without question.

For an early-access game, the top-down run-n-gun design is absolutely solid, and by itself it has a MONSTER amount of potential for all kinds of team-based warfare gaming, or even its very own story mode. I can literally see the same ""system"" (for lack of better word) powering this same game to be like a 2D Battlefield-style game.

There is a wide selection of weapons, and I hope they expand on this. It's excellent fun to make a custom avatar out of the selection of custom outfits, from taunt poses to shirts to animal subtypes.

It is a very straightforward premise: Be the last man/team standing. The skunk gas shrinks the playable area of the map, forcing you to fight other players in a smaller range. In between, there are secrets strewn around the map before that gas comes along, funny little gimmicks like a live theater or a mysterious ""banana cult"".

My only real critiques so far are:

1) There's no ""tutorial mode"" (yet?), so you kind of just get thrown into the fire and learn the ropes that way. It would be nice to know the controls and get a feel for the game. Like I spent the first couple of rounds stuck figuring out how to do some commands (ie: opening chat, marking items for teammates, etc.). Perhaps make it feel like a bootcamp or something

2) You're going to have to grind hard and get good at this game to unlock a particular core species you may want as soon as you want, and that's a pain. Like I get unlocking outfits and gun skins, or even sub-types of breeds, but the core breeds themselves I don't think should be unlockables; people love to customize their characters at the onset. The same can be said for some outfit pieces; there's one in particular I really want but I'm waiting 100% on the chance of getting that piece rather than a given achievement unlock or something. Grinding is just making it annoying and I feel like I have less control of decking out my characters.

3) The game in its current state almost always boils down to a close-quarters brawling when you encounter other players, which almost nullifies the need for otherwise very cool weapons they made, like the sniper rifle or the bow-and-arrow, because you don't want to be stuck getting sprayed by a shotgun and you want to ultimately kill off the opposition as fast as possible anyway. I get that it must be very tough to do 3D-like things on a 2D display, but I feel like those weapons will not get a whole lot of love in combat, even if they are powerful.

Overall, I entirely recommend this game, and here's to hoping it just gets better and better. They intentionally put out a Free edition to see if you like it, so at least start there and see if you like the flow of the game. Then buy in.",1599278730,1599278730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The real tragedy, however, is that the people I know in real life talked me into getting this game and have long since moved on to other games. So here I am, left to join Discord servers and meet randos (mostly furries) to squad with, and spend hours upon hours with complete strangers. While I can't say I regret this, it does speak volumes to the fact that no matter how much time I spend playing, no one I know personally will ever really care. I have no Twitch stream account and no following, so even when I eventually get to level 1000, I must live with the fact that the victory will *solely* be for myself to enjoy. What's worse and even more frustrating is that no matter how much time I spend continuously on this, there will always be someone on here who's better (or at least has better equipment) than me.

Gameplay wise, the game is fairly solid, if standard for the genre. You parachute (or rather, use an umbrella, Mary Poppins style) out of a giant bird at the start of the game to deploy yourself somewhere on the map. The map gradually gets filled up with poison gas, forcing the players to ever smaller areas. This is a very fast-paced battle royale, with games lasting under ten minutes, so you don’t spend a lot of time wandering around empty space; the map is fairly large, but 64 people deploy on it and you generally engage in a number of fights before reaching the end unless you deliberately try to avoid combat – and even then, you probably will run into other people anyway.

There’s a reasonable variety of weapons, and while sometimes I’d love to see a few more, what is there does the job. You’ve got your pistols, your shotguns, your SMGs, your rifles, your assault rifles, and a few special weapons like the minigun and a poison dart gun that deals damage over time. There’s body armor you can pick up. There are lobbable grenades, which include both conventional grenades, “skunk gas” bombs which deal damage over time to anyone in the zone, as well as somewhat sillier things like banana peels that cause people to slip on them. There is a healing juice you drink to heal, and duct tape you use to fix your armor. There’s even an “accessory” item slot, though what these do is poorly explained in-game.

As with most Battle Royale games, there are five different “tiers” of these items, with the top tier ones doing more damage than the basic variety, along with three different tiers of armor. This, combined with the need to find healing items, drives the player to explore around the map and try and pick up better and better weapons and armor as the match goes on, as well as to get more equipment to heal themselves with.

The game uses a ring mechanic like many other such games; in this case, a cloud of “skunk gas” gradually creeps over the area, poisoning anyone who is inside of it, dealing them a bit of damage as long as they stay in it. The damage isn’t so fast that you can’t move around in it, but it is fast enough that it can definitely kill you – and it bypasses the armor you pick up.

The map itself has a reasonable variety of biomes in it, from tropical areas in the south to snowy/icy areas in the north. Beyond giving visual variety and giving you some idea of where you are located on the map, it also adds in a few different environmental aspects – there are coconuts you can eat in the south, while the icy areas are slippery and cause characters to slide around unless they have the right accessory. These are minor touches, but they add a little bit of charm, and make it so that games play out a little differently depending on where the map shrinks to sometimes.

There’s also a couple of “vehicles” in the game – hamster balls, which you run around in and crash into people with to deal them damage, and giant emus that you can peck at people with. These also serve as additional “health” of sorts, as they have to kill your vehicle before they can start damaging you.

The game does have some flaws, though. Perhaps the largest flaw is that some of the weapons don’t feel very good to use; in particular, the ultimate shotgun is a rather lackluster weapon, and feels like a bit of a disappointment to get due to its high spread. The fact that the game doesn’t do a great job of explaining how different various weapons are is also a bit disappointing; there is a wiki where stuff can be looked up, but when you’re in-game, if you don’t know what a particular weapon or accessory does, you have no way of looking it up cleanly.

It also only has one map, which is a little sad; while I do understand that is standard for the genre, variety is the spice of life, and I would love to see a small number of maps that cycled.

While the game is still technically in early access, it feels very feature-complete on the whole in terms of the actual core gameplay; it’s a battle royale game and it has all the features that it “needs”.

Aesthetically, the game is pretty solid; the players are all animals, and there’s a cohesive sort of look to the game overall.

Your character’s species is purely cosmetic, and over time, you unlock additional animal species like any other cosmetic; you get “DNA” after each match which counts towards a random animal, and there are consumable magnet items which “attract” a particular type of DNA, meaning that you only get that kind of animal DNA for the next three games. You get more DNA the longer you go in the game, with the most for winning, and always get a minimum amount even if you die very quickly. There’s a reasonable variety of animal species, and each of the species has a number of different palette choices, as well as more sophisticated differences, with different ears/faces/beaks/tails and the like. Almost all of the animals correspond to real world animals, though some of the palette choices are more fanciful variations. The animals pretty much all look cute, and there’s a very large number of choices in the game.

On top of this, you also get cosmetic items – clothing, face coverings (like glasses or eyepatches), hats, as well as cosmetic weapon variants that change how the weapons look while you’re carrying them (notably, they don’t change how they look on the battlefield, which is handy, as it means they always look the same). You get some of these cosmetic items periodically, and the longer you survive, the more likely you are to get them. The drop rate does feel a little bit slow, but there’s also frequently events going on that drop cosmetic items independent of the “standard” background ones, and you also get cosmetic items for achieving various in-game achievements, which vary from dancing in front of a no-dancing sign during a match to unlocking secret rooms to getting large numbers of kills with a particular type of weapon to rolling around a great deal.

Overall, this gives you a pretty solid basis to work with, and I’ve got a half dozen preset looks at the moment that all look pretty reasonable. Importantly, you can save these looks and name them, so if you want to quickly swap between them you don’t have to laboriously go in and do so.

All in all, I’ve been having a lot of fun with this game. The fast pace means that dying doesn’t feel bad, and there’s a reasonably active player base. There are separate queues for solo play, duos, and full squads, and when there’s fewer people around, bots autofill the missing slots, and they feel okay to fight against on the whole – not as good as players, but they work well enough, and can kill the players if they manage to surround them.

The gameplay is pretty simple: it’s a top-down battle royale, a formula that is executed almost perfectly. Despite the fun little additions they've made with each update, it still is a very easy to figure out, ""no-frills"" experience. Unlike other battle royales (that I have quite a number of hours in), what makes SAR stand out is its accessibility. 5 minutes in you’re winning your first frantic 1v1s. 10 minutes in and you realize that those were against bots and you just got your tail kicked by a human player. 15 minutes in and you’ve finally won your first REAL 1v1. 15.1 minutes in and someone rolled over you with a hamster ball while you were looting the cute critter you just killed.

And so on.

I’ve seen people describe other battle royales as “easy to learn, hard to master”, but the phrase is so disingenuous because it often just ignores a plethora of hidden systems or meta that all the top players study religiously. Not so with SAR, which is simple from the get-go, but constantly offers challenges to keep you on your toes.

THE GOOD:

-accessible, easy to learn
-friendly player base
-cosmetics handed out frequently
-free version so you can try it out
-constant free updates
-you get to shoot furries
-matches take only a minute to get into, and don’t last more than like… 5? 10 min? I forget. And you can hope right into another one after you die!

THE BAD:

-hardcore players may find it a bit “too simple”
-most of the players are furries (you do get to shoot them though)
-extremely overzealous chat moderation (seriously, it’s pretty cringe and tyrannical)
-small player base, which contributes heavily to my next point:
-lack of inventive modes (You won’t find any 32v32 here, sadly, as there would not be enough players to populate it AND make the matchmaking as quick as it is. How cool would that be though?)

I love this game and, despite its flaws, would love to see it get the attention it deserves. Most of the issues, including the overzealous chat moderation (it’s bad, yo), would be solved by an increase in the number of players. Give it a shot, talk to some of the players while you’re here, and you’ll quickly find that we’re a family.

Also you get to shoot people with .ttv in their name, how cool is that?

This game is just another BR title, nothing wrong with that of course, they have their own spin on things, in case you missed the beady eyed small animals it's quite different in look to ""hardened army man with gun""  but unfortunately it's unique qualities are not quite able to shine too much because of a few flaws in the game, one of the biggest of them being the fact no one plays it anymore.

You can hop into any game mode: solo, duo, squad... and there will be, at beast 10-20 ACTUAL players, everything else is filled in with bots. Slowly yet surely this game is beginning to lose steam, devs are still putting stuff out sure, hit boxes are... questionable but all this could be overlooked if the game had just a little more traffic, after facing the same user trough 5 different games you start to realize just how empty the servers really are which makes me sad; this was actually a cute looking game that tried in it's own way to break the usual mold of the BR formula, it's sad to see it slowly dry out like this.

Still recommend it over any COD or PUBG on the other hand.",1552543715,1590912129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game does not have particularly many players, so you often face a good amount of bots.

However, you can access the game for free, it takes up very little space on your computer, and is one of few indie BR games that is mac compatible, so for situations where you have a lower-end pc especially a lower-end mac user, this game is great. You can play it.

The mechanics are not complex, but they allow for skill to play a major role in victory.

The graphics are very good for what they are - a cute sort of parody to the nature of the series. The cosmetics are also very rewarding for a relatively inexpensive price.

Sometime after they opened up to a free market last year, that all seemed to change. No longer do they listen or acknowledge valid criticism or problems, so let's start from the top.

Gun Balancing: Guns have had a significant rework since the early days. Guns used to have random spread and a few other characteristics that made it a real challenge to take down your opponent. Weapons no longer have a random spread and use a recoil system. This is fine but changes the whole dynamic of the game in a bad way, or that was not prepared for. More on this later.

Shotguns are a good example. Shotgun power is over the top. Compared to any other weapon, the gun has the most amount of 'OP' attributes to it since the last major rework. Because bullet spread is no longer random, and uses a re-coil system instead, every shot is dead accurate if you jump and roll. There is no account to recoil on movement, so it is fashionable to spam jump roll and kill your opponent.

Not only this, but the shotgun can be exploited in other ways. One of the downsides of the blue shotgun is firing speed. Well, this can be negated if you spam jump. Every time you jump, you reset the reload animation to fire again. You can jump in a way that you can tap tap in less than a fraction of a second with a Logitec ""free scroll"" or scroller jump bind. This will allow you to spam shots faster than intended into your target.
 
This can be further exploited if your on an Emu or inside a hamster ball.  The lag time between the physics of the hamster ball or Emu allows the player to have an invisible shield for about 2 seconds after dismounting. I Understand players can have different pings and lag spikes, but these lag spikes happen more often than not during an emu or ball dismount.

So with this new Emu shield/Hamsterball shield, you are able to move incredibly fast into a target, dismount, and spam shotgun kill them before they have a chance to land a hit on you.

On top of that, after you dismount a hamster ball, you specifically have immunity for 1 second from all incoming fire if you're armed with a shotgun. This is a feature.

This is just one weapon out of many that need reworks. 

Netcode: Developers need to spend more time into programing the game on how to deal with ping and lag spikes. Because this game is still in early access, people from everywhere tend to play on NA or Oceanic. This is fine, however Because of the nature of speed movement and jump shooting in the game, you will run into issues quite often.

You will notice your rolling along and get murdered by a hamster ball that is visibly far away from you. But because you or the other player had a lag spike, you got ran over. Iv has seen many times were two players on the same ping still experience this. Developers sweep this issue as being a user side issue.

Surviv.io has better net code.

And this has gotten worse because of the following.

Unity 2018.4. This engine is hugely un-optimized for the scale of the project this developer is trying to pull off. Currently, they cannot give the backend really what it needs to be able to handle 64 player battle royal. 

This new game engine has introduced so many problems. And so many more people are now left unable to play due to not having 'Recommended hardware specs.' The problem is the engine is so bad that even with recommend hardware specs, you will eventually crash due to memory leaks or graphical issues. The developers don't know how to optimize the engine for what they want to do, and they spend more money on the 'art aspect' of the game then actually putting money into the core of the game.

This game would have far benefited from being completely rebuilt in the Unreal 2D engine and use the existing tools for heavily implemented Multiplayer games.

Giving away Earned items for free: This is what broke the camels back.

Because they want everyone to feel included, they are now putting items in the shop that can be easily obtained. For example, we no longer have holiday exclusives. The time spent to achieve those exclusives or clout is no longer there. Now anyone can get X,Y,Z skin without having actually to earn them on that holiday. 

Hard to obtain items like the lightsabers are now just given away for free after some users spent hours and hours to obtain them.

There's no regard to those who spent the time and felt like they were earning something before realizing it, it will just be given away for free with some promo code at some point.

Developers have totally lost reality with how collectibles should be obtained. And don't even understand how to do basic odds.

Epic Founder. I have gifted over 40 copies of this game. I don't recommend anyone play right now until developers get back on track and start working on the heart of the game instead of the looks. 

So much needs to be worked on from a technical standpoint, but they refuse to listen and will end up insulting you before acknowledging you in any way. Netcode, Dysync, Game engine so much needs to be done. But what you will see is they drowned out the technical issues with more free skins. 

Don't fall for the trap. It's a fun game, but the developers need to actually develop the game instead of slapping lipstick on a pig.

Alright, now let's get into these reasons. Like any Battle Royal, it is a fight to be the last alive. There are single, duo and 4 player squad modes. What I think separates this game from all the other battle royals out there is it's simplicity. There's no guesswork in the game. An AR needs big bullets, a pistol or SMG needs little bullets, shotgun bullets for shotguns, and so forth. The simplicity makes the game able to focus on just being a good BR. 

Visuals are always gonna be subjective, but in my opinion, the simple visuals, combined with the unique Super Animals make the game such an adorable game about killing everyone. There's so many animal puns throughout the world, and it's just so much fun to find them all. 

With new additions to the game, especially free falling, which is possibly the most adorable face plant ever in a video game, Super Animal Royal just continues to be the best Battle Royal for simple fun. Lobbies are never empty, as the lobby fills the arena with very good bots. You'll know right away if you're facing a bot, they're not super skilled, but don't underestimate them, or you're find yourself back at the main screen. 

There's no Microtransactions. I'll repeat that, nothing after the first purchase needs money. You unlock everything in this game by playing. All the Super Animals are unlocked via DNA drops, and you can use Magnets to get that specific Animal or variant. There's fun achievements in the game that also give you cosmetic items, and the variety of the cosmetics are amazing. 

All in all, if you're looking for a competitive shooter Battle Royal, this won't be for you. If you're looking for a cute, fun and simply great Battle Royal, I highly recommend this game.",1589635355,1589635355,True,7,0,0.542857170104980469,0,True,False,True

- When my friends recommended I try this game I was genuinely not turned on by the idea, but after trying it I fell in love with it. It is not competitive, and it is easy to learn and get good at and also easy to play for someone like me who isn't good at games like this.

- The free version lets you play the whole game pretty much, minus all cosmetics, and buying the whole game gives you EVERYTHING pretty much, so you don't feel like it is shoving microtransactions down your throat 24/7 like other games love to do. 

- The art style is just adorable and very polished. The map is BURSTING with personality in every corner, and you can tell a lot of love was put into this game. The music, though there is very little of it, is also boppin. All of the sound effects are very satisfying and everything wraps it up in an adorable little package of wholesomeness... if you ignore the fact you're murdering each other.

- The community is one of the kindest I have come across in an online game, which is a rare thing. People are welcoming, ready to answer questions, and most are really good sports. I love that this game is not competitive, because it lets you have more fun and really embrace what I think the game really is about... just being adorable animals and doing cute dances as you murder each other. As someone who struggles with my competitive nature, I never once felt angry from losing in this game. In fact, there were times when losing has been more fun than winning.

- the variety of animals and cosmetics is stunning for an early access game! I feel like I still have so much to work towards and I have already unlocked nearly every milestone, and leveled enough to reveal every animal. I enjoy when a game doesn't get stale too fast by running out of things to unlock or work towards achieving, and this game has done well in making unlocking each the animals a grind. I can appreciate that, as it feels like I have really earned them when I finally get to them.

CONS

- If you like competitive hardcore battle royales, this may not be the game for you. This game is definitely for casual players, and you wont find as many challenges. There are very good players in the community, but even they don't seem like they're competing for a leaderboard title.

- Replay value highly depends on what you enjoy on a game. I find it easy to keep playing over and over, but other people I know get bored quick of the same formula over and over again. The game can struggle to stay fresh unless you're working towards something like a new animal, or trying to get a certain cosmetic, or trying to level up. 

- There aren't many people playing this game currently. I am not sure how many players will be on when the game finally comes out in full release, but as of now, the most players I have seen in a game has been less than 30 out of the 64 cap. That means matches are full of bots most of the time, and you frequently reach the top 10 whether you're a well practiced player or not. Sometimes it sucks playing with just bots in hours of the day when player traffic is low.

- There is a lot in this game already, but it feels like there should be more! And that is no fault of the game, as it is still early access! I am not including this point as a complaint necessarily, simply as a notice. If you feel as though it is lacking, remember that there is likely A LOT more to come!",1589504428,1589504428,True,13,0,0.667828083038330078,0,True,False,True

I am however, not recommending this game due to a bad experience with the community in game, and the mods on discord.

I was playing SOLO games today, and people were teaming up. A group of 4 players were teaming up, not killing each other, attacking me, and helping each other win in SOLO matches. I couldn't report fast enough in the game & it was about the whole team, so I just went to the discord and wrote up the story. It took me 10 or so minutes to write it up in a very thorough and detailed manner. When I posted it in discord a mod instantly deleted my post which took me considerable time and effort to write.. in an attempt to help them with their game! Worst off, the mod and other people in the Discord ""thanked me"" by accusing me of starting a witch hunt, mocking my name in discord etc. I instantly left the discord server.

I'm sad because I was enjoying this game and have gotten into it over the last week with my girlfriend and my other friend.

Gameplay is quick, matches rarely last more than five minutes, so you can absolutely play this when time is short or you want something fun to play with minimal effort. It also means that losing doesn't feel too frustrating, you can just go again immediately without feeling like an investment has been made.

If you want to pay the meagre £10, the items you unlock (all cosmetic) are actually pretty decent. It certainly doesn't feel like a rip-off (there are also no lootboxes, so that's a plus!)

This is a top down BR game, unlike, like what, 90% of all BR games? Anyway, you know that roguelite Enter The Gungeon? Yeah, that very fun game where puns are abundant and guns are everywhere. SAR controls very similarly to EtG, in that you have a top-down view of the battlefield, can dodgeroll, aiming is literally the same in both games, yadda yadda. If you like that, you'll like this.

By the way, I have to say I don't like royale games. Except this one, apparently. SAR is really fun. 10/10 battle royale.

I love this game. I love that it's cute and I love that it gives everyone the chance to play the game for free and once you buy the game there's nothing else you need to buy for cosmetics like most battle royales! The game is adorable, the community is nice and I've made lots of friends with people in-game and streamers. The game is easy to play and easy to get into and I don't think I'll see myself not playing this game anytime soon. I went ahead and bought the founder's edition just because I think out of most games I've played this game is the one that deserves money the most. It's well developed, fun, not money hungry like most battle royales and the community is a blast!

First Battle Royale Game I've played and it's extremely easy and fun to get into. The community is also amazing and there is a Animal Royal Discord available to join.

You can download the full game for free. It gives you complete access to the gameplay with the exception of the cosmetics and most of the species; though you can still obtain the cosmetics/species in the free game...you just can't use them until you purchase. The perfect try before you buy approach. 

There are a lot of different species and outfits to obtain and they have a different event each month it seems. 

I love that you can do things like run people over with a hamster ball or attack them with a bird, in addition to the shooting, sword fighting and grenade throwing that you see in most games like this.

The game is very easy to grasp and even if you're not a fan of battle royale type games, this one is just simple and cute enough to help you forget that you're playing one!

The controls are quite simple, and while there's no in-depth tutorial, the game is simple enough for you to very quickly learn most things in a few games. The player base is not very large though, and you're likely to find yourself in lobbies with a lot of bots. This also means that of the 64 players in a given match, you're very likely to run into the same 3-4 players, which means the guy that won the last 3 matches, is likely going to win again because he has more play time.

The game's discord is open to the public, and the devs are very open to feedback, as well as announcing new things every other week, so there's always something to look forward to. The community themselves are a mixed bag but tend to be incredibly friendly for the most part, which is always a bonus.

If you like cute aesthetics, wacky, goofy gameplay, and don't mind coming second to the same one dude all the time, then I'd recommend giving the game a try!",1587349743,1587349743,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Graphics:
The graphics is simple and clean. The style is very adorable and suit everyone. I cannot say it is magnificent but overall it is very pleasure looking.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is fast and fun. And it is very easy to handle. Players like me can have a fun game. The system is not complicated, unlike other battle royale games, which you need to use skills and a lot of other complicated systems etc. Happy game with friends.

Optimization:
This kind of game is very difficult to have low fps. I can play on a 20 years old pc... Maybe? Very smooth and no stuttering.

You can also dress up the characters too, like giving them hats, clothes, etc, but if you're playing the free version, you're in bad luck, cuz they will be locked out until you purchase the game, but the game experience is still the same.

The game is not as serious as PUBG of course, but still can be a challenge, because it's a top down shooter, that means you have to have 360 degree awareness at all times. Guns have Fortnite-like tiers, from common to legendary (which only obtainable in the box randomly left by a mole), the differences between them I think it's only the increased damage, although I hope the guns can be modified somehow in the future, that'd be cooler, like putting attachments on them, or just guns having random perks like fast reload, increased range etc.

What I'd love to have in the game in the future is a practice mode that has firing range that we can use at leisure instead of when we're waiting for the match, and maybe a deathmatch mode as well because the firefight is actually fun in my opinion.

I highly reccomend this game because the game has potential, it's great enough in its current state, but the latency needs a lot of fixing, that's the only thing that's detracting the experience.

Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. 
I saw a friend playing this on stream, and decided to give it a try myself. The art style and animal characters drew me in, as I do tend to be a sucker for those types of things. I'm not a battle royale type of person, I strongly dislike them in most cases. But this one, it kept me.I played about two rounds of the game before I went and bought the founders edition. I found this game easy to pick up, yet difficult to be truly good at, and I'm still learning new things about it. It wasn't as tedious as other battle royale types, as the rounds hardly last more than five minutes. 
This game is also great to play with friends. It's perfectly fine without them, as you can still pair up with random others in a lobby, but seriously, try to find a friend to play the game with. There's a great discord server that's always active, so go there if you must. But really, this game is honestly so much fun with friends, whether that be helping them in duos or squads, or fighting them in solos. 

This game is really something. I'm honestly so glad that I decided to give it a try, and I hope this review will help someone pick it up as well.

I've played this for 3 hours so far and I'm shocked how fun this game is! I do have some issues with it; Not sure if these will be addressed in the future or not but I'll put them down anyways:

- Enemy players disappearing behind outdoor objects when close to them, making it hard to avoid being third-partied while healing after a fight; It's worse when you have to reload your weapon because once behind cover, you can't even see the enemy even if they're two feet behind you.
- Reload feels really awkward; I can understand it being designed the way it was, possibly to prevent spam(I assume), but I also can't really quite place my finger on why I dislike it. Possibly due to the first criticism above but maybe there are other reasons.
- This one is more a personal pet peeve of mine and doesn't really ruin the game, but I kind of wish we had a third inventory slot. Sometimes I get myself into positions where I don't really know what the best weapon is to take; Whether I feel like it'll be better for me to push with SMG, or keep distance with an AR.

Regardless though, I am really enjoying this game, and I suggest others to give it a shot before turning it away. I can understand not liking the cute-sy furry puns, those don't appeal to me either, but looking past that this is a really solid game that keeps you on your toes constantly.",1584161519,1584161519,True,13,0,0.622748017311096191,1,True,False,True

1. No massive skill gap bridging the line between casual players and hardcore sweats
2. Well balanced loot pool, you wont be running off because you couldn't find a gun in this game, no matter where you drop you will always be able to kit yourself up with a weapon and some goodies for a fight.
3. Cosmetics are EARNED not BOUGHT, this is the single best feature of this game, just by playing you unlock different cosmetics for your animal as well as earning cheese coins to buy cosmetics from the store, no loot boxes, no micro-transactions.
4. Fun community, the people you meet ingame are delightful, a sharp change from the toxic communities surrounding other games in this genre.
5. Free to play? the game is entirely free to play if you don't want cosmetics or the ability to inv your friends through steam, i don't know why the latter is included but its a thing.
6. LOAD TIMES, NO LONGER WILL YOU SIT IN YOUR PUBG LOBBY FOR 5 MINUTES WAITING FOR A GAME, IN SAR, IT IS INSTANT
7. its adorable, i don't know what else to say.

The game itself is quite basic to pick up, as it's just really a battle royale, nothing more, nothing less. 
Though the community isnt very large, you might run into familiar faces
It happend to me quite frequently, but it is large enough that you get at least two dozen players in every match you do, while the rest are auto-filled as bots, and the bots are no joke, they play like actual genuine players; though not all of them do.
It's out if 64 players btw, not 100 for whatever reason, so games typically last like 5-10 minutes, so rounds go by relatively quickly. 
Although they don't have many guns, they do have a gun for everyone so you should be alright.
The game also has a wide variety of cosmetics and animals you can unlock, so I'm sure you'll find something that'll fit your tastes.
There's no real paywall in the game besides the supporters' pass, which gives you early-access to content and a couple exclusive cosmetics and species.
If I had to point out some faults:
Since there is no currency in the game, everything must unlocked by grinding missions and experience points, and some of these missions ask for A LOT, so for some, that might be a turn off.

The game has a singular map, which can get repetitive overtime, but it is a mash up of a lotta different biomes, so it's at least a diverse map.
I don't know too much about the  game's gun balances but, it has minigun, which is dummy strong, that is frustrating to deal with.
Though, they're rare, since they only come from drops that typically happen three times a game, and they don't always drop miniguns.
I've also found that the content is a little lacking in content, but the basics are there.
Overall, I really think it's a game worth your money, even though it might be a bit small in content, it is a fresh game that is receiving updates frequently, so I'm certain far more features will be added upon updates. I've had loads of fun playing it, so I hope you'll enjoy it too if you decide to purchase it, and if you're unsure about buying it, theres always a demo you can try out!

The game itself plays very similarly to Surviv.io, but with a lot more polish and mobility that really wraps up the gameplay. While I am not quite at a high enough level to say, at first glance most guns seem fairly balanced. the M4A1-S seems a little under-performing for its high rarity, but I've had decent success from pistols to snipers to smgs to auto rifles. And yes, even shotties (which actually take some decent skill to use due to the high mobility in the game.) Gameplay-wise, you're looking at a very competent, top-down battle royale.

Cosmetic wise, it's very fair. Every game you play has a chance to drop a cosmetic, and losing the chance increases your odds of getting it next game. You also always get ""DNA"" which is used to unlock animals, and variants of those animals. There are also achievement based cosmetics. And the best part yet: You don't pay anything besides the upfront fee to buying the game for the cosmetics. 

And yes, I'm sure the animal theme might worry some people. But it only plays to make the game fun and lighthearted, while still having that air of high mechanical skill. So as a casual, or as a more competitive player, you can still have fun with the game even though there isn't currently a competitive mode.

If I haven't convinced you, just give it a shot. The ""Super Free Edition"" is the full game, but you ca't wear any cosmetics you unlock. But later down the line, you can pay for the game and use all of those cosmetics if you enjoy the game. 

Oh, and also. Just be nice. As I put it, the game doesn't currently split comp and normal game play. So you'll get anywhere from first time touching the controller, to hop-chaining legends that have mastered the art of AK/M4 gunning people down. If that bothers you, just play solo or duos.

Simple, comprehensive controls and mechanics. Relatively balanced gun system, each gun has a specific threshold of effective range so it's quite clear which gun is better in what circumstance. There's plenty of cover in the world, and the visibility system adds a lot of stealth and variety to the combat.

Adorable art, and there's no blood or anything which is nice. The world map looks great and has a lot of different area types. You unlock new cosmetics just by playing the game, there's no cash grab elements. Matches are fast, and travelling is fairly convenient.

Only criticisms really is that the lobby countdown is too long, there's no way to actually run, players really shouldn't be allowed to taunt people, and the rollsniping meta needs to be balanced.


Just a phenomenal implementation of the Battle Royale genre. It doesn't really do anything especially different, it just does the basic formula fantastically.

I like a lot that the actual game is free to play. You can even unlock all sorts of vanity items, even though you need to buy a copy to use them. But the core game itself, with 4 basic SuperAnimals, all the gameplay features, weapons ect. are 100% free.

But Super Animal Royale is one game that a lot more fun than other BR games I've played, and sunk more into. From its accessible gameplay, to plenty of customization options if given the patience to go through it, Super Animal Royale is a really fun game to be made for everyone, according to the devs.

The gameplay, unlike other Battle Royale games, are a bit more simpler in design, and also plays more differently, being more of a twin-stick top down shooter instead of a third person/first person shooter. While this can be thought of as a weird design for BAs, it works surprisingly well in the game, as this made the gameplay more simpler, but also has its own quirks to make it enjoyable. Its gunplay is fairly simple, where you point and shoot, but here it has bullets that fly in varying speeds and reaches its max range, making each shots from your guns more of predicting and avoiding, making the gunplay fairly fast-paced, requiring you to be on the move. 

Because of the gunplay, a gameplay mechanic is added in to co-exist with the gunplay: dodge rolls. As quick movements are needed to avoid some bullets, a dodge roll is a good way to enable you to avoid shots as you predict where they go. While its main use is for dodging bullets when needed, another use for the rolls are also to travel at faster speeds, if you use each roll in a specific rhythm, making it an essential tool for many things. Now on the topic of being a top-down shooter, what do they do to make sure you can spot characters and items without having it be too easy to see everything? They answered this with a line-of-sight mechanic; a fairly simple way to make sure you can see everything, but still require you to keep your wits about it, as while you can see whatever you can, some angles depending on where you're standing can act as a good blind spot if you're able to position yourself really well, making the system well balanced, as you can't expect the line-of-sight to catch everything. Much like Fortnite, it has a similar system with how it handles weapons with the rarity system, where the higher tiered weapons naturally the best weapons to find, but because of the simplicity of the rarity system, where only damage/dps, range and accuracy is affected albeit slightly, it sometimes doesn't make too many changes to the outcome, but it does make it easier to down players with said high tier weapons. 

While this doesn't cover everything in the game I can find, but overall I've found the game that despite its simplicity(which it's not a bad thing by any means), it has many aspects and elements within the game to be both unique within the Battle Royale library, as well as making it both easy to play, but hard to master, and really rewarding gameplay.

- As you play you get experience and you get 'genes' to add more research to create more animals and breeds for your list, its all for fun, nothing complicated. 

There's dancing too, because of course there is. Conga line.

It's somewhat low-spec friendly as well. You can get by with a consistent 30 FPS and still get kills pretty easily. The top-down view allows you to see people coming(as long as they aren't obscured by obstacles). This makes the game less reaction-time critical.

If you're a furry, this game is likely automatically awesome because all the avatars are bidepal animals. Being a furry myself, that was a key attraction to this title. As a furry, I wish for more games with animal characters, and every time I find a new one, I almost have to try it, unless I think it looks dumb.

I really wish I could get more friends to play this game with me, and see this game gain a bigger crowd and grow. It deserves prosperity. It'd be cool to see it become available on multiple platforms. Crossplay might be too much to expect though, although I think it would be much easier for console players to compete with PC users in this game due to it's Top-Down style. Two-stick top-down shooter controls would probably work really well with this title.

If you want a competitive edge, use the bear mostly at first until you unlock darker/grayer skins for other species. I've noticed on my friend's high-end monitor, the standard orange foxes stand out brightly. Although, I don't feel like I die any more often using the fox skin than a darker skin, but I know darker/grayer colors are generally less vibrant on even the highest-end monitors, and therefore less attention-drawing.

Some of the post-progress unlockable species need to have more skins added. Some of the more basic skins have tons of options, but at the same time, perhaps not quite the options you might hope for. It's not a big deal, but it's something I think could be improved on. DEVs, try to be well-acquainted with your playerbase. Not implying you aren't, just dropping advice if it's necessary.

You can be a cat or a dog or all sorts of things, dress them up, go shooty shooty, die, re-queue, play again. I really like this.

Best part, there is no building, which was my major turn-off from Fortnight.

I just hope that there are no 'cheaters', but so far it's all been fair-and-square despite being in a shared Asia-Pacific region for me. Hackers is what kept me from ever getting into PUBG despite how good it is.

In an age where it seems every single game is attempting to do a million things, it is refreshing to see a simple game that does one thing and does it well. Given this: I recommend this game.

A few bad points:

1. The easiest way to win is not to play. This is a major gripe of mine. It is best to avoid confrontation, find level 3 armor, and stock up on your ammo and health potions. Wait until the bloodbath settles and then enter the fray. It is also best if you wait until someone is already in a fire fight and pick at them from the outside.  

I admit that I cannot think of a remedy to this negative point. I suppose its just the nature of the game. Even so, I find this tactic to be extremely boring and therefore just throw myself into the mess :). 

2. You may have heard others complaining about the hit boxes. This is a pretty big problem, I feel. The hit box extends well outside of your character sprite; However, your opponents DO have to deal with the same problem.

3. VERY few people play this game. The most I have ever seen was on a Saturday night, which was 15 (in a single game).  Typically you will have anywhere from 4-7. The rest are fairly dumb bots.  I have also been online for a few days and have come to recognize most of the common of the players. I almost always see a a few players that I recognize in each game. 

4. There are a few hackers in the game, but it isn't bad -yet. I have had a few cases where one shot destroyed my level 3 armor and killed me, while I was at full health. This was not from a close range shotgun, but an epic-level AK from across the screen.


A few good points:

1. As I mentioned in my initial summary: The game is short and sweet. It does one thing and one thing only, which I like, and it does it pretty well.

2. Cute graphics.

Highly recommended.

Very quick to learn. Very fun to play. The simple mechanics lend to the skill-ceiling being mostly strategic. Ass a clumsy old fuck, I appreciate this greatly. It's a breath of fresh air to play a multiplayer shooter with a little bit of actual color, and be able to see the player who has killed me, sometimes, even before I die!
The art is great. Consistent, but varied. Colorful and cute, but not hypersaturated. The sounds are simple and descriptive. 
There's a ton of avatar customization options. They're random drop, but there's no way to pay or trade for them, nor any ""loot crate"" style mechanics, so there's actually some individual variety in style, and no bullshit simulated ""economy"" to wreck it all and remove the fun in getting a good drop. For the base-level ""skins"" you can use a resource called ""magnets"" to much more quickly and reliably get exactly what you're aiming for, provided you put in the time, which, I must emphasize, is greatly reduced with ""magnets."" No grinding for days and days unless you want something VERY specific.

The game was slightly overpriced, in my personal, broke-ass opinion, but I still bought it, and I don't regret it for even a second. By purchasing the game, you gain access to skins, and cosmetics, and that's it. You can play the game, with no disadvantage, for free, for as long as the game exists.
There's no deception here, and I think that's worth supporting, on it's own.

If I started to get shot most of the time I wouldn't know from where, and would take cover only for it to be perfectly visible to my opponents.

I know who shot me, and from where. Does that mean that there isn't a stealth mechanic? not at all. Their Idea for fog of war works rather nicely. For example.

Well, in this game, I seldom ever find that frustrated feeling. Games go incredibly fast, gunplay is smooth (except the sniper rifle, screw you sniper rifle.), and perhaps most importantly, the fashion is top notch. There's constant updates to add new animals, emotes, guns, and cosmetics!

The style is adorable, the community is completely furry-friendly, and Super Animal Royale holds a charm that I don't see in any other battle royale game. It's even more fun to play with friends! The chat and player behavior is quite closely and fairly moderated, and I've witnessed players spouting rude/racist/bigoted remarks be banned within minutes of being reported. They quite literally vanished from the game!

I will say, despite the community looking cute and fun on the outside, there are occasionally some toxic/bullying players you'll find romping around the battlegrounds. Focusing and BM taunting can be a problem, and though many people say the community is friendly, just try not to screw up or say something someone might not like. You could make one person upset, and they'll tell their friends, and those people will tell their friends, and before you know, you're the focus of a witch hunt. This is amplified by the small community size.

Trust me, I know. 

Overall, I recommend this game 99 times out of 100. Incredibly fun, silly, wild, fast paced, and generally speaking, most of the community is full of fun, cuddly cuties. Get this game, you won't be disappointed. And most importantly -

Yes, it's a battle royale, but there's no building, and it's a top down game, so there's not a massive skill gap like in Fortnite; that is to say if I lose in this game, it's because I was bested in battle, not because my opponent built a 5-star hotel with WiFi at me then sniped me from the other end of the map.

Also you unlock more skins either through random drops for cosmetics or by leveling up and creating the animals you want, no real money past the initial purchase.

The game is currently in early access and the community is fairly small but very active and supportive. The developers are also extremely active and constantly update and improve the game and listen to feedback and provide new challenges and cosmetics. 

The game currently only has one map and while I’d love to see more maps in the future, I think the map is very diverse and gives possibility for many tactical drop points. 

SAR is available for free but you will not be able to equip any cosmetics you unlock, and you also cannot play with friends unless you do it through discord. 

The “Founders Edition” includes a few exclusive cosmetics and I’d only recommend it if you wanna support the developers imo. 

There are three different modes you can choose from: Solo, Duos, Squad. Solo being fairly self explanatory, Duos for you and a friend, Squad for you and three other friends.

Finally I’d like to praise what really sold me on the game, the artstyle. SAR has a very cute, simplistic and consistent artstyle that roars with expression. There are so many animals and breeds to pick from. There’s a lot of animal puns and many different cute sounds and animations. I really love the artstyle and I am always looking forward to unlock a new breed and see what they look like in the battlefield in different cosmetics.

This GORGEOUS little game has had me hooked for well over 500 hours of gameplay thus far, and its still only in early access.
It is every bit as adorable as the trailer would lead you to believe, and the game itself has been highly updated, the devs are VERY passionate and update the game highly regularly, and the game seldom seems to encounter many crashes of downtime.

The REAL gem though, the reason that keeps me playing this game more than the game itself, is the SUPER amazing community that the devs have carefully constructed. By keeping the game strictly PG rated, and enforcing good conduct both in game an in their discord server (which is VERY active), They have managed to cultivate a caring, supporting NONTOXIC community, which is SUPER rare to find in general, let alone in a BR Genre.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

This is different. S.A.R is an absolutely amazing, yet simple game. It's like a parody that somehow outclasses the originals in every way. The gameplay is fun with a low skill floor and fairly high skill ceiling. Even losing match after match, I still find myself coming back, because win or not, the gameplay at it's core is balanced and polished to a degree I've rarely ever seen in games, it's so enjoyable and perfect for such a simple little game. 

Not to mention it's charm, the game's artstyle is simple in a great way, everything looks relatively fresh and it's both eye catching and appealing without dragging your attention away from playing the game itself. The map is RIDDLED with little details you can spot mid-game and every one of the animals, whether you like them or not, is adorable. 

Now one thing I will mention: If you genuinely hate furries, and have something against them, I wouldn't recommend this. This game draws them in like it's a safe haven, a majority of players you meet will be furs, and they make up a huge part of the community. That being said, this is one of if not the most pleasant, wholesome, genuinely nice and fun communities I have EVER seen in a game. Nobody is toxic, everybody is nice, and everybody is there to have fun.

Finally I'm going to add and say that the devs themselves are great. The game gets updated every few weeks or so with new content always flowing in, they're good, and active, and they care for the community.

TL;DR: It's REALLY damn good, nothing in the game costs money after initial purchase, constant updates, good community, GO BUY. NOW. WILL NOT REGRET. VERY WORTH.

The general nature and context of the game gives it a laid back experience and playing it with friends or solo is great.  The community is very supportive, silly, and just awesome in my personal opinion.  The devs are great as well, always saying what is coming up or hinting at it in their discord and twitter, and just seem to be really cool people as well.  The best part about this game to me is that if you want to try out this game for free, you can!  The only 2 things they lock off from you are the cosmetics and lobying with your friends.  The no lobying with your friends does suck, but it doesn't stop you from playing Duos and Squads still so the base price of 13$ is fair to me.  But that 13$ also is worth it for the cosmetics.  You have all kinds of breeds of animals, like Raccoons, Foxes, Wolves, Hawks, Cows, Pigs, and so on.  And there are tons of cosmetic outfits, hats, glasses, and melee weapons that you can wear to make yourself feel original.  13$ is a completely fair price for this game, as none of the cosmetics are pay-to-get like other Battle Royale games.  Just play the game naturally, complete dailies, and last as long as you can and you'll get the DNA to create the critter you want to play as.  And they are always updating and adding in new breeds of animals (most recent one as of posting this review were the Jaguars).

In short, this game is super fun, download it for free and try it out and if you like it, throw 13$ at the devs for making a battle royale game that is super fun, enjoyable, and has a community that is super awesome as well.",1574855353,1574855353,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Animals. With guns. With many species to choose from, with their own various alternate versions, the variety of weaponry and all the cosmetic options you can choose from to make your own character be really yours! 

Fueled by a friendly community that is very wholesome and welcoming, and not only that, but also playful! With developers listening to the community and putting love into their creation, and that love is given back by all of the players of the game.

Currently at an early stage, but sure is very promising!

10/10 but hopefully non-furries eventually play this game

EDIT: So, after 300 hours, I got one major issue with this game and i wrote all this text cause of it. 

TL;DR: separating the game into ""super free edition"" and a purchased version alienates f2p users, confuses prospective players, and ultimately slows the growth of the userbase. i know thats a mouthful but ima go through it lol.

-being f2p sucks. you can't queue up with friends through steam, only through discord. this means that even if just ONE of your friends doesnt have the full version, ya gotta all leave your steam lobby and create a new discord lobby and invite your friend that way... which is buggy. half the time the person can't see the invite on discord, you gotta switch the lobby host around and it's really just a pain (I just started buying people the game cause its ridiculous).

-so far, ive gotten about 15 people to try out this game, and roughly half of them have gotten confused when I told them it was free. And if you look at the store page, first thing they see is that it costs $12.99. then, they see that theres only a demo of the game. after that, when they open the demo to try out the game, they see “BUY THE FULL VERSION!” all over. not a great first impression.

I asked a SAR mod about this, and they said the purpose of separating versions like that is that F2P games get less exposure on steam… but is steam’s purpose to market your game? I think that’s where the community, youtube, and streaming come in… which brings me to my next point.

recently, ive been playing many games where there are only about 8 people in the game. 8 real people, and 56 bots. even on peak hours, just 25-30 people. I think its important to note, usually most of the people wearing cosmetics. Barely any F2P’s… the newbies that might actually BUY the game.

as of now, I think the community isn’t growing as fast as it should be… even if the game is only a year old, and even considering it’s still in early access. In the past, decent-sized youtubers and streamers (and even deadmau5!)... have brought new traffic, but we’re still out here playin in smaller lobbies than the week before.

I think this is where I restate my thesis. Frankly, I think seperating the two editions is stunting the growth of this game. Yes, I think F2P should get steam lobby invites, the base level gray cosmetics, and more animal customizations, cause unlike 3d battle royales, you gotta look at your guy a LOT. Yes, I think pixile is using a business model from 10 years ago. Yes, I really like this game and I just want it to do well. 
Anyway, there’s my 3-point essay. Just had to get that off my chest. Forgot the hook tho. Its whatever.

I honestly don't know where to start.  Battle Royales seem to be everywhere and yet this one grabbed me and pulled me right into its big, fuzzy embrace.

As advertised, it's a top down battle royale.  Larger objects, such as trees or big rocks, can block your line of sight and create a ""Shadow of war"" effect on the side you can't see.  If anyone is moving around there, you won't know.  This makes one of the biggest problems I have with most royale games, very trivial:  Vision cones.

Let me explain.  In a normal battle royale, you're in first person.  You only have a field of view in a cone in front of you.  But in THIS game, you have vision all around you.  Enemies can still get the drop on you by appearing out from the shadow of war, but if they move out into the open, you see them.  And they see you.  There is only ONE situation where an enemy can see you, but you can't see them.

Firing a weapon won't reveal your character, but if someone were say, behind a wall, they would see where the muzzle flashes were coming from.  So if you were engaged in a firefight, but another hostile was hiding nearby with something blocking their sight, they could still see the muzzle flashes.  This isn't [i]perfect[/i] as you could simply move away, but it does give them a small edge.

There's not a ton to the game, but what is here is very enjoyable and easy to pick up.  You can play as a variety of different ""Super Animals"", but gameplay wise, it's all for looks.  My only complaints are against the Sniper Rifle and the somewhat low drop rate of items.  All the items are cosmetic and are for dress up or to add a splash of color to your weapon.  Or to dance differently.  As for the sniper rifle, I'm not quite happy with how it rips off all your armor and, at almost any range, nearly all of your health if you don't have armor to block the shot.  I've run into a few players who simply shoot, dodge to a new spot, then shoot again, tearing opponents apart without suffering much return fire.  I know it takes a bit of skill to perform that, but it's still frustrating to run into.  

Also, as a side note, you can [i]not[/i] take health and armor damage at the same time from gunfire, so even if you have ONE point of armor, said sniper round will only destroy that, and not your health.  Explosions, however, do deal health and armor damage and can quickly tear you apart.  Getting run over by a hamster ball (Yeah, that's a thing) ignores armor completely and just kills you.  Try not to get run over.  It's not fun.

Other than that, a tutorial would be a welcome addition, but I'm sure that's in the cards for later.  If any dev reads this, please make sure to note that different weapons slow your speed down when drawn, having your melee out does let you move faster, and maybe add a practice range so we can get a feel for how fast the weapons fire / bullet speed and spread.  Small things like that can be very helpful.

Last but not least, there's a free version of this game!  If you don't mind being locked out of the cosmetics or being able to party with friends (You can use Discord and a function in game though to do that), then entire rest of the game is free to play for as long as you like!  If you like it, think about buying it and supporting the developers.  And if you don't, you won't have spent any money on it.  Everyone wins.

EDIT:  11-12-19.

This is a good edit, no worries.  The drop system was changed a while back (I didn't bother to update this when it did, sorry) and in a good way.  You now have a bar that starts at 0% for your drop rate.  Every time you finish a match (Weather by winning or just playing), the bar will fill.  Surviving a match longer fills it quicker.  Your drop rate chance bar will continue to fill until you finally get a drop.  It doesn't have to reach 100% chance.  You could find something at 15% chance.  The point is, each game makes it more and more certain that you WILL get something.  Once you find an item, the bar resets to 0% and you start over.  So if you're above 50% and you don't get an item, you'll probably reach (if you stayed alive for most of that match) an increased drop chance of maybe 60%.  So you keep playing and what do you know, you found a thing.

Good change, making your drop rates apparent to you.  Now you're not just wondering ""Should I have gotten something by now?"" or feeling cheated.  Good on ya devs.",1560190745,1573589797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[b]Original review:[/b]

Dead game.. stay with the free version.


Alright, so it's fun for the first day. Then you realize 95% of players are just bots, and every match is exactly the same. The game isn't completely abandoned, but the playerbase is so small that you'll always play against the same few people (and bots).

To make it more clear, you usually end up in a match with 4 - 6 people (15 on weekend if you are very lucky) and 60+ bots.


Because of that, ""Duo"" gamemode is broken, as you mostly don't get teamed up with anyone and you're forced to play alone against teams of 2 anyway.
""Squad"" mode is completely dead, I never saw anyone even in the lobby.


The game itself  is cute, and the controls are okay (though you get stuck often), but it's just one map and very few guns, which aren't really any different (except for the poison dart gun).

And because of the small ""view"" size, every gunfight is exactly the same. You spray and pray. No tactical shots, no real usage of cover and no real ""sniper"" rifle (it feels exactly the same as the pistol, just that it does more damage).


Sadly the Devs appearantly have no intention to improve the game. Every update is just more cosmetics.. just wait until they add microtransactions.


So all in all I can not really recommend to buy the game at this stage, you won't get anything the free version has not - besides some useless cosmetics.

Stay with the free version and hopefully the Devs grasp the situation this game is in, and get their butts up to save the game from slow but certain death.",1569067825,1573419322,False,10,0,0.493545114994049072,0,True,False,True

While it just allows cosmetic things (either buy founder's for some stuff early or hope it drops, no microtransactions), I kinda think it was worth it.

The top-down nature of this game makes me actually interested to play a battle royale, and it's sweetened by the fact that you can play for free with friends using the free edition and discord parties. The breeds are actually pretty cute too along with the emotes. Community is definitely friendly (and probably mostly furries xd), and while some of the playerbase can be pretty toxic, it's pretty rare in my time playing. Even after playing around 6 hours a day in three days since I bought it, I don't feel tired of it or burnt out. Things feel fresh still.

If you're new and aren't always playing with friends, it might be best to switch regions to get some games fighting mostly bots. Especially around peak times on NA in the evening, I deal with the ping spike and play on AS or EU as you'll have <10 real players and mostly bots. Gives you a good chance to explore the map, work on achievements/milestones (if that's your thing, there's some cool unlocks with them tho) and try different guns while getting the hang of things.

Overall, even if you don't like BRs, at least give the game a shot. You might have a little fun with this.",1572896676,1572896676,True,10,0,0.599202811717987061,0,True,False,True

It's also the only battle royale game I can actually play that seems worth it. I can't play the big name ones, because lots of quick lateral 3D camera movement or FPS views make me motion sick. So SAR is the perfect fit for me to get in on the BR fun.

And. And! The free version? You can do everything gameplay-wise that the paid version does; the only exception is that you can't use vanity items nor unlock new animals. But that's pretty minor if all you want to do is play and have a good time. That being said, by all means, buy this game! Support Pixile! They're doing an amazing job!

To preface this, my usual stance on Battle Royale games is mixed while I like the idea of battle royale games on paper - the idea of grabbing what you can and holding off against a bunch of other players in an ever-enclosing arena, quite often in execution they can foster some pretty awful, toxic communities.

With SAR this is simply not the case. It has one of the most welcoming, fun communities I've seen, and the amount of love the developers put into this game is very much visible, from the designs of the animals, to the myriad cosmetic items, even as far as having a little Youtube series set in the game world to expand on its lore.

There is no pay-to-win, there are no paid lootboxes (The closest you get to paid cosmetics is the Founder's Edition package and even then, the devs straight up tell you what's contained within that package!) - The bulk of cosmetics and content are unlocked simply by playing the game, while others are tied to seasonal events. Every time you win or die in a match, you can see what your chance of unlocking a new cosmetic is - this chance increases the more matches you play without receiving a reward, and the amount of time you stay alive in a match further boosts your chances at getting something, in essence rewarding survival tactics over hunting for kills!

The game itself plays much like a twin-stick shooter, portrayed from a top-down perspective and being very focused on fast-paced run-and-gun gameplay, with matches being very quick to finish. Perhaps unique to this game as well is the potential to win a match as a pacifist - you even get a reward the first time you pull this feat off!

All in all, this game is a lot of fun, whether you're just playing a couple quick matches to kill a few minutes, or spending a few hours having a blast with a friend or three in the Duos and Squads modes, and I can't recommend it enough!",1572734474,1572734474,True,2,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True

I have played this game for 340+ and still not bored boring playing this.
This game is a much less complex BR game which casual player would love! I'm a casual player  and I think this game is very fun and less stressful compared to other shooting games.
The graphic,animation and art is nice and the music in the game is also very good!
This game is very family friendly and the community is very kind and friendly! (you will love the community including discord.

The game is still in early access. Is it worth buying? well for me it is very worth buying! the game still updates a lot and can see it is growing in player count and gameplay,mechanics and items and skins.
I would suggest you try the free version first but I am sure you will love it! Yeah the free version sync your progress to the full version game once you buy it..so don't worry about the progress you have made ;)

This game you gain new skins and items not buy in game payment but you gain it by playing the game! isn't that fun?

At first this game might be a little bit hard but once you get to hang on it..it will be much easier :D
so give it a try!!

I'll come right out and say it: I am a chicken. Battle Royales, or even just some PvP games, stress me out. As a result, when I play I tend to just hide and hope for the best...not the best game type for me to play casually - not to knock the game type, of course. This game, though, takes the Battle Royale layout and just...seems to simplify it, and wraps it all in the cutest roly-poly exterior I've ever seen.

(Like, for real, this game doesn't have any right to be as sweet as it is.)

It provides a fun, more relaxed Battle Royale experience, and while, admittedly, there doesn't seem to be a huge amount of players in lobbies yet, bots fill absent spaces, and feel like competent enough opponents to play against. There are a ton of unlockables to get as you progress, and quite honestly all the little animals make me wanna go 'squee!'

In short? GET THIS STINKIN' PRECIOUS GAME. It deserves recognition for standing out as a very unique, sweet little game amidst a sea of Battle Royales.",1572386852,1572386852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is way more than that and then some. There are so many positive things that can be said about this game by probably everyone who plays it - so we'll start with the #1 best thing about this game: The community.

The community of Super Animal Royale (SAR) is probably the least toxic community in any competitive game, period. Most members of the game speak in lobbies or in discord, and very rarely - if ever, is anything negative said. Usually people will happily answer any questions someone has or they'll direct a player to a moderator for further help. The moderators are extremely active, friendly, and helpful as well! The icing on the cake? Even the developers at Pixile who work on SAR are active both in the game and on their discord server. Everyone is so happy and friendly that it just feels like an extended family. It's a Battle Royale, yet everyone is having a wonderful time hanging out (just before the mass killings and praising of banan).

Next up is the Gameplay. The mechanics of the game are extremely simple and easy to pick up. You can traverse the island by rolling, walking, or finding a hamster ball to roll faster at the cost of sound echoing in a wider area. There are shotguns, pistols, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, miniguns, sub-machine guns, and dart guns that have varying rarities strewn along the map for players to find. Each weapon is balanced in terms of range and player handling so there is no real 'meta' as it's up to the user as opposed to a single weapon being the most over-powered. Additionally there are grenades, bananas, skunk bombs, and armor you can pick up to further enhance your offense and defense. The three throwable items have their perks as well, meaning there are so many loadout options for any scenario or preference. Otherwise it's a standard battle royale - survive, kill, and be the last animal standing.

One key feature that this game has are the Bots. Bots spawn in and help fill each lobby up to the maximum of 64 players if not enough join. They are quite easy to tell they are bots - but it's great to populate the game and help new players practice their shooting or weapon types. No matter what time you play, there should be a full lobby waiting for you.

And finally, for my favourite part - the cosmetics! There are over 200 animal breeds available for you to unlock and use to personalize as avatars. The grind for them isn't terribly bad once you understand how to survive longer. You can unlock magnets to use in an attempt to expedite the grinding for particular species - but ultimately the more you play, the more you'll have unlocked. There aren't just species to unlock, either. There are actual cosmetics you can equip yourself with that have a random chance of dropping at the end of every match. A percentage bar fills after each match, from 0%-100% as a chance for an item - so eventually you should get something and it'll restart until you get another item. Get a duplicate? You can trade up items of the same rarity to get a random item of the next tier. There are so many cosmetics available that it will surely keep you busy for quite some time!

Oh, and one more thing. There are no loot boxes. No paid-for cosmetics. No premium currencies. Once you buy the game, you have everything at your disposal with no more monetary blunders begging to be spent outside of the Founder's Edition (which supports developers and rewards goodies for supporting the game in Early Access). Not only that, but you can even try the game FOR FREE and when you buy it, you'll receive everything you earned while it was free! 

So please, give this game a shot. You can try it for free and you won't regret it! If you don't stay for the game, you'll surely stay for the community. So Praise Banan and see you on the island!",1571562733,1571562733,True,4,0,0.506889402866363525,0,True,False,True

A battle royal that's really easy to pick up and play, unlike others. Even if you are not into battle royals, I highly recommend you give this title a try. It does not feel like other battle royals it's more like a party game! A few things that set it apart I've listed below

it's top down, not first or third person, The vision system is nice. Obstructions and shadows can hide you. However this can also hide your enemies
No instagibs from someone you can't see! If they can see you. You can see them.
The matches last around 4 mins at maximum, No hunting and collecting items only to suddenly die 10 minuets without warning. This is ingrained into the game. A match cannot exceed 5 minuets ever.
Even if you die it's a collect-a-thon! you collect loot when the game ends for you to unlock tons of cute critters, outfits, weapon skins. None of which give any advantage or bonus in game! Pick out the outfit that best suits you (or styles on the enemy and makes them feel terrible for losing to someone with your level of fashion sense) 

You can trial the game for free, Which means full access to the game, you can unlock skins, collect DNA get all the normal drops, and even Event drops. And now after an update you can even play with your friends!
the only limitations are:
you can't put on clothes/skins
You can't craft new animals, 


Should ya like the game, it's only 12.99$ to unlock the whole game, 
There are no Microtransactions. You buy the game you own it. This is a Premium game, not a Fremium game.
Best of all, You won't lose any progress. The game will Recognize your steam account and update it to the full game. All the loot you collected, all the Drops you've gotten. They are yours to keep. As far as I can tell the only thing that does not transfer over is the Time played listed on steam.

Most matches are done in about 10 minutes, and the game does use bots to avoid having to wait in the lobby forever. This means that if there is a player that scares or harasses you, you can easily avoid them and get into a different match. The bots can be a nightmare, and they tend to swarm, which is good practice when the player base is light for newer players to the battle royale format. Like all royale games, this all can get quite boring after awhile, but the various play styles and unique ways of trying to win keep the game entertaining. You could try to outlast someone and gas them, run into the gas yourself, use snipers, bananas, dive in with a full shoot-out...whatever your style, its strengths and weaknesses will be revealed if you can get to the final 5. And, given the use of bots, this means that making it into the Final Five is much more accessible to newer players than they might find in other games, which I consider a positive.

The developer is continuing to add new species and new items, some of which you can get with free redemption codes. There are very few glitches that I have seen, and this game deserves all of the support regardless of how many players might be on at any given time. There are also plenty of player versus environment missions for items and other upgrades that allow you to just do your own thing, if you want to. All of these style accommodations come together in a tight, efficient way.

The main criticism that I have is that the species that you might want to become may be easy to acquire in a few hours, or it might take a few weeks, and that can be frustrating as the level up system rewards time in the game above all else, while kills do still matter. If you want to be a rat or mouse, you have good taste, and you will acquire that species quickly. But others, well, you might be in for a long ride of frustrating disappointment. A better system would be to pay $5 to instantly unlock a single species (base-level), and that would help to financially support the game without giving the player any other advantage, or make them grind for something that they may never achieve due to losing interest/motivation.

It would also be nice if there was a choice for when you trade up common items to the more elite tier, as many of the yellow and purple items that have appeared were super disappointing and did not match my personality at all (for example, female items if you wanted male items instead, or vice versa). I also hate the sniper rifle, but in a way, it is the great equalizer if you can handle it. It allows you a shot to win even if you don't have good armor or other weapons available to you.

I'm not a fan of the new missions system because you can only re-roll one mission a day for powerups that help you unlock more species/colors. They seem to come in waves, where I get a bunch of group mode missions that I will never do because I find solo more appealing. It would be nice if, when you re-roll a mission that you don't like, you had some kind of choice as to which game mode the replacement would be for. The developer should be able to easily implement this, as the mission versus the reward for accomplishing it seem to be randomly combined.",1570181583,1570183433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

On the topic of keybinds, I was able to figure out how to play the game very easily, and after one match I already knew what I was doing. 

The playerbase is pretty friendly, and it's very likely that you will join a game with devs and mods. I have 1.6h on the game and I have seen a mod in like 90% of the games I played.

Game play is easy to learn and simple to get a hang of. If you've played games like Hotline Miami 2 then just think as if playing the fan levels and only playing as Corey its kinda like that but you don't die in 1 hit.

Guns in this game are pretty simple some better than others but they feel great to use and help get on top of the food chain! Some that are kinda trash tho and you should never use *cough*pistol*cough*

Where Super Animal Royale really shines is its looks and charm. The super animals all look cute, some of the cosmetics are neat and the drop system is very fair and best of all NO MONEY REQUIRED TO BUY THESE LOOT DROPS!

Music I cant really say too much but its pretty great if you go listen to the soundtrack even if 4 out of the 10 songs in the soundtrack are 3 min loops of the emotes they are all really nice to listen to every once in a while.

Sound design in the game is pretty great while on the battlefield you hear everything you need to hear from footsteps, super animals jumping and rolling around, gunfire, and even stuff that happens around your environment.

As of now the devs are doing an amazing job keeping this game fun and alive with new super animals, events, and the Super Animal Royale Tonight events are always something I love to watch and legit so much love and care gets put into them with the funny little gags they do and voices they give the super animals. (quick run down about Super Animal Royale Tonight every once in a while devs will ask players to send in clips to show in a little show and who ever they pick to be in the player and teammates in the clip get their pick of neat little cosmetic items)

My only complaints about the game are just there is no voice chat, bots are kinda dumb but they do their job(yes game has bots to fill in slots so players dont have to sit around forever, like I said before this game has a very small playerbase) BUT devs are improving the bots to not be well dumb as a banan, and honestly not really a major complaint but more guns would be nice.

OVERALL Super Animal Royale is a really great game, get along some animal friends or whatever and have a blast! PLUS ITS FREE well unless you wanna buy the game which you should do if you want to wear cosmetics and unlock more super animals.

this is one of the more balanced and fair games that span the BR genre,matches of 64 players, balanced weapons, and extreme polish to prevent any sort of system cheating. more updates keep the game fresh and super cute animals and cosmetics are a very welcome addition. it's fun to pick up and play a few rounds with some friends or even by yourself.

Twin stick battle royale with furries. Weirdly enough, it's also my preferred battle royale game. I could be playing Fortnite, PUBG, or even Apex Legends, but no. I'm playing this game. Maybe it's the ""friendly"" environment, or how I think this should've been the kind of game that's suppose to have ""crossplay"". Either way, I like it. I like it a lot.

It's also technically free to play due to how the demo works. Demo gives you all access to everything that has to do with gameplay. No play limits, no dance limits, no free limits, you can squad with pub bros, you can squad with your bros, you can kill all the furries you want!... with your furry!

You can't access the cosmetics you earn though. You can keep 'em, but you can't equip them. which makes way for the paid version.

Buying the game gives you access to achievable cosmetics along with all the cosmetics you've earned...that's it. Oh, it also feeds the developers. Pretty cool, right?


[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Drop, loot, run, kill. You know how it works. Although, ""stop, drop, and roll"", works here too actually. Mostly the ""rolling"" part but, you'll see what I mean.

It's pretty casual actually. Simple gameplay, simple mechanics. Hop in, hop out. Dive in, die out. Games usually last just around five to ten-ish minutes.

That isn't to say you can try getting competitive, though. You definitely can by mastering the Super Jump Roll mechanic. You do that and you're gonna look pretty badass rolling around killing everything.


[h1]Map:[/h1]
No details too high and no details too low. From a vandalized convention center, to an interestingly destroyed research lab, Things can both work with and against you, a rat in a prison cell will claim he is not a rat, some explosive barrels you'll slowly walk away from, some little hidden secrets you might unintentionally find, while at the same time some very interesting details of lore you can glance at for a bit, and then move on before the skunk gas comes out to get ya. The Super Animal Island can never always feel the same.


[h1]Updates:[/h1]
Game updates pretty regularly actually. Mostly cosmetics and bugfixes, but they also drop some bonuses here and there. They also do balancing of course and most recently they dropped a few Tunnels into the map. It made a pretty cool hotspot to drop in and at the same time, made a really good scene for their show. Check out the patch notes yourself and you may find some bonuses you can type into the redeem code.

Events will also appear every once in a while. Their basically pseudo season passes for exclusive cosmetics.


[h1]Playercount:[/h1]
Before official squad release, playercount was low. Close to dead low. Only got a little busy whenever the squad feature wired in. But now that squad's permanent, player counts increased from all modes and game no longer feels dead. You can go solo, duo, squado and you'll always find peeps to play with. You can also go to the game's official Discord channel and find peeps there.

Game also fills up the lobbies with bots so you don't always have to wait around too long in case of player shortage.


[h1]Playerbase:[/h1]
Since it's a very friendly game with a very friendly monetization, it is only natural that the very playerbase it gathers together is VERY... toxic... toxicly friendly. Like fam, you can join in a random squad and never say anything to them and they're going to play like as if you are friends with them. It's rather heartwarming, you could say. You can even just dance around the lobby and in mere seconds you'll have some random dudes joining in with you. It's very friendly I tell you. [spoiler]Then again, it's probably just the mods doing something suspicious. HHhmmMm.[/spoiler]


[h1]Controller Support:[/h1]
The tag doesn't lie. The game has legit FULL controller support. Whether you be a keyboard warrior or a console hippie, plug it all in, and play the way you want! 

Aiming accurately is a bit hard for me, but I don't mind. The challenge though is the snipers, just seeing an enemy holding one sends shivers down my spine. It gets scarier when the sniper's deadeye accurate. *shivers*


[h1]Progression:[/h1]
C O S M E T I C S... Progressing...gives you... C O S M E T I C S...that's all.

Every five levels give you more Super Animals to unlock using their specified Animal DNA. Max level is 30. Upon unlocking a Super Animal, you can still gain more DNAs for it to unlock more of it's variants.

Only the specific Animal DNAs your level has access to will drop to you. You get them every time you finish your games. You can also use DNA Magnets if you only want a specific DNA to drop for the Super Animal you want. DNA Magnets can drop upon finishing games and can also appear as a reward for the daily missions.

You can have up to three active daily missions depending on how long you were away.

Also, clothes and weapon skins can also drop for you everytime you finish a game. There's also this Mole Crate guy who will give you a percentage chance which increases depending on how long you survived in your game. Additionally, if he doesn't get you anything for that game, then the percentage will add into your next game, increasing your chances until you finally get something out of him. Similar to Rainbow Six: Siege's alpha packs system.


and finally...


[h1]C O S M E T I C S:[/h1]
From a naked bear coming out to knife you, to a sniper wielding stylish husky rolling out to snipe the glowing loot out of you. Whether you want to dress up as an officer wielding a ""No Dancing"" sign, or be a pretty little birdy holding a freaking minigun. Maybe even be an innocent looking red panda with sheer [i]intentions[/i] , or a colorful looking raccoon with a bandana.

Whatever it may be, whichever it may be, the Super Animal Royale has all the things you can find to dress up into the adorable monstrous animal you terrifyingly have always  wanted to be!


[h1]So there you go![/h1]
The Super Animal Royale in a nutshell. A really cool game for really cool gamers.

What? Still not interested? Not even gonna try it?! Ugh fine, here...

[h1]You can kill enemies using a banana for a sword[/h1]
So what are you waiting for? Go! Play it! Try it!

The game still plays out like other more popular BRs, you start off in an aircraft, a giant eagle in this case, and then you decide to jump out when you feel the time is right before landing to grab weapons, armor and items, there's also no inventory management like in PUBG or other games however, instead you just pick up/swap weapons you find and the same goes for grenades too, if you don't have any in your inventory, there are no weapon attachments either to worry about.
Also, the only way to heal yourself is by finding Health Juice bottles of different sizes that can fill up a bottle you're carrying up to 200, there's also duct tape which you use to repair armor that's either broken or damaged, but it generally is best to try and save the tape for later on by swapping out broken armor for new ones you might find.

· More servers (At least 1 on Latin America)
· A tutorial and practice mode, both available offline, for new players to test its mechanics and plunge into online play with more confidence and skill. Also for veterans to study the map, and range and damage output of the different weapons and vehicles.
· A voice interface, at least available for duos and squad parties

input delay - sometimes just wants to make a keyboard give input delay, no matter settings, servers, and yes, its limited to this game only, not happening on other games or on the system.

the lag is real - when im high ping playing with my friends overseas, ill roll and still get hit by a bullet from 5 feet around a corner thats only now just reached it, i dont fully blame the devs, desync happens and not much to do about it. but thats alot of desync yo (tested with dancing, im in sync my client but they not on their client, bullets, recordings, etc)

NPCs and/or sussy chars - ill notice a player (might be an npc, i dont know) who'l snap me in an instant, and no matter the cover, movement, rolling, randomizing, they're ALWAYS aiming to where im going with perfect timing to the bullet... now i understand and know people can be good, but you cant fully predict a human, unless ofc its an NPC, then i might aswell play Escape From Tarkov and their aimbot scavs.

Otherwise, its a great fun, Quick-to-drop-in game!! even better with friends!!! Yes, ill be playing this for youtube, but i would really like for these bugs to be fixed :D

Discord matchmaking is a little unreliable compared to steam. Additionally wait times are sometimes a minute plus or less than 10 seconds. If they trimmed the wait times it would help but I also think that might be an issue with how many available players there are at a time.

I paid $10 or so for the ""actual"" game and I don't regret spending it. That said, for a BR game it feels rather bare-bones still. I also feel that by the time it comes out of EA, the Battle Royale scene will probably be dead or be on it's last legs. As it stands, the game is enjoyable in short-bursts.

A few issues I have with the game:

- It's quite literally down to ""who can get the best weapons first/who knows what weapons are best in a scenario"". While the AAA BRs each have their own twist on how you can turn the tide of battle or what not...SAR is simply ""did you get this gun first? Ok you win,"" basically. Sure, there are some times where someone with an uncommon sniper will outplay with a M16 or what-not, but it isn't as common. 

- Leveling is painfully slow as is really getting new things. I get the point is to give a grind so people don't get everything they want and then leave, but after a little more than sixteen hours of play...I've been wearing the same stuff with the same animal for like the past ten hours. It feels like it takes way too long to get a ""new"" unlock.

When it comes to the good parts though, the game is rather simple. You don't have to worry about meta, or what not. It's a really simple ""pick up and play"". As such, it's easy to get rather decent at it and while you won't win every game you'll probably end up in the top five pretty commonly if you play a decent amount.

The general look is really nice. It has a cutesy, cartoony feel while at the same time clearly not being...too cartoony? The customization is pretty decent as well.

In general, while the game isn't the best BR out there it's still good for a casual run through, that lets you feel like you're actually good at a BR for once.",1564024072,1564024072,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,True

This game has consumed me for the better part of the past week since buying it. I write this review as I slowly begin to wane out of my addiction and play a bit more casually.
Read any other review for a brief description of what the game is, because I have very little to say about the gameplay (which is fun), and more so about the community.

If you took the time to look into some of the negative reviews here, you might have seen a lot of complaints about the community being full of furries. This is true. There are a lot of furries. In fact, i'd go as far to say that roughly half the current player base is furry.
There is a reason why the furry community is among the most bullied and scrutinized groups on the internet. I could go on about this all day, but i'll let you do your research yourself. What i'm getting at is, the ironic ""OwO"" here and there is fine, but when you join a lobby and are constantly greeted with something like ""OwO nice bulgie wulgie -nuzzles fur- UwU"" it gets old REAL fast.
My brief interactions with the discord also gave off the vibe that if you aren't a furry and point some of these things out, it'l probably be swept under the rug (and in my case the mods will directly remove your messages and sass you).

The only thing I can hope for is for the community to grow and dilute. 
It is so saddening to see this game be tainted by its obnoxious playerbase. The gameplay, the art, the core mechanics, they're all great. No issues with connectivity and with lag. Its already a great game in its current state. It just needs more people. A more diverse community.

Do I like this game? I really do. 

Would I recommend it to my friends? No. It pains me to say this about an otherwise amazing game, but it would be embarrassing to do so.

I hope following it's official release, it will receive the community it deserves, and not what it has now.",1563265478,1563265478,False,15,3,0.492279201745986938,0,True,False,True

The game is very quick to get into a game as it usually fills half of the 64 players with bots to make queuing short and brief. The bots are rather predictable, so it more just gives you something to do till the end when it's all real players. The gameplay follows this theme of fast and fun with a game lasting about 5 minutes with the top down view and cute animal style adding to the light cheerful feeling as you murder each other.

I quite enjoy the music as they tend to be catchy if a little bit repetitive. I can't wait to hear more if they decide to add more tracks.

The best part though is the character customization and the community which are always cheerful and chatty while waiting for a game. A common occurrence is for most of the players to start dance parties while waiting as most will have the default dance equipped. As for the character customization there's plenty of animals to choose from with at least 4 color schemes for each.

But this one makes an exception, in that Super Animal Royale isn't just a nice game to have - it can actually alleviate the sense of frustration that Battle Royales in general can cause to non-PvP oriented fellow gamers.

The graphics make it very easy to run on just about any computer that doesn't belong to the 56K age, and at the same time are pretty enough to compel you to stay. Expect animal puns - probably one of my favourite parts - like it was raining cats and dogs.
Solos and Duos are currenty available with 4-animal Squads rotating in and out of availability as the game development progresses. Gameplay is simple enough and as astraightforward as a Battle Royale can get; commands are very easy to memorise, still easy to goof up if you're not paying attention. Empty spots are eventually filled up by bots, which get progressively better the higher in level you are. Don't expect an easy ride at the top. :P

For an Early Access game, there are very few bugs (and this too was an unintentional pun in case you missed it) if any. I can't say I've ever encountered one.

I strongly recommend playing it with friends. Solo matches can be useful for building up self confidence, but group fun is where it's really at.",1562159561,1562159561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There is just so much to love about this game:

1. The top-down view is awesome.  There is much more action and much less frantic searching for snipers you can't see.  

2. Running across the map isn't tedious.  There is gear to grab, grass to cut, coconuts to eat, etc.

3. When I lose it's more funny than anything else.  It's hard to take this game too seriously, especially when you're fighting against cute critters like these.  

4. Customization in the full version is great.  Who wouldn't want to see a fox in a suit?

5. The game is not very system intensive and would likely run well on older machines.

Good thing this game focused on what usually happens to the 99 other people in a 100 person battle royale, and that's turnover time!

With the adorable character designs and easy to learn controls it didn't take me long to get hooked. What I love the most about this compared to many other BR games out there is the speed of sessions. A session doesn't often last more than about 10 minutes which means that you can start a new game almost immediately.

Another great element to this game - at the time of writing - is the community. Perhaps due to how little the cost is of losing a match, or perhaps due to the fun look and feel of the game, the community is very relaxed and kind. In almost every other game I hate playing with random people online, but in this game it has been pleasant every single time.

With all this and the regular updates this is a game I'd recommend to anyone with even a passing interest, especially as the free version allows you to play the full game and even get all the stuff to unlock cosmetics (even if you have to get a paid version to actually use them)

As a final point that makes me love this game and is completely unrelated to the quality. This is one of the very very few games where you can play as a bat, so there's that!",1562060078,1562060078,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

About the game:
The matches are short compared to any other battle royale I've seen. 8 minutes max. You can spend as low as three seconds looting in the right spots, so even if you die near the end of the match, you aren't frustrated from spending so much time looking for things.

With fast rounds comes fast gameplay. Time to kill is no more than a few seconds. This can lead to some intense firefights when squad fights squad, or you're fending off player after player in solos, and the fights are enjoyable all around.

SAR has a [i]bizarre[/i] amount of customisation, which can be obtained regardless of playing on the demo or not, even if it's only available for use on the full game. In turn though, the cosmetics are the only thing that are exclusive to the full game, which means you can play without needing to pay, but the customisation is honestly worth it.

These are all just the game's elements that I love, though.
On top of all of that, the community and the developers are, to say the least, [b]wonderful[/b] when it comes to SAR. The developers are some of the most responsive I've ever seen in any sort of game. I've reported more than one issue in my half a year of playing, and then came in next match only to see that it's been patched. It's only been five minutes! Not only this, but the developers and server moderators play alongside us daily, further showing their support and love for the community.

Speaking of the community, they are some of the most friendly people you could meet. There's an incredible lack of toxicity in this game and people are good sports about dying, even if it's from a shotgun to the face. The community discord is even more active and makes the community even more easy to meet, as well as containing information about all of the updates and the community highlight episodes that the developers make.

===

Overall, I couldn't recommend this game more. The game is amazing, the developers are amazing, and the community is amazing. You don't have to pay to play, but I'd honestly recommend buying it anyways just to support the developers if the cosmetics weren't already enough reason.

Thank you, Pixile, for this amazing game. Keep up the good work. <3",1562058984,1562058984,True,4,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True

The art style is colourful and vibrant, but very clear at the same time, you wont loose characters in the background. The world is set in a run down safari park with many different biomes and areas, and a hidden lore about the place, signs of an interesting hidden backstory and the struggle between the Super Animal World forces and the rising opposition: The Super Animal Super Resistance.

The game relies on an easy to learn shadow line of sight system and it works very well and you quickly understand it's mechanics.
Controls are simple and easy to learn, and so the only things you will need to train to improve is your aim and positioning.

This is the kind of game that's both satisfying to win and almost impossible to get mad at when you lose because it's just too adorable and silly. The top-down perspective and cartoonish graphics give it a unique charm while also making it accessible to those with less-powerful computers. I played it on my friend's old laptop for weeks with no trouble.

Each match contains 64 people and lasts roughly 10 minutes. The player base is sizable, so you can always count on at least a few real opponents. Even if there aren't enough players online to fill a match, the game automatically fills the empty slots with bots that scale in difficulty based on the level of the player they're fighting. Predictable and pretty much harmless when you're still learning the ropes, but they pretty well simulate a slightly-below-average player at their most difficult. You can also play in Solo, Duos (2-player teams), or Squads (4-player teams).

The free version has no restrictions on gameplay or modes, though you can't access cosmetics or Steam lobbies (teaming up with Steam friends; Discord lobbies are still usable). In the paid version, there's no shortage of cosmetics and customization options. No loot boxes, microtransactions, or pay-to-win mechanics; just plain old randomized loot drops after each match, including clothing, emotes, death animations, weapon skins, and more. If you don't like your loot, you can trade in five items of equal rarity for a single random item at the next tier (e.g. 5 Rare items for a random Epic item), so you can always look your best.

Whether you're a fan of typical battle royale games or not, SAR is a blast to play and a great way to kill time.",1561883352,1561883352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Turns out creating a theme park based around animals capable of intelligence ultimately lead to a revolt, who could have predicted? Abandoning the island, the creators left all the tools to create more anthropomorphs in the hands of the rowdy mob, which was of course immediately utilized. Realized the problem, humanity cordoned off the island and set into motion a plan to drown the location in toxic gas- but unwilling to lose everything the creators came up with a plan- they would let it be known ahead of time that the island would soon be scoured of life- but also let it be known that should all the beasts but one be exterminated, then the survivor shall be granted continued existence. In the face of annihilation, the animals came to a conclusion: it is better that at least one survive than all die- but the question of who would be the survivor was a heavy one. Ultimately, it was agreed that survival of the fittest would be the ultimate decider- the only fair and consistent force in a world that they never had a part in- and so they scattered across the island, gathering the abandoned armors and weapons left by the dismantled Super Animal World security, and turned on each other- and so the Super Animal Royale begun.

The game--and the community built around it--touts itself as being ""family friendly"", but how true can that be when your task is literally to kill other animals for the amusement of humans?
There's also the issue of the community being -too- positive, slapping down criticisms that may be considered ""too harsh"" despite not necessarily being anything of the sort. If you're a regular, ""you can do no wrong"" is the attitude you get.

Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is solid, and the developers are generally quick to fix broken things, but the conflict of interest involved in combining ""family friendly"" and ""kill all opponents"" is a serious problem that merits a change before I can consider recommending this to anyone.
Still, if you want to play a competitive game about killing furry critters--and some less-than-furry critters--then give it a go.

The controls are smooth, and accessible for any skill level, but difficult to master. Unlockable customization is the only progression system currently, which is fine because the game play hook is so satisfying. The design of the game is very charming and humorous, and the animation is crisp.

Cons: Not a lot of game play diversity yet, which means the longevity of this game could be questionable once the game play loop gets old. No 4 + person team play yet, but that will come, so I won't consider that a con at this point. Milestones (and their unlockables) are pretty much only based on how much you play the game, making achievements more reflective of how much time you put in rather than based on difficult performance based achievements. 

This game lives in a surprisingly fun niche of the battle royale genre, which I was very bored of until I played this game.

This game adds to the battle royale genre by providing us with cute cuddly animals that can eb equipped with a variety of weapons. The weapons vary from a pistol all the way to a banana peel you can throw on the ground and pretty much everything in between. This gamer even features a giant hamster ball you can climb into a viciously run over your enemies with. The game also features a duo and squad mode, so you don’t just have to play solo if you want. Currently, the squad mode is disabled, but it should be back up shortly. Grab some friends and share in the cuteness of the game. The game is free to play with a $12 option available which provides some customization options. I originally had the free version and recently updated to the paid version. 
My first time playing I got fifth place. After playing a few matches I can say that this game does have plenty of violence, so don’t go letting its cuteness fool you. 
The game doesn’t have a very large user base, so it does take a bit to load it. With that said, it hasn’t taken longer than a couple of minutes for me. If there isn’t a full lobby of people, it will add some bots in the mix. Therefore, there will always be plenty of victims for you to kill. Even if the lobby isn’t full of humans the AI bots do still make it an enjoyable time. 
I haven’t spent a lot of time with Super Animal Royale and the time I’ve have as been great. I normally play a few sessions and get off. It isn’t a game I would play for a long duration at a time. I guarantee this will be a game I’ll come back to. The 2D world and the cuteness and style of the world makes it pretty enjoyable for me. Whether you buy it or download it for free you’ll get plenty of enjoyment out of it. This is an easy recommendation to make.

Being sprite-based means that even my potato laptop can run it fairly well, unlike Fortnite and other 3D games in the genre. The weapons are all fun and satisfying, with the exception of the hamster ball. It's a clever idea; you can crawl inside it to move faster and to mow down opponents, but you can't shoot from inside it - except that actually hitting opponents with it doesn't seem to ""count"" most of the time for some reason. Also, the top-down, all-around perspective means that if you can see an enemy, they can see you - there's not really any way to sneak up on someone facing the other direction or something like that. I think it would be cool if you had a cone of sight in the direction you're aiming rather than being able to see 360° around your character, but it's probably too far along to change that at this point.

Note, I'm not to competitive with gaming as I've gotten older, so was never interested in most Battle Royale-style games, that being said, I found this game extremely fun and I can break it down into a few reasons why:


- Controls are simple and easy to pick up from the get-go. It's great for my short attention span.

- The graphics are adorable and simplistic which I love. Coming from an MMO background, I'm one of those people addicted to customization so I really like the satisfaction and opportunity to unlock equips as well as animals. 

- Adding on to the above, many games with that visual customization have cash shops or some sort of micro-transaction system. That is a huge model in the gaming industry right now that tends to create a disconnect between players and the producers as well as it makes us feel more like a market than a player-base of people. I like that the game opted out of that annoying system.

- The PG-13 guidelines set it up for having a great community. There can be pretty toxic people in the Battle Royale genre of games and adding this system really helps promote a healthy and positive player-base. It's nice and refreshing and makes for great competitive yet casual game play based on enjoying yourselves and not being the best. I am in my 20's, I pretty much ignore and don't care for salty kids turning the internet into a war-zone, but it's still nice to not have that white noise to begin with.

- Being simple within this gaming genre, matches go by pretty fast and without stress so it's rewarding to even just play one match if I've got 5-10 minutes to spare, then get back to work or whatever else I was doing.


Those are a few thoughts I have on it lately. Again, I'm not a heavy gamer as I was when I was younger and I usually try to find something to enjoy about everything. However this game has the ability to keep my terrible attention span entertained as well as create a chill and positive experience. In addition, it's also important to me to support other indie devs in the gaming community so that compelled me to write a review even more when I usually don't. Great job, guys!

I never got into BRs long boring matchs with a few seconds of all out carnage, this one however is a blast.

Suggestions - user generated music(not sure how big the music files) which is streamed to other players while waiting for match, perhaps the ability to play musical instruments like LOTR online so people could make music in groups.  This game has live streaming written all over it, Twitch interactive gameplay More social features, more streaming features.  Matches are actually fun to watch because they are easy to understand, unlike more popular games which if you dont play fornight, you dont watch people play it, it looks complicated and the building stuff on the fly looks stupid. Not all of us touched minecraft, that building mechanism is silly stay away from it please in this game.  Need more character taunts, like in game snarls, sniffs, farts, burps,poop maybe a mechanic to fart out swamp gas for a chemical surprise.  Animals are funny and nasty.  More traps, expand on bananas(bear traps big spikes clamp that slows character for 2-3 seconds while applying a small DOT effect, expand on grenades, mortars, RPGs-very rare.

POOP mechanism - 1 once per game character can drop a poop, if another animal steps in it then they become more visible or tracked on the mini-map - something like that.  Maybe even a peskie micro DOT thats really really slow but doesnt go away until you get in water. Maybe have a green stink trailing off of character - Animals POOP everywhere, some even sling it others.  Gotta get poop in the game ASAP.  You can sling your own poop a short distant as well.

It's incredibly cutesy, with a lot of detail on the game's aesthetic being brought out in the presentation. The characters make cute noises, most everything has a satisfying and appropriate sound, and there's a variety of cosmetics. Hell, slipping on a banana peel is both hilarious and adorable, though you'll probably die in a serious gunfight if it happens.

The game feels pretty damn balanced, all things considered. Maybe we die sliiightly too quickly in some cases, but I don't feel like weapons are unbalanced. You are, however, at a massive disadvantage if you don't get body armour, but generally everything is pretty plentiful, and as long as I have some kind of gun in my hand with a level 1 vest I don't feel doomed.

The most interesting feature of this game is the totality of balance foresight. The game features a line of sight system that helps balance all parts of combat, especially in close quarters, and minimizing cheesy camping kills around corners. If you're in a corner, but it's also next to a doorway, the vision extends at an angle, so you can be seen beforehand and would require more distance away to be unseen.

Adding to the balance notions, sound is very important. The positional accuracy is very strong, and most sounds or actions can be heard at different distances, as well as through walls. Even grenades can deal some damage (though greatly reduced) through walls. Guns have different values for how far they can shoot, or how fast the bullets travel. (There's also some aim instability while moving, but it's not very strong for most of the guns.) Weapons have different rates of fire, suffer damage prorate at longer ranges, and varying ranges. They even have different effects on your movement speed while out. (You're faster with a SMG than a Shotgun, for example.)

Earning the new animals is a bit grindy, though that's primarily in the levels. The magnets you get will make farming a specific animal/variation much easier. All of the animals come with a lot of variations, and they're continuing to add more over time. (I'm running around as a raccoon right now, but I'm trying to get the red panda!) Cosmetics might feel a bit light right now, but it is still early access with much more in development.

Lastly, this game is far faster paced than the other major battle royales I've played (Fortnite, Apex Legends). The map is huge, but the ring encloses faster, people die and maneuver faster overall. Matches won't drag out too terribly long, so it's easy to pick up and play, and walk away if spending 15 minutes gathering weapons and materials in Fortnite isn't your fancy.

You can try the free version to play, and the only drawbacks is being unable to utilize your unlocks or group with friends (however, all of your earned cosmetics are unlocked for use as soon as you do get the full game, so no time is wasted). Maybe you won't like it, or hell you'll get hooked on it like me.",1556332595,1556332595,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Armor is also unique -- instead of giving a flat amount of HP, they block X shots, giving a very interesting interaction between auto, semi-auto, and single shot weapons, with snipers shredding all armor in one shot. 

It's also delightful in every other way, and the developers know exactly what people want, such as a single bush in the game waiting lobby reading 'Party Bush', or the campfire with a little sign with an icon indicating that foxes are not allowed to use the default dance there, both of which spur some fun interactions. The community is also exceptionally friendly, and moderators in Discord are empowered to ban/silence trouble people, with the devs themselves playing regularly and also uniquely colored (I duo'd with one once! We did poorly!)

The only thing lacking is a huge community, and that's not even a negative, as the community there is very nice, and seeing the same faces most every game has made me more attached than other battle royales, to the point since I started playing I have a regular series of faces I sometimes end up duo'd with or against and chat with prior to games.

The last fun fact is you can globally chat if not dead, and a chat bubble is visible over your head, so feel free to taunt or beg for mercy. If you die, this privilege is lost.

The only progression is species, which you get through DNA playing, and cosmetics. In both counts, the better you perform in both kills and survive time, the better your rewards. And you can gamble unwanted ones for higher rarity cosmetics, which tend to be more unique and coveted.

The gun play is alright, but some weapons just need faster bullets (SMG and Shotgun). The sniper is totally useless in my opinion, the revolver is just much better for most situations and has a faster rate of fire.

I have a few problems with this game:
1. People that have no lives that constantly play this game (9 hours/day), it isn't fun to be in a gun fight with someone that has 10 times more time put into this game, especially not when they find disgusting techniques that cheese you to death.
2. Furries and anime fans/weeaboos. These people are so annoying, you will find that most things said in chat are either ""UwU"", ""OwO"" or the other people that are as annoying as the furries and weeaboos themselves. The haters. You will most likely see ""Ewww furries"" or ""Your mom"" or ""No U"" in the chat from these people, basic bitch memers that have no clue what real memes are. The weeaboos are by far the most prominent and annoying people in this game. Reasons for it:
1. They most likely have no lives just like every other person binge-watching anime and will play this game for 10 hours straight and will probably rek your ass.
2. The chat messages are obnoxious, cringe and repetetive.
3. They probably bought the founder's edition and have tons of skins (just like fortnite kids).",1556098525,1556098525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you've ever played any mainstream battle royale before, you'll find the mechanics easy to pick up and understand. Weapons, armor and health pickups have multiple tiers, with higher tiers meaning better equipment. Even with the removal of an entire dimension, it's still easy to understand what's going on.

The gameplay is fun and surprisingly well balanced. Weapons have well-defined roles, and even the top-tier weapons only acquired from mole crates don't feel overpowered. There are plenty of areas to explore, and loot is easy to find, so you won't often be screwed over by lack of firepower. You can also cut grass and smash crates with your melee weapon to get extra loot, like ammo, health and tape, which you can use to repair armor.

The artstyle is great. Very simplistic and cute, probably the biggest draw of the game in my opinion. It's fresh and uncluttered, and doesn't diminish the BR experience. The cosmetic system offers a lot of options and an unlocking system that I wish more games had. There are no microtransactions, you unlock new animals by using ""DNA"" which drops after games (the amount increases depending on your performance), and cosmetics are unlocked both as drops and from completing challenges. That's not to say it's perfect however, unlocking stuff takes a huge amount of time, so you better be ready to grind a lot. And some of the best cosmetics are behind rng, which kinda sucks. There are some systems in place to make up for it, but they are merely band aids on the bigger issue.

Starting with the gameplay, it is an actual new take on the Battle Royale genre.  Featuring a top-down POV, with an actually clever and inviting vision system, I can't say how quickly I fell in love with the gameplay side of this experience. The gun play can take some getting used to, feeling similar to the point-and-click style of MOBAs or other strategy games, but once you find a niche and get the hang of it, leap-rolling around people with Magnums and Shotguns feels all the more rewarding.

While the game itself is fantastic, and a refreshing break from the usual nitty and gritty gameplay and toxicity of Battle Royale like Apex, PUBG, or Fortnite, Super Animal Royale really shines with it's playerbase, and the closely-knit community that has been built up around the game. From match-to-match depending on your region, you'll encounter a lot of the same names and faces, and start to get antiquated to their antics, maybe even trying to hold a conversation. This kind of bond is fairly hard to come by elsewhere, owing also to the level of customization offered with the different species of animals, and the endless combinations of clothing and accessories (You ever see a bluebird in a dress with a mustache, mohawk, and a minigun? Buckle Up Kid). 

The discord server which parallels the game is also fantastic, and it feels easy to talk to the Moderators of the game, who you'll likely encounter in-game, and the Developers just as well. If a issue arises, a Moderator is almost always available, either for in-game assistance, or in the chats.

What a gem this game is. A top down, Battle Royale game featuring highly customisable fluffy creatures for you to gun down aplenty. It's charm, styling and pick-up-and-play nature really is a joy, for battle hardened veterans and casuals alike. It's incredible how polished this BR game is, even though it's in EA. 

Graphics are great, highly polished and just darn-right cute. Gameplay is incredibly easy to pick up, but tricky to ultimately master. The weapons available don't number in the extreme, but quality levels force you to keep scouting and keep pushing. Due to the nature of the game, you can expect to win from time to time straight from the get-go, with each round rapid and minimal hanging around waiting for games. The map is fairly small, keeping action high and keeping dead time to a minimum, and it's rare to find people camping; it's a tactic that doesn't really work in this game. Customisation is top notch, with hundreds of ways to create your own animal personification, from clothing, all important hats, emotes even to death animations and gravestones.

Frequent free ""events"" are held, with plenty of extra customisations up for grabs, and all with funny stories to back it all.

Currently, one of the best parts is the incredibly friendly and inclusive community, although this may change as time goes on. The players at large are fun-loving and ""grown up"", with the ""let's all have fun"" attitude shining through. Squad/Duo play (only one of which is available at any one time while they continue tweaking in EA) is a joy, with players generally fun, and accepting of all skill levels. The devs are highly engaged, with frequent apperances in game and a highly active Discord community where bug reports are rapidly picked up and dealt with.

Don't let the EA tag fool you, this is a fully functioning gem of a game that's easy to throw 30 minutes or 3 hours into. Highly, highly recommended.",1555802571,1555802639,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The top down shooter format helps it out much more because it means people can't snipe you from across the map or sneak up right behind you. Instead, a fog of war type line of sight means people have to slyly hide behind walls and cover. Pretty cool. The game is always being updated to add new cosmetics and balance changes with community input, great community too. Overall, I'd say its a pretty worthwhile purchase, but there's even a demo if you aren't convinced!

Other pros include:

Art. Seriously, I'm a sucker for cute games and this one wins in that category.

Community. You can play solos forever and never talk to anyone, but if you want a community, this game has a nice one. It's a smaller game so everyone seems to know each other, and there's a very active discord you can join too. If you happen to be a streamer, there's a whole slew of perks for content creators.

Developers. Constantly making improvements and adding new features. The devs are easily reachable on their discord for bug reports and are always friendly.

Some cons:

Bots. There aren't really any major cons to this game outside of it just being an early access, but there are a lot of bots thanks to the fairly simple control set. Most of the time bots are an easy kill, but sometimes they catch you in a bad position or gang up on you and it makes things difficult.",1554913127,1554913127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The art style is incredibly easy on the eyes and, though it may be off-putting to some with how 'cutesy' it can be, I believe most, if not all, will appreciate how well the mechanics have been developed. I've never been a fan of 2D/top-down shooters, but this is just so well done, I can't help but like it.

 It has just the right amount of depth in combat that keeps all the fights interesting without having too steep of a learning curve making it hard to get into like some other battle royale titles. The weapons are incredibly well balanced. You can win any fight with any weapon, as long as you use it correctly. If used correctly, grenades add a whole new dimension to the game.

The community is not very large (yet), so most lobbies are usually about 30/64 players. Most would be turned off to this, but the AI is good enough to give you a challenge, that you won't notice they're AI, your first couple dozen matches.

Have you ever wanted to see a battle royale between the cute cuddly Happy Tree Friends with the mechanics from that one multiplayer top-down Stick Flash game you played nearly a decade ago? This is that game! 

Super Animal Royale's matchmaking is quick. The Time-To-Kill is very small (Armor is crucial for lasting a couple seconds in battle), and the outside kill bubble feels like a hard leash on your character.

I apologize in advance if my grammar or English is not right :)

[h1] What I like about [/h1]

- 64 animals join the match and only one, duos, or squad survives :) Characters are all adorable and it's very addictive killing time game.

- 21 animal types, each has different breeds. Examples are Fox, Bear, Skullcat, Tiger, Cat, Dog, Deer, Raccoon, Bunny, Monkey, Donkey, Pig, Panda, Sloth, Sheep, Boar, Wolf, Lion, Capybara, Red Panda, Hyena. I like that not everything is fully unlocked. You have to level up for dna drops.

- There are bots to fill in empty spots so the match is quick and consistent. (my favorite bot names are grandma, grandpaw, sushi, sandwich, not a bot, Chicken Salad, choochoo, dr.taco, noob, lumpadump)

- These bots are well trained and fairly shoots well. Sometimes it's possible a bot can win :P

- The map looks neat, well thought out and designed. The funny signs on the buildings and banners made me giggle. (Slow Food *with sloth mascot* (Fast Food), Pie of the Tiger *tiger holding a pie* (Eye of the Tiger), Pandup Comedy (Standup Comedy), Meet & Eat (Meet and Greet), Hello Furiends! banner, Animals are people too banner).

- You can chill at the waiting lounge until the match starts. Try the no dancing in front of campfire (animals around usually do the opposite), party bush (there is one bush in front of the sign and animals usually get in the bush), dance together, hit someone just cause, roll around until you get dizzy, make a plan, or cut grass :)

- There is hamster ball for fast transportation :D (Imagine a sloth riding a hamster ball xD) You can get three hits (most weapons) but it comes with a cost. You can't use weapons, pick up items, use any consumables when inside it. It is told, if you use the full speed it can instakill.

- Many biomes in one map such as tundra, desert, forest, swamp, bamboo, and beach.
Also, nice effects like snow falls in tundra, rain pours down in bamboo zone.

- If you don't have any energy drink, you can use the campfire or eat fallen coconuts to heal yourself.

- Settings include resolution 640x480 through 1920x1080, fullscreen, v-sync, shadow quality, controls, lock mouse to window, all chat, team chat, music ,effects.

- For people who have ping issue, you can choose server - NA, EU, AS 

- You fix your armor with duct tape. YES, DUCT TAPE! xD (It also makes quack sound)

- Refreshing top-down point of view 

- Not too much blood, gore, flashing lights, dizziness right in the face since it's not fps and is good for sensitive people :)

- There are certain features you can't use in the game unless paid version. The good thing is the progress saves and syncs so you can keep your earned cosmetics to use after the upgraded version.

- For the free version, you can play solo, duos, and squad (temporarily disabled but sometimes they open for squad days). Also, duos and squad will be random players in free version.

- A great affordable alternative of battle royale type of games like Fornite,PUBG,Ring of Elysium :D It's like animal crossing went bananas and causing riot xD

- People with potato pc can play this smoothly with no crash and lag. 64 animals + environment do not cause my pc to stutter >:D

- It's easy to understand, simple mechanic, well polished.

- There seem to be no cheaters, griefers,hackers as far as I have seen :)

- Music is upbeat and carefree

- You can check your stats like k/d of solo, duos, squads, and other for random actions.

- Many items to loot and pretty fast paced match.

- Fog of war system. Your field of vision is limited/restricted which stops from being able to see the opponents and items from far away. Also, keeps out from campers waiting for you to come close with their scoped weapons. You can also use covers like rocks, trees, buildings for stealthy tactic and ambush them :P  

- When you or your teammates are hurt you can be revived or revive them. (If the Super Skunk Gas is coming your way, it would be hard to revive but at least there is an option to get a second chance!)

- You don't get to keep other animals cosmetics by a drop which makes the game less chaotic and greedy :P

- You can be resourceful by cutting grass to get extra consumables like bullets, energy health drink, and bananas.

- You can hit wooden boxes for extra items.

- Super Skunk Gas is your biggest death threat after being killed by an enemy animal :D

- The weapons sound very satisfying, my favorite one is a marshmallow on a stick. Plus there is a lot of variety of weapons. If you like guns there are a pistol, magnum, silenced pistol, SMG, shotgun, AK, m16, sniper, minigun with common, uncommon, rare, epic. For a melee weapon, there is Katana. Throwables there are grenade and banana.  

- There is crate delivery mole that spawns twice per battle at random location. The crate has rare loots and sometimes available only through the crate. 

- Super milestones - you can earn many cosmetics through milestones such through games played, wins, level, kills, melee kills, vehicle kills, grenade kills, destructibles destroyed, distance traveled, super jump rolls, getting mole crates, health juice drank, coconuts ate, enemy armor broken, super tape used, grass cut, campfires used, enemies banana slipped and so on.

- You get random prizes for compensation even when you die (or survive) like serums, animal DNA, and cosmetics :) 

- What I like about this game is it's no pay to win and makes the game balanced. Animal breeds and cosmetic items have no buffs or stats. So no one really have disadvantage :) It is fair and it's more of skill based or luck. Also, cosmetics are not bought with real cash. All items are either from events, milestones, prizes after you die or survive.

- You can support the devs by buying the full and founder's edition :)

[h1] What I didn't like about [/h1]

- In the free version, you can't play multiplayer with friends. Everyone needs the full version to play as duos or squad together (squad is temporarily disabled but sometimes available). Buying only for yourself and inviting other free players don't work.

- In the free version, you can only play as the super fox, bear, skullcat, and tiger as default.

- In the free version, you can't wear cosmetics (clothes, weapon colors) or use the animal breeds but you can wear and breed after you buy the game.

[h1] Suggestions & Ideas [/h1]

- More emotes

- More nom noms like coconuts

- It would be great to have a way to craft or combine cosmetic items for new one.

- Team command or communication panel for people finding hard to type or not using voice.

- Being able to spectate your friends

- I think it would be nice addition if you receive a crate or box and you don't know what it is till you open it. Also, the crate opening sound should be special for maximum effect of you know.. like a feeling of pimple popping satisfaction xD I usually like saving boxes in the inventory and opening all at once :D

- Free cosmetics and breed system for the win! Keep up the good work. Love the idea.

- Please keep this game no pay to win. It will keep the community nontoxic and nonsalty :)

- Sales in packs or at least buy one and get one for a friend.

- Need some clothes for free players. My friend said he feels a bit naked. (Well besides the fur :D)

- Bonus modes such as story campaign, zombie animals vs animals, food fight (where you have to scavenge for food and water to survive and not get killed), same weapon only (no weapon spawn only the same weapon for all), fist fight (no weapons).

[h1] In Conclusion [/h1]

This is very light on pc but fun battle royale type of game which does not require being serious all the time. It's more of light-hearted and comic-like silly badass animal survival :P If you can't run heavy ones I really recommend this one to try out!

I've read a good few comments in the chat where people say this is their favorite Battle Royale, and I'd have to agree. Matches are quick and gear is plentiful enough so you can kit yourself out with a viable loadout shortly after dropping. You may or may not have the highest tier gear, but it does not take long to find something that suits your style or the situation and you can dive right into the gunplay. Different weapons work better in different situations, so there is some thought that goes into what to cary. Shotties are devistating at close range. The AK and the uzi are both automatic weapons, but the AK is superior at longer ranges while the uzi's rate of fire will out-damage the AK when close up (provided you land your shots). Sniper rifles do heavy damage and will eat the opponent's armor, leaving them vulnerable. Half of the battle is just using the right tactics for the right situation.

In SAR, encounters are frequent enough to keep things interesting and the pacing of the storm always keeps you moving. Of course battles can and will end as quickly as they start and send you right back to the title screen, but I've had fun every time.

You always know, who hits you in the moment, so there can be cool fights. Rounds are super fast, even if you are the last, a round doesn't last more then 5 - 10 minutes.

In my hours of play, there were always minimum 10 - 20 human players in one match. It seems, bots come to the battlefield, so there are always 64 furries in the match.

It's a very fun and cute twin-stick shooter take on the battle royale genre and you can play for free all you want until you decide whether or not to buy the game. Good luck, have fur.

[b]MECHANICS: positive.[/b] Super Animal Royale is a battle royale game that plays like a twin-stick shooter. It supports up 64 players and you can play either solo or part of a squad, but the queues are, of course, separate. The controls are simple, but in a really good way, and everything is very responsive. The selection of weapons and item are small, but everything has a good purpose and the game really gets the basics down. Full controller support makes this a good living room option. There are bots to fill up matches up to 64 players but they play a little better than the typical beginner and don't seem to cheat.

[b]CONTENT: neutral.[/b] The game is charming and endearing and the maps are well designed, as well as the unlockables, but at this point there aren't a lot of cool stuff to unlock yet. Still, the game is still pretty early in development and it seems to update pretty often. Cosmetics are mostly unlocked at random at an ok pace, but some are conditioned to in-game experience such as ""first win"", ""50 games played"" or ""five kills"". You craft new animals to play as with items you acquired at random which can be a little frustrating if you really just want to be a Sloth for some reason, but it's manageable. 

[b]CONVENIENCE: positive.[/b] Everything works right out of the gate, I didn't run into any bugs. Requirements are super low and performance is as stable as you can expect.

[b]VALUE: positive.[/b] If you don't care about cosmetics or are you just interested in trying out this game's free demo is actually the full game, except you don't get to equip anything you unlock. Once you buy the game all content you got is there for you fully synced. That's a pretty good way of implementing a free to play model. There are no micro-transactions and so far there's only a founder's pack with exclusive cosmetics, but both it and the game are pretty reasonably priced. 

[b]X-FACTOR: neutral.[/b] Small but very nice community, a lot of them furries as you probably expected. Most matches I found in peak hours had more real players than bots, but in the off hours and can be down to just handful of players and dozens of bots. The people you actually run into in the lobby are mostly nice and fun to talk to, which makes waiting for matches more tolerable. It doesn't seem to take more than 4 minutes in my perception but it can be a little grating if you just died at the beginning of a game and have to return to the lobby. I sincerely hope this community grows a little more by the next sale.

I was hooked in a matter of a few games and more importantly, it gives me a platform to say all my animal based puns and jokes. If you like BRs, this is definitely fast paced in terms of gameplay.

It does everything a BR should. Item collection is fast. Death is fast. Gameplay takes skill to avoid attacks and hit moving targets.

Its not pay to win by ANY respects. If you pay for the base game, you have access to everything possible almost just by playing the game and leveling up. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.",1551689535,1551689535,True,2,0,0.503326952457427979,0,True,False,True

The game has an adorable art style, and that adorableness is somehow reflected in the music, making it all round enjoyable to play. The games are short so its fun to play a few matches when you've got time to kill, you could probably fit three games in only 10 minutes, though it does depend on how long you can survive! Whilst I personally prefer Solos, having played both Solos and Duos I can safely say that both modes are really good, and after seeing the testing phase of squads, I'm sure that will also be amazing.

• Cute and simple design which are well done, which only compliments the already great mechanics.
• Can pull your friends in for free so they can goof around with you
• Hosting events regularly for the usual gauntlet of holidays like any other major developer would.

All in all, I think this game does a great job pulling off what it aims to do.

The only downside is that matches end up populated with bots if you're playing at strange non-peak times - however, don't let that stop you from checking out the free download of the game to have a look and see if its something you'd like to encourage with your wallet.  ^^   The only limitation is that you won't be able to do a bunch of vanity stuff.

I've never played a battle royale game until now, the competitive nature of them never interested me, but the simple and accessible style of this game really changed that for me. The matches are quick, and dying doesn't feel frustrating since you can be back in another match in about a minute. I like the cute artstyle, and the top-down, fog-of-war combat really appeals to me, as I'm not great at FPS games. The ""demo"" is basically the full game, the only restrictions being you can't use the cosmetics you unlock, and you can't select your partner in duo matches (and probably squads when those are added as well), so it's a pretty good way to get a feel for the game before you decide to buy it; progress even carries over from the demo, so anything you earn can be used as soon as you buy the game! The devs and mods are active in the community as well, frequently talking to players in the official Discord server and even playing matches. There isn't voice chat, so playing with randos can be a bit confusing, but the simplicity of the game helps with that. There are AI opponents which play fine, it's just a bit boring to find out you killed a bot instead of a player. The playerbase isn't very big either, with the majority of a match being filled with AI opponents, but the simple solution to that is to get more people to try the game out!",1548041298,1548041298,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

-The random customization unlocks are a little too random? I kinda wish it were a little more weighted (at least in the beginning) towards pieces you don't yet have.

The gameplay is simple, but deep when you and your opponent are playing mind games with other. I love the 1 on 1 fights, but sometimes you'll find yourself in a total battlefield surronded by murderous critters and it can get really exicting.  The fog of war system is great, and still makes sound very important. A big complaint i had with most BR games was when people camped, and you would die without knowing what went on. In this game the battles are always in your face, espically hamster ball sneak attacks. :D

The graphics are really easy to look out and figure out what's going on at all times. The cosmetics/characters are all super cute and fun to unlock.

I eventually had enough and decided to find a new BR to play. After a few hours of browsing on steam and checking out trailers and reviews i stumbled upon this game. On first glance i could never see myself playing it. I've always preferred realistic first-person or third-person shooters. I seen it had a free demo and thought why not give it a try. The rest is history. It's a phenominal BR that to me has the perfect balance between a casual and competitive game. I've played for 7 hours so far and not once have i ran into a camper. Nothing but fast paced gun fights.  On top of that the full games take between 10-15 minutes. Sometimes even earlier. The community is great and for the price of $12.99 is fair for what they give you. Cosmetics is great and the progression gives you another reason to keep playing. The only downsides I can possibly think of is the small player base (which will eventually grow since this is a newer game) and the lack of a leaderboard. Hopefully they add one so I can start a leaderboard grind for this game :),1547202700,1547202700,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Definitely no PUBG effect of camping on a ledge for 20 minutes tabbed out reading Reddit and waiting to hear footsteps), which also makes deaths not too punishing - if you die, you're out at most 5 minutes of your life, whatever.

I bought the founders edition to support the devs (and because the soundtrack is dope), but the demo is fully playable minus being able to evolve character types - this is rare on Steam these days and pretty awesome. Which brings me to the last great point of this game: no pay to win or loot box BS! Minus the founders box (all cosmetics), all upgrades (also all cosmetics) can be earned in game just through playing matches. There's definitely hints in the UI towards monetization of these things, but hey - cosmetic monetization is fine by me.

Also, Linux friends! It runs great in Proton/Steam Play, so despite there being no native client (boo), you can absolutely give this a go. Exiting back to desktop so far has never worked - you'll want to use the Force Close in your desktop environment or the classic ""ps aux | grep Super"" and kill -9 the PID shown from a terminal (Google it if you're unfamiliar).",1547190209,1547190209,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros: 
1- Simple
2- Cute skins/graphics
3- Smooth Running
4- MATCHES LAST APPROX 6 MINUTES!! (Keeps me from raging)
5- Competitive players that will challenge you every match
6- Controller support
7- Tight knit community that is very welcoming and not toxic
8- EXCELLENT DEVELOPERS THAT LISTEN TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND ARE VERY INTERACTIVE!

Cons:
1- No inventory management as of yet (was recommended and was told will be added soon)
2- No leaderboards (In the works to my understanding)
3- Nothing else that pops into mind

Recommendations? 
I believe this game has the potential for immense customization and to be huge! If it is worked with to achieve cross-platform between console, pc and mobile I can easily see this game exploding and becoming huge, the game is simple enough where mobile players are able to enjoy it, short enough where they can play several matches and it's challenge enough where the console and pc players will be intrigued to jump into matches one after another.

Many times I found my self saying this is my last game just to end up playing another one because they are short and very fun.

+Very smooth and adorable animations
+Tons of animals to unlock
+Fun gameplay, not particularly frustrating to die/lose 

-Sometimes annoyingly long wait times. You'll have to sit in a lobby for up to like two minutes before you get into a match comprised entirely of bots save for a few players.
-Not a huge weapon variety, but that will hopefully change as the game develops
-Gameplay and netcode can be shoddy at times. Sometimes enemies hit you and kill you in fairly questionable ways.

Pros:
Super friendly community
Adorable art style
Minimal inventory management
Fast matches focused on the action
Plenty of different species/skins
RNG rewards: outfits, weapon skins, emotes/dances, umbrellas etc.
Plenty of biome variety: tundra, swamp, desert, lush forest
Best BR vehicle ever: a hamster ball
The audio precision is great, and the music is very cheerful
Devs are very active on their discord

Cons:
Small community, each match is filled with bots
Random Progression rewards sys needs more tuning
Duplicate cosmetic items have no worth atm
There is a learning curve to getting used to the top down aiming and using throwables 

This game has a ton of cuteness and charm and it’s hard to rage when you lose because you are just having lighthearted fun. In the initial lobby waiting room, animals are dancing or finding some way to be clever and making me laugh. Then there is the battle bus err I mean battle duck that you drop from, it’s things like this that keep the game from getting super serious mode and that makes losing less frustrating. That doesn’t mean the game isn’t competitive though, as there definitely is skill involved in aiming/moving from a top down perspective. In a first person shooter, aiming at your opponent means you have a clear line of sight to land your shots, but in this game you need to take the geometry into account because its easy to get tunnel vision and not examining the objects between you and the other player, like trees. Players can also sneak to reduce noise and hide behind walls/trees to reduce their visibility for a split sec advantage. Grenade throwing and banana trip traps can be very potent tools against enemies that camp in buildings or altering the pathways they can engage you. Without armor you are very squishy, only able to take a few hits before dying, keeping the battles quick and the games fast.  A winning match might be 5-10 minutes. The community is small, ive never played a match with no more than 18-20 players, on non-peak hrs the players per match drops into the single digits, the remainder is always filled with bots; which are competent enough to be a danger.

Inventory simplification in a BR game seems bad on paper, but in this game its refreshing that you are not fighting with loot decisions. There are no backpacks or weapon attachments, you can carry 2 guns, 1 type of throwable to a max of 5 (grenades or bananas), and 1 vest of armor and plenty of ammo. Looting healing juice just gets added to a cup that caps at 200, with the lowest healing loot being 10 and the highest being 40; dead opponents drops  the 40, regardless of what was in their cup. There are only a few weapons in this game, each filling a role; you dont have to decide which different AR is better, there is only 1 type per weapon class: pistol, silenced pistol, magnum, smg, shotgun, AR, m16, minigun, sniper. Each weapon has diff lvls of rarity with an easy to identify color: common (grey), uncommon (green), rare (blue), epic (purple), legendary (yellow). There is no reason to not swap a AR common for a AR rare, its simply better, making looting super easy and straightforward. Armor is 3 types, lvl 1-3, as far as I know armor doesn’t reduce a % of dmg like in cod blackout, is simply gives you 1-3 bars (based on lvl) of armor that can only take a few shots before the bars are destroyed, even tier 3 armor wont last long against an opponent that has good aim; for example a rare sniper can 1 shot a tier 3 vest.

The progression sys is the carrot on the stick to keep you playing with goals, like unlocking a new species to play as or going for that alt skin for a species you already have unlocked. Unlocking these is done via 2 currencies you earn while playing: animal serum (which is a universal currency) and (insert specific species) DNA.  This sys needs more tuning when it comes to earning DNA, for ex I really wanted the white tiger (I have it now), but at the end of every match your DNA reward is random, when you are a new player there is about 5 different starter species, more as you level up. So getting a ton of cat or dog DNA wont help me to unlock anything in the tiger category; this gets worse when you unlock more species options as you lvl up, further diluting the pool of potential DNA drops. Made worse is the DNA is usually rewarded in low values around 8-18 per match, making unlocking a certain species even more of a grind especially as the higher lvl species need 100+ DNA per variant; not to mention that you have to have unlock the base version of that species first before you can unlock any of the alt skins. Serum seems plentiful in the early levels but once you get around lvl 15+ you realize that the serum costs are alot higher for high lvl species or higher rarity alt skins and the rewards per match don’t scale based on your level; to put it into perspective, the starter species have alt skins that can cost avg 15-30 serum + DNA, the later lvl 15-20 species can cost 50-80+ serum. The only benefit to the slow progression is right now there isnt a lot of content and so you don’t have to worry about burning through all the unlocks in a month and having nothing left to look forward too, but later as more and more species are added the rewards will have to scale up with your player lvl. 

Other cosmetics rewards, like outfits, guns skins and emotes etc are also randomly rewarded at end of match. You could get very lucky and get that dance you’ve always wanted or wait for 20-100+ hrs of playtime to get it; Random is random. And unfortunately duplicate items have no use at the moment, im hoping that later on we can turn dups into a currency or that the possibility of dups will be eliminated entirely and that the sys will get a revamp so that its not random, and we can work towards unlocking specific rewards. 

A refreshingly cute take on BR with alot of potential. Haven’t crashed once, only had the matchmaking bug out on me once, and the devs fixed it in like 5-10 mins. I had only a handful of moments where my character has lagged around. Each match is 64 players max, with a map that offers enough variety in biomes and even has some lore in a few locations for flavor. The map could be larger; rarely do I find myself in the gas and because of the initial circles size versus the map size, there isnt much variety until around the final circle, but even then I noticed that circles tend to end in similar locations depending on which part of the map the circle shrinks in. Same with loot drops.

Overall this is a very pleasant and fun BR experience that puts a smile on my face and countless laughs. A free demo is coming soon to help with community growth, its worthy of the attention of anyone who loves BR games.",1546465892,1546465937,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Here's a list of pros an cons about the game.

Pros
- Community is amazing
- Developers work one on work with the community to better the game.
- Mechanics are great everythings fairly fluent, the delay of bullets make it more skill based then just shoot an kill.
- Playerbase is thriving even after the free weekend they did.
- Guns are extremely balanced an don't favor one person. Of course some guns are 2 shot kills but with understanding.
- a LOT of customization options.
- Skins beyond skins this falls into customization but it's more then that. Extremely gender neutral an skins that favor one gender over the other. This helps distuinguish a female from a male or a trap from a trap...

Cons
- Although the playerbase is thriving there could be so much players in the game. But they're fixing this, so though it's a con as of 12/20/2018 we already know there is a fix coming!
- The players per game is quite low 68 i think, the map is huge though you don't find yourself doing nothing a lot as theres a enemy every corner the cap could be raised to make it more competitive or satisfying to get a kill. 

I'll admit i'm actually really enjoying this game so the pros are gonna be favorable whilst the cons well be more logical then not. The game has a interesting take on the battle royale genre which definitely makes it more unique then your mainstream battle royales. Would i recommend the game at the current state? I would, it's absolutely amazing an stunning an the developers are working one on one with the community which makes the game a lot better then any other game. As i've worked with a lot of developers attempting to help better there game an was completely pushed away. As a person of the community they've built here i feel like i belong an my opinion an ideas are actually being put into the game which is super cool.",1545331335,1545331335,True,3,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,True

This 2D overhead LoS based BR has been one of my best experiences with the BR genre. It's definitely an interesting take on the BR mechanic and very welcomed, but don't let it's cute animals trick you. Loaded with an army of murderous animals, an interesting set of weapons and throwables, you need to manuever your way around this colourful map, and make the appropriate decisions to stay out of harms way, whether it's animal or the fast moving zone!

The progression system for animals is a very unique mechanic and lets you sink hours into the game getting all the cool varients and super neat cosmetics, but don't fret, those hours fly by. The games are fast paced and loaded with action with the help of it's amazing and positive community always looking to play games, solos or duos! 

For it's surprisingly low price and it's amazing dev team, this game exceeds so many expectations and is quite addicting! Boundless fun and so much more coming to it. I'm very excited to see it grow and turn into the amazing game it has the potential to be. Definitely worth a shot and look into :)",1544863556,1544863556,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True
