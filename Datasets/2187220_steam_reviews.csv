I can't bear to finish 'Spirit of Justice' because it just got to the [spoiler] Apollo's retconned origin story [/spoiler] part and it's so ridiculously out-of-left-field. 

I bought this trilogy upon release without waiting for the price to drop because i was so curious about the first game, 
[h2]Apollo Justice,[/h2]
and it was completely fun, it didn't disappoint. It is controversial of course because [spoiler] it ruins Phoenix's life shortly after the end of Trials And Tribulations [/spoiler], but Apollo Justice was so satisfying as a story that I made peace with that. Loved every case, and Case 2 was an absolute banger.

[h2]So then there's Dual Destinies.[/h2]
 I went in expecting it to be my least favourite ace attorney game, but also being really excited to see Athena, Blackquill, and case 3 and 5, which I already knew tidbits about.
From cases 1-3 i was pleasantly surprised, but after cases 4 and 5 i went off it all again. Then spirit of justice came along and now Dual Destinies doesn't look so bad anymore lol.

Annoying things:
[list]
[*]Athena's dramatic breakdowns in the middle of court.
[*]Apollo's ''i can't trust you anymore!'' drivel
[*] [b]the dArk AgE of The LaW[/b]
[*]Widget feels like a cheat and its insane that the judge says yes to bringing it out for 90% of the times it's used.
 [/list]
''The Dark Age of the Law'' was so badly done that it [i]almost[/i] singlehandedly ruined the entire game. Based on manga i've read, I presume that 'more repetition=more dramatic' is a trope in japanese stories... But Phoenix and Blackquill going ''by the way, there's this thing called The Dark age of the Law, you might not have heard of it''  after every single statement just doesn't work for an English translation. 
I didn't like that you get told what to do every step of the way in Case 4, and if i remember correctly it was a problem right from Case 1.

This game was the first to use anime cutscenes and it starts acting like a cheesy anime as a consequence. And that's how I would classify this one; the one that got Anime-fied. They clearly leaned into this for marketing reasons and the game suffers as a consequence. Might be why they got so hammy with the ''dark age of the...'' but i don't intend to look into it.

Since Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice fall short as faithful continuations of Apollo Justice, playing through shook my stance on the Apollo Justice controversy a bit. Like, if we don't get a satisfying story stemming from it, what was the point of sacrificing 7 years of Phoenix's life? To change as little as possible about DD, it would've been best to make Athena the only playable lawyer. But it would've been even better if they'd done an Apollo Justice 2 follow up and done Athena's DD later.

Why couldn't the developers be more patient and take the time to make an [i]actual[/i] Apollo Justice trilogy? The franchise was already hugely popular, they should've had more confidence in people continuing to pick up new releases. 

[h2]Finally I talk about Spirit of Justice itself, the killer of joy.[/h2]
Firstly, Spirit of justice is hard, due to clunky court scenes. I've had to use a walkthrough at times because of the divination seance and because case 2 started channelling 'Rise from the Ashes' [case 1-5] energy during analysis of evidence. In this game more than any of the others, i'm left thinking ''I could've argued that point with 9 other pieces of evidence in the court record, why did it have to be this specific one?'' On top of that, it continues Dual Destinies shtick of straight up telling you what you need to fetch from the court record before you do it. I want to engage my brain lol, i want to figure it out for myself. 
[i]More difficulty is good, but it should come from the case being more puzzling rather than evidence cheesing[/i]

 Secondly, it's a bit too childish, in a way that detracts from the game rather than working with it. Examples of this are the REALLY annoying musical witness for Case 1 and the name puns getting so stupidly simplistic and blatant.

Thirdly, the main reason i'm even reviewing, the straw that broke the camels back, is Apollo's Surprise new origin story. What can I say except for: Don't you think he would've mentioned that he's an immigrant from ace attorney's North Korea, at some point in the entire 3 years of him knowing Mr Wright? 
A game which is just an anthology of 5 stand alone cases would be way better than this ham-fisting of the main characters into a bizarre new storyline.
Also if they decided to make Khura'in such a big deal, with apollo literally growing up there, why did they even have two cases in america/japan. Why not 5 in Khura'in?

[b]Something I liked:[/b] Return of Maya and Ema. Maya shows development rather than regression. Prosecutor Sadhmadhi is interesting without recycling elements from previous prosecutors.

The best bits of SoJ and DD is when they build upon Apollo Justice lore - Klavier performing at the Themis Academy, Trucy's magic career, Phoenix's return to law, and, admittedly, The Dark Age of the Law, as a concept; but they push against the pre-existing storyline more than they work with it.

So in conclusion i would've voted neutral for ''do you recommend this,'' but having to choose, I'm going with no - don't spend Â£40 on it like I did, and just know that any other Ace Attorney will give you more meaningful story arcs, less contrived cases and motives, and usually less clunky evidence-presenting-logic.",1708888453,1708888583,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DD, by other site shit even more about AJ that AJ ever did with the original trilogy, removing Klever, Ema Skye, which  we know since AA: PW DLC case.
The jurist system was abandonned and all the built up plot from AJ was also abandonned.  And the biggest character development of the Phoenix was reseted.
The total lack of consistence and with... trials that most of time have disappointing logic comparing with similar series like danganronpa, these game could be so much more.
One of this demonstrations is where you accusing the professor means in the third chapter, and he says he was home in the time of the crime, when question he have a proof he says ""and do you have a proof that i wasnt home"" that NOT how alibi works... he can't prove he was home so he don't have a alibi, even so the game interrupts with another character coming to prove he was not home, which would be unnecessary as an not prove alibi is not a alibi at all. but ok.

In another words, this game as always try too hard in looks like a shonen anime where ""moments"" of fake finals and fake comebacks are important, than really do some consistent story and mistery.
I like the characters and a lot of times i like the humour (definitively not always), i even like the premisse and the possibilities.. but this game likes to ignore the story or simply change it based the success level of each entry

[h2]Rating: 10/10[/h2]
[hr][/hr]

[b]From the moment you press start, the Apollo Justice Trilogy grabs your intellect and emotions, refusing to let go until you unravel the last of its brilliantly conceived mysteries. This collection is not just a game; it's a journey through a meticulously crafted world where the lines between right and wrong, truth and deception blur in the most fascinating ways.[/b]

[h3]Storytelling Par Excellence[/h3]
The trilogy's narrative is its crowning achievement. Each case is a novel waiting to be devoured, filled with twists that would make even the most seasoned mystery aficionados pause in awe. With his unwavering determination and innate sense of justice, Apollo Justice is a protagonist who grows on you and with you. The supporting cast is equally memorable, offering a spectrum of personalities that range from the hilariously eccentric to the deeply tragic, all contributing to a rich, immersive experience.

[h3]Gameplay That Engages and Challenges[/h3]
The gameplay mechanics are a refined blend of the series' classic formula and innovative new features that elevate the experience. Thanks to the clever use of the DS's touchscreen and microphone, cross-examinations, evidence gathering, and courtroom showdowns feel more interactive and impactful. The 'Perceive' system in trials adds a layer of psychological depth, challenging players to analyze the facts and the subtleties of human behavior.

[h3]Visuals and Soundtrack That Captivate[/h3]
Graphically, the trilogy is a standout, with vibrant character designs and beautifully rendered environments that breathe life into the world of Apollo Justice. The soundtrack deserves equal praise, with compositions that perfectly complement the highs and lows of the narrative, enhancing every moment of triumph, tension, and heartache.

[h3]A Legacy That Will Stand the Test of Time[/h3]
The Apollo Justice Trilogy is more than a collection of games; it's a landmark in storytelling and game design. It's a testament to the power of video games as a medium for conveying complex narratives and evoking deep emotional responses. Whether you're a long-time fan of the Ace Attorney series or a newcomer to the courtroom drama genre, this trilogy is an essential addition to your gaming library.

In conclusion, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is a masterpiece that redefines what visual novels and adventure games can be. Its compelling story, engaging gameplay, and unforgettable characters set a new standard for the genre. This is not just a game you play; it's an experience you live, breathe, and ponder long after the credits roll.

Maybe it wasnt deemed worth it until TGAA sold well? Weird, one would think this would be done before TGAA, but I digress. Please give us the EDGEWORTH INVESTIGATIONS GAMES. CAPCOM.
Apollo Justice is still excellent, but the problems with AA5 and 6 are especially evident if you play AA4 right before them. Seriously, playing this trilogy one after the other makes the drop in quality spectacular. 
It's immediately clear Shu Takemi did not write 5 and 6. The change in writing by having a fanboy write fanficition while takemi did TGAA combined with the mandate to keep Phoenix at the centre and make them more like 1 to 3, result in a massive regression of his character. 
Really. Watch the insane levels of sheer genius Phoenix displays in AA4, especially in the opening case, and tell me what we see after is the same character. 
The waste of potential, particularly on 5, is saddening. 4 started the idea of a troubling age of the legal system, and 5 keeps talking about this dubbing it a ""dark age for the law"" even though its barely used and conceptually wasted. The neat jury trial system introduced by 4, timely referencing a change in Japan's IRL system in '09, is also dropped forever.
The fact that you can't just buy AA4 separately like you could on mobile irks me but I am glad 5 and 6 are being preserved despite the massive waste of potential they represent. And in the end they are passable amusements for those who wanted more like 1 to 3. 
My objections with the latter games aside, the collection has very neat extras for fans, it easily makes all the content accesible, including the DLC, so you can jump to whatever part in the story you want, runs on anything... It's the definitive verioin of these games. I only have one technical complaint. AA4's art looks slightly pixelated on resolutions above 1080p, but on 1440p and upwards rendering at 1080 looks better but makes the text slightly fuzzy. This can be easily solved if the devs let you render the UI at native and the game art at a different resolution.

Some of its cases go basically nowhere, it feels like they didn't really decide on it being the ""Apollo Justice Trilogy"" until the third game, Dual Destinies has some questionable character decisions, and frankly these days these games are probably more well known for that meme about the clown girl than anything else. But with all that said, being the ""lesser"" of what a lot of people would consider some of the best mystery games of all time is a distinction that only sounds bad on paper. They're still good games in their own right, even if you have to temper your expectations slightly compared to the rest, and the first game is severely underrated. In terms of port quality it's generally as good as you'd expect, but in particular (at least to my eyes) the updated 2D art of Apollo Justice looks a lot nicer than the original trilogy's HD release.

Regarding the bonus content (which was mostly what I'm here for for now, since I've already played these games multiple times on the DS/3DS), it isn't as in-depth as The Great Ace Attorney's unused music vault and annotated concept art, but there is a lot of concept art for each character, alongside the usual suspects like the soundtrack and movie players and a silly animation studio that plays out like a more high quality version of that old objection maker website from the early 2000s. The Asinine Attorney bonus episodes unfortunately once again didn't make the cut, along with the Japan-exclusive collab costumes, but all of the other DLC is in, and it's still plenty content-complete and bonus-rich enough to consider this the definitive version of the games.",1706225121,1706225609,True,5,0,0.420180737972259521,0,True,False,False

Dual Destinies - A sequel that tells its own story from Apollo Justice, but it really works. The writing is top-notch and brilliantly witty, the pacing is excellent and playing as 3 different lawyers helps to make the story feel so fleshed out. Plus Athena & Blackquill are just the best characters. In the whole series.

Spirit of Justice - Big in scope and probably the longest game in the series yet the brilliant pacing never makes it feel dull. Khura'in is a very expansive, well-detailed environment and the artistry is breathtaking. The music may even be some of Noriyuki Iwadare's best work. It's also nice to see Maya again, even if what you expect might happen to her... happens to her.

All in all, a brilliant trilogy that I'm so grateful I'm FINALLY able to play on other than my 3DS. And it has only made me more excited for what Ace Attorney 7 (Athena Cykes game plz!!) may bring.",1706213559,1706213559,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

You don't have to play the original Ace Attorney trilogy to play these games (Although, those games are just as amazing so you should play those as well!) so feel free to jump in here! Personally speaking, I got into the series when Dual Destinies released and played the games in perhaps the most unorthodox way possible (Dual Destinies -> Trials and Tribulations -> Original Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney -> Justice For All -> Apollo Justice -> Spirit of Justice -> Investigations -> Chronicles -> Next Ace Attorney game whenever that comes out!) and still absolutely enjoyed the experience the games offered, so don't feel afraid to play out of order if you really want to (but all games are amazing so probably don't follow what I did and do it in order of release lol). 

By the way, these games are so surprisingly replayable, even if they are linear visual novels. The cases are way too wacky to remember everything like the back of your hand whenever you replay, so I always get that great feeling of cornering a suspect pretty much every time I end up playing this series! Something I love that this game added is the extras! Seeing all the art, sprites, and OH MY GOD the MUSIC be readily available to us is super nice and very welcome! It's a great package all in all.

This collection of games were such a vital part of my teenage years, I am so happy to be able to relive these absolute classics on an HD screen! Dual Destinies may not be the best Ace Attorney game in the franchise, but I have so many great memories anticipating the 3DS release of the game. From the web based Japanese demo that I would play over and over to the trailers that were so good at making the wait for that game almost unbearable! Dual Destinies is what helped get my foot into making YouTube videos with my old Music Compilation videos. I owe a lot to Dual Destinies, and it's about time that it leaves the 3DS and Mobile Phone landscape of gaming! I still cannot believe that Dual Destinies came out 11 years ago!!! 
I have a lot less memories with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, I've only played that game once on my DS, and Haven't returned to it since then. That's not to say it's a bad game! I still love every single AA game that's been made! I WILL, however, say that whoever was responsible for Spark Brushel's armpit tell... you know what you did.
Spirit of Justice is the best game out of the whole collection, without a doubt. From the long awaited return of Maya Fey (side note, genuinely where is our boy Gumshoe!?), to the infamous clown girl...... to the gut wrenching final case that finally let Apollo shine in his own trilogy. I truly believe that Spirit of Justice will go down as a highlight for this franchise.

I really want to say thank you to Capcom for not letting this franchise die with AA6. Thank you for giving us more updated versions of the Original Phoenix Wright trilogy, thank you for translating the Great Ace Attorney games and letting us finally play those amazing titles in English. Thank you for giving us Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, Ace Attorney Dual Destinies, and Ace Attorney Spirit of Justice on modern platforms. This series has meant a lot to me, and I cannot wait for what is next for Ace Attorney. Thank you.",1706165758,1706165758,True,40,0,0.750999510288238525,0,True,False,False
