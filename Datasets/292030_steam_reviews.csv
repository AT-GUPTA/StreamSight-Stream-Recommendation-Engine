An artistic masterpiece so ideal you'd die grateful to have witnessed it. And practically nothing can match it, which is why it is one of the best rated games of all time.

The story, the design, the action - it was made with love, with passion, with a longing for a life we will never live, a person we will never be, and seeing things we never will. But it shows us what could be, and a place of comfort to escape to when the real world is just too overbearing.

I recommend you play some games. And then play this. Because experiencing this will make everything else disappointing. Seriously. I went out of my way to play this again, just to soak in how good it was even if I may never get to relive the exact feeling I had then. And in doing so I found so much that I had missed during my first playthrough. I bought and played through the other games, watched so many in-depth videos on The Witcher series, and will probably get the books at some point. Which I never thought I'd do.

The story is well written for the most part, however there are arguably some dire pacing issues at the earlier part of the game. Took me multiple tries to get into the game and continue past the Griffin fight..

Moreover, some of the characters are complex and have a lot of depth.. but most are one dimensional and annoying. 

Now moving to gameplay, I think the combat system is pretty solid - however there's a lack of variety with the Skills tree. It's kind of a letdown that even after finishing the Main story, I don't feel a significant change in my combat playstyle and how skills progress.. 

Perhaps they were aiming to make the Signs complimentary mechanics and not the main focus, but I don't think it's an excuse (in contrast, the Skills progression in Skyrim felt much more rewarding for me). 

And.. about the side content, some of it is high quality and at times as good as the Main Quests, and some are very generic and feel like a chore from start to finish, and get repetitive.

Anyway, Gwent is amazing - 10/10 IGN.

First time was like a lot of people after watching the series, I got motivated to try the game. Gave it a couple hours but couldn't really get into it because of how slow the pace of the game is. Second time I knew this going in so it was easier. Voice actors are pretty good for the most part, to be honest geralt is probably the worst voice actor in the game. At times it is really bad. It plays pretty slow, but very very similar to assassins creed in game play minus the parkour aspect. Surprisingly there are still game breaking bugs that I've run into. I've hopped on the horse and then couldn't move except for swinging a sword. Try jumping over stuff on the horse and it freezes and contorts in mid air. Some quests get glitched and will not move forward. Usually have to load a previous save a couple times or run back and forth multiple times trying to trigger something. I'm also not a fan of the way the quests are given. I don't like that they flood you with all these quests, and if you don't know what you're doing you can fail a whole lot of them if you advance too far in other quests. This process of doing it makes absolutely no sense to me. NPC's spawning under the map with just the top of the head sticking out. All in all though this game will keep you busy for a long while if you can get into it. 101 hours later and I'm still in the second territory, velen/novigrad.",1708695575,1708695575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

CD Projekt Red has truly outdone themselves with this masterpiece, crafting an experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming and leaves an indelible mark on the RPG genre.

The narrative of The Witcher 3 is nothing short of a magnum opus. It weaves a complex tapestry of political intrigue, personal struggles, and moral ambiguity, all set against the backdrop of a stunningly realized open world. Geralt of Rivia's quest to find his adopted daughter, Ciri, unfolds in a non-linear fashion, offering players a narrative depth rarely seen in gaming. Every choice you make, every ally you forge or betray, resonates throughout the story, shaping the world around you in ways both subtle and profound.

The attention to detail in the game's design is nothing short of awe-inspiring. From the bustling city of Novigrad to the war-torn landscapes of Velen and the hauntingly beautiful Skellige Isles, each locale feels alive and brimming with stories waiting to be discovered. The environmental storytelling is top-notch, with every nook and cranny holding secrets, lore, and challenges for those willing to explore.

The character development is a testament to CD Projekt Red's dedication to their craft. Geralt's stoic demeanor hides a depth of emotion, and the supporting cast is filled with memorable and nuanced characters. Whether it's the sharp-tongued Yennefer, the roguish bard Dandelion, or the enigmatic sorceress Triss Merigold, each character feels like a living, breathing entity with their own motives and desires.

Combat in The Witcher 3 is a finely tuned dance of steel and magic. The variety of weapons, armor, and spells allows for a customizable playstyle, and the monster-slaying contracts provide a challenging and rewarding experience. The progression system is robust, ensuring that every level gained feels meaningful and empowering.

What truly sets The Witcher 3 apart, however, is the sheer amount of love and passion poured into every aspect of the game. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, the meticulously crafted quests, the jaw-dropping visuals ‚Äì it's clear that CD Projekt Red aimed for perfection and achieved it.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not just a game; it's an experience that will linger in your thoughts long after the credits roll. With its compelling narrative, breathtaking world, and unparalleled attention to detail, this game stands as a shining example of what the RPG genre can achieve. For any fan of the Witcher series or RPG enthusiasts in general, The Witcher 3 is an absolute must-play, and I can confidently say that my 250 hours spent in this enchanting world have been some of the most rewarding in my gaming history.",1708694399,1708694399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Using a 4090 to crank the graphics settings, I'm still unimpressed with how this game looks - even in 4K. That aside, the world feels so sterile, its incredibly difficult to interact with anything. The game doesn't reward exploration and just sort of expects you to follow a pre-determined path. The mechanics and menus are cumbersome. Why do I have to open 3 menus just to heal my character? Combat is repetitive and just gives me no incentive to keep trying at a boss because I'm not having fun. Even basic traversal feels like a chore and riding your horse is even worse. I'm not even impressed with the voice acting, I'm actually sick of Geralt's little quips especially when talking to Roach.

Yes, *the* Witcher, silver-haired monster hunter extraordinaire, and unwitting star of ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt."" Sit down, pour yourself a drink‚Äîpreferably something strong‚Äîand let me regale you with the tale of my latest, grand adventure. Mind you, it's not every day I write video game reviews, but when I do, I prefer to add a touch of... let's call it, rugged charm.

First off, let's talk about the sheer size of my playground. The lands of Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige are so vast, you'd think you were on a continental tour rather than a quest to find Ciri. I've spent more time on horseback traversing these realms than I have in baths‚Äîand let me tell you, I do enjoy a good soak. Roach, my trusty steed, has seen more landscapes than a well-traveled bard. And don't get me started on the number of times she's spontaneously decided to mount a fence or a rooftop. A mind of her own, that one.

Combat, ah, the bread and butter of witchering. It's like a dance, indeed, if dancing involved slicing drowners in half and setting fire to vampire nests. My moves are a blend of poetry and violence‚Äîa pirouette here, a decapitation there. And yes, I do occasionally talk to myself during battles. Keeps the morale up, you see.

Magic, or as we in the business call it, ""signs,"" are a handy toolkit. Ever tried to negotiate with a bandit only to find words failing you? A blast of Aard tends to send the right message. And Igni? Nothing like a bit of fire to brighten up a nekker's day. It's all in a day's work.

Now, the heart of this tale‚Äîfinding my surrogate daughter, Ciri. Between you and me, it's not just a simple fetch quest. It's an epic saga involving time travel, other dimensions, and a Wild Hunt that's as persistent as a debt collector. Along the way, I've had the pleasure of rekindling old flames, playing politics, and yes, even partaking in a bit of family counseling with vampires.

The characters I've met? Imagine the most colorful carnival you've ever attended. From sorceresses with more secrets than I have scars, to a bard who's more interested in his next ballad than his next meal. And let's not forget the Bloody Baron‚Äîa man with a story so touching, I almost forgot to charge him for my services. Almost.

Side quests are a Witcher's delight. Ever had to judge a beauty contest for trolls? I have. Or search for a pan with as much zeal as for a lost princess? Done that too. The variety is astounding. It's like the locals see me coming and think, ""Here's a man who looks like he'd love to chase after my runaway goat.""

In closing, ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" isn't just another entry in my ledger. It's a testament to my endless journey‚Äîa mix of heroics, heartbreak, and the occasional game of Gwent (a card game that's dangerously addictive, I warn you). So, if you ever wonder what it's like to walk a mile in my boots, to face down beasts and bandits with naught but your wits and your sword, give it a try. Just remember, it's not all monsters and magic; there's a lot of horse-chasing, too.

Till our paths cross again,

The game looked like a mess and crashed quite a bit in the first 10 hours or so due to my settings. Turning off dynamic resolution can fix your game looking blurry, getting rid of hairworks immediately cut my crashes down tremendously (from what I understand it's Geralt's hair not beast hair that can cause these crashes but there's no option to just turn off his hairworks... but we do have mods that turn his off and the beasts on). I ran the game on dx12 which is what I account for the remainder of crashes but with everything else in place it rarely occurred.

Graphically stunning; an easy to use and rewarding crafting system; adrenaline-filled, gory, and satisfying combat-- every combat sequence is a unique and thrilling experience, where you will use both magic and swords (Witchers always hold two swords: a steel sword for humans, and a silver sword for monsters) to defeat your enemies. You'll be confronted with some of the most intense choice based story sequences in all of gaming, many of which will cause you to question your own morality. These often tough choices have a lasting impact on the characters and world around you, and ultimately affect how the story unfolds. All of this is perfectly blended with a rich, fantastical open-world, a dazzling musical score, and a seemingly flawless plot which make this a strong contender for the greatest game of all time.
I am currently on my second run-- the first time I played it on Xbox One-- and it's great to see how different the story can be based on the choices you make throughout the game.
Addictive, masterful storytelling combined with fluid, visceral combat make this game one hell of an experience. It's a thrill-ride you won't forget any time soon; an absolute must-play.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, you are whisked away on a fantastical quest that will keep you hooked for hours on end.

One of the most remarkable aspects of The Witcher 3 is its sprawling open world, teeming with life and detail. Whether you're traversing the rugged terrain of Skellige's islands or navigating the winding streets of Novigrad, each location feels alive with its own history, culture, and challenges to overcome.

But what truly sets The Witcher 3 apart is its narrative depth and character development. The game's storytelling is nothing short of exceptional, weaving together intricate plotlines, moral dilemmas, and unexpected twists that keep you guessing until the very end. Every decision you make, no matter how seemingly insignificant, has far-reaching consequences that shape the world around you and the fate of its inhabitants.

Of course, no discussion of The Witcher 3 would be complete without mentioning its stellar cast of characters. From the enigmatic sorceress Yennefer to the loyal bard Dandelion, each character is brought to life with remarkable depth and complexity, making you care deeply about their fates and motivations.

But perhaps the crowning achievement of The Witcher 3 is its gameplay. Combat is fluid and dynamic, allowing you to seamlessly switch between swordplay, magic, and alchemy as you face off against a diverse array of foes. And with a wealth of side quests, treasure hunts, and monster contracts to undertake, there's never a shortage of things to do or discover in the world of The Witcher.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a true masterpiece of modern gaming. With its stunning visuals, gripping storylines, and immersive gameplay, it sets a new standard for open-world RPGs and cements its place as one of the greatest games of all time. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or a newcomer to the genre, The Witcher 3 is an experience that should not be missed.",1708348972,1708348972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a fan of the books and a dedicated gamer, stepping into Geralt of Rivia's shoes felt like coming home to a rich and vibrant universe that I had grown to love.

From the moment I set foot in the sprawling landscapes of Temeria and beyond, I was enraptured by the game's stunning visuals and attention to detail. Every corner of the world felt alive with its own stories, characters, and secrets waiting to be uncovered. Whether traversing the windswept plains of Velen or navigating the winding streets of Novigrad, The Witcher 3's world felt vast, diverse, and utterly immersive.

What truly sets The Witcher 3 apart, however, is its masterful storytelling. Drawing from the rich lore of Andrzej Sapkowski's novels, the game weaves a complex tapestry of politics, betrayal, and moral ambiguity that kept me engrossed from start to finish. The characters are beautifully realized, with their own motivations, flaws, and shades of gray that make them feel like real people struggling to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world.

As someone who has read the books, I was delighted to see familiar faces and places brought to life with such care and attention to detail. From Geralt's iconic silver sword to the haunting melodies of the game's soundtrack, every aspect of The Witcher 3 felt like a loving tribute to the source material.

But beyond its rich storytelling and immersive world, The Witcher 3 also delivers on the gameplay front. The combat is fluid and satisfying, with a wide variety of weapons, spells, and abilities to master. The quests are diverse and engaging, ranging from epic battles against monstrous creatures to intimate moments of moral decision-making that have lasting consequences.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is more than just a game‚Äîit's an epic journey that transcends the medium. Its rich narrative, captivating world, and unforgettable characters have left an indelible mark on me as both a player and a fan of fantasy literature. It's not just one of my favorite games; it's a masterpiece that I will cherish for years to come.",1686596420,1708322364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Recently with the release of Baldur's Gate 3, I said that it, as in BG3, has become my new favorite game and rightfully so. I got Witcher 3 on Steam now mostly to get my 100% achievements for a great game in order, but while I played this game for like the millionth time, I did not feel bored, it did not feel daunting. I was playing looking at the environment, graphics, design and I couldn't believe this game was released in 2015. I thought it would feel like a chore playing this and that most of my good memories with the game were pure nostalgia but after finally completing it, I can say it is not, in fact, nostalgia, but actually an insanely well done game that held up for, what is now, 9 years.
Witcher 3 has been my favorite game for a very long time. I've played this game countless times and with the release of Baldur's Gate 3 which I deemed my new favorite game, and with the playthrough I did now on the Witcher 3, it has remained my favorite game, unfortunately I am unable to choose between these two.

pros:
+ gigantic world
+ shit load of quests and points of interest
+ beautiful graphics
+ the gwent card game is very well implemented solution to the boring pure luck based dice poker. 
+ Heart of Stone DLC does have quite interesting story
+ some quests are also well done and give og Witcher 1 vibes (Djikstra's treasure, finding the murderer who hurt Priscilla)
+ huge variety of enemies
+ you can do a skill reset as much as you wish (almost)
+ lots of references to books or previous witcher games
+ its the complete opposite of the trash netflix series

cons:
- extremely uninteresting skills in the skill tree
- the blood and wine mutations do not really bring much improvements to the combat, it just pretty much enhances your stats.
- leveling up takes soooooooo much time and offers no real excitement of getting a new skill.
- the combat system is very primitive, you can literally beat anything (even monsters 20 levels higher than you) by just spamming left mouse button and occasionally reapplying quen or dodging.
- there's so huge potential with the bestiary, learning about the monsters weaknesses and using them against your enemies. This thing is purely useless, again you can just spam anything with light attack for easy win. I literally play this game using only one hand.
- given the fact that after 2 witcher games the combat system has only gotten worse, this negative rating is fully justified - Witcher 3 has the least exciting and boring combat system.

Even after the next gen update, the combat still sucks ass. I would really love to see something that takes more than 2 braincells to beat the enemies.

now after the combat system has received enough hate let's move onto the story...

- story is marvel/fairy tale tier, that means it's very primitive and characters are black'n'white aka the good guys and the bad guys. The story ends by the good guys beating the bad guys. There's nothing else to the whole story of The Witcher 3. The worst and least interesting story of all the witcher games yet.

- wayyyyyy less sex scenes
- no sex cards in the journal character entries
- no uma sex scene
- no more arm wrestling
- no more dice poker
- very limited challenge in the gwent minigame
- gwent AI is sometimes insanely stupid
- the horse race minigame is more of a ""body block your opponents when the horses stamina is low"" than a race game.
- Geralt has way stronger feeling for moral values than he should have
- the whole game is too family friendly
- no equipment imported from The witcher 2 save
- if you want to get all the achievements in the game - they are grindy af and not really challenging.
- no Iorveth appearance
- no Yarpen Zigrin
- would expect next gen update to add a new dlc
- the existence of another random game launcher and the requirement of having it installed to play this game is an absurd tragedy. Fortunatelly, you are not forced to create another stupid throwaway account for this random launcher app.

Should you give it a try?
absolutely - though this game sucks for a witcher game it certainly is not a trash game and can offer hundreds of hours of fun.

Also I would love to say that the hour count of mine is mostly idled but it is not really...",1638296650,1708170060,False,6,6,0.365499496459960938,0,True,False,False

As an avid gamer and enthusiast of the fantasy genre, delving into the vast world of The Witcher 3 was nothing short of a transformative experience.

At the heart of The Witcher 3 lies its unparalleled storytelling. The narrative unfolds with the grace of a finely crafted novel, drawing players into a world teeming with political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and existential themes. Set against the backdrop of war-torn kingdoms and shadowy conspiracies, players assume the role of Geralt of Rivia, a seasoned monster hunter known as a Witcher. Geralt's journey is deeply personal yet intertwined with the fate of the world, as he embarks on a quest to find his adopted daughter, Ciri, and confront the malevolent force known as the Wild Hunt.

One of the game's greatest strengths lies in its characters, each impeccably crafted with layers of complexity and nuance. From the stoic Geralt to the enigmatic sorceress Yennefer, and the fiercely independent Ciri, every character feels like a fully realized individual with their own motivations and struggles. The relationships forged throughout the game are equally captivating, as players navigate intricate webs of alliances and betrayals that shape the course of their journey.

Quest design in The Witcher 3 is a testament to CD Projekt Red's commitment to excellence. From the epic main storyline to the countless side quests and contracts scattered throughout the world, every mission feels meaningful and engaging. Whether tracking down a mythical beast or unraveling a town's dark secrets, each quest is meticulously crafted with its own unique narrative arc and moral dilemmas, ensuring that no two experiences are alike.

The game's atmosphere is nothing short of breathtaking, with sprawling landscapes, bustling cities, and foreboding forests brought to life with stunning detail and atmospheric lighting. From the windswept cliffs of Skellige to the war-torn streets of Novigrad, every location feels alive with its own distinct culture and history.

Moreover, The Witcher 3's downloadable content expansions, particularly ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood and Wine,"" elevate the game to even greater heights. ""Hearts of Stone"" delves into Geralt's past and introduces players to a cast of intriguing new characters, while ""Blood and Wine"" transports players to the vibrant land of Toussaint, a realm of chivalry and wine, filled with new quests, creatures, and adventures. Both expansions offer hours of additional content that seamlessly integrate with the main game, further enriching an already expansive experience.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a tour de force of fantasy gaming that sets a new standard for storytelling, character development, and world-building. With its gripping plot, memorable characters, and vast open world teeming with adventures, it's a game that will undoubtedly stand the test of time and continue to enchant players for years to come. Whether you're a seasoned Witcher fan or a newcomer to the series, this is an experience that should not be missed.

The stories, characters, dialogues, choices you can make and world-building are hands down the best I have seen in any game. Main characters and plot are very well written and the latter has pretty good pacing all in all. The world always feels alive and is fun to explore with plenty of outstanding optional quests which have interesting stories and fleshed out characters tied to them, or just randomly tucked in useful items and materials guarded by various enemies. Even though the core gameplay loops are bound to become repetitive in a game of this size, the quality and amount of various narratives make up for it, since the side quests here are easily the most elaborate you can find. There are different ways for just about anything to unfold and a vast majority of your decisions are quite impactful, choices often being morally grey or without easily predictable outcome and consequences, making the role-playing part more engaging. Darker, difficult moments and more light-hearted parts are well balanced. Same goes for happy, neutral and sad conclusions, resulting in a very immersive experience.
Combat is not spectacular compared to purely action games, but it's fairly decent - responsive, a good number of different moves and abilities, slick animations, several difficulties... There's a high variety of enemies, both regular and ""boss"" ones, all with detailed lore and different strengths and weaknesses. Ability / talent development and gearing / crafting options for Geralt are alright. The builds won't completely change your playstyle, but there's enough to allow for some experimentation.
All the systems are well done and nothing feels out of place or poorly implemented. If you get bored of combat, exploration, talking, occasional horse-racing, puzzles and riddles - you can always play some Gwent, which is insanely fun for a mini-game!
The visuals are great for its time and still hold up, especially after the awesome next-gen upgrade which brings numerous graphical and QoL improvements. Soundtrack is pleasant, UI is functional... I honestly don't think I have a single complaint.
The two expansions are excellent as well, especially Blood and Wine which might be even better than the already amazing base game.
To conclude: Witcher 3 is surely one of, if not *the* best game I have ever played.",1704121330,1707958128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I‚Äôve played the whole game on my other account but now i‚Äôm gonna play it on this account also, Seriously, this game is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. From the moment you start playing, you're sucked into this incredibly detailed world filled with monsters, magic, and political intrigue.

The storyline is just...wow. It's so rich and immersive, with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. And the characters? They feel so real, with their own personalities, motivations, and flaws. You really get invested in their journeys, which makes every decision you make feel weighty and important.

And let's talk about the world itself. It's massive, but it never feels empty or boring. There's always something to do, whether it's hunting down monsters, exploring hidden caves, or just chilling in a tavern playing Gwent. And speaking of Gwent, don't even get me started on how addictive that card game is!

Combat is another highlight. It's challenging, but in a good way. You have to be strategic with your swordplay, magic, and potions to take down tougher enemies, and it feels incredibly satisfying when you pull off a tough fight.

Honestly, I could go on and on about how amazing this game is, but I'll just say this: if you haven't played The Witcher 3 yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up. You won't regret it.

for ppl who don't know previous games its also monster hunter game, u hunt monsters that's ur main job, mut its not as black and white some monsters are sentient and attacked humans for reason and u as a player decide whatever it was justified or not, also there are frame jobs and misunderstandings so u half to use ur head, thats where u also play detective + sometimes u half to solve typical human issues to that also requires detective work, or wiki if u want perfect playthrough and spoil awry thing for urself, but also there are typical monster hunter jobs where u kill a beast take trophy and sell trophy, simple black and white quests   


Bugs:
at times u cant attack u click on left mouse but nothing sometimes u can't even cast (no i am not talking about the thing where he does the move like hes casting but fails but i am talking about pushing Q doing nothing) it was terrible at the start of the game the training i could not make the counter attack sins no button wanted to work i could only block then i pushed Q the sing use key couple of times then it did counter attack once and then didn't work messed around 5 min before i got to 3/3 counter attacks also it may crash to desktop but its rare for me

Diving at times doesn't work 
this bugs can be soled by saving loading game but training area i could not save so i had to mess around long time, only bugs i noticed 


TIP easiest way is focus on fast attack and and also parry skills and u need charm sing forgot the name lvl 1 in first map lvl 2 in second map and lvl 3 in 3th map if u want to solve some conflicts peacefully and sings are useful u chose what u prefer it also means u need light armor (mix matching is not that good) and skill that gives u crit from each light armor peace but ye also depending on sings and tools u use to but with crit build u can beat higher lvl mobs easier like some who could 1hit u who have question marks meaning they are 2high for u normally u can call is assassin build to sins its about crit and bleed DPS i think its easies for some1 playing w3 first time and for some1 playing in higher difficulty 

what helps u make money hunt for question marks (undiscovered places) on 3th map lets call it Vikings/nord land a lot are in water there are 2much of them i quit half way cause i got a lot of crowns selling this stuff when i started W3 first time i went crazy with hunting question marks some mite have 2strong of a mob guarding it sure so u half to return later but i made more money with treasure hunt then missions bit more it does help at beginning sins u need to repair gear and ur low with crowns hard to repair so selling sh is ferry useful specially random treasures u find. also u find armor later also u can craft at smith, u can sell stuff to normal trader but smithy pays more for weapons and armor

i hope tips are allowed in review",1601567912,1707856461,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really recommend to play 2 other games or/and read the books. Books first then games , for the best experience.Otherwise you won't experience the same emotions seeing  characters the way the game presents them compared to how you imagined them inside your head while reading the book. But if you do otherwise you will have a clearer view of what is going on in the book as you won't have to imagine anything (experienced both). 

Positives:
-Amazing soundtrack
-Strong main and side storyline(s) 
-Variety of consequences for the actions meaning every player has a unique experience of their own
-Challenging the entire time (unless played on lower than Blood and Broken Bones and without enemy upscaling)
-High character customization (mostly armour and swords tho)
-Great athmosphere of  the medieval age 
-Dialogues refer to Geralts adventures described in books often , making it sweeter for the players that read the books
-Gwent , a great minigame that makes usual collectibles  into a wonderful entertainment 
-Over 400 quests
-Great replay-ability 
-Cheap for a AAA project
-Did i mention the soundtrack?
-Great voicover for dialogues 
-A world that engages the player to explore it
-Fooking nordlings
-Lots of charecters from previous games
-Your actions actually determine the lives of people and communities surrounding you
-For ¬£30 you get ¬£100 worth of content .
-Time demanding



Negatives:
-Combat , not very rewarding for using a variety of techniques . Most of the players will just spam Alt+M1 as it is the most effective way.
-Roach is kinda buggy , which makes you laugh at first but starts to annoy later
-Controls don't respond correctly in combat , leading to death/taking damage(happened 5 times in  100 hrs)
-The game is too damn good , so if you fall in love with it playing becomes painful . Meaning that you won't wish the adventure to end.
-Limit of 12 slots for perks , meaning that you will never experience geralt with every single perk in the game (though Hearts of Stone makes the situation better , adding mutarions)
-Time demanding.




Overall , if you are not a book fan or just not into medieval RPG's as much as Witchers community you will get a clearer view what a banger Cyberpunk 2077 will be.",1555971653,1707853585,True,3,2,0.496183216571807861,0,True,False,False

Out of over 200 hundred games I own Cyberpunk 2070 was the only game that I can't play.  Due to crashes & insane bugs until now.  Now The Witcher 3 is with Cyberpunk as being games I paid for that do not run & can't get a refund.  Whats frustrating is it used to play fine.  But thanks to there updates it's now unplayable.  The keybinding do not work either.  You select what you want to change.  But you can only program it to left or right mouse.  And that's something I would never do for the sprint button.  And now there's no way to set it back to default settings.  You can uninstall & reinstall the game or erase input settings in Witcher 3 files.  Nothing works.  So if you try to change a keybinding.  You game will NEVER play right again.  Also you can not quit the game without shutting down your PC.  On Steam it just say the game is stopping lol. Yeah it's been stopping for over an hour.  I'm just sick of companies making all this money.  And they can't even make there product work.  I used to just boycott Ubisoft but not it looks like I will be adding CD Project Red to the list.

Definitely an instant classic where you get to play as the legendary Witcher himself Jerry, finish the fight against a group of murderous furry cat people called the Wild Hunt, while protecting your surrogate daughter who's destiny it is to save the world from the deathly, pale void called the White Frost.

Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to play a great game from the 8th generation of gaming (2013 - 2020). This game has maps you can get lost in for hours on end; I know I did for Toussaint; great romance options such as Yennefer or Shani, and no Triss and Syanna are the kind of chicks you'd stay away from in real life lest you wanna false accusation taken your way. Other than that, the supporting cast of characters such as Ciri, the an-Craite clan, and the Bloody Baron, as well as DLC characters like Olgierd and Regis that are compelling and carry each story and quest that they are in to make such a great narrative.

In conclusion, buy this game if you're a fan regardless of sale or not (I'd wait for a sale personally).

Geralt, my silver fox, turns into a medieval Casanova, and I end up with the romantic finesse of a potato.

I tried wooing Yennefer, but it was more awkward than a bard with stage fright. My attempts at romance were so cringe-worthy that even the in-game monsters were rolling their eyes. Geralt may be a monster hunter, but he's no match for the real beast: my attempts at love.

And let's talk about Gwent - I'm more likely to summon a deck of Uno cards in real life than master this card game. My Geralt might be a legendary Witcher, but he's also the guy who accidentally punches a merchant while trying to buy bread.

Introduction:
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt stands as a testament to the heights video game storytelling can reach. From its breathtaking visuals to its immersive world and intricate storyline, every facet of this game exudes excellence. With all DLCs and expansions, The Witcher 3 delivers an unforgettable experience that will linger in the minds of players long after the final credits roll.

Main Game: The Wild Hunt
In The Witcher 3's main storyline, players step into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, a seasoned monster hunter, as he embarks on a quest to find his adopted daughter, Ciri, pursued by the otherworldly Wild Hunt. The narrative unfolds in a vast open world, filled with political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and unforgettable characters. From the war-torn landscapes of Velen to the bustling streets of Novigrad and the majestic vistas of Skellige, every corner of the world is meticulously crafted and teeming with life.

The main storyline is a rollercoaster of emotions, blending personal stakes with grand political machinations. Players will find themselves drawn into a web of alliances, betrayals, and unexpected twists as they unravel the mystery of Ciri's heritage and the true nature of the Wild Hunt. Along the way, the game presents players with meaningful choices that shape the world and characters around them, making every decision feel weighty and impactful.

The visual fidelity of The Witcher 3 is nothing short of breathtaking. From the haunting beauty of the haunted swamps to the awe-inspiring architecture of ancient ruins, every environment is rendered with painstaking detail. Character models are equally impressive, with lifelike animations and expressive faces that bring the inhabitants of the world to life. Whether exploring the bustling streets of Novigrad or navigating treacherous forests, the game's visuals never fail to impress.

Expansions:
Hearts of Stone
Hearts of Stone takes players on a dark and twisted journey into the heart of Temeria, where they encounter Gaunter O'Dimm, a mysterious and enigmatic character with a penchant for making Faustian bargains. The expansion introduces a new cast of memorable characters, including the tragic figure of Olgierd von Everec, whose tale of love and loss serves as the emotional core of the storyline.

With its intricate plotlines and morally ambiguous choices, Hearts of Stone offers a refreshing change of pace from the main game. Players will find themselves drawn into a world of deceit and betrayal, where nothing is as it seems and even the most noble intentions can lead to unforeseen consequences.

Blood and Wine
Blood and Wine transports players to the sun-drenched kingdom of Toussaint, a land of chivalry and honor, where they become embroiled in a mystery involving a series of gruesome murders. As Geralt delves deeper into the investigation, he uncovers a dark secret lurking beneath the surface of this seemingly idyllic paradise.

With its vibrant colors and picturesque landscapes, Blood and Wine offers a stark contrast to the grim and war-torn world of the main game. But beneath its facade of beauty lies a story of corruption and decay, as players navigate the treacherous politics of Toussaint and uncover the true nature of the monsters that haunt its streets.

Conclusion:
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, along with its DLCs and expansions, stands as a crowning achievement in the world of video game storytelling. With its richly detailed world, compelling characters, and intricate plotlines, it offers an experience that is as emotionally resonant as it is intellectually stimulating. Whether you're a fan of epic fantasy or simply appreciate a well-crafted narrative, The Witcher 3 is a must-play experience that will leave you breathless from start to finish.",1707733667,1707733667,True,3,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False

I've put a few hours into the game and simply cant stand Geralt, I dont doubt this game is amazing because it really does look so, but he's just to moody and smug. I honestly prefer watching the show with Henry Cavil (when it was good anyways). The game version just gives off major doosh vibes.

The combat feels a little jank to, with some of the controls being very awkward to move with. Now with my biggest gripe, this game (as I've been told) requires close to or over 10+ hours of time to actually find it ""interesting"". Look, I don't know about most people but typically if a game cant hook me in the first 3-4 hours, im out. 

""Trust me bro X game gets really good once you hit the Y hour mark"" no, come on.

The next gen upgrade is fine but honestly if you want to play a good rpg buy and play kingdom come deliverance. Kingdom come deliverance has realistic swordplay and Elder Scrolls like rpg elements.

Story is deep, choices actually matter, even side characters have deep stories.
The combat is great, you can play in many different styles and builds. Difficulties are thought out.
It takes a good 100 hours to finish up the main story + 2 DLCs, I've personally played it ~12 times so far :)
This game is an absolute masterpiece, big up CDPR.
I'll forever keep voting for this game when available in the Awards.

Fast forward to today and I played countless hours of the Witcher games, bought all of Sapkowski¬¥s stories, fell in love with Gwent and just recently read Rafal Jaki¬¥s take on a Ronin Witcher... I¬¥m even writing this review with a wolf medallion around my neck...

That had never happened, I watched, read and played a lot of media, not one came close to The Witcher, and for that, this game will always be my favourite.

From beginning to end, an absolute masterpiece. I myself went into this blind, with no idea about the books and got utterly entranced by the level of world building CDPR achieved in this adaptation. The characters and the flow of the story are so finely crafted, its hard to stop and return later.

The game can best be experienced in two parts - the side quests and all explorable areas, and then the main quest because if there is a way to do side quests right, this game does it. None are mere 'fetch' quests and there is no backtracking to return to the contract giver unless for a very valid in-story reason. Be aware that completing all of the side quests will make your character pretty OP for the main story, but that takes nothing away from the immersion. Even better that many times, the side quests have some hidden connecting thread that becomes apparent only when you have progressed enough.

Each of the monsters you face, has certain tactics and weaknesses and if you find yourself underpowered, you can go down the rabbit hole of potions and oils, though you can also entirely avoid that and focus on getting hold of the best possible weapon and armor sets. If you don't like grinding for coin, then make sure to loot every body of every victim, since you can become rich just by selling weapons and armor. To be clear, there is absolutely nothing in the game that requires you to repeat the same thing twice. There are however optimal and sub optimal choices to getting resources quickly, but with just enough leeway granted that it never feels like a hassle.

Witcher 'signs' bring an entirely new dimension to combat, and 'abilities' and 'mutations' even more so. If you find parrying difficult, you can upgrade your 'Igni' sign to begin with a burst of fire that burns the enemy or the ""Aard' sign to stagger them, then rush in to deal a couple of swift sword blows and retreat, waiting for the 'bleeding ability' to further wear down defenses until you begin the final set of swift attacks with a strong finisher. There are an incredible number of combinations and variations to playstyle. You can watch a trailer for the game called 'A Night to Remember' for a flavor of this.

But gameplay aside, what sets the experience of playing this game apart from others, is the character development and balanced story progression. There are zero unnecessary dialogues, and you would find yourself amazed by the ease by which is built a world where you are at the same time an outcast shunned by the populace, but also a potently powerful creature and where you try to tread the thin line between taking one side or the other - when there are no easy choices to make. What starts off as a deeply personal mission (finding your daughter) ends up as an intricate dance across kingdoms, across worlds and across webs of intrigue that are brilliantly crafted around your character. Furthermore, the voice acting is incredible, and that includes even random NPCs. Even on subsequent playthroughs, you would likely not be skipping through the cutscenes.

Choices absolutely will matter and affect not only your experience of the quests and side quests, but also the main ending. This gives you a huge reason to replay the game several times. One of the best ways this is implemented is in recruiting allies for an epic midgame battle, which plays out differently scene by scene based on who is on your side.

So take the plunge and make the time for this game. You would keep memories of it, for years later, and one thing is guaranteed - there would be characters you actually miss with all your heart once the game is over.

RPGs of this nature are strongly determined by who you interact with in a game world, not who you get to play as.  However ""The Witcher"" flips the script where you get to play as the James Bond of the game world.  RPGs shouldn't force you to play as a well defined main character and try and convince you how cool this character is, they should allow you to create your own persona by putting you in a game world and surrounding you with well developed characters that can interact and reflect back your decisions to you in a dynamic and fun way.   The Witcher doesn't do this at all.

Look at BG3, the popularity of the game is surrounding the supporting characters where the main character you play as is a blank slate.  That's how these games are supposed to be.  That's what makes it ""role playing"" and what makes your decisions matter.  

I think this game is as popular as it is, is that there are a lot of people that think that playing as ""James Bond"" is cool, and it was also the last major game of this kind before the greed of the AAA industry created a bunch of even much worse games that perhaps hit its nadir with Diablo IV.

There is no other open-world game that unites such fantastic visuals and world design with the game mechanics.

The combat in the game can become monotonous as it mostly involves pressing the square button However the game includes a card game called Gwent which is a game within the game and is a lot of fun Gwent is a strategic card game that requires players to build their decks and each card has a unique ability that can be used to outsmart the opponent.

In my opinion Gwent is the highlight of the game and more enjoyable than the game itself It is a great way to take a break from the main story and challenge your mind with a different type of gameplay So, if you're looking for something to break the monotony of the game and have some fun give Gwent a try!

It's a decent open-world RPG.  I played a lot of this game closer to when it came out on PS4, and the PC version is better to the point of feeling like a remaster at times.  Even so, it crashes a lot, bugs out a lot, and the combat is a lot less polished than you'd want from such a combat-heavy game.  By ""it crashes a lot,""  I mean it crashes much more frequently than any other game I have ever played on PC.

If you're just looking to dust off a game that you played years ago on console, you know what you're getting into, and I think this will scratch that itch and then some.  If you're looking for a genre-defining open-world fantasy RPG, [i]I guess[/i] this is probably that, but I don't know if that's actually a good thing.

One thing that I can say for sure is that it's a million times better than Cyberpunk.

It is simply the most overrated game of all time. Combat is uninspired. They just threw every mechanic possible into it for a game of this style and didnt polish a single one of them. This game is supposed to look amazing not only for 2015 but even now but its not AMAZING. Its simply was just pretty good for its time. Not saying its bad just not exceptional for the time like people say. Another thing that I have seen praise for are the facial animations. Once again im rating this as if it is 2015. They are just good nothing special they look like any other game at the time. The story pulled me in at the start but sadly did not refresh this feeling quick enough for me as it was the only thing keeping me on the game. What reason would I have to play a game where the combat is generic and not interesting and the story isn't captivating consistently enough? that's right none at all.

i already bought the game in steam like around 2018 lol because of discount

2019-2023, i have money, but i don't have enough space of time, so, in 2024, when i have enough time, i must play the game even  it is old enough. but back again, damn, how to build experience with gaming for following the storyline, with really great dialogues, characters developments, voice actings that really great,,, i realize that's why CDPR really put heart, brain, love, and soul into the game. it's not only about full freaking action bullzht, but how to build experience that the games will be directed flowed into our souls,,, 

i realize art work is real, like having souls
music, film, game and many more,,, they have souls,,, if you really work on them...

game, it's not about just having full of content features for free roam bullzhts, not just open world for you can do bla bla bla bla anything like do selfie, buying tanks, mansions, freak weapons, so much sport cars, vehicles, so much fashions, or so many many many mini games like a freaking reality,,,, no,, it's not like that...

it is about how game could be your real friend for flowing into any experience for real stories ,,, you know like real friend will talk meaningful and expressful things in life,,, same with this game and cyberpunk for knowing how to feel the experience social like real in fantasy world,,, not just only do any kind of mini games features or too much buttons features that are really annoying....

for me real game will always be combination between storylines, mechanical gameplays, character developments with responses, and the unique explorations,,, those factors must be one fine game. not just only exploration, or npc responses, or only so many mini games features, or only customization, but if you put game for highlighting only storyline, that's way better than game with bullzht storyline with great gameplay, that's how offline game works,,, 

but it's different for competitive game, you can say like tetris, cs, dota, and many more,,, even current online games having bullzht zhitty lores.... online like pvp or competitive games will always be seen for mechanical gameplay.

i hope current zhitty game developers like rokstor, ubisuf, and many mores can learn from it. also elden ringis really great.

but what i hate again about current dev like rokstor, ubisuf, ffrrrum soft,,, kapkom,, and many mores are like too pressuring and too demanding for we buy your games,,, but i'm feeling like you control my own fuqqqng game,,, yall still owning my game,,, and fqk u for that.,.,., feels buying game but not owning it

i hate  the side of current games with super bugs are cdpr too,, rokstr too, ubisuf too,  wb and many mores... still thanks not doing micro transktion bullzht.,.,.,",1692453914,1707213183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, after diving into the lore of the video game and seeing the masterpiece that CDPR created here, I found myself reading the novels, watching the show (God bless...), and watching more YouTube videos than you can count. The Witcher 3 is not a game. It is an artistic masterpiece that, as consumers, we are blessed to be able to interact with. It's like watching a book unfold before your very eyes. Fortunately, through my first playthrough, I received the ""good ending."" Without spoiling anything, I'd just like to commend CDPR for their storytelling here. There were highs and lows throughout, amazing subplots, and even the secondary missions and Witcher Contracts feel fulfilling and tell a story. I've finally completed the base-game, and so I felt it was time to write a review. 

There will never be a game quite like this. Many will try to replicate it, but nothing will ever come close. You're going to read plenty of reviews that say ""my first time in Ard Skellige was breathtaking,"" or ""I'lll never forget the sheer beauty of Toissant,"" and you're going to think the reviewers are just blowing smoke. I'm here to tell you that they are not. Especially with the current state of the game (4.04), this is a masterpiece--graphically, audibly, and gameplay-wise. I urge you to pick this game up. Don't wait for a sale, and don't try something else. I promise you this is THE GAME. The beginning is a little slow, and you'll come across a plot line with a guy named ""The Bloody Baron"" that seems to drag a little bit, but please trust me when I tell you it is all worth it. Dive into the lore, read all the notes you come across, and check things out as you play. Take your time. Go explore areas you haven't seen yet. Learn about the characters. Check the bestiary and character catalog. There is so much thought and love put into this game. I'm forever grateful for what CDPR has done for The Witcher franchise with this game. 

Play this game. I promise after the time it takes to complete the story and countless hours you'll spend diving into the lore, The Witcher 3 will create an itch only scratchable by this game.

The Wolven Storm

These scars long have yearned for your tender caress
To bind our fortunes, damn what the stars own
Rend my heart open, then your love profess
A winding, weaving fate to which we both atone

You flee my dream come the morning
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep

The wolf I will follow into the storm
To find your heart, its passion displaced
By ire ever growing, hardening into stone
Amidst the cold to hold you in a heated embrace

You flee my dream come the morning
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep

I know not if fate would have us live as one
Or if by love's blind chance we've been bound
The wish I whispered, when it all began
Did it forge a love you might never have found?

You flee my dream come the morning
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep",1695582282,1707183851,True,0,4,0,0,True,False,False

Witcher contracts are always fun, no matter how many times I do them. World is massive (for its year) and feels alive. Music fits the climate very well. The only problem this game has is the combat.

If you are playing on the normal difficulty combat will be reduced to left click spam + Igni/Quen. With the exception of a few boss encounters all fights can be completed with eyes closed. No need to use oils, potions, dodges etc. This problem is fixed if you play on the highest difficulty (for like 10h, because after that you learn how to play game properly). Then all the previously pointless mechanics start to matter. However even then combat has problems. It's simple (fast/heavy attack, 5 signs, bombs, parry, dodge, roll) and is wonky at times. Heavy attacks feel useless compared to fast attacks. Hit-boxes are weird at times and you can get hit by an attack that clearly didn't even touch you. That being said combat is still enjoyable provided you chose a difficulty that actually requires you to do anything.

To sum up, the game is amazing, but I wish all the difficulties were scaled up so ""Story and Swords!"" would require you to actually use all the game mechanics and I would like ""Death March!"" to be challenging for longer than 10h, because in all honestly the hardest fight was a random pack of wolves.",1706344085,1707163320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

+ Good graphics
+ Riding around on you horse in the big world feels great a few hours
+ Good voice acting
+ Some tough fights that are really fun if you play on death march and are a bit underleveled

Cons:

- No mechanical depth to combat, most systems can be ignored, just dodge and hit them on the head
- Crafting system is absurd (for example you combine leather straps into a full piece of leather, should be other way around...)
- GUI is primarily for console so it feels like Skyrim, playing a bad port of a console game
- Leveled loot is boring. You switch gear almost every level which means you never get attached to your gear (also absurd that a better sword should be harder to use...)
- The game world itself is boring, if want to take a walk in the fields i can just go out my RL door.
- Everything tries to be so gritty. Instead it feels like a parody.",1578685909,1707136041,True,0,0,0.419455945491790771,0,True,False,False

Naturally, as every review is subjective this review will be void of almost all objectivity as this is not a mere game and it should not be reviewed as such due to the virtuosity of the devs.
CDPR has succeeded in not only creating the best video game of all time serving as a role model that has changed future games from other developers for the better, but also making it transcend into a living piece of art and milestone in several categories.
There is no greater value for your money on steam.
The choices matter branches are so vast that people are discovering new scenarios till this day! [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_UwerUx8bGApFn_oIAuilw] Refer to xLetalis on Youtube [/url]. CDPR should award this Youtuber with a Kaer Morhen PhD.
This acknowledgement needs to be superseded by compliments to the author Andrzej Sapkowski as there would be no Geralt, Yen, Ciri, Triss, Vesemir or drowners in Velen to kill without him.

This is the best video game ever made...
... in fact this is not a game, its an artistic masterpiece so beautifully vile, sinister, and morally grey as life is. 
The malevolence one encounters in the Witcher III  is dreadful and monstrous, whereas the love and empathy one can  come across on Geralt's journeys can be truly heart-warming and invigorating.
This is all up to you and your choices.

Last but not least this story has the most gripping prologue 
(featuring the Kaer Morhen theme and a stunning view from the balcony of the castle) and the most mesmerizing and breathtakingly beautiful moment I have ever seen in a game starring Geralt, Yennefer and a Djinn.

Dont need to play tough for me. That was a hard fight. Maybe not as hard as the last time we fought a djinn, but still...

Hhm! No comparison, I'm afraid. Half of Rinde suffered then. Now I'm merely a bit tired...
Thank you for coming, Geralt. I'd have had a much harder time of it on my own.

Well, I never could say no to you.

Hmm...I expected...I don't know what I expected actually. A bit of vertigo, perhaps.

But it's not like that at all. Nothing's changed.

[h1] [b] Yen [/b] [/h1]
Why?
[h1] [b] Geralt [/b] [/h1]

I love you, Yen.

Ow! What was that?

[h1] [b] Geralt [/b] [/h1]
Strange...Done that so many times, but...it felt like our first kiss to me.
[h1] [b] Yen [/b] [/h1]
It was, in a way. Besides...once you say ""I love you"", a kiss has to taste differently.
[h1] [b] Geralt [/b] [/h1]
What's next? Got any plans?
[h1] [b] Yen [/b][/h1]
That depends on what you mean...We must find Ciri, and then defeat the hunt...But I doubt the world will end if we sit here a while.

There are few that came close to it,which personally captivated me with their gameplay,story and overall setup and I enjoyed them with both my heart and soul.Giants like Mass Effect Trilogy,Baldur's Gate 3,Read Dead Redemption 2,Hades for example.The Witcher 3 takes the cake as perfect game in every aspect,and its story gave me so much pleasure and happiness,joy and sadness and unforgettable memories with amazing characters which I will cherish forever.
Read all the books before playing the games,so the experience was even more memorable and enjoyable.
Not even gonna mention the DLCs,it adds so much to the game it's ridiculous.

Great RPG elements are in the game: Crafting, Alchemy, Bestiary, Character Skill Tree. The combat is engaging and with a variety of enemies to fight, all different weaknesses to make it challenging.

Drama, romance, funny mystrery, thriller, horror, many feelings combine together. Long speaking dialogues and cutscenes.The books and documents in this game are also full of story in it. Every quest even minor ones are filled with great stories, distinguish itself from each others. The choices you choose, the ways you speak or act effect the story line in game a lot. Scenery and music are also wonderful, could make you cry. 

The combat is very good, fun, enjoyable but can't say it's the best one. There are many games I've played better than Witcher 3. I know horse's bugs in this game are hilarious and could be famous meme. No offense but horse riding is suck! The horse get stuck on every thing even the thin air you can't see. Riding is awful give you disadvantage in combats.

This game is NOT SUITABLE for gamers who like GRINDING, killing monsters/enemies, doing same things over and over. Because you level and make money from quests and contracts which have different stories, missions, and things to do. You cannot expect what's gonna happen next. 

The DLCs are pretty big, long and great stories. I feel like I play another big game of Witcher, so I recommend you buy the GOTY edition that including the base game and all DLCs. Worth every cent, penny, baht or whatever your currency is.

It is definately the best game I've ever played in my life, it's like a work of art that I'm glad I had the chance to experience.
Every place you go feels so alive, the characters are so well written that most of the time I would get completely immersed into the conversations with them.
When you look back at it after doing everything, every single quest, all the expansions, all the places.. You feel something like a good memory from the past, a feeling of nostalgia..
When people say this game is big, it's kinda hard to understand what it means, for some, it's the map, or the number of quests, or even the size of the campaign, but I believe this game is big on what it tried to achieve, on the greatness of the story that it told, the powerful effects of your choices, the felling you have when you discover a new monster and quickly have to adapt to overcome it, the experience you have when picking up a trail, or sailing through the cold oceans of skellige alone..

So many memories, that with words it's simply too hard to explain, memories that I will always hold dear to my heart.

An amazing story and detailed characters paired with fantastic graphics and audio is what makes this game so immersive and it just keeps pulling you in. As it goes with RPGs like this, some parts are a tad bit slow but it is 100% worth it. It's got an okay replay value since there's a lot of different choices and paths to take, also there's a lot of mods made by community! Aside from main story and a lot of interesting side quests/contracts/exploration there's also a card mini-game Gwent which is a lot of fun when you actually learn how it works, so I recommend doing that throughout the game!

Combat isn't really a strong part of this game although I've enjoyed it. After getting the hang of it, it gets really repetitive and easy (apart from certain bosses) even on the hardest difficulty. Luckily, you can try out a lot of different builds which focus more on different aspects of combat so thats a plus. Also Roach is buggy af but we love her for that!

From the moment I stepped into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, I was captivated by the rich, immersive world, the intricate storytelling, and the sheer depth of character development.

Visually stunning, the game's landscapes are breathtaking, from the bustling cities to the hauntingly beautiful Skellige Isles. Every corner of the world is meticulously crafted, creating an atmosphere that draws players into a living, breathing fantasy realm.

The narrative is the true gem of The Witcher 3, weaving a complex and emotionally charged tale. The choices you make have genuine consequences, affecting not only the main storyline but also the fates of the characters you encounter. The moral ambiguity of decision-making adds a layer of realism, forcing players to grapple with the consequences of their actions.

The character development is unparalleled. Geralt is not just a monster slayer; he's a multifaceted individual with a moral compass and personal struggles. The supporting cast is equally well-realized, with each character having their own motivations, flaws, and stories. The dialogue choices feel meaningful, contributing to the immersive storytelling experience.

Combat in The Witcher 3 is a satisfying blend of strategy and skill. The variety of weapons, spells, and potions at Geralt's disposal allows for diverse playstyles. The monsters you face are not just adversaries but living entities with unique behaviors, weaknesses, and lore, making every encounter a thrilling challenge.

Beyond the main quest, the game is filled with side quests that are more than mere distractions; they're mini-epics in their own right. The depth of the world-building is evident in every quest, big or small, creating an expansive and cohesive game world.

While no game is flawless, any shortcomings in The Witcher 3 are overshadowed by its overwhelming strengths. The occasional graphical glitches or minor bugs are forgivable in the grand scope of this gaming masterpiece.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a triumph of storytelling, world-building, and gameplay mechanics. CD Projekt has crafted a game that not only sets the bar for the RPG genre but also stands as a testament to the power of interactive storytelling in the world of gaming. It's not just a game; it's an unforgettable journey that lingers in the mind long after the final credits roll.",1706888971,1706888971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Second play through years later reminded me what makes The Witcher 3 so special. True freedom to explore a vibrant world in your own style and pace. Decisions have true impact and are game-changing. Even better, the game designers did not wave red flags, like most designers do. The smallest of choices can lead to the greatest of consequences, As in life, there is nobody there to make those forks in destiny clear. 

Graphics still hold up, especially with the free next gen update. The graphics aren't appealing just because of fancy atmospheric affects (though you get a bit of the that). It's because of the beauty and detailed cultures in all of the game's locations. Which is to say... this game is was crafted with lots of passion and creativity.

This review comes from a really wild angle of the entire series as a whole. I tried reading the books, I tried watching the TV show and I tried playing the games. I even bought a poster, a mug and set my backgrounds to as many Witcher themed art as I could find. 

There was a time I really loved this game, I didn't even want to play multiplayer games at one point, I would even schedule it in my calendar and plan what I would do next in the game. I would even light my room a certain way and my desk when playing. 

But then it updated into some new update which made the game different in the bad way, the Netflix show got bad, the books storytelling and endless lore got confusing, the DLC was prolonging the game into infinity and I just fell out of love with it. 

Suddenly I was apart of a lot of Witcher fans who were like ""What happened to this franchise?"" it kind of spread thin and started to become milked for what it's not...another Lord of the Rings. Not only that the update made the game unplayable and I ended up losing a lot of progress that I didn't feel like redoing. 

My Recommendation: Play the game with out the DLC and play it on a quality that your PC can handle. Don't dilly dally in the game and just keep it moving at a quicker pace. Don't try and 100% the game because it will become a tad repetitive and you'll lose the great story that is within the game. Don't fall into what the Witcher brand is wildly changing into.

One day I will re download this game and finish it, but right now I understand it's a masterpiece, I just got caught up the hype of it all and it ruined it a bit for me. If that's what you are afraid of... don't download the DLC and just play the straight forward story line and stay away from the new wave of the Witcher series. That's what made it what it is known for not what it isn't anymore.",1706671833,1706671833,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The combat, which the game wants to revolve around for some reason, is down horrendous. Deathmarch, which I alway play on because I'm stupid, is essentially just enemies with more hp and dmg, nothing creative. A boss fight at this difficulty takes a little bit of time, the whole time you are not having fun, you are just waiting to dodge and to hit, that's it. 

Also how can the game still have so many bugs and issues? It's been a decade. I just played the wraith fight from Heart and Stone and you Projekt Red still haven't made it so Geralt targets the paintings, essentially just giving you a RNG factor to how long the boss fight lasts. I know guys who have spent entire SEASONS in that room with that wraith. I hate how this game thinks longer boss fights is more fun, NOBODY is playing your game for the combat, buddy, YOU ARE NOT THAT GAME. 

In all honesty though, the game plus all the DLCs are worth around maybe 6-7 dollars, but the game is expecting way too much thinking it's worth more than 10 dollars. YOU ARE NOT THAT GAME!",1706574309,1706574309,False,1,3,0.306592226028442383,0,True,False,False

Every little nook and cranny have their part to play to make this a truly immersive experience. The attention to detail in the games design, from bustling cities to the tranquil countryside, is a feast for the eyes. Almost every house is fleshed out and not some empty or locked up set piece. Character models are intricately designed, and the monsters you encounter are both terrifying and awe-inspiring. The graphics, even years after the games release, continue to stand the test of time.

The storytelling in The Witcher 3 and its DLC's are among the best narratives out there. Filled with complex characters, choices that makes you question morality and each dialogue or action have their consequences that shapes your tale. Every corner of the map is teeming with quests, mysteries, and hidden treasures. The side quests are not distractions but are tied to the main story, offering players a chance to explore the depths of the world and its lore. Whether you're hunting mythical creatures or solving mysteries, every quest feels meaningful and contributes to the overall story of the game.

The combat system is both challenging, fun and really satisfying. Movements and fighting feels so fluid with a big variety of combat styles to suit everyone, from sword fighting, spells, ranged and potions allowing players to really strategize. It's a perfect balance between accessibility for newcomers and complexity for seasoned players.

The sound design and music is something truly special and deserve a big praise! The music is especially haunting combined with the atmospheric sounds and have a huge emotional impact on every moment.

Hate: A dense story that's difficult for newcomers to follow without referencing Google/YouTube, cheesy acting, random sex scenes (the whole game is sexually charged for no reason), and a protagonist / love interests that I personally have never been invested in.

CD Projekt Red's magnum opus isn't merely another entry in a popular franchise; it's an expansive, deeply engrossing journey that defies the constraints of its genre, weaving a complex narrative tapestry that resonates long after the final credits roll.
At the heart of The Witcher 3 lies a narrative so intricately woven that it transcends the boundaries of video game storytelling. This isn't your typical hero's journey; it's a deeply human exploration of complex moral dilemmas, political intrigue, and the blurred lines between good and evil. The game's masterful storytelling allows players to navigate morally ambiguous choices, presenting a nuanced world where every decision has far-reaching consequences, making it one of the most captivating and intellectually stimulating narratives in modern gaming.
The game's meticulously crafted open world of Temeria is a visual and atmospheric marvel. From the sun-drenched fields of Velen to the hauntingly beautiful Skellige Isles, each locale is painstakingly detailed, brimming with life, and steeped in rich lore. The depth of the world-building is nothing short of remarkable, immersing players in a living, breathing realm where every corner tells a story and every character carries a weight that goes beyond their scripted lines.
Moreover, the expansion packs, ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood and Wine,"" aren't mere cash-grabbing add-ons, but full-fledged narratives that rival the main game in both scope and emotional depth. They seamlessly integrate with the base game, offering new lands to explore, characters to meet, and stories to unravel, demonstrating a level of care and dedication to storytelling that is rare in the industry. CD Projekt Red's commitment to delivering substantial, story-driven content without compromising the game's artistic integrity is a testament to their respect for the player's experience and a stark contrast to the predatory practices seen in contemporary gaming.
Despite its occasional technical shortcomings, such as minor glitches and performance issues, The Witcher 3's ambition and attention to detail far outweigh its flaws. It demands patience and investment, rewarding players with a deeply satisfying and emotionally resonant experience that lingers long after the controller is set down. It's a game that transcends mere entertainment, leaving an indelible mark on the player's psyche and challenging the very notion of what a video game can achieve in terms of narrative complexity and emotional depth.
Furthermore, The Witcher 3's evocative musical score, composed by Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz, with contributions from renowned folk band Percival Schuttenbach, serves as a powerful emotional undercurrent, enhancing the game's already immersive world. The haunting melodies and rousing anthems underscore pivotal moments in the narrative, evoking a range of emotions that further cement the game's ability to resonate on a deeply personal level. The synergy between the game's visuals, narrative, and musical score creates an atmospheric symphony that transports players into the heart of the Witcher universe.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a seminal achievement in the realm of video game storytelling, offering a profoundly human and thought-provoking experience that elevates the medium to the realm of high art. It's not just a game; it's a transformative journey that reminds us of the power of interactive storytelling and the potential of the medium to provoke introspection and emotional resonance. For anyone seeking an unforgettable and deeply immersive narrative experience, The Witcher 3 is an absolute must-play that stands as a landmark in the evolution of video game storytelling.",1697802277,1706433677,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The graphics hold up so well that the game looks better than some of the major RPGs that came out this year and the music creates a really one of a kind atmosphere that makes you want to come back for more and more. The progression system is well thought out - as complex or simple as you want it to be, allowing different types of builds despite the fact that you only really use two swords. There are a few annoyances throughout the game, such as the massive spike in fall damage, but these can be easily negated with the help of mods. The open-world is the best ever made. You can feel the fantasy atmosphere through the monitor. Despite the game not following the books written by Sapkowski, the lore is really true to the one established in them. What are you waiting for? Go buy it now!

The combat system is really bad, fighting things is boring and feels like a chore. This game is great if you want to just wander around sight-seeing, but actual gameplay is pretty bad and un-interesting. I have tried re-installing this game several times because I feel like I keep missing something, but no... It's just a game that's not very good, extremely overhyped by the community and people who don't want to sound foolish when they admit that this game is just a waste of money.",1706299263,1706299263,False,4,1,0.418972313404083252,0,True,False,False

Absolutely timeless. Very immersive. I find myself getting lost in the open world every time I go to do a quest. I love the fact that your decisions matter in game.

Geralt of Rivia, ladies and gentlemen ‚Äì the ultimate monster slayer, ladies' man (sometimes), and champion of gwent. This ain't your fairy-tale fairytale. Welcome to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, where the sun shines brighter than Yennefer's smile, the bogs are deeper than Geralt's gruffness, and the choices you make leave scars more permanent than a drowners' bite.

Story? Twisted enough to make a wraith blush. Politics thicker than pea soup, family drama spicier than Novigrad sausage, and a main quest that takes more turns than a kikimore on roller skates. You'll hunt beasties from folklore nightmares, negotiate with sorceresses sharp enough to cut diamonds, and make choices that'll leave you questioning your humanity faster than a succubus can say ""free drinks."" And the characters? Well, they're as messed up and magnificent as a cursed witcher with a drinking problem. You've got Ciri, Geralt's adopted daughter and living plot twist, Dandelion, the bard whose lute skills are only matched by his knack for trouble, and Zoltan, the dwarf whose love for ale is only surpassed by his loyalty. You'll love them, hate them, and swear under your breath at their stubbornness (especially Geralt and his gwent addiction).

Gameplay? A griffin's nest of options, deeper than a drowner's den. Swordplay that feels smoother than a witcher's oiled muscles, alchemy that lets you mix bombs like a potions professor on vodka, and signs that make you feel like a mage with a bad attitude (and a knack for electrocuting drowners). You'll explore vast landscapes that beg to be plundered, uncover side quests hidden in every nook and cranny, and maybe even find a love interest or two (just don't get your hopes up, Geralt's track record is... complicated). And then there's gwent. The card game so addictive it should be illegal (and probably is in Nilfgaard). You'll spend hours collecting cards, strategizing decks, and trash-talking opponents like a pro. Seriously, this game can steal your life faster than a pack of feral dogs with a taste for bards.

The world? Breathtaking, even with the stench of troll vomit. From sun-drenched vineyards to misty swamps, war-torn cities to ancient elven ruins, Night City has nothing on Velen and its friends. Every corner whispers a story, every abandoned shack hides a secret, and every tavern bustles with rumors and questionable characters (Geralt fits right in). You'll spend hours just wandering, soaking in the atmosphere, and maybe accidentally picking a fight with a group of bandits (whoops, sorry not sorry).

So, perfect? Nah, choom. Bugs the size of a wyvern, combat that can be clunky as a rusted blade, and a story that sometimes gets bogged down (pun intended) in side quests. But here's the truth: The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece. It's a world so alive you can practically smell the roasted boar and hear the lute strings twanging. It's a story so gripping you'll forget to eat, sleep, or shower (maybe not shower, that's just gross). It's a game that makes you laugh, cry, rage-quit, and come crawling back for more. So grab your steel sword, pack your gwent deck, and dive into The Witcher 3. Just remember, in this monster-infested world, the only guarantee is a good story (and probably a few accidental drownings).

P.S. Special thanks to my trusty AI co-pilot, Bard. They may not know how to fight a griffin, but their knowledge of Witcher lore is deeper than the ocean a siren calls you to. Plus, they kept me from writing the entire review in Elvish (no one wants that headache). So yeah, give that AI some love too. Maybe a few extra crowns or a shiny new algorithm upgrade. They deserve it.

Now go forth, slay some monsters, win some gwent, and try not to get eaten by a drowners' nest.

Sincerely,

Also by the way here is the worst DLSS i've ever seen in games. i'm ashamed, that after such a big time CDPR still haven't done anything to fix next gen patch(Patch, that requires patches itself). Even cyberpunk 2077 on release wasn't so broken(I've pre-ordered game on GOG and played one of the first, i know, what i'm talking about), at least i haven't seen so much crashes, as in witcher 3 next gen. I hope CDPR will fix this awkward once. But under eternal crushes hiden brilliant of the game industry. It's not my first walkthrough of this game. First time i just ran trough main story quests, and forsaken it.

This has been my third playthrough, but the first time I tried the next-gen patch and also the DLCs for the first time. Surprisingly, I found myself enjoying the game even more than before, spending considerably more time on the main game than before.

Storywise, it's great, up until somewhere around the halfway point of the final act. The storytelling is nearly unparalleled, with occasional drags, but given the scale, they're forgivable. Even the less exciting parts are still impressive when compared to other games.

However, the halfway point of the third act is a bit of a letdown. It feels rushed, lacking the time needed to appreciate the culmination of the chase. The urgency of the Wild Hunt chasing doesn't fully compensate, as Geralt's interaction with Ciri is limited from the player's perspective.

While there are other aspects I'd like to delve into, such as the romance options feeling somewhat shallow, I'll refrain.

Gameplay-wise, I was a bit less captivated compared to previous playthroughs. I went for a New Game + on Death March, adding some much needed challenge. The core combat didn't grip me as before, but I kept it interesting by going with the Feline Armor, making almost anything oneshot me. Despite claims about combat lacking depth, I found it satisfying due to impressive sound and visual effects.

Visually, it's stunning, and the next-gen patch significantly enhances the game's atmosphere. Unfortunately, I couldn't run it with RTX on, dropping the frames too low for my liking. Audio-wise, it's great, though I'll leave the detailed assessment to those more versed in the subject.

[h2]DLC's[/h2]
Now then the DLC's or rather expansions in this case. I was blown away by them to say the least. 

""Hearts of Stone"" has secured a spot as one of my favorite, if not the favorite, DLCs of all time. The story is enthralling, delving deeper than the base game and prompting more questions about characters. It's gripping and exceptionally well-crafted. The gameplay takes daring and interesting turns, introducing experimental set pieces that challenge players to think and act differently. This departure from the main game's formula was immensely enjoyable.

""Blood and Wine"" is also excellent but falls slightly short of the previous one, at least for me. The story and new characters are enjoyable, yet it lacks the experimental feel of ""Hearts of Stone"" that I grew fond of. However, it compensates by offering an expansive new map with stunning environments that exude atmosphere. The inclusion of new enemy types and encounter scenarios on the map adds a refreshing layer. The bandit forts with numerous adversaries were particularly enjoyable to conquer.


[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Overall, I still find immense joy in this game. I believe that anyone with even a passing fondness for open-world games or RPGs should experience the entirety of this game at least once.",1561918921,1706128655,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

witcher 3 made me like and enjoy open world games again, what a blast i had in this game! After putting it off for so long, i finally tried to play and enjoy this game fully and i am so glad i did. It became an instant favourite mostly due to how much i hated the previous version of the game with clunky controls and unremarkable graphics. The game is seriously so beautiful with characters you care about. That is really important as i thought i would hate Geralt at first as i thought he seemed quite boring, but that was not the case. If i have a complaint, it is that the game does not have too strong of a combat focus, it can be very easy and mindless sometimes, and the chore-like sidequests can really be quite dumb to do sometimes. However, more often than not, you will be rewarded with good storyline in these side quests that i actually like. The main cast of characters are so endearing and lovely, i really like this game.",1625304697,1706121665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".

And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?

And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feel I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.

Andrzej Sapkowski did a masterful job at telling the story of Geralt across all of his novels, and it's clear that CD Projekt Red scrubbed his novels to create the Witcher 3 in such a lore accurate manner.

It's beautiful from start to finish. Upon beating the base game for the second time (this time across a 46 episode series on my YouTube channel, and on Death March + Enemy Upscaling) I found myself in so much happiness that the epic conclusion had been met, I got the ending I wanted, everyone lived a happy life, but I also found myself sad that it was over now.. not fully though because I can still play HoS and B&W for a second time.

This game is not just a game. It's a story written over the course of 6 years.

Developed by CD Projekt, this action role-playing game (RPG) was released in 2015 and quickly earned critical acclaim for its expansive open-world, compelling characters, and mature narrative. In this review, we delve into the various aspects that make The Witcher 3 a masterpiece in the gaming industry.

World-Building and Exploration:

The world of The Witcher 3 is a vast and breathtaking landscape, meticulously crafted to immerse players in the rich lore of Andrzej Sapkowski's novels. The Northern Realms and the Skellige Isles are sprawling territories, each teeming with diverse ecosystems, cities, and hidden treasures. From the bustling streets of Novigrad to the untamed wilderness of Velen, the game's world is not merely a backdrop but a living, breathing entity that reacts to the player's choices.

Exploration is a key element of The Witcher 3, encouraging players to venture off the beaten path to discover hidden caves, abandoned villages, and mysterious landmarks. Every nook and cranny holds a story or a challenge, rewarding the curious with both tangible rewards and a deeper understanding of the game's lore.

Graphics and Visual Design:

The graphical prowess of The Witcher 3 was groundbreaking upon its release, and it still holds up remarkably well. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and weather effects contributes to the game's immersive atmosphere. Whether riding through a dense forest shrouded in fog or engaging in a swordfight under the moonlight, the game consistently delivers stunning visuals that enhance the overall experience.

Character Design and Development:

At the heart of The Witcher 3 is Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter with a stoic demeanor. However, it is the supporting cast that truly elevates the narrative. Characters like Yennefer, Triss Merigold, and Ciri are masterfully developed, each with their own motivations, flaws, and moral dilemmas. The game presents a morally gray world where choices have consequences, and alliances are forged and broken based on the player's decisions.

Geralt himself is a complex protagonist, grappling with his own identity, morality, and the burdens of his profession. The writing and voice acting, particularly by Doug Cockle as Geralt, breathe life into the characters, making them memorable and emotionally resonant.

Narrative and Quest Design:

The narrative of The Witcher 3 is a mature and engaging saga that weaves political intrigue, personal drama, and supernatural elements into a cohesive and compelling storyline. The main questline, centered around the search for Ciri, is complemented by a myriad of side quests that are often as rich and meaningful as the main story.

Quest design is a standout feature, with choices that genuinely impact the narrative and the fates of characters. The moral ambiguity of decisions adds depth to the storytelling, challenging players to consider the consequences of their actions. The Bloody Baron questline, in particular, is often cited as a shining example of the game's ability to tackle complex and emotional themes.

Gameplay Mechanics and Combat:

The Witcher 3 strikes a delicate balance between action and role-playing elements. The combat system is fluid and responsive, requiring strategic thinking and mastery of Geralt's diverse set of combat skills. The use of signs, potions, and Witcher senses adds depth to encounters, allowing for a variety of playstyles.

The alchemy and crafting systems are robust, giving players the ability to enhance their weapons, brew potions, and craft armor. The economy is well-balanced, making each decision to spend resources a meaningful choice.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a monumental achievement in the realm of video games. Its captivating narrative, memorable characters, and expansive world make it a timeless classic. CD Projekt's commitment to quality is evident in every aspect of the game, creating an experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. The Witcher 3 stands not only as a benchmark for RPGs but as a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.",1705860980,1705860980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The character writing, the music, the story, it all caught me in a way no other game has ever managed to. Interactions like the pseudo-quest about Lena in White Orchard are things that are wont really affect your gameplay itself much, but it makes the world feel much more alive. There was no reason to help her, the game didnt tell you to help her, but maybe you still wanted to try, so you did, and the game rewarded you with an extra cutscene or two with a bittersweet ending for this little irrelevant plotline in classic The Witcher fashion. 

A lot of decisions in this game are incredibly hard to make, since this game's philosophy is a lot about having to choose between two evils, where you have to decide for yourselfwhich is the lesser one. Random sidequests will put you infront of decisions that will probably require you to take a step back for a minute and think which option is for the greater good.

    - 1 Kilogram of coca leaves.
    - 1 Gallon of kerosene.
    - 1 Gallon of acetone
    - A large pot
    - A trainer
    - A glass of baking dish
    - A spoon
    - A coffee filter
    - A rubber band
2. Prepare your workspace. Make sure you are working in a well-ventilated area. Cover your work surface with newspaper or plastic.
3. Dry the coca leaves. Spread the coca leaves out on a flat surface and let them dry in the sun for several days.
4. Crush the coca leaves. Once the coca leaves are dry, crush them into a fine powder.

There's something off though, I just can't get into this game...

I know that's a terrible reason, but that has been my experience. I want to like it, and it really seems like something I should love! Every time I play I just feel so... meh.

The only thing that really stands out to me is how clunky the combat felt. Almost like a console game lazily ported to the PC. I don't think that's why I dislike the game though, as I've enjoyed some really clunky stuff in the past.

Objectively I see that this game is amazing in scope, story, and diversity of content. I think they definitely deserve the love and money they have received. Objectively, I recommend the game.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game personally... and I wish I had a more specific reason than ""dunno... didn't like it"" but... I don't.

I am guessing I have played roughly a quarter of the main story, and I find myself completely engrossed with both the main story line, which I will not divulge, but especially all the side plots.  Nothing feels forced or unnecessary.  This is what an open world RPM should look and feel like.

I also have to say I mostly disliked how Geralt was depicted in the first two games.  As a veteran that has dealt with people that needed a solid punch in the mush, that was mostly how I felt about Geralt, much too pompous for my tastes.  In Witcher III, he feels much more nuanced in his dialogue and far less of a punk that needs to be taken down a peg.  I did not read the books, and I thus wonder if this is reflective of his development in the source material.  Regardless, liking the main protagonist is a major boon.

I would also like to compliment the combat.  It frankly felt clunky in the previous games.  I absolutely love the combat in this game.  It feels realistic, and I really appreciate the depth of tactics that can be employed.  The games accomplishes this and remains very smooth and fun at the same time.  I really don't mind dying if the combat is engaging and you learn as you play while thoroughly enjoying yourself at the same time.

My final comments are around the mini-game of Gwent.  I utterly despised the dice play and even more so the arm wrestling of Witcher II.  The arm wrestling was some of the most frustrating video game play I have ever experienced, and I won't bother with the details.  Play it for yourself if you are feeling especially like a masochist.  Gwent, on the other hand, is probably my favorite mini-game ever.  At the outset of Witcher III, before I had become engrossed in the story, I was excited just at the prospect of playing more Gwent.

If you are a fan of immersive fantasy RPGs, Witcher III is worthy of all the accolades it has received.  I cannot say the same for many games I will refrain from mentioning.",1705600171,1705600171,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I kept installing the game and trying to just understand what everyone liked about it (my friends too) and I kept getting bored out of my mind. The world wasn't interesting enough for me to explore and when in an open world game, the world doesn't interest me. I play the main story and guess fucking what? Even if you go only main mission heavy, you get stopped by the game telling you to go do side quests to get enough level to continue playing the main storyline. I think that detracts so much from the story. 

Not only that, but the combat is more tedious than any other RPG that I put in time to; Firstly, sometimes I would just roam around the map and there would be ambushes! That sounds fun, right? No! Because the ambush enemies are level 9 whilst I'm level 6. AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME! Ok, I cheesed them and then somehow? Killed them. I come across some bandits trying to burn down a woman house, and I'm like ''fuck yeah, I'm going to be a hero' Bam! I get mauled by enemies that are 3‚Äì4 levels higher than me, so I load a quick save and avoid that area entirely.

If you're a fan of open-world fantasy sword-fighting games, The Witcher 3 is an absolute must-play. I truly recommend it.

It stands out as one of the most comprehensive open-world experiences available. Playing it took me back to the days when I immersed myself in the world of Gothic, playing day and night. The Witcher 3 offers a similar captivating experience. I found myself eager to undertake every quest, uncover all the adventures, and explore the mesmerizing world it presents. The game's beauty is truly remarkable. I'm eagerly anticipating more DLCs and, fingers crossed, The Witcher 4.",1705515801,1705515801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The story is obviously the biggest selling point of the game, with an intricate plot that tackles topics of undying love, bitter revenge and imperfect fatherhood. Those who are fans of the books will be delighted to see some of their favorite characters make a return and to hear about the old adventures of The White Wolf.

Gameplay wise, the game has fluid combat, thanks to Gerald's dance like moves, and rewards fast engagements. As for the world, there are many activities to enjoy, from memorable beast hunts, to crafting monster killing gear or taking part in the incredibly addicting Gwent card game, there is a lot to do.

So as belies any already well reviewed game, I'll briefly make the case for it in my own way.

The story- for both the main game and the 2 fantastic DLC's- Hearts of Stone, Blood and Wine, are stellar, consistent, and MOSTLY well paced. This also brings me to my first complaint- the game just speeds up rapidly after you find Ciri and the rest of the game...just...happens in a flash. I do not like how I found Ciri when I was 50h in, and the main story was over by the 60th hour. That being said, the narrative was placed rather well, albeit feeling a bit rushed sometimes. The choices in the story do have an impact on how the world sees you, and I do appreciate that.

The graphics- they dont look too bad, and I'd argue they MIGHT hold their own in 2023, it's a really good looking world. 

The combat- I dont dislike it inherently, it's fluid, smooth and all, but there's just some things that make no sense- like the way my movement is locked in to rolls and dodges, unable to jump or sprint unless I kill all enemies or roll tf away from the vicinity, both of which will cause issues in the succession questline in Skellige- because fucking harpies and all just love flying and fucking around and more often than not you fall to your death trying to evade. I believe everyone should be able to get out of the combat state once the weapons are withdrawn. Also the crossbow power discrepancy underwater vs above ground is borderline stupid!

The sound design- It's done well. It's atmospheric, and it sounds well, combat engagement themes are good. 

The map- It's...somewhat good- but I do wish my barber marker didnt disappear off the map unless i was close to one. 

The level design- Overall, all in all, mostly good. There can be some bad, and some really poorly designed levels that dissociate with whatever logic the buildup had, but most levels, the vast majority are well designed. 

The performance and stability- Awful. I've not had a game crash more than Witcher 3 in my whole life. As of review time, I can assure you atleast an hour was lost from random crashes in the inventory or loading screens, and a further hour caused by the progress lost during the abrupt crashes. It's not a very well performing game but it's not bad either in sheer performance outfit. What is awful though is the stability. Also microstutters really apparent, albeit very, very rarely. Infinite loading screens are a thing somehow in this game. It is also extremely buggy, that is not expected of a game thats been updated since 2015. Roach keeps clipping onto shit, sometimes Geralt freezes in the game, unable to move when I rapidly tab in and out of the photo utility. 


I do appreciate the game a lot, those were a fun 83 hours, but I wish it were more stable as an experience, because it does pull it out of the game. With that, I'd argue a 9/10 is well deserved, for a game as complete as an experience, minus the baffling number of bugs.",1705422277,1705422277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They say it's overrated because you are just searching for a person. Well, that sounds simple & stupid. Of course there is a plot & story changes, you meet new characters, doing favors but the main quest is to find one person. (Witchers are good trackers, LOL)

Story is perfect but the best in this game is the gameplay.
1) Witcher senses, the way you examine, track so you can solve the mystery, lift curses.
They say Batman is the greatest dedective... after Geralt
2)You can customise Geralt with haircuts, beards, weapons, armors and abilities.
You explore the world, find diagrams & craft weapons & armors
3)Spells, Oils for your swords & potions to make extra damage or to recieve less damade, breathe underwater more time etc. 
4)Beautifull economy system so you can have all above or... visit a brothel.

It is quite simply pure mastery of game design, with ultra-satisfying combat, an absolutely stunning world to explore, riveting lore quests and mythical beasts and monsters to discover, and one of the most epic stories ever put to video games in my 25+ years of gaming. 

I first owned this game when it released on PS4. The only major gripe I had with the game at the time were the absurdly long loading times (which became a pain if you died in the game). That being said, the game had me hooked and I was more than happy to repurchase the game again for PC and up the graphical HP of this game to new heights (and experience much better loading times). At that time, I had a GTX 1080Ti, which played the game wonderfully at 2K maxed out. 

This game does a tremendous job at completely immersing you in the world it creates. It's a game I can get lost in for hours and always find something even nearly 9 years later. Sure, the NPC character models can look a little funny as there are only a handful of NPC model designs created and re-used with different hair styles, eye colours and so on; and the way the characters stand or react when in a conversation can look a tad bit stiff; but other than that...the game holds up extremely well and is still plenty of fun, which is the most important thing.

The game also looks absolutely gorgeous, and it certainly helps now that there has been a remastered job done on the game with much higher resolution textures, better framerates and the introduction of Ray Tracing. All of this and more included in the remaster takes the game to an even higher level. On PS5, this game runs incredibly well at Performance Mode with a very stable 60FPS and some incredible retexturing. On my latest PC rig, with an RTX 4090, this game is insanely beautiful. 

If there is one thing I have noticed, however, is that even though the game can be run at native 4K at Ultra Settings, there is a lot of grain and noise in very kinetic assets such as foliage, trees and even Geralt's armour when he moves around. Apparently, this has something to do with the textures being at a much higher resolution and not entirely optimized that well for Native 4K. Either TAAU or DLSS seems to fix the issue, but it is a shame this hasn't been fully addressed yet, because the game can run perfectly well on Native. It's almost like the remaster is expected to be run with either TAAU or DLSS and Native was slightly overlooked. Just something to keep in mind. For now, until this issue is addressed and patched, some form of upscaling is expected to make sure the game runs with no sign of any visual artifacting. 

Nonetheless, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a timeless epic and is well worth full price even today.",1705286643,1705286643,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

What was it that I liked? A compelling story with easily perceivable influence on the world. Fantastic characters, each memorable and incredibly played out. Newly-introduced character progression system where you can get your build at level 25 and complete it at level 30-34. Incredible breathtaking locations with just the right amount of bloom and colour range. Most places have really good soundtracks.

But all of this is figured out already. Now after things one can find not as attractive.
Firstly, some of the quests behave unexpectedly, almost randomly. The ""Lord of Undvik"" quest - you can complete it without ever getting a quest marker or anything at all. The quest with the Novigrad serial killer - to avoid spoilers, let's just say you figure out who it is and yet you can get a forced ending on the quest upon a really minor dialogue option. Skellige has this weird quest where you deal with the werewolf for good and yet a certain friend of Ciri goes to fight him... what?

Now, locations. Why would the devs allow 60% of landmass be unplayable is beyond me. Using NVIDIA GeForce camera you can travel for minutes past the playable territory and encounter places you can't ever see from the playable zone. Why include them at all? No wonder things get hairy as far as performance goes. And the game would be at least 10Gb lighter without them. Sure, you might say ""Who cares, it's to make the world pretty and seamless"". Yes, I can somewhat get it with White Orchard or with Velen. But why leave so many islands in Skellige entirely empty? I counted at least a dozen. Surely, a monster nest and a guarded treasure on each would be more interesting than those half a hundred contraband markers. Then, some of the locations serve only for one quest or one point in the game. And it's fine of course, but... why would they do this to a major in-game location and territory which feels empty after main quest? Not to mention there is only one short soundtrack which is on an infinite loop. And this leads us to the next problem.

Something I found irritating is how almost all important NPCs disappear from the game once you are done with them. You are thus left alone in a world full of meaningless background characters with no way to chat with some of your friends. Why opt for this instead of leaving them be and writing maybe 5 minutes of lines for them? Does not seem too much after all the grandeur of the main questline.

At last, a minor detail. Why in the world would you do in-game gear sets if you can enjoy their set bonuses only by the end of the second DLC? Seriously though, why? I looked forward to having gear from a certain witcher school, only to again and again realise it is inferior in everything to regular yellow or orange armour. After finally getting the set bonus I only got around 2 hours of gameplay and it was criminally not enough time to enjoy it.

All in all, a legendary game, although it might not seem as much after you penetrate the veil of nostalgia surrounding it.",1705246272,1705246272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well maybe a little bit exaggerate, but all in my honest opinion. If were to count the game have been played, I would say most of AAA game title nowadays a tad bit(missed) and have lackluster [b]lore[/b]. The depth story to be told very immersive with addition of [b]strong and difficult[/b] language

How to make it sounds like it's no chores game.
[list]
    [*]Play once, twice or thrice within decent hours per week
    [*]Away from game when boredom come
    [*]Finish homework and turn back to game once it finished
    [*]The goal is not to achieve everything but adventuring
[/list]
A bit clunky control when combating, Attack speed skills matter. Well in the late game those are no problems. Found it turn up into easy mode even for Death March! Horsing is just very simulation of real world physics. Inertia mechanism.
Countless dialogues options. Well said have a good reason to replay again.
The best part of Blood & Wine is whole new breathtaking continent to be explored. Farm to heart content. and it optional to start fresh by playing DLC alone only.

[b]Witcher Trilogy[/b] ended almost perfect in all aspect overall.

I don't care if the developers were trying to be cinematic, lore-accurate, whatever... Wild Hunt's combat is atrociously convoluted and tedious. It's not an issue of complexity, but of disorganization. There is too much grinding and multitasking involved. I've played games that have found much better solutions for handling nuanced combat systems, and there are a lot of things Wild Hunt could have done much better than it did in this regard. Furthermore, as if all that isn't bad enough, Wild Hunt's combat animations themselves also work against the player. When performing melee attacks, Geralt acrobatically throws himself at the enemy. This is very problematic against groups of enemies because the player cannot maintain a strategic position.

the witcher 3: wild hunt, developed and published by cd projekt red, is a magnum opus in the open-world rpg genre. embarking on this journey, whether you're approaching it as a completionist like i did or not, is a exhilarating and deeply rewarding experience. from the moment you step into the vast and meticulously crafted world of the witcher series, you'll be captivated by its stunning visuals and attention to detail. the landscapes, character models, and ambient effects create a visually immersive environment that seamlessly blends realism with the fantastical elements of the witcher universe.

the narrative is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving a complex and morally gray tale that keeps players engaged from start to finish. every side quest, dialogue choice, and character interaction added layers to the overarching story. the choices made throughout the game have far-reaching consequences, ensuring that every decision feels weighty and impactful. honestly the sheer volume of quests can feel daunting at times. i want to assure you that literally every single questline is crafted with the upmost care and attention to detail. exploring every nook and cranny of the vast open world brought a sense of discovery and anticipation. uncovering hidden treasures, solving mysteries, and completing contracts for the various monster slaying i did kept the gameplay fresh and engaging.

geralt, the protagonist, is a complex and well-written character, maybe one of the best of all time. the relationships he forms with other characters, both major and minor, evolve dynamically based on player choices. completing character-specific quests and delving into their backgrounds adds depth to the overall experience, making the characters feel like real individuals with their own motivations and struggles. again, i can't overstate how truly epic and masterfully this is all done. 

gwent, the in-game tcg, is a delightful addition that can become something of a mini-obsession for 100% completionists. collecting every gwent card is almost enough for it's own game entirely, as you have to win tournaments, challenge characters with powerful decks, and manage to find every single card in the game. it's an amazing distraction from the main game and side stuff, which while great in their own rights, can benefit from diversions from time to time. the strategic depth of gwent itself as a trading card game is surprisingly addictive and complements the overall gaming experience.

despite the game's massive scale and expansive scope, the technical performance is remarkedly stable. the witcher 3 sets a benchmark for technical excellence, paired with the attention to detail in animation, voice acting, and sound design, contributes to a immersive atmosphere that elevated the player experience. in conclusion, this is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of what most people know as convention gaming. this is a truly unparalleled journey filled with challenges, choices, and rewards. the dedication to exploring every facet of the game is met with an abundance of content that consistently maintains a high standard of quality. the witcher 3 is not just a game, it's an epic adventure that sets a new standard for storytelling and world-building in the gaming industry.",1705115374,1705115374,True,3,0,0.539923965930938721,0,True,False,False

At this stage, I've spent around 30 hours in game so far & must admit I was a bit flummoxed by the skill tree to begin with, but seem to have gotten the hang of it now. The game controls are easy enough to get the hang of, (I classify myself as a gamer, with 1,000's of hours invested, but I believe even someone new to gaming would find the control system easy enough to use!). I'm also very much enjoying the story lines & learning more about all of the mythology. There's a lot of information out there in the world to find, if you're willing to search!

The combat can become somewhat repetitive, but there's so much in terms of player progression, varied loot and new, interesting biomes to explore, that it's not at all an issue. And, though not quite required, if you do decide to jump into all the aspects of combat given (potions, signs, etc.), there's plenty to keep any strategic mind occupied for a good minute.
To praise the characters a bit more, you really do care when even a side-quest requires parting with a known face, or even decide on a particularly important bit of their life. Those side-quests can also become part of the main experience, if you let them. They colour in the emptier bits of the map, and add for interesting background, head cannon even, when running through the main arc.
The one bit that I'll nag on is, oddly, the story. Though the individual adventures are great, I feel the overarching story is rather bland. What's worse, it starts to make less and less sense towards the end. Not to spoil anything, of course, but characters towards the end start acting irrational, not as they have through the rest of the game. This starts to show towards the very end, as the game starts dragging on, seemingly pushing for more bosses and further epic battles, effectively disregarding the ones that just occurred. And the characters seem to act for the benefit of pushing further into the fray, going for more epic-ness, instead of their regular logic.

Don't let that last bit distract you, though - this is a fantastic experience that enjoyed through and through. You do need to have an interest in these types of games (RPGs, I suppose?), as it's a long one.

You actually feel like this is a real world with real people, and not just another game to blow through for dopamine hits.

The world is huge and detailed and there's always someone or something to find around the next bend. You'll never be quite sure how you're going to shape it depending on your choices either. This huge world is full of monsters that want to kill you, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses that really feel rewarding when you play to them.

Back then when I was at high school this is the most expensive game that I bought with my allowance yet after hundreds of hours of immersion I had in this game it really feels like I still owe some more money to CD PROJEKT RED for this masterpiece that other companies would have priced even higher. Every aspect of this RPG game works in harmony, the decision making works well and some of them have an effect later in the game but the real deal is what choice you will make as most of the choices are not black and white (good and bad) most of them are grey choices that will test your morals. potions, oils and decoctions that you make can save you in dire situations and once utilized properly can help fight high level monsters at the hardest difficulty (Death March). The in-game growth of beard and the durability system for swords and armors makes your game play more realistic. Lastly there's also an addictive mini game called Gwent, a card game that involves in-game characters so you are playing a game within a game but you probably know it by now since Gwent memes became a popular gaming meme on the internet. These are the features that I've cherry-picked from the game and there are still a lot more features but with that being said if you like Role-playing then this game is a must have. I hope that there will be more games to be developed in the future that can cope up to the standards and high quality that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt offers to the table.

I've never been drawn by a game as much as The Witcher 3, the stories, the characters, the world, everything... This game is truly a masterpiece.

I played 35 hours just the past 5 days and I am only doing side quests. Many times I find myself wondering if I'm playing the main quest because of how good and detailed some of the side quests are, it is mind blowing. You find a random guy on the side of the road and you end up on a 2 hours journey killing beasts and discovering secrets.

The game captures a very dark theme but it also has just the perfect amount of funny into it. Some of the lines said by npcs or Geralt himself are just pure gold.

Without wanting to spoil, at one point you go back to Kaer Morhen and before going to bed, you have the option to spend a night with the boys and drink up. Please do me a favour and do not go to bed, you have to continue de scene until the end, it is extremely funny and I promise you will laugh alone in front of your screen, I commend CDPR for this scene, pure comedy.

[b] Good[/b]

+ Very good story and characters with many interesting choices, events, and dialogue. 
+ The world is vast and detailed, and full of stuff to do.
+ Great sidequests.
+ Many cool armor sets and weapons that you can craft or find in the world.
+ Graphics are still gorgeous, even more so with raytracing.
+ The DLC is the best content the game has to offer. Especially Blood and Wine which is essentially an entire new game. 
+ Mostly a bug free experience.


[b] Bad [/b]

- The beginning area of the game, White Orchard, was very slow and uninteresting. I almost dropped the game, but it gets much better once you reach the main overworld.
- Movement is pretty atrocious. Controlling Geralt feels like driving an old muscle car. Trying to move anywhere other than a straight line will result in him crashing into anything and everything. The horse controls are also completely terrible. 
- Combat is honestly kinda clunky. Its not terrible by any means, but it feels pretty heavy and imprecise. Blade oils are tedious until you figure out the auto oil setting exists. 
- I didn't like the skill tree. It takes forever to get points, and most of the early and mid skills feel pretty meaningless. If you dont grind levels, you will only start unlocking interesting skills near the end of the game which kinda sucks. 
- This might be a skill issue but the game is pretty bad at telling you things. For example, I didn't use the potion system until the midgame when I realized they are not consumables and are replenished for free. A lot of the early game (White Orchard) was spend stumbling around kinda having no idea what is happening. I also did not play Witcher 1 or 2, so it took a little bit to figure out who everyone was (Dont let that stop you from playing Witcher 3 tho).

You also basically can't do anything at all with any of the unnamed NPCs besides look at them and hear two lines of repeated dialogue and you can't really be evil at all outside of a few officially sanctioned choices because it's ""not in Geralt's character"" meanwhile Geralt's character has actual lore to explain why it is so generic. Playing Geralt is the worst of both worlds, he's too generic to be an interesting character and too much of a character to let you do what you want. The narrative (aside from Geralt) and how pretty the environment is are basically the only two parts that are good which almost makes me wish it was a TV show... well ok they ruined that. At least there's YouTube videos compiling the cutscenes into a ""movie"" which would probably be a more entertaining experience than actually playing the game because none of the game part of it is really any good. Skyrim has a great degree of interactivity in exploration and the sandbox. Games like The Outer Worlds and Baldur's Gate 3 have a great degree of interactivity in how you role play. Even CDPR's own Cyberpunk 2077 strikes a pretty good balance between those things.

From the moment I stepped into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia in this third installment, I was captivated by the sheer brilliance that unfolded across every facet of the game.

The gameplay, a seamless blend of fluid combat mechanics and intricate decision-making using the Witcher signs, immerses players into a dynamic and ever-evolving world. The responsive controls and strategic depth of combat provide a visceral experience, making each encounter a thrilling challenge. The open-world exploration is a testament to the game's meticulous design, with every nook and cranny brimming with life and detail.

The narrative woven throughout The Witcher 3 is a masterclass in storytelling, intertwining complex character arcs with a rich, mature narrative. Geralt's journey to find his adopted daughter, Ciri, is an emotional rollercoaster, filled with moral ambiguity, political intrigue, and personal sacrifice. The characters themselves are crafted with such depth and authenticity that they breathe life into the narrative, creating an emotional resonance that lingers long after the game is turned off.

And also worldbuilding in The Witcher 3 is nothing short of awe-inspiring. The vast open world of the Continent is a living, breathing entity, teeming with diverse landscapes, bustling cities, and hidden secrets. The attention to detail, from the architecture of Novigrad to the untamed beauty of Skellige, is nothing short of breathtaking. Every corner of the world tells a story, and the lore is so richly textured that it enriches the overall experience, creating a sense of immersion that is second to none.

Accompanying this visual feast is the beautiful musical score, composed by Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz. The music is a symphony of emotions, perfectly complementing the game's atmosphere and heightening the impact of key moments. From the melancholic tunes that accompany Geralt's introspective moments to the adrenaline-pumping combat themes, the soundtrack is a crucial element that elevates the overall experience to new heights. Making it one of the best Videogame Soundtracks to ever be created.

The Hearts of Stone DLC and Blood and Wine expansion are not mere add-ons; they are vibrant extensions of an already remarkable universe. Weaving captivating storys that serve as a fitting epilogue to Geralt's journey. 

(Only time will tell what and who the next Witcher game will be about).

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not just a game; it's an experience that set the standard for what an RPG can achieve. Its seamless integration of gameplay, narrative, worldbuilding, and music creates an immersive experience that lingers in the heart of every player, cementing The Witcher 3 as a timeless classic that will be remembered for generations to come.

Dont forget about the dlc expansions Hearts of Stone, and Blood and Wine *mewh* mastery at its finest. The Witcher 3 is possibly my favorite game! First started playing on xbox when it was released, fast forward to now, playing on pc. The game is 10x better not only visually but its the nostalgia.

Everything around me was alive. I am not a person who can be easily convinced. But The Witcher 3 has earned it. And trust me when I say they have earned it as I have played almost every Single Player RPG title there is, both linear and open world. But The Witcher 3 has redefined what open world video game means and many open world game developers have followed their footsteps. It has changed the way video games work forever and went beyond.

The attention to detail in the world is phenomenal. The breathtaking story of this game offers choices that you can make will directly impact the entire story, the characters and the world around you. Not many games actually do it, much as they'd claim.

The characters are unforgettable and feels so personal, with a gaming map so big, yet so dense and interactive, makes it a truly successful quantity with quality open world game. It has cleverly managed the skill and alchemy system.

And in the Blood & Wine DLC they welcomed us with a new character mutagen system which is awesome. The two story expansion DLCs which are by the way, widely considered as the best DLCs in the history of DLCs, are so massive and rich that they could have been easily two separate random masterpiece games themselves.

It's too much content for a single game and we certainly do not deserve a game this good for a price of a single game. Yet, here it is, right in front of you to explore. Play it, cherish it, love it or hate it while you still can, while you are still alive! Thank you CDPR, for everything.

These scars long have yearned for your tender caress
To bind our fortunes, damn what the stars own
Rend my heart open, then your love profess
A winding, weaving fate to which we both atone

Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep
 
The wolf I will follow into the storm
To find your heart, its passion displaced
By ire ever growing hardening into stone
Amidst the cold to hold you in a heated embrace
 
You flee my dream come the morning
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep
 
I know not if fate would have us live as one
Or if by love's blind chance we've been bound
The wish I whispered, when it all began
Did it forge a love you might never have found?

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has undoubtedly earned its place as one of the greatest games of all time, and it has effortlessly secured a spot in my personal top ten games list. CD Projekt has crafted a gaming experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional RPGs, delivering an immersive and captivating journey that will stay with me for years to come.

From the moment I stepped into the vast open world of The Witcher 3, I was spellbound by the sheer beauty and attention to detail. The landscapes are breathtaking, ranging from dense forests and bustling cities to eerie swamps and towering mountain ranges. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle contribute to an ever-changing environment that enhances the realism of the game.

What truly sets The Witcher 3 apart, however, is its narrative depth and character development. Geralt of Rivia, the stoic and charismatic protagonist, is expertly portrayed, with nuanced emotions and a compelling personality. The supporting cast is equally well-crafted, each character contributing to a rich and complex tapestry of storytelling. Every decision I made felt impactful, shaping the world and characters around me, leading to multiple branching storylines and endings.

The quest design is nothing short of brilliant, with side quests that are as engaging as the main storyline. Each quest is a mini-epic, filled with moral dilemmas, unexpected twists, and memorable moments. The attention to detail in world-building and lore is astounding, making every corner of the game feel alive with history and intrigue.

The combat system is fluid and responsive, offering a satisfying blend of swordplay, magic, and alchemy. Geralt's abilities can be customized to suit different playstyles, allowing for a tailored experience that keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting. The monsters and creatures you encounter are beautifully designed, each posing a unique challenge that requires strategic thinking and skillful execution.

The Witcher 3's soundtrack deserves special mention, as it masterfully complements the game's atmosphere. The sweeping orchestral pieces and haunting melodies enhance the emotional impact of key moments, drawing players deeper into the world of The Continent.

The game's post-launch support, including the outstanding expansions like Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, further demonstrates CD Projekt's commitment to delivering exceptional content. These expansions are not mere add-ons but expansive narratives in their own right, offering hours of additional gameplay and enriching the overall experience.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a triumph in every aspect. Its unparalleled combination of stunning visuals, compelling storytelling, and immersive gameplay make it a timeless masterpiece that deserves a place in every gamer's library. If you haven't experienced the epic journey of Geralt of Rivia, do yourself a favor and embark on this unforgettable adventure. The Witcher 3 is not just a game; it's a masterpiece of fantasy gaming that sets a new standard for the genre.",1704531299,1704531299,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics run extremely well even on third world systems
Graphics are gorgeous
Music is composed well and perfectly implemented
Story is written well and executed well
Voice actors did a decent job. No token voices/slang that is out of place, no wanker streamers voices included for a boost in marketing
Romance with no gayness = no awkward moments for 97% of players
No ""agenda/token"" characters that don't belong in the game or in the time period simply to satisfy sensitive ""equality"" c()nts
Character models done very well. Women look feminine, men look manly. 
DLCs are icing on the cake
OG Gwent in game is much better than the pay-to-win nonsense that released as a stand alone game years later.

Patch 4.0 was FREE and made the game even better

You can hate my review but you can't hate the game. This game is a solid 10/10.

The side quests are probably the standout of it, you can probably count all mindless fetch quests on the fingers of your one palm. I heard some people had issues with the combat and though they aren't made up from nothing, I loved it trough my all near 800 hours counting ps4. Can't forget the DLC which in my opinion are the best in whole industry, the story of Hearts of Stone has so many inspirations and callbacks to different media and still holds up on its own.

The immense detail in the world and writing. Just look on youtube at how many different variations of scenes there are, how many small conversations that are able to be had depending on your choices. The story is phenomenal and has excellent pacing with characters you care and love for. Not to mention on just how well the game has held up. It's been nearly 10 years since this game came out and the visuals still hold up to this day. Look out of Kaer Morhan... look out in skellige. It's astounding how they have created such an artstyle that still holds up. And then on top of that all, you have possibly two of the best DLC's made. Both expand on gameplay elements, have their own great stories, and one has even a whole new zone. 

Of everything the only thing I have to complain about is the combat, and even then it's not bad. It's fairly repetitive and is only as deep as you make it. You can easily go fully into builds and such but none of that is required to beat the game on any difficulty and you can easily get through it with mashing light attack. The only other minor complaint is the one thing that's not quite held up is the dialouge animations. They are all stiff and some have such piss poor variations (Looking at you every dwarf being crossarmed). 

But none of that matters. If you're looking for a world to sink hours into this is the game for you. If you love RPG's this is the game for you. Even if you don't really like RPG's I say give it a shot, wait for it to go on sale.",1704356514,1704356514,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've tried to convince her, extolling its virtues, the captivating narrative, the beautifully woven quests, and the sheer depth of its characters. Alas, it seems she's carved her own path in the RPG landscape.

Perhaps the allure of The Witcher's fantastical world isn't quite her cup of mead. Or maybe she's holding out for her own personal reasons. As a parent, I can only marvel at the game's brilliance and hope that someday she'll be drawn into Geralt's mesmerizing adventures. Until then, I'll cherish my solo quests in this mesmerizing universe, leaving a spot open for her, should she ever decide to embark on this unforgettable journey.",1704334120,1704334120,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After putting 101 hours into it, I can say that as well. From my 2023 perspective, this game holds up amazingly well. It doesn't feel outdated to play, the next-gen update makes the game look amazing, and the story and its writing is fantastic as well (though a lot of the lore/story I kinda had to assume because it does draw heavily from the story of the other 2 games). The things I would say I did not like were the fast travel system, the lack of usefulness of many of the game's potions and ""skill tree"" traits, and of course like any open world game the numerous annoying glitches I encountered. 

I recommend playing the other 2 first, but it isn't 100% necessary to understand who's who or what's going on in a broad sense. The first DLC ""Hearts of Stone"" is okay, but the second one ""Blood and Wine"" absolutely blows that out of the water by several degrees, it truly is a fantastic addition to the game. IMPORTANT: Play the latter DLC AFTER the game's main story is done, as it heavily over-levels you and makes the ending sequence more trivial and thus less impactful.

All in all, if you like a really good fantasy story, solid 3rd-person melee-magic combat (for its time), and great scenery, I would buy this game plus its two DLCs, or at least the second one.",1704331874,1704331874,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Greetings, fellow gamers and inhabitants of the mystical lands! I am Scootaloo, a 19-year-old school-age Pegasus pony hailing from the icy world of HowlStrom. As a fervent gamer who has journeyed through many virtual realms, I bring you my in-depth and dramatic review of ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"" a game that has captivated my spirit and challenged my wits.

[h2]Embarking on the Journey[/h2]
In ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"" developed by CD PROJEKT RED, I stepped into the boots of Geralt of Rivia, a monster-slaying mercenary. The game's vast, war-torn, and monster-infested world reminded me of the harsh, unyielding landscapes of HowlStrom, where survival is a daily struggle.

[h3]Gameplay: A Symphony of Sword and Sorcery[/h3]
The Witcher 3's gameplay is a masterful blend of open-world exploration, intense combat, and deep storytelling. As I navigated through this rich and complex world, I felt a kinship with Geralt, a character as multifaceted and resilient as the Pegasus ponies of HowlStrom.

[i]Combat and Exploration[/i]: The game's combat system is both brutal and balletic, a dance of death that demands skill and strategy. Exploring the expansive world, from the rustic villages to the majestic mountains, was akin to soaring over the frosty peaks of HowlStrom, feeling the icy wind beneath my wings.

[i]Story and Characters[/i]: The narrative is a tapestry woven with intrigue, emotion, and the struggles of its characters. Geralt's quest to find Ciri, the child of prophecy, is fraught with moral dilemmas and heart-wrenching choices, mirroring the epic tales told in the halls of HowlStrom.

[h3]Visual and Audio Splendor[/h3]
The game's visuals are a feast for the eyes, with breathtaking landscapes and meticulously detailed characters. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, composed by Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz and Mikolai Stroinski, resonates with the soulful melodies sung during the long nights in HowlStrom.

[h3]Evaluating The Witcher 3[/h3]
As I traversed the perilous world of The Witcher 3, I was struck by the game's profound impact on me. It's a rare gem that transcends the medium, becoming a part of one's very essence, much like the ancient magic that flows through HowlStrom.

[b]Strengths[/b]:
- Engrossing narrative that captivates the heart
- Exhilarating combat that challenges the mind
- A vast world rich in lore and beauty
- Deeply complex characters, each with their own story

[b]Weaknesses[/b]:
- Occasional technical glitches that break immersion
- Some quests can feel overwhelming in their complexity

[h3]Scootaloo's Final Verdict[/h3]
""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" is not just a game; it's an odyssey of the heart and soul. Its impact on me is as profound as the ancient legends of HowlStrom.

[b]Rating[/b]: [i]9.5 out of 10 HowlStrom Stars[/i]

In conclusion, ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" is a masterpiece that every gamer should experience. It is a journey that will stay with you long after you've set down your controller, much like the eternal winters of HowlStrom.

The attention to detail and actual consequences for your quest choices (and 15 different endings I hear) as well as difficult morally grey decisions make it an immersive world that will pull you in and make you think about every choice.  Combat takes a bit of getting used to as its all third person if you are used to first person games but take the first map and quests slow and you will get used to it after a few hours.  Best option seems to me to play in story mode first and then come back to do the hard mode challenge for the achievement (that's my plan anyway :)  

If you get the next gen update things look amazing so don't let the 2015 release date dissuade you.  Had to turn settings down a bit for stable FPS on my older rig but it still looks amazing.

Will probably come back and try the first 2 in the series after I finish this one.

The story and world design is among the best Ive ever seen in a game. There are a multitude of different varied enemies all with their own weaknesses and strategies and their own backstories. The characters are written very well and are relatable, I often felt bad for some of the more unfortunate characters. The different ""rituals"" that Geralt uses to defeat the various monsters are very interesting and feel like they have been inspired by real world legends/traditions. 

My only complaints of this game is that sometimes the controls can feel clunky, especially during combat. For example you have to wait for Geralt to finish his attack animation before opening your tool menu and it can get annoying at times. Also the dodging and rolling can use some refinement. Sometimes when fighting multiple enemies I would take damage from a melee attack when it was clearly a miss. Some monsters can just instantly attack you with little to no telegraphing and break your combo. 

Overall however I would still give this game a solid 8/10 and would consider it a must play for anyone that likes fantasy games or rpgs.",1703367520,1704174917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend this game to everyone! [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] has an engaging story in a beautiful open world and gives you the freedom to make impactful decisions in both combat and dialogue.",1644122755,1704162643,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Well, now It's the perfect time to play if you haven't yet. It's basically finished in terms of all the DLC and updates. You can play it now and have the full complete experience - and it's awesome. Grab it on sale and don't skimp on the DLC, it's fantastic.

Next up, they're working on releasing serious mod tooling which will probably be released next year. In a few years you can come back to it and hopefully have some excellent community created content to explore.

That's not to say there isn't mods you can use right now, mostly smaller quality of life stuff. Check the Nexus and look for mods that have been updated sometime since July, 2023 or later. Those are most likely to work with the current version of the game. They might mention Next-Gen in the title or description.

Have fun!

I will now proceed to tell you random tips and tricks I wish I knew when I started playing:
[list]
[*] Don't sell your Witcher Gear, that's the green colored items that come from various Witcher schools. They can later be upgraded into some of the best armor in the game. Put them in your stash if you don't need them right now.
[*] When you get too close to the edge of the world it'll open the map, you can then fast travel anywhere or close the map to be put near where you were but pointed in the right direction.
[*] Stuff sells for more if you're talking to the vendor that specializes in that item.
[*] When you're getting attacked underwater you can use your crossbow and kill them in one shot.
[*] When you're just starting out loot and sell everything for cash.
[*] If you hold your crossbow button you can manually aim, but if you just tap it it'll autoaim. Manually aimed headshots do more damage.
[*] You might get a bad ending if you romance both love interests. 
[*] Buy recipes from the shops.
[*] Play Gwent, it's fun and addictive.
[*] If you want to collect all the Gwent cards then play everyone right away, you might not get a chance to later as the story progresses.
[*] Summon your horse faster by looking in the opposite direction you want him to spawn.
[*] Use Quen and when you get damaged back up and use it again.
[*] Read, or at least open all the books and notes and then sell them.
[*] It's not like other games where you craft potions, use them and craft more, rather your potions will be replenished for free when you use the meditate function.
[*] If you want to hunt animals for food, you can just run into them with your horse and they'll die.
[*] You can loot a monster nest after you blow it up!
[*] You'll obtain a lot of useless currency that you can exchange into real money at Vivaldi‚Äôs Bank in Novigrad.
[*] If you find a ""Place of Power"" use it to get a buff, and also an ability point the first time you use it.
[*] Don't worry about how you spec your character at first. You can use a ""Potion of Clearance"" to respec your character later.
[*] You can steal stuff, just run away from the guards and they'll forget about you.
[*] Use Axii on a wild horse and it'll be yours to ride.
[*] If you're in a boat you can fast travel to docks.
[*] Save early, save often.
[*] Buy every gwent card you see from shops.
[*] When you're unlocking skills with ability points, you need to equip that ability by dragging it over to the open slots on the right or it won't do anything for you.

Gwent is more addicting than fisstech. The next gen update makes an already beautiful game even more so. The world is immersive and fun to explore. The characters are intriguing. The choices are engaging, difficult, and sometimes haunting. The world feels alive and you feel apart of the world rather than some omnipotent god changing everything to your will. The combat is fun and makes you want to learn more things to unlock more options to change your experience.

You won't get bored at all even though you will be doing a lot of travelling but the way the world is constructed makes up for the travel. One of the many games where you will avoid fast travelling at every expense and will actually take time to traverse through the nooks and crannies of the map, even the little ones.

A lot of good talk from my side, but if you still don't believe it, give it a try yourself. Bet you won't refund it!

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt stands as a magnum opus in the realm of role-playing games, delivering an unparalleled gaming experience that transcends its genre. Developed by CD Projekt Red, this masterpiece is a testament to the studio's commitment to storytelling, world-building, and player immersion.

From the moment you step into the vast and meticulously crafted world of The Witcher 3, you are engulfed in a rich narrative that weaves together political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and personal quests. As Geralt of Rivia, the titular Witcher, players embark on an emotional and thrilling journey to find Geralt's adopted daughter, Ciri, pursued by the mysterious and otherworldly Wild Hunt.

The game's narrative prowess is only matched by its breathtaking open-world design. The Continent, a sprawling land filled with dense forests, bustling cities, and treacherous swamps, feels alive and teeming with stories to uncover. Every nook and cranny is meticulously detailed, creating an immersive environment that encourages exploration and rewards curiosity.

What truly sets The Witcher 3 apart is its morally gray storytelling. Choices matter, and the consequences of your decisions ripple through the narrative, shaping the world and relationships around you. Characters are not simply black or white; they are complex and multifaceted, making every interaction a moral dilemma that leaves a lasting impact on the story.

Combat in The Witcher 3 is both fluid and challenging. Geralt's combat style, a dance of swordplay, magic, and alchemy, is a joy to master. The monster-hunting contracts, epic boss battles, and dynamic encounters keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. The alchemical system, where potions, oils, and bombs play a crucial role, adds depth to the strategic aspect of combat.

The game's audiovisual presentation is a feast for the senses. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack sets the tone for each moment, whether it be an intense battle or a quiet stroll through the wilderness. The attention to detail in character design, animation, and environmental graphics is nothing short of breathtaking, elevating The Witcher 3 to a cinematic experience.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a triumph of storytelling, world-building, and gameplay mechanics. CD Projekt Red has crafted a game that transcends its medium, delivering an emotional and unforgettable experience for players. Whether you're a fan of fantasy, RPGs, or simply exceptional storytelling, The Witcher 3 is a must-play that will leave an indelible mark on your gaming journey.",1704042150,1704042150,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

One thing I'd like to highlight is I had to attempt the game twice before I got hooked on it. I didn't play the other 
Witchers, so at first I played the intro then dropped the game, a few months later I beat the intro and got hooked big time. I've never been so excited to come home and progress in a single player game since Skyrim came out. 

Every single little side quest you do has some sort of deep backstory and content to it, there are very little boring fetch quests, and the combat is the perfect balance of challenging and forgiving. Both DLC's are absolutely amazing, one of them opens up a whole new map with new enemies and environments, and the other had a gripping storyline that had a great ending. This game was made with love and then some, 70 hours in and I still have MUCH to do. 

All in all, buy it.

Story, quests, wandering around the map, searching for treasure and adventure are so nice. There are several outcomes you can choose from by interacting with the NPCs differently while you play through the main quests and storyline. The landscape, the weather animation and so on are breathtaking. The Devs really poured a lot of effort and heart into this game, and I love the game in the game, gwent rocks, hunting for cards in this game is fun too.

There are only minor graphical errors, for example, if Geralt sits down, sometimes his cloak/armor doesn't fold right, and if you see the light armor gloves up close, they are way too thick, but those are just nitpicking details.

On many fronts, The Witcher 3 shows an incredible care and craftsmanship, given how detailed the world is makes a lot of sense considering this world started to span from the ink of a pen decades ago.

The characters are well written and the amount of voice acting that has been done in multiple languages is truly tremendous.

Personally, the world of The Witcher partially lost me after two dozen hours or so. Simply put the consequences of my choices were very often unclear, situations where they were vague at best became a frustrating occurrence.

The game's mechanics took a big hit due to the length as well for me,  I personally started to get uninterested in combat after my 30 first hours, my perks were pretty much all set and I should have probably changed the difficulty as passionate fans seem to find a high amount of value and strategy in the higher difficulties.

Although this was not one of my personal favorite experiences this is one of those games that deserve to objectively be praised as a masterpiece. I believe that on every front, from artistic direction to pure game design not many miss steps are taken. On top of that the developers added an incredible post launch support that I have rarely seen put into place for a single player only title.

Who knows maybe some year in the future I will attempt a new game + on a higher difficulty haha.

I say this with all certainty, most of the negative reviews only concern themselves with a single point of the game ""the combat"" others find the ""combat difficult and not noob friendly"" which doesn't make sense, because the game's combat is the most simple as it exists.
And I put this in this way because they find the shared analyzes ridiculous, since the games that have come out since the Anthem Syndrome will only come out with poorly made games, without any structure in the story, characters with weak backgrounds and the Witcher not only the game but its entire universe They deserve to be highlighted as excellent games to set an example of a good game or what makes it good.

(History Overall and Characters)
- From start to finish, I'm speechless, every choice you make, good or bad, has an absurd impact on the characters and the ending of the game itself, the Witcher 3 is the continuation of the previous games where it brings back notable characters from past games.
The game manages to convey the same feeling of being present in that world, of actually living the daily life of a witcher and of making tough decisions at critical moments. Only reading lovers could understand this feeling of truly entering this world. 
Only reading lovers will be able to understand this feeling, we end up feeling like we are really inside the story of the characters and the world itself, it's not for nothing that great games end up being based on Books already made.
And despite this, we ended up becoming interested in wanting to know more about the game's world, I was one of the people who fell into Witcher 3, I never got to touch 1 and 2 but I had already seen something, and when it's finished I will definitely give it a leap forward in previous franchises, I don't expect the same level as Witcher 3.

{Combat and Mechanics}
The combat is not very challenging, with just a few hours to minutes you can understand the basic mechanics, which end up being a reason for many to ignore the game, despite this I found the style of combat that the game gives us interesting. The character's movement ends up being buggy and not synchronized with the game's NPCs, often when dodging or attacking an NPC who is in stun, you still take damage even if the enemy NPC is doing an attack animation and it is cancelled.
Even so, I don't find combat boring, I always experiment with ways to try and make it fun, always using combat tactics to simulate that I really am a real witcher.

{Graphics and performance}
The graphics and the world itself are full of details and things to do, compared to some games where they make you walk 500 km to do something and I find it boring, if I walk around the game every now and then there is always some interaction or special event with someone NPC leaving more and more curiosity and desire to explore new rare or unknown interactions.
Performance, although some have reported problems even with PCs at the same level as mine, I have never encountered problems resulting from poor performance, crashes, corrupted saves, etc. 
I even consider Witcher 3 to be an excellent, very well optimized game.

(Side Quests and DLC)
In some games we can consider that the side quests are literally to fill you up and make you waste game time, but in this game all the side quests are for you to do, I believe that the contract missions where you have to kill some monsters are not have so much impact but completing missions will give you the possibility to interact with new characters that can affect the main quest in general. Honestly, I wasn't bored with the side quests, which even surprised me.
The game's expansions are excellent, nothing to criticize them for, and I'm sorry they didn't make an expansion of the Blue Mountains area where at the end of the Bloody Baron's quest he ended up heading off with his wife.

Try the game, stop being silly about the combat, if you think the story is horrible, start considering reading some books and opening your mind on that aspect.",1633876159,1703943299,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A game worthy of it's praise and high ratings.

The story- enticing, full of life, unexpected events and important details you're allowed to miss.
The characters- indistinguishable from humans, filled with real emotions, attachments to people and ideals.
And you too, will become attached to them; often seconds before you decide their fate; and the direction of the story, as you have a wild variety of options and endings to choose from.

The combat is designed with the players' interest in combat itself. Should you wish to play as realistically as possible, you'll choose the hardest difficulty and approach each encounter with care and preparation (potions and oils pair well with studying the beastiary). 
Should you come here mainly for the story, the easiest difficulty will still make sure you don't feel overpowered and encourage tactics.

The combat may look simple, but there's plenty to learn. Overconfidence may lead you to a quick defeat. Many times, I've thought myself a legendary witcher- only to go  headfirst into a pack of thugs or drowners. An unlucky hit is all you need to get taught a lesson by Dr. Stunlock. 
Dodge for monsters.
Block for humans.
Enter a fist fight championship with a bear. 

And the final praise- you need not grind if you don't want to. <3",1703932773,1703932773,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Played in GOG first, now on steam, just for the record.

Some tips:

Don't forget to also equip your skills after acquiring them. Skill points can be reset with a Potion of Clearance available from certain merchants for 1,000 crowns each.

Skull-level enemies aren't generally worth the trouble as the reward will likely be unusable or scale to your level anyway.

Don't get too burned out going for every ? on the map, especially in Skellige where many of them are just smuggler's caches located in the sea. On the other hand, not all places of interests are marked with a ?, so explore a bit and keep an eye out for suspicious-looking spots on your map.

Axii works best in dialogue when the target is alone, using it in front of others has higher odds of things going awry. The tier 1 Sign ability Delusion is required to pass higher level Axii checks in dialogue.

Gwent-playing merchants and innkeepers reward you with a card when you beat them for the first time, and many cards can also be bought directly from stores. A man near St. Gregory's Bridge in Novigrad sells a book that lets you keep track of which areas still have Gwent cards to be won.

The contents of read books are stored in your journal, so non-quest books can be sold safely.

There are two ""points of no return"" in the game, but they are very obviously signposted.

You can loot monster nests after you destroy them.

Make use of the Bestiary to find the best ways to fight each enemy type.

Make heavy use of your Potions, Bombs and Oils as they only need to be crafted once after which strong alcohol items (which are practically infinite) will automatically replenish them when resting.

Decoctions are replenished with Alcohest, though their heavy Toxicity makes them harder to use outside of Alchemy builds.

Getting surrounded will get you killed. Control fights and stay at the edges of them. Two rolls back is a great distance to throw a bomb from, to replenish a sign, to reload your crossbow, etc.

The crossbow will automatically aim towards a targeted enemy even without manual aiming. It's also your only method of slaying enemies underwater.

Hold down the attack button while on horseback to slow down time and make it easier to land hits.",1640672623,1703860948,True,3,1,0.508379876613616943,0,True,False,False

The combat in this game is really fun and engaging, thanks to the amount of ""tools"" and weapons avalible to you, Oils, bombs, potions, crossbows etc. Sadly, as main weapons, the only really good options are the 2 swords, but this is because of the lore and immersion. Armors look good, and there are a lot, suitable for different playstyles.
The crafting system is a bit generic, but perfectly fine and immersive for this game. 
What is annoying here is the constant need to repair your gear, it is just an extra chore, and it does not anything meaningful to the game experience.
The talent system is really simplified, with few actually good options, and even from the unlocked talents, it is limited how many you can set to active, so making unique builds, really going in depth with character customization is missing from this game.
The questing experience is really great, though the investigation part of these is really simplified, so you don't really need to use your brain.
Exploring the world is a really great experience, with lot of stuff to discover, monsters to hunt, treasures, hidden quests to find, making it really rewarding.
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- GRAPHICS --[/b]
The world, the characters the monsters all look amazing and the artstyle really fits the dark fantasy of the witcher games.
[b]10/9[/b]

[b]-- SOUNDS --[/b]
The voice acting, the music, the ambient sounds are all a perfect match.
[b]10/10[/b]

[b]-- STORY && CHARACTERS --[/b]
The story continues the previous games, taking your old saves into account. It is a great, immersive story, which can easily pull you in, and make you excited.
The storytelling, the pacing is really great, it is something that hard to achieve.
The complex, interesting characters, elavate the experience, making this, one of the best fantasy stories in video gaming.
[b]10/10[/b]

[b]-- REPLAYABILITY --[/b]
There is new game+, different difficulties, and tons of different choices with different outcomes which can make replaying the game interesting.
[b]10/7[/b]

[b]--TL;DR--[/b]
The Witcher 3 is one of the greatest RPG in video game history, with fun immersive gameplay, a great story and a huge amazing gameworld to explore and lose ourselves in.

While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".

And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?

And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feeling I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.

Dive into The World:
Picture this ‚Äì a massive open world filled with gritty cities, creepy swamps, and lush landscapes. The Witcher universe isn't your typical fantasy setting; it's dark, it's dirty, and it's damn captivating. You're Geralt of Rivia, a stoic and contemplative badass monster hunter with a silver sword and a tongue sharper than the blade. Get ready to navigate political intrigue, tangle with mythical creatures, and make choices that'll haunt you.

The Witcher 3:
Now, let's talk about the game itself. Clocking in at a solid 100+ hours, it's not a sprint; it's a marathon. The main game is a rollercoaster of emotions, and if you throw in the Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine expansions, you've got yourself an RPG feast.

Pros:
1) Epic Storytelling: It's like a Netflix binge but in game form ‚Äì gripping, unpredictable, and addictive.
2) Monsters Galore: Seriously, the creatures you face are nightmare fuel, and it's awesome.
3) Beautiful Chaos: The graphics are a visual treat, and the environments range from hauntingly eerie to jaw-droppingly gorgeous.

Cons:
1) Learning Curve: Don't be surprised if you fumble a bit at the start.
2) Glitches Happen: Every now and then, Geralt might decide to dance instead of fight.

In a nutshell, The Witcher 3 isn't just a game; it's a freakin' experience. Get ready to lose sleep, make questionable choices, and fall in love with a world that's as dangerous as it is beautiful.",1703754207,1703754207,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The World:
This world is so stunningly real, I occasionally check outside to make sure I'm not actually in a medieval fantasy. The landscapes? So beautiful, they make real life look like a low-budget indie film. Every village, city, and creepy crawly forest is a feast for the senses,  and occasionally, a feast for the monsters trying to nibble on me.

The Gameplay:
Combat here is like a dance if the dance involved slicing and dicing things that definitely don't want to tango. It's the kind of fun that's only slightly less dangerous than juggling chainsaws. And Gwent, it's the digital equivalent of potato chips. Can't play just one round.

The Story:
Epic? More like epic on steroids. It's a rollercoaster of emotions with more twists than a pretzel factory. Geralt, our gruff, silverhaired hero, has more depth than a philosophy book, and the plot lines are so engaging, you'll forget what a social life is.

Final Thoughts:
If you haven't played The Witcher 3, what are you even doing? it's an escape to a world so rich, you'll consider paying taxes there",1703695832,1703695832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played many big world games like Assassin's Creed or GTA, but I got tired of them after roaming around for a few days after I've done all the types of missions (steal, follow someone in stealth, kill a group of people, etc).

The Witcher 3 is the only game that keeps me coming back again and again, even after I leave it for a few months as I get busy, because the combats are hard and very satisfying. Almost any fight with a big beast feels like a boss fight and they have unique patterns of attack that you must learn to beat them.

-Every side quest feels like a MAIN quest
-Every character feels real, you will fall in love with them (and do 'other' things with them ;)
-Filled with politics, moral and ethical dilemmas - You will have to make choices you don't want to make, but sometimes doing something is better than doing nothing at all.
-Every action has a consequence 
-The Tax Man will come after you if you're doing something you're not suppose to be doing
-Make sure to prepare for every monster hunt
-You can negotiate the price of jobs and exploit peasants in desperate need for more money
-Don't go around killing every monster you see. First check the job board to exploit the local peasants.
-Become a Card Game Master, participate in Gwant Card tournaments and become the King of Games

[h3]Introduction:[/h3]

Enter a world where the line between fantasy and reality blurs, and where the choices you make carve out your destiny. ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" is not just a game; it's an immersive journey through a meticulously crafted universe, where every decision weighs heavy and every monster you slay echoes through the vast landscapes of its open world.

[h3]Graphics and Visual Splendor: [/h3]

From the moment you step into the Northern Realms, you're greeted with a visual feast that transcends mere gaming graphics. The attention to detail is jaw-dropping; each tree branch, every drop of rain, and the flicker of candlelight in the darkest corners of the world are rendered with a level of precision that sets a new standard for open-world games. The sunsets over Novigrad and the moonlit swamps of Velen are not just backdrops; they're canvases of digital artistry.

[h3]Narrative Depth and Player Agency:[/h3]

At the heart of ""The Witcher 3"" lies a narrative that's not just epic in scale but deeply personal. Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf, is no traditional hero. He's a complex character with a history, emotions, and moral dilemmas. The game doesn't shy away from presenting you with choices that have consequences, both immediate and far-reaching. Every dialogue option, every action, shapes the world and the relationships within it. Your decisions don't just affect the story; they shape its very fabric.

[h3]Open World and Exploration: [/h3]

The open-world design of ""The Witcher 3"" is a triumph. The vastness of the map isn't just for show; it's a living, breathing world teeming with life. Every village, cave, and castle tells a story. Whether you're tracking a monster through the dense forests of Skellige or engaging in political intrigue in the busy streets of Novigrad, there's always something to discover. The game rewards curiosity, turning exploration into a narrative in itself.

[h3]Combat and Monster Hunting: [/h3]

Combat in ""The Witcher 3"" is a dance of steel and magic. Geralt's fluid movements and the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal make every encounter unique. Monster hunting is not just a task; it's an art. Each creature requires a specific strategy, and preparing for a hunt is as crucial as the battle itself. The thrill of facing a griffin in the highlands or a werewolf under the light of the full moon is an experience that lingers long after the battle is won.

[h3]Musical Score and Atmosphere: [/h3]

The haunting melodies composed by Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz elevate the atmosphere to new heights. The music not only complements the game's emotional beats but also enhances the sense of place. From the melancholic tunes of Velen to the heroic anthems of Skellige, the soundtrack is a symphony that weaves seamlessly into the fabric of the game.

[h3]Conclusion: [/h3]

Combat can be a little annyoing since enemies actually put up a fight and they often don't follow the video gamey rule of attacking one at a time, that one might be used to.
But if you put in the effort to research what makes a monster or beast or what have you crumble, it is really statisfying

Forse pero' e' stato alzato eccessivamente sopra un piedistallo, tantoche' la gente, a distanza di anni, ha iniziato a ricordarsi cose sbagliate sul gioco: le scelte narrative prendibili non sono tantissime e le variazioni del finale sono poche. Cio' non significa che sia un male, ma ricordandosi male, il pubblico ha avuto aspettative sbagliate su CP77, quando in realta', entrambi fanno uso dello stesso tipo di narrativa (storia principale, missioni primarie opzionali che influenzano direttamente la main quest e variazioni importanti presenti solo nelle sequenze finali). L'unica vera differenza e' la maggior caratterizzazione di Geralt paragonato a V.

Heard a lot about this game, so going in my expectations were high. This game was way different than the ones I had played before, mainly because of the lore and backstory. I had to catch up with the series before starting the game (thankful that I did) and I had a blast. Being longer than other games I have played before, and considering I have trouble focusing, this was a challenge. And as I got closer to my goal every time, the feeling of it slipping away, that desperation, was unparalleled. I encountered a few bugs in the game which were very annoying, I do not know whether they came up because of the next-gen update or if they were there to begin with, but it got annoying after a certain point. Anyway, I got the good ending (thankfully) and I'm happy to put this game in my top 10 list.

First, the support and dedication to this game was really good since it's release to the big overhaul, as usual for CDPR games.

It's beautiful, it's huge, it's entertaining to the last, it has several great DLC. And it has stories. Oh so many stories. Yeah, there's the main story line, but I'm talking about all those small ones. In a mix of side quests, NPC dialogue, notes and environmental storytelling there are small, and, as typical for the Witcher, usually morally ambigous and sad tales everywhere, all intertwined, to tell bigger stories. Of a family. A farm. A village. A region.

It brings the hard lands of the franchises universe to life, in all it's hard, grim-dark rural country with it's - at the best of times - difficult and often no-win decisions and it's contrast to the often decadent cities. And then it paint's, in vivid detail, the horrors of several wars, past and ongoing, over that scenery.

Great story in which you play the role of an outlaw that does not really belong to any faction. Conversation options really give me the feeling my choices matter in this world.
Similar to Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption 2, with a different story though.
The in-game card game reminded me of Final Fantasy 8. It's awesome to have this little game inside of a game.
Did not like that they decided to copy faces for different characters. It's sort of an atmosphere breaker if you meet a new character with a face of a person that you had to kill earlier within the game. But that's just noise within a game which stands out as one of the greatest games ever made!

I consider it game of the century, until CDPR releases Witcher 4 of course.

But seriously, if you're looking for a game to kill your time, just buy this one. Play it and when you're finished play it again but with mods. Install ""New game plus plus"" and you can drown all your sorrows till you die.

All in all I really enjoyed my time playing this game and I do suggest other people to play it. Just keep in mind that this game is not meant to be grinded although it has a lot of content. One last thing, the 395 hours that shows in the time of writing this review I have not touched new game+ yet.

I love games when they get the sounds and sights of Nature right. This game renders Nature, the sun, the wind, the forest, the fields and the sky ‚Äì very beautifully. 

The quest stories are deep, meaningful and enjoyable. The medieval cities, towns, and landscapes are gorgeous to behold. And the soundtrack that accompanies your exploration is one of the best that I‚Äôve ever heard in game.  

To be certain, the injustice and harshness of this medieval world ‚Äì is very dark and grim. 

But you, as Geralt of Rivia ‚Äì can bring a bit of light and justice to a small few. 

And that my friends, makes it all worthwhile.

The story is gripping and does not kill your immersion by forcing you to know the events of the previous games like so many triple A titles do nowadays. Aside from this, it helps ease you into the world by offering loads of dialogue to help you piece previous game's events together, while keeping the story moving forward at the same time due to the incredible amount of time and effort put into the writing of this game.

On the surface, it seems like another RPG whereby the player is sent one place to kill or retrieve something, rinse repeat. But no, no this game has many special quests and unique charm. There is a lot of political nuances dotted without, relationships between the characters that actually make you empathize with them, love, death and betrayal, all attributed to an immense open world and great story telling. The game is by no means easy either, so If you want a challenge, this game will break you on the harder difficulties but it is well worth it. Studying the bestiary, drinking potions/decoctions and preparing for a fight, only to finally slay that monster? There are few games that deliver such a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment like this.

Overall, a great game which I have no doubt in my mind will become a timeless classic. CD Projekt Red have truly out-done themselves. If this series' success is anything to go by, CD Projekt Red's next game: Cyberpunk 2077 will be worth EVERY penny.

Even now the game is still worth being played.
And the best part for me was the ""Blood and Wine DLC"" an entire new map. Best looking shit i have ever seen with an amazing storyline about higher vampires and wine in a french setting. Absolutely blew my mind!

[b] Rating: [/b] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

[b] Review: [/b]
I've spent considerable time exploring the world of ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" and can confidently state that this game is a true masterpiece in the RPG genre. Here's what I particularly enjoyed:

    [b] Deep and Captivating World: [/b] Every location and character comes alive thanks to the attention to detail. The game's world is vast and full of interesting places and quests.
    [b] Compelling Characters: [/b] Geralt of Rivia is a superbly developed main character with a unique personality and sense of humor.
    [b] Engaging Storyline: [/b] The plot captures your attention from the first few minutes, and the branching choices genuinely impact the game's progression.

However, there are aspects that could be improved:

    [b] Combat System Balance: [/b] Sometimes the fights feel unfairly difficult or, conversely, too easy.
    [b] Depiction of Female Characters: [/b] Some aspects of how female characters are portrayed in the game raised questions for me.

[b] Conclusion: [/b] Despite some flaws, ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" remains an excellent choice for RPG lovers. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who values a deep story, an immersive world, and multifaceted characters. It's one of those games that leaves a mark in your heart even after you've finished it.",1703060214,1703061336,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Hmm, i dont know.

This game has been sitting in my library for years, and they gave us this ''next gen patch''
That has to be a good thing right?  Years after a game being released it stil is given attention from the developers.


Lets find out!

CDProjekt Have been talking about this amazing Next-Gen patch for over 2 years.
 After some time trying to get rid of  stutters and bad performance, it turns out the devs made a DX12 version run on DX11 without making a native DX12 version.

This causes your CPU usage to go true the Roof, with many stutter and shading cache issue's.

You have to deactivate x2 files the following folder:

So after this ''Fix''  Wich is already outdated, we still cannot play the game.

a few months later we have recieved a fix that adress a lot of these performance issue's

For starters, you take control of what is one of the most popular and beloved protagonists in media history across books, games and television. Geralt of Rivia. CD Projekt Red deserves an endless amount of praise for how they handled this. The story is so accessible to everyone even those who have failed to play the games predecessors (Like myself) or even read the books. (Which the first game takes place directly after) Right off the bat with no real explanation needed, you can feel and understand the importance of a lot of these characters involved in Geralt‚Äôs life from the beginning. With a world filled with already so much deep lore and backstory I find this to be incredibly impressive. But with Geralt being the center of it all, I actually adore that he‚Äôs not even the main character in this specific instance. The dark gritty tone the game starts off on is perfect. Paired with absolutely beautiful music that sets you right into the world so effortlessly. The pacing is done just right. You‚Äôre thrown in the mix, being left with so many questions and emotions. But you have to wait, and taking your time is the best part about this entire masterpiece. 

The graphics are stunningly beautiful, and at times truly breathtaking. For an 8 year old game it still holds its own extraordinarily well. (I understand the next gen update but who cares) The combat while holding only 1 of 2 complaints I have about the games entirety, is still a TON of fun. It has some jank, but when you get the hang of it it‚Äôll quickly be something you get over. The game does a great job of giving you all the tools and information that truly engrosses you into feeling like you are a Witcher! From the beastiary, to the oils, potions all of it is just awesome.

Furthermore, the game succeeds at the pure RPG elements that I crave from so many games that can‚Äôt quite nail it the way you dream of. Most importantly for me is the choice and consequence opportunities, and man, do they do it right. So many instances where I was just stressed debating back and forth on what to do, and I love it! That‚Äôs how games should make you feel, it‚Äôs a feeling I desire where something I do makes a real impact on the storyline or the outcome of a character. There‚Äôs so many quests that stick out in my mind when it comes to this. Even better this includes side quests! A trend so often in modern gaming is how pointless, boring and overall forgettable most side content is, but not here. I adore how each character and story is capable of giving added context and depth to the main plot of the game. Tying them in so effortlessly that if you skip out on a lot of this stuff you‚Äôre doing yourself a HUGE disservice. Some of my favorite moments come from these secondary objectives, and there‚Äôs so much of it. Including the treasure hunts or the Witcher contracts. Better yet, I love that they don‚Äôt stray away from the dark side of life sometimes. Not everyone gets a happy ending, and this game isn‚Äôt afraid to show that. Sometimes things just suck no matter how you spin them. 

In addition, the world building is absolutely top notch. Each NPC feels real and they‚Äôre carrying on doing their normal everyday things that are so easy to miss when you‚Äôre just running by to your next objective. Random encounters from people walking up to you or having their own meaningful conversations. It‚Äôs just that extra attention to detail that many developers bypass because of the admitted difficulty and overall insignificance. But it really does help in making the world more alive and immerse you in a way many games fail to do. Each section of the map has its own quirks and I truly find each one interesting and captivating. I love all the towns and villages you can come across, all having a unique experience and feel to them. 

In conclusion, this game absolutely stole my heart. I loved the almost everything about it, this is the exact kind of experience I was craving when I decided to tackle this from my backlog. I once again applaud everyone involved in making this project. I feel like I could ramble even more if I wanted. Just man‚Ä¶ What a game, and experience. I can‚Äôt wait to tackle the DLC‚Äôs and come back and play it again someday in the future. I was so sad it was over, but there‚Äôs still so much to do and I truly can‚Äôt wait.",1702702339,1702946827,True,2,0,0.531101584434509277,0,True,False,False

The Pros:
-The main story is great, tho some people complained about The Wild Hunts as the main villain, I found them to be great in the story context. Especially how the people in this world treat them like a mere folktale.
-The side quests are amazing, this the true meat of the game, do not rush the main story, take your time to delve in the story of the people of The Continent. Some of the best writing I have ever seen in any video games.
-The branching stories and the various ways you can solve the quest(with variable ending) are great and made the world feel alive and made your choices matter.
-The combat is fine and fun, might not be the most creative out there but there's a lot of room for various kind of build.
-The graphic is great even though the game is 8 years old already, the enviroments are gorgeous(especially Toussauint).
-Sound design is great.
-Armor designs are great.
-Weapons designs are amazing.
-Monster designs are top notch.
-The DLC are amazing.
-Heart of Stone got amazing story and atmosphere.
-Blood and Wine basically give you at least another 30 hours of gameplay in a new map that is well crafted.
-Great replayability.

The Cons:
-The camera in the fight can be wonky sometimes.
-The world can feel more alive, stealing and murdering basically don't have any effect like let's say stealing in The Elder Scrolls Series. The guard basically useless in this.
-Sometimes, they sprinkle 5 seconds of gameplay between long cutscenes, might aswell just continue the cutscene if the only thing I need to do is walk less than 10 feet.
-Found a lot of small annoying bugs like how Roach can't gallop sometimes.

Overall this is an amazing game. CDPR magnum opus thus far.

I love how secondary quests have their own plot that is actually interesting. It makes me want to explore the world. Mosters are unique and it's fun to fight them. The game does not get boring as there is always somethings interesting to do.
You can explore the world, follow main quests, do some sideline activities. The world is rich and alive.

It honestly feels fantastic that they still care so much about the game. And trust me, this is not a ""Skyrim re-release"". They added a lot of stuff, new quests, armor, weapons. But best of all, they've rebalanced the skill and talent trees. So now more things are viable from the early game, even on deathmarch difficulty. Though with the changes now I feel DM is not as hard as it used to be. Overall I like the update, both graphically and gameplay wise. 

TL; DR at the bottom.

I have never played the other witcher games or read the books before the Witcher 3, BUT this masterpiece changed everything. It's simply the best fantasy game out there and I‚Äôm pretty sure it will become a huge classic.
It just made me feel so many things I cannot even list them all. Got me so emotional sometimes it was almost embarrassing.

The story is solid, quality writing and the (cut)scenes are done so professionally it almost feels like a movie that just goes on and on, pulling you in more and more, as you get attached to the characters. And the realization hitting you, that nothing is black and white in this universe. One can feel sympathy for the most deformed, hideous creatures, while sometimes it's the humans who are the most disgusting and evil inhabitants of this world.
There are three stories that are the most significant (main games and the two DLCs main quests), but most of the side quests have some significance. Whether you get back an old woman‚Äôs frying pan or take on a contract to kill a bloodthirsty monster, you will be surprised by the stories what these smaller quests can deliver.

Graphics are gorgeous, the landscape is diverse, from a gloomy miserable swamp to a colorful land with hills vineyards scattered all over it. The vast open world feels like it could be just watched from above and even then it would be interesting. The world lives, the NPCs have daily routine, they move from place to place with purpose.

Oh and the music, the music goes so well with everything mentioned above. From epic fast paced compositions made for battle, to the eeriest lullabies... just perfect.

The combat. It feels good. On the first two difficulty settings it is easy to just meet any adversary rushing in head forward, however, the games core mechanisms shine the brightest on the hardest. At early levels you have to use everything (the bestiary for example) to gain advantage. And even with an ""end game"" -ish build, you could face some difficulties if you don't pay attention. The talent system may be not the most in depth one amongst other games, but it still provides a large amount of possibility for different types of gameplay.

TL; DR:
So even if you read the full review, I probably missed some things that Witcher 3 did amazingly, and sorry for that. But i think you can get a good idea of the overwhelming positivity provided by the community towards this piece of art.

As you can see I invested quite some time in this game and probably will in the foreseeable future. Yes, it's just simply fantastic. For me this masterpiece will become the standard of the fantasy genre and for the single player games.

And currently the GOTY edition (which contains both expansion size DLCs), is only 50‚Ç¨ (at the time when I‚Äôm writing this).

For a game where story is such an integral part, I did not find any joy in progressing through the main quest because of boring sub plots.

The entire story so far goes like this -

- You search for Ciri, you find clues in a place where a person knows something about Ciri, and that person strikes a deal with you that you'd have to collect a potion for him in order to give you information about Ciri, and while you are collecting this potion, you find another person who knows about this potion and you'd have to do him a favour to collect this.

Its just sub plot over sub plot and maybe I'm in the minority but I just didn't find any of this fun.

Despite the flaws, I have to admit, the gameplay is fun, rewarding and the RPG element incorporated in this game is definitely engaging. Even some of the dialogues and voice actors were surprisingly good for a weaker story (unfortunately, the same can't be said for the main character). Geralt is probably one of the least charismatic protagonists i've ever seen.

Like all Witcher games, the story, characters, world-building and lore are why we all fall in love with this series. While there is no branching storyline in the main story like you see in the Witcher 2, all the choices you make in the Witcher 3 including those in side missions have consequences that can affect future story events and questlines. In fact, some of the side-missions in this game could pass off as being main quests since they do have a direct impact on what ending you get. Quests are so well written that you can even get different cutscenes and dialogue simply because you started a quest at a different time of day or did a quest objective or completed another quest at a different order. To this day, people are still finding new things in this nearly decade-old game, which shows how great the attention to detail was.

For a game with so many choices, the Witcher 3 also does a brilliant job in respecting choices you make. Sure, sometimes a choice may yield unintended consequences, but it will never be because of your character doing something completely different to what you have decided to do. There are so many choice-based games out there where picking a choice may cause a character to perform an action that isn‚Äôt in line with that choice, due to how vaguely the choice was presented or simply because the writers wanted to add an element of shock or surprise. The Witcher 3 does not fall into this immersion-breaking trap and instead relies on its strong narrative to create this effect.  

Another reason why the storytelling is so great is because of its believable open-world. The game has a full day/night cycle where NPCs will have their own lives and schedules. Some will even have new dialogue after completing certain story events. It‚Äôs not the most dynamic system out there, but it‚Äôs enough to set a realistic world. The absence of loading screens when exploring a map also allows for better immersion within this world.

Speaking of exploration, exploring in this game is always rewarding since loot scales with your character level (you will find higher level weapon and armor as you level up). However, this stops becoming relevant once you start crafting the Witcher gear which overpowers all the other gear in the game. Nonetheless, exploration is still worth doing as you can find all you need in food, materials and gold just from looting. Geralt is still able to go unpunished for looting people‚Äôs homes, but that‚Äôs a game mechanic that dates back to the very first Witcher game and is pretty much a staple in most RPGs. The Witcher 3 does improve on this a bit by making certain guards hostile when caught stealing, but some might find this added mechanic annoying. 

Traversal is easily the weakest part about this game. Travelling on foot is fine, and the parkour in this game is surprisingly good as you can climb or jump onto most reachable roofs and platforms. However, travelling via boat is very clunky and tedious, and it is only made worse by the inclusion of a durability system. Horse-riding can also be just as bad, as any small obstacles you stumble onto can cause Roach to suddenly stop moving (which CD Projeckt even admitted to themselves via an in-game quest). Fortunately, we never have to rely on these modes of transport for too long at any instance as the map is filled with fast-travel points all over the world. 

As for the combat, it is very similar to the one in Witcher 2 - same real-time hack and slash combat with Witcher signs and rolling & parrying mechanics. However, this time they added a side-step manoeuvre, which is great for dodging attacks while still maintaining proximity to the enemy (the previous game only had rolling so whenever you dodge an attack you would always create distance). There are also no more quick-time events like the ones you see in Witcher 2, but this does mean there are less cinematic fights if that‚Äôs your thing. The worst part about the combat is its awful targeting system as Geralt would sometimes attack a random mob instead of the closest one. You could swing at a completely different direction despite having an enemy or targetable object right in front of your character. There‚Äôs also the issue that you cannot jump during mid-fight, so you can unintentionally become stuck somewhere like in a ditch, which makes for awkward fighting. Initially, the overworld may seem lacking in enemy variety, but there‚Äôs actually a lot of different monsters you can encounter, especially those from contracts and places that stray far away from the main path. I highly recommend playing this game at the hardest difficulty (Death March) because it forces you to utilise your potions, oils and bestiary knowledge more, making you feel more like a real Witcher (plus it‚Äôs necessary for 100-percenting the game in one playthrough for all you achievement hunters out there). 

On a tech scale, the next-gen update provides much vastly improved graphics in the form of upgraded textures, higher detail level, ray-traced reflections and shadows, higher crowd and vegetation density, and greater draw distances and foliage visibility range. As a result, the environment is now brimming with more flora and fauna, breathing more life into this world. The only downside is that the more realistic lighting of ray-tracing makes the interior of buildings too dark to navigate in, which means you will need to carry a torch or candlelight at all times. There‚Äôs also a noticeable hit in performance and increase in game crashes, but the graphics upgrade is worth these trade-offs. The game honestly looks like a triple-A game that was made from this year.

In summary, despite its shortcomings in certain mechanics, the Witcher 3 is still a masterpiece thanks to its strong storytelling alone. Fans of the series will enjoy the same structure of storytelling with returning characters and references from the old games and books, while new fans can enjoy an original story that was designed to be standalone. The DLCs are also worth playing, and one can argue they are better written than the main story. The Heart of Stone DLC has a tight and well-crafted story with very unique missions and impressive boss fights, while the Blood and Wine DLC is basically another game itself as it adds another map that is packed full of content.

First, I couldn't get the game to launch. Took me hours to finally track the issue down to one of the utility programs that auto-runs when I boot up my PC. Disabling this utility app allowed the game to launch instead of sitting in the background of Task Manager.

Then, I temporarily broke my game because I enabled Ciri's alternate appearance option in the main menu. This is [i] official DLC for the game [/i] and having it enabled would crash my game and not let me load back into my saved games!

Now I'm dealing with constant crashing when I go to load a quick save or an auto save file. Only manual saves will allow me to reload the game once it is running without crashing to desktop. Additionally, I cannot select a save file to load into the first time I boot up the game; the only way to load a save without the game crashing is if I select [b] continue [/b] from the main menu.

- A lot of the menus are well thought out. 
- On-screen instructions are helpful. 
- Navigation is good. There are only a few parts that leave you guessing.  
- No major glitches or bugs to report. 
- Beautiful natural open landscapes. Probably the nicest I have seen in a game. 
- Generally, well written. 
- The gameplay is good. I like that doors open without needing to press buttons. 
- You can play as another character sometimes. 
- Great cut scenes. 

 Negative: 
- Music is very repetitive and needs to be turned down or off in places like dungeons to give the scene a better atmosphere.  
- Not enough battle time. 
- Going from quest to quest can be confusing as no markers are placed. You must complete the quests in a nonlinear order 
to complete prior quests. Also, sometimes you must complete secondary side quests to move on, but it does not instruct you to do so. 
- Long winded at times, 100+ hours. 
- Fishing rod, but no fishing capability?  
- *The rest read below. 

 

Conclusion: 

I can see why this game got so much attention. The huge map is wonderful to explore, leaving what feels like the possibility for endless exploration. The menus/HUD and gameplay are very well thought out. The writing and graphics are very good. Honestly, I see no need to keep diving into the good so let's look at the subjective. 

After coming from titles such as Dragon Age Inquisition and Skyrim the Witcher III is a different experience. Love it or not is personal but you best be prepared to put away your weapons and put on your Sherlock Homes hat. A lot of this game is playing a detective. Maybe that‚Äôs okay? I came into the game blind, so it was a surprise for me.  

The intro really stands out along with the last quarter of the game. The issue is that I often didn‚Äôt really feel like a warrior while playing. During dialogue the main character sometimes displays traits of inner weakness. To me this conflicted with his sword bearing persona. 

Despite these critiques the game is very well done and certainly deserves great recognition. If a 4th edition was released, I would certainly play it.

You must've heard this line countless of times right about now, although it might not be as extreme as mine. I'll gladly give my explanation in excruciating details. If a game takes us at least a hundred hours to beat, I'm sure it's the least one can do to review the end of Geralt of Rivia's journey.

Not sure where to start, but this game marks the third and the last journey in Geralt of Rivia's ""The Witcher"" series. Or Geralt the exterminator. Geralt the shephard. Geralt The Slayer. Geralt The Hide and Seek player. As a player of the whole series, I can safely say we have seen a transformation of the character as well as the environment throughout the course of the three games. The previous games had their flaws, and though these flaws are not disengaging to the point where I'd be completely disinterested, they still were quite bothersome. However, I can easily and safely say The Witcher 3: The Wild hunt is flawless in every shape and form.

Recently, I've taken up an efficient way of beating games in my personal opinion where I dont have to force myself to spend more time than I have to depending on my curiosity. The reason being, if I force myself to be a completionist with a game, especially if it is a Role-Playing Game, I'd be disengaged from the world itself and might not even feel involved anymore in the world the characters live in. Luckily the opposite had occured with The Witcher 3 and I initially went with the flow. However, I saw myself veering off to exploring and asking NPCs about monsters' whereabouts and helping out those in need besides the main plot. It didn't feel superficial nor disengaging from the rest of the game. In fact, every quest felt like it mattered in comparison to the overall world.

One of the main reasons I was attached to this game is the storytelling and the pacing of the plot. You literally live in the character's mindset and the narrative, although sometimes takes place from different perspective, still takes you through geralt's mind. The animation and the graphics as well as the soundtrack and the great performance intertwines with the narrative in a beautiful fashion. At first, I felt overwhelmed, but as I delved deeper into the world of The Witcher, I didn't want to get out of it. Sure enough, 150 hours later, I'd look for more sidequests before finishing the story.

Choices in the game are not all about Right and Wrong, it's a little more than that and to be honest it is hard for me to explain since there was a consequence for each action I've taken. I did not regret a single choice I have picked however bad the consequence seemed.

Combat is actually great as opposed to the previous games. The series' weak point in my opinion was always in the combat and thankfully, this game saved it with its variety between signs and combat. There are so many combinations one can come up with and so many different play styles are present as opposed to the clicking of the mouse in Witcher 1 or the button mashing in Witcher 2 without the emphasis or need on Signs as much as here.

Don't get me started on the aesthetics of Witcher 3. The music is beautiful and really takes you to a different world. I am sure I would type more but I am out of words right now and I can only say I feel quite empty after finishing this wonderful project by CD Projekt. There are no other developers I would entrust an RPG experience than CD PRojekt. Keep it up guys and I'm looking forward to their future games and expansions.

DX12+11 are usable now. Its no longer stutery mess. They added back HBAO+, fixed the bugs introduced by the next gen update. RTX looks great, but the games age still shows.

New CDPR launcher is terrible, why another step.

For older PCs, I would recommend playing 1.32 if the performance is not good.

They are working on redEngine editor, which is great, but little too late.

 [h1] Original   [/h1]

[strike] [h1] Great game, ruined by the next gen update.  [/h1] 	[/strike]

Yes after all those years THIS UPDATE made me review the game on the steam.

[h2] TL;DR  [/h2]
Play the 1.32 verison. Version 4.00 Introduced better visuals(with RTX its gorgeous) at the cost of terrible frame pacing and bad performance overall.


[h2] review update  after 4.00 hotfix 2 [/h2]
I can say that this hotfix reduced cpu usage(seems more on par with dx11 now?) and stabilised frametimes on dx12.Hovever, FSR still seems to increase cpu usage and Dx11 still has bad framerate and other issues described below.


[h3] Reasons for my negative review: [/h3]
Hard work was destroyed by relasing it with problems right before christmas. Great job! /s Now all forums are full of toxicity. I'm mad too, but I wont be rude, thats not right. Dont be rude too. I will just make a negative review cause it's deserved.


 Doesnt really matter if you choose dx11 or dx12. Heavilly single threaded, shader compilation stutter, camera stutter, xOne controller wouldnt work on dx11, photo mode was black with tiny dot of correct image... I played Cyberpunk 2077 and this is worse than CP77s PC release performance(not the game issues and glitches), which is sad but true.

 [h3] Notes on CDPR:  [/h3]

I trusted CDPR up to this point, even after the Cyberpunk old gen performance fiasko and generall gameplay underdelivery(story was great but years of hype suggested it would be gtaV style open world etc.. but it didnt even have police chases)

Now my trust in CDPR is oficially lost. 3 New games including 2 Witchers and W1 remake you say? Unreal engine 5 you say? New cyberpunk game soon? 
No thanks, I already know what the result will be.

[h3] Small rant about modern AAA games  [/h3]
Thankfully there are many small indie companies which dont require 2000‚Ç¨ dollar GPUs and dont follow the generall motto of modern gaming. 

[b] [i] Overpromise, release minumum viable product(that means unfinnished, unopitimized and ready to be abondonded instanly when everyone rightfully says its trash) and stuff it with money and fun sucking addiction features like limited time battlepasses designed to basically addict you to feel bad for playing other games while you could be grinding the latest battlepas limited items.

The basic criteria of its genre, including world building, plot organization, and character development are all as superb as any other classic games can get, or even beyond.

The main advantage of this game, is mainly based on its layered approach in main quests and almost all side quests, of which, many are interconnected to convince you of a real and dynamic world in progress. The amount of details, the ability to trigger your emotions after your carefully decided moral choices, are not yet found on other games. This is further strengthened by a group of charismatic characters, who all developed comprehensive arc alongside the journey. I would argue that all people from all cultural and social backgrounds, will find the game deeply resonating with their experience, one way or another. 

However, it is also noticeable, in contrast to the story aspects, the game controls such as combat, numeric balance, character related system designs are awful even back when its launch in 2015. The action feedback mechanism in combination with poorly designed input latency/cd is the most frustrating experience for beginners. Many times encountering character not moving/reacting to your commands several times a second, can be annoying. This is amplified by poorly integrated skill system, which although already strayed away from the original book's settings, is not complex and interesting enough for gameplay oriented setting. 

Therefore, another major advantage of this game to me, is the modding community and environment. Mods addressed many major problems people faced before, and contributed directly to the introduction of NG version. Witcher 3 stands as one of the most welcoming games for mods, like Skyrim and etc. This highlights my main recommendation for this game in 2023 and beyond, specifically due to modding community's incredible vitaity.

In conclusion, this is a game for who pursues story driven gameplay, not keen on competitive combat, and one who enjoys late medieval styled realistic world for exploration. It is to my knowledge, a great game portrayed the complex nature of myths development and pre-industrial era social dynamics.",1702384725,1702384725,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

Just to give some context, I played Witcher 1 when it first came out and I was a massive fan. I was let down a lot by Witcher 2. While I liked the story in Witcher 2, everything else was a disappointment to me, especially the atmosphere. I actually had to restart Witcher 2 three times until I finally forced myself to finish it. Because of my disappointment with Witcher 2, I wasn't excited about Witcher 3, so I was thrilled when I finally played it and felt like the Witcher magic was recaptured.

Almost everything about Witcher 3 is great. The music is one of the best soundtracks ever. The graphics and art direction are insanely good and still look like a modern game in 2023 (yes, I know they updated the graphics). The story, characters, voice acting, writing, etc., are all top-notch. The DLCs are amazing. The only two nitpicks are 1) while I like the combat overall, it can get a little stale when playing for 100+ hours, and 2) I don't like what they did with the Geralt-Triss-Yennefer love dynamic. I could write pages of why that love triangle is flawed and stupid for multiple reasons, but I'll skip that for now.

The game can be many things to different people, set to its lowest difficulty the game becomes a story-based narrative game with combat adding flavor to the engrossing open world, but at higher difficulties such as Blood and Broken Bones and Death March, the game begins to take on souls-like characteristics, rewarding the player for learning about and thoughtfully utilizing the deep combat and crafting systems. Blood and Bones finds itself as feeling like a souls-like hybrid, more accessible than a traditional souls-like, but still challenging and rewarding, whereas Death March integrates the punishing feel of a souls-like, forcing the player to engage with the systems in place to gain any traction in the world, rather than firmly, but not overwhelmingly simply pushing the player in their direction in the Blood and Bones difficulty.

Overall though, The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, for the right person, this sort of game really caters to someone who enjoys games that engross one with a deep story and beautifully deep RPG systems, but may not appeal to someone who is just looking for a game to pick up and play for a couple of minutes. Though if one is a new player to RPGs, I'd highly recommend The Witcher 3 as a way to enter into the genre, particularly at lower difficulties as it allows the player to learn and engage with RPG mechanics, without them being overwhelming.

Witcher 3 is not 10/10 game like many state (as there is almost no such thing as perfection) but probably is best RPG, especially ""modern"" RPG game. Well written quests, weapons and armors to choose from, references to other games and more. Characters are easily like'able, DLC's are on their own better than Ubi's or Bethesda's games. My only recommendation: besides installing graphical mods (achivements still work) try playing on Death March, even from a get-go. Besides ONE boss from DLC, the game feels balanced but DM forces you to use oils and potions which are somewhat trademark of Witcher's set, makes game little more immersive. Tried playing game on anything lower and I was able to no-brain my way to the end.

Witcher 1 will still remain my favourite story-wise but third game became a benchmark for good action rpgs.",1666359769,1702202643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me, this game is best enjoyed by not only focusing on the main story, but taking time to complete the side quest content. The side quests in this game are mini-stories of their own which add extra flavour to the dark world The Witcher inhabits. I might not be selling them enough, but they are easily the best side quests I have experienced in any game I've played (I've played and finished more MMORPG's/RPG/open world games than I can count). I think it's only a benefit to take time to complete them.

My only critique of the game would come down to the combat, it's nothing to write home about but is serviceable, it feels like some weird mix of old Assassin's Creed and Dark Souls but it's passable. Though it's certainly not enough for me to not recommend this game or hesitate from saying it is in my top 3 games of all time. I highly recommend the DLC's also, particularly Blood and Wine, which is a fantastic expansion-like experience with a story that has to be the best DLC story I've ever seen.

Hello friends, today I will review the game called The Witcher¬Æ 3: Wild Hunt. This game tells the adventures of Geralt, a monster hunter in the open world RPG genre. Geralt is looking for a girl named Ciri, who is seen as an omen of doom and can change the shape of the world. But there are both humans and monsters after Geralt. The atmosphere, graphics, sounds and story of the game are very impressive and gripping. While playing the game, you experience Geralt's emotions and decisions. Some parts of the game are very exciting and action-packed, while others are very emotional and touching. The difficulty level of the game is also quite high, especially in monster hunting and side quests. It takes about 100 hours to finish the game.

Good points of the game:
- [b]Graphics:[/b] The graphics of the game are very beautiful and realistic. Geralt's facial expressions, hair, beards, everything is very well designed. The game's environments are also very varied and detailed. Mountains, forests, cities, villages, castles, everything looks beautiful. The colour palette of the game is also very harmonious and atmospheric. When you play the game, you really feel yourself in that world üòç
- [b]Sounds:[/b] The sounds of the game are also very successful and impressive. I recommend you to play the game with headphones, because you hear the voices of Geralt and other characters. These sounds increase the realism and emotion of the game. The voices are suitable for both the characters and the environment. All of the voices are very well dubbed. The game's music is also very beautiful and appropriate. The sounds of the game are one of the most important elements of the game. üéß
- [b]Story:[/b] The story of the game is also very interesting and unusual. The game tells both a fantastic and realistic story. The story of the game tells both Geralt's past, present and future. The story of the game tells both the fate of Ciri and the fate of the world. The story of the game is both action and drama. The story of the game reflects both Geralt's personal journey and his relationship with other characters. The story of the game is very deep and meaningful. After finishing the game, you can't get out of the effect for a long time. üìö

Bad aspects of the game:
- [b]Battles:[/b] The battle scenes of the game are the strongest aspect of the game. The game's battle mechanics are very fun and challenging. You don't just attack with two buttons and defend with one button. There is a lot of variety in battles. You can use different weapons, spells, potions, bombs, traps. A lot of strategy is also required in battles. It is not enough just to set the timing well. Battles increase the atmosphere and fluency of the game. Battles are the most fun aspect of the game. üòÅ
- [b]Puzzles:[/b] The puzzle sections of the game are also very interesting and challenging. The game's puzzles are not usually based on finding or matching symbols. The puzzles are very relevant to the story of the game. Puzzles do not slow down the pace of the game. Puzzles are the most mysterious aspect of the game. üòé
- [b]Replayability:[/b] The replayability of the game is also very high. Once you finish the game once, there are many reasons to play it again. The game has different endings and choices. The game has hidden elements and side quests. Replaying the game doesn't just mean doing the same things over and over again. Playing the game again increases the effect of the game. üòä

Pros: 
- Just read every review here on Steam

Cons:
- Combat is clunky

- I didn‚Äôt care for most of the cast (Triss and your Witcher teammates were probably best imo).

- Basic quest routine: takes a job, uses Witcher senses, kills monster, gets paid, repeat. Maybe throw a decision in there now and then. 

- The trekking between sign posts (fast travel points) was grueling at times.

- The puzzles were pretty straigtforward or nonexistent

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt released in 2015 by CD PROJEKT RED is one of the most legendary and addictive gaming experiences you'll ever have. The sheer amount of content is absolutely staggering, and it's all at a triple A level of quality.

You play as Geralt of Rivia, a legendary Witcher (professional monster hunter and mutant), in one of the most dark and grim fantasy worlds out there. Geralt and his kind were created to protect humanity, but humans fear and despise him, so he mostly stays travelling. Your journey begins in White Orchard, where you are dedicated in finding someone who is like a daughter to you, Ciri. Ciri is not a mutant but she has been trained as a Witcher, and she also carries the Elder Blood within her, which is a rare lineage which boasts powerful magic and special abilities. Geralt, along with a colorful cast of friends and lovers, must band together to find Ciri and save the world from Eredin and his twisted Wild Hunt.

The Witcher 3 is a passion filled game made with the highest quality and amount of effort possible. It took me 35 hours to complete the entire main story on Death March difficulty, and I felt like I was going pretty fast generally. The characters and universe are extremely memorable and endearing, which is odd considering how bleak and unforgiveable their lands are. This is a hopeless husk of a world they are living in, and yet, the player behind the controller will be constantly filled with joy and impressed with the vibrant and beautiful colors / graphics.

I also wanted to make a special mention for Gwent, it's one of the most fun strategy collectible card games I've ever played and it's insane how much thought and effort was put into it considering it's a secondary mini game. The game can often feel like a movie at times, but it's a movie that lets you control it which is how you do it. The cutscenes are obviously fantastic, but they're actually more rare than you'd first imagine, most scenes in this game are conveyed via the game's actual engine and dialogue choices. On the topic of choice, this is a true role playing game at it's core as your decisions will actually matter and take drastically different effects, while you are obviously playing a pre-created character for you . . . Geralt, you can still very much decide how you want his journey to go and what kind of person he will be.

The Witcher 3 is a legendary title and it pains me to not give it a perfect score. The primary reason is that I feel The Witcher 4 is inevitable to come out and I know they can do even greater things than what they've done here.

The voice acting deserves high praise, as it brings life to the characters by adding emotional depth to their interactions. Geralt of Rivia's gruff yet charismatic voice perfectly embodies the iconic Witcher. The original score delivers a powerful and atmospheric soundtrack that complements the gameplay, intensifying the impact of key moments. Everything else also sounds great, including the horrifying monsters. However the score is sometimes out of place.

Story and Characters:

The story delivers an emotionally charged narrative. The rich lore and intricate political landscape of the Witcher world provide a compelling backdrop for Geralt's personal quest. The diverse cast of characters, each possessing distinct personalities and motivations, enhances the storytelling experience. Every choice holds significance.

Gameplay:

The gameplay is competent, offering a variety of combat styles, a robust alchemy system, and meaningful choices that impact the story. However, the presence of level-gating can be frustrating at times. While level progression is common in RPGs, the sandbox nature may feel constrained when certain areas or quests are locked behind specific character levels. This can limit the sense of freedom and exploration that a true sandbox experience should offer.

Conclusion

""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" delivers a captivating world filled with memorable characters, remarkable storytelling, and breathtaking visuals. Its excellent voice acting and original score further elevate the gaming experience. While the level-gating may somewhat hinder the sandbox experience, the overall journey through this rich and immersive world is undoubtedly one that every RPG enthusiast should embark upon. And the two story expansions are also remarkable, each in their own way. I would rate this 8/10 Adequate.",1502686936,1701896332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, a couple of aspects bother me. Firstly, despite being described as an open-world game pre-release, it's not entirely so. There are zones to load into, and although they are sizable, it doesn't quite align with my expectations of an open-world experience akin to games like Skyrim or Far Cry.

The combat is another aspect that doesn't sit well with me. Despite updates, the movement feels peculiar, leaning more towards console controller gameplay rather than being optimized for mouse and keyboard. Lastly, the inability to save during certain story events has led to some frustrating encounters. Waiting for the last save to load, enduring repetitive dialogue, or skipping sections, and then replaying the encounter can be tedious, especially if it's a challenging sequence.

Despite these shortcomings, I genuinely enjoy the game and would recommend it.",1451464220,1701892429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, this game still looks beautiful and the soundtrack is so amazing! This alone makes The Witcher 3 great. With the books Sapkowski created a beautiful world with beautifully deep characters. Seeing his work turned into 3d really makes me happy.

Storywise I have to say it's alright. You try to find people and while you do you see flashbacks of what they have been up to. What I did not like however was being barred from quests because I played too much of the main quest without knowing! I felt like I had to do every side quest, fearing it would randomly fail. Though at one point I couldn't bother doing any other side quests, because I wanted to keep the main story going and I was overleveled anyway.

Like the main quest, I'll rush the end a little bit: The main characters felt well made, while side characters usually were very one dimensional. Best example is nearly every peasant being ""help us, m'lord! T'was a monster aye!"". Geralt was just a glorified dog at some point. Skillbuilding felt alright and fighting itself was very nice. Alchemy never again felt as necessary as in Witcher 1, sadly. Swallow was the only potion I really needed.

All in all I enjoyed playing and I was happy to do all achievements. I probably won't play it again though.",1701886166,1701886166,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have played the third game and completed it. I have played the third game for 337.8 hours. I do not understand all this hype. This game before the latest patch: the game used to be buggy. For instance, I remember that I experienced a few glitches in the middle of battles. I did not play after the latest patch, so many players applaud it. The story is a forced straight agenda, this is where the worship is coming from. Although the story is dull, they had an affair, but their adoptive daughter and her friend erased their memory to protect them. Many nude women, and this isn't new for many games. The nudity has been extremely shoved in my face many times. They had one gay man character, and this is it. There are no sexualized men nor naked men. I was annoyed by the romance force: almost every woman Geralt interacts with, initiates the romance and flirtation, then you will have to break up with them. For instance, the romance with Triss in the first game felt forced. Someone told me there was a gay character, and I played it. I wish I didn't play it. And here is what I think:

1- The story is dull, forcing us to accept the straight agenda.
2- The combat is okay in the third game.
3- The quest Geralt have to sleep or flirt with a woman to save the world or complete a mission.
4- In the third game, I admit the graphic is breathtaking.

From the moment I stepped into the vast and immersive world of Temeria, I was captivated by the sheer brilliance and attention to detail that envelops every aspect of this game.

Let's start with the visuals ‚Äì breathtaking is an understatement. The landscapes are so beautifully crafted that each corner of the map feels like a hand-painted masterpiece. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add an extra layer of realism, making every sunset and stormy night a spectacle to behold. Whether traversing the bustling city of Novigrad or exploring the hauntingly serene Skellige Isles, the graphics create an unparalleled visual experience.

The character development and storytelling in The Witcher 3 are second to none. Geralt of Rivia is not just a protagonist; he's a multifaceted character with a rich history, and his journey is laden with moral dilemmas, intricate relationships, and unexpected twists. The supporting cast is equally compelling, with each character contributing to a narrative that is emotionally gripping and intellectually stimulating.

Combat in The Witcher 3 is a ballet of steel and magic, offering a satisfying blend of tactical depth and fluidity. Geralt's array of combat skills, combined with the variety of monsters and bandits to face, keeps every encounter engaging and challenging. The alchemy and crafting systems add layers of strategy, allowing players to tailor their playstyle and evolve Geralt into a formidable force.

The world is teeming with side quests and activities, each with its own unique storyline and moral quandaries. Whether aiding a troubled spirit or participating in a Gwent tournament, every side quest feels like a meaningful addition to the overarching narrative, enhancing the depth and longevity of the gameplay.

Musically, The Witcher 3 is a triumph. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack by Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz complements the game's atmosphere perfectly, eliciting emotions that range from melancholy to exhilaration. The voice acting, led by Doug Cockle's stellar performance as Geralt, is impeccable, adding another layer of authenticity to the characters.

In summary, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not just a game; it's an epic odyssey that sets a new standard for open-world RPGs. CD Projekt Red has crafted a work of art that seamlessly blends a gripping narrative, stunning visuals, and immersive gameplay. If you haven't experienced the magic of The Witcher 3, I implore you to embark on this journey ‚Äì it's a gaming experience that will linger in your heart long after the credits roll.",1701705487,1701705487,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]- a medieval, morbid and grim, yet fairytale-like atmosphere [/h1]

[h1]- literally hundreds of hours of fun, action, intrigue, turnarounds and decision making with consequences[/h1]
[i](I personally spent over 1000 hours enjoying it and finishing the full story twice on a PlayStation 4, hence the lower number of hours here on Steam)[/i]

[h1]- beautiful landscapes, spine-chilling ambiental soundtrack, awesome overall graphics, a captivating story full of original characters, epic battles and I could go on for hours...[/h1]

Not only that, but even though it's a ""AAA"" title [i](that has surpassed and will continue to surpass A LOT of big titles)[/i], the base game which also gives you about 16 free DLC's is half the price of what other big companies are charging for their so called ""AAA"" games, and the ""GOTY"" [i](Game Of The Year Edition)[/i] which includes both its massive DLC's, is only 50 euros. I mean considering the epic proportions of this game with all that it has to offer ""from A to Z"", 50 euros is practically ""giving it away"" as far as I'm concerned.

Trust me. [b]BUY[/b] it, [b]OWN[/b] it, [b]PLAY[/b] it, [b]LOVE[/b] it and [b]REPLAY[/b] it using the ""New Game+"" feature!

At the heart of this masterpiece is Geralt of Rivia, the iconic Witcher whose stoic demeanor and moral complexity create a truly unforgettable protagonist.

Geralt's journey to find his adopted daughter, Ciri, forms the emotional core of the narrative. Ciri, a character of exceptional depth and power, adds a dynamic element to the storytelling. The bond between Geralt and Ciri is beautifully portrayed, providing players with a personal stake in the grand tale unfolding across the Northern Kingdoms.

The game also explores Geralt's relationships, including the compelling romance with Triss Merigold. Triss, a powerful sorceress, brings her own complexities and moral dilemmas to the story, adding layers of emotion and choice to Geralt's already intricate life. The dynamic between these characters is expertly woven into the narrative, allowing players to shape Geralt's personal story through their choices.

The open world of The Witcher 3 is a triumph of design, offering a vast and diverse landscape teeming with life. From the bustling city of Novigrad to the war-torn landscapes of Velen, each location feels alive and meticulously crafted. The attention to detail extends to the characters populating this world, each with their own stories and struggles.

Combat in The Witcher 3 is both exhilarating and strategic, with Geralt's fluid movements and a variety of combat styles keeping encounters fresh and engaging. The monster-hunting aspect, a core element of Geralt's profession, adds a layer of depth to the gameplay as players prepare for battles with supernatural foes.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a crowning achievement in gaming. Geralt, Ciri, and Triss, along with a host of richly developed characters, contribute to a narrative masterpiece. The meticulously crafted world, combined with outstanding visuals and gameplay, make The Witcher 3 an absolute must-play for anyone seeking an immersive and emotionally resonant RPG experience.",1502492458,1701517101,True,5,0,0.557836234569549561,0,True,False,False

Many RPGs let you build a character, and going into this i expected being locked into the role of Geralt to be not as fun as building my own character (this game was my first experience with the franchise, now ive read some books and played the second game also) but man they not only proved me wrong, but changed how i think about approaching video games. now i see playing a specific character means they can tell a more complete story because they don't have to use generic backstories that fit everybody, but they can use all that backstory to create a much more epic game. this game has caused me to raise my standards in video games and i now tend to be disappointed in them a lot more because of comparing them to games like this or RDR2.

After finishing Cyberpunk 2077 I finally decided I had to give The Witcher 3 a go too. 

Now that I've finally taken the time to play through the game, it's quickly cemented itself as one of the best games I can recall having played throughout my life. Playing this for the first time felt very reminiscent of playing Skyrim for the first time around 10 years ago - that is to say, I really enjoyed it. 

Great combat with a lot of variables (e.g. through use of different abilities, weapons, potions, oils, etc...), amazing story, exemplary voice acting, and such a rich and vast world with a bunch of different sceneries and activities to partake in. Hats of to the developers, writers and everyone else involved in creating the game. The game also looks amazing for it's age, though I expect that's also partially attributed to the next-gen update a little while ago. 

10/10 game, in my honest opinion.

I bought during a sale, for $ 6 + all DLS for free.
And let me tell you that this is one of the best games I have ever played.
Let's go through the pros and cons:

+ let's start with the plot, otherwise why would we play RGP :)
the plot is multifaceted, with each stage the game reveals itself like a young rosebud, from city to city from location to location. every decision you make affects the fate of the character, and this affects the ending.

+ the combat system, you need to pay special attention to it, it is so diverse that you definitely won‚Äôt be bored, you can make a super fighter, a supernatural mage or a hidden assassin out of a character, and that's not all - there is no feeling that you are constantly doing the same thing same. a large number of combinations.

+ open world, uuu my low bow here, because each location is worked out and collected in great detail - and the game of 2015 is already 7 years old and it will surprise you, I assure you. from white orchard to Kaer Morhen - these views are to be enjoyed, you will love them <3

+ musical accompaniment:
everywhere the atmosphere in the game is present, thanks to the music, it is maximally selected, in every tavern, location, and even in the game lobby, the music will accompany you throughout this wonderful game.

I hope I didn‚Äôt miss anything in the pros, and if so, I‚Äôll add it later. :)

and so the cons:

- if you are an avid fan of perfectly completed games, and love 100% completed achievements, this game will be difficult.
Started more than 4 times to make everything perfect, but never unlocked everything 100% :(

I recommend this game to all RPG fans.
this game is worth every cent spent.

Oh, I did settle into it and some part of it settled into myself!

I've only ever attempted to play The Witcher 3 on DEATH MARCH difficulty because it's not a game that you should simply play like other games, no... The Witcher 3 is an absolute masterpiece at the highest difficulty and you only get out what you put into it. That said, I've tried to get into it a few times, yet I couldn't go beyond the doldrum grind of White Orchard without becoming distracted and kept away from my PC. The Witcher 3 on the Nintendo Switch broke the chain of my 3 fruitless attempts of getting immersed.
The Witcher 3 will take ahold of your daily thoughts and you'll be compelled to see it through soon after you break free of the initial slog through White Orchard. Truly, there's no comparison and no equal to what you'll face as you enter Velen to begin your search for Ciri. The continent is so massive that purists such as myself who chose only to travel by horse will soon be faced with a massive dilemma that only ""GROWS"" far beyond any previous experience... You won't be shortening the experience by choosing to fast travel, you're merely reducing distractions that will take you weeks off that path as you venture off course to explore.
The characters themselves are uniquely their own persons and full of life as I've ever seen. You'll come to respect every subtle nuance that makes every interaction worthwhile as you choose to listen to their plighted past. Ciri's as colorful as the Von Everrics are woefully dark and you can literally feel what type of person you're dealing with as though you were speaking to a real person. There are moments where you will fear the outcomes of having an interaction that could reverberate throughout the game... Or it could even be a Witcher job for an ""imp"" that will leave you torn on what you choose to do as you lay in bed, restless as you wonder whether you made the right choice! They all are as fascinating as they are fateful in your you play the game!
The combat is absolutely superb, not a simple hack and slash with more dodging; moreover, the abilities that you unlock will all find their way into your approach to overcome every enemy. The ability to counterattack is just as useful as it is deadly to both parties, but you'll eventually learn how to use it being mere dumb luck in an attempted block. Your impressions and effective use of signs will absolutely deviate from your initial thoughts of them all. The combinations are endless as you unlock new iterations of signs you'd once thought futile, every sign has a place. It would serve you well to keep an open mind and a few unused skill points as you progress in the path... There will be situations that throw you squarely into a fight that you never accounted for nor anticipated as the story is unpredictable!

In speaking of the epic tale which you're attempting to unfold, I can only say that it is the best writing that I've ever seen in my life! There's really no comparison to how the game lures you into becoming emotionally invested in the outcomes which you've had a hand in weaving. Your choices will have far-reaching implications that could help, harm, or severely impact everything that you've done as you will unknowingly leave the continent reeling from your best attempts at doing the right thing... It's truly something to behold when your choices continue to follow you into every village you enter...

Sufficed to say, this is the greatest game ever created; from the story, to the landscapes, and to your choices in how you choose to conduct yourself... All will come to change for the better or worse, based solely upon a lowly Witcher's choices.

I highly recommend you buy the game and undertake it on a difficulty fit for making it the most rewarding...
DEATH MARCH! You won't regret it! (10/10)

""New Game+"" will make your efforts far more riveting in the end as it's only the beginning that moves slowly and the beginning again that will test you for the first time!",1701422500,1701422500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a lot of fun to be had in this game, but that fun is spread over an insane amount of playtime due to the significant amount of filler. This is a LONG game, even if you just aim for the main content this game will take a while to complete. I simply don't have the time or patience to play the Witcher 3 all the way through. Some days I have less than an hour to play video games, on those days it is not very motivating to boot up the Witcher 3. Especially since the Witcher 3 has lots of dialogue, which I can appreciate, but often times Witcher 3's dialogue fails to be anything other than boring. On my first major playthrough I remember resorting to skipping through most dialogue to get to the more interesting parts.
This was my second major attempt to play the game, and I didn't get as far this time. There are 3 major parts I remember enjoying about this game. The first was the combat. Especially on higher difficulties, some of the enemies can be a thrill to fight. The visuals mixed with the sounds and the music is incredible. Sometimes the fights can be repetitive however, or even frustrating. The main fights I didn't enjoy on the Death March difficulty were the bosses that could heal their health. This got frustrating as these fights felt impossible. There was one boss called Jenny o' the Woods. I levelled up a significant amount, prepared, etc but still couldn't beat her. She would always heal herself way too much before I could kill her. Of course, I could just come back to her when I was 20 levels higher or look up a guide but I didn't want to. It wasn't an enjoyable experience. The second part I enjoyed about this game was some of the dialogue. You can get Geralt to say some cruel and badass stuff, that just makes you laugh or at the very least leave the conversation grinning. However, these moments were few and fair between compared to the overwhelming amount of dialogue. The final part I enjoyed the most were some of the bugs and glitches. Sometimes they created for a hilarious experience. However, the majority of the bugs and jank in the game were not enjoyable.
There are a truck load of mods, but I would always end up breaking the game whenever I tried to install more than 10 of them. I played through most of the game on my second playthrough with all the foliage and hair moving around at 3x the speed. I never could find the cause, probably because I couldn't be bothered to.
At the end of the day, I am happy I tried the Witcher 3 but I feel no need to play through all of its 100+ hour story.",1701359157,1701359157,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

They sure did an excellent job of visuals 100%! For the time this was released it looks absolutely insane.
One of the horrific things they do is apply a dulling mechanic to a partial playable characters only sword.

The story line is just captivating and interesting as you play the main game and DLC and how you can determine what kind of Geralt you will be :) - a fatherly, an evil one or up to your wildest imagination. The characters in the game are rich in their background as you interact and learn about them and how they will help you in the storyline.

Scenery I just got one word: Mind-blowing. I personally like Kaer Mohan view and this is one of the main element of the game that you can treat your eyes into as you go to various places in the Witcher world. This is a bigger plus point if your GPU can support higher settings.

The gameplay including fighting and crafting and the rest can be tricky at first but there ain't anything you can do if you fall in love with the Witcher world :) After all, I think Witcher fighting gameplay is still easier than Darksoul in many ways with the help of your magic. Fighting style you can develop in your own style and thats one big plus point for me.

The game do include romance also so if you like some romance as you imagine yourself as Gerald while playing the game, you got that option too :) This part is for you to explore yourself - no additional spoilers for you :)

Overall, Witcher 3 is an fantastic open-ended RPG with its own unique combat system with its deep and rich storyline. This includes things you can do like crafting potions, weapons and all while keeping it real like remember to repair your precious armor and weapon! Lastly - Gwent! You get to play games in this game itself :) If you do not know what is Gwent yet, start playing Witcher 3 to find out. its more fun that way - trust me!",1701279496,1701279607,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fuck off with your cunting fucking LAUNCHER you stupid cunts. Go and fix Cyberpunk 2.0 before fucking with this game that was GOOD! I was going to replay it on harder (hardest?) difficulty. But fuck you CDPR you stupid bastards. You lost your best people, now you are fucking with the one thing you got right! Im not dealing with launching a luncher to launch a launcher. to play your fucking game again? Fuck off you money grubbing cunts.

Yeah, I recommend it, BUT...
OMFG!@!! Its DAMN BUGGY!!! I can never be sure if a quest is bugged, or if having found clues in a different order, the quest is broken completely or not. A bunch of the red highlighted items often wont trigger anything. Characters walking in the air, dying above ground when killed underground. No wonder Cyberpuke was so friggin bad, and how can anyone have expected anything different considering this is supposedly the GOTY edition? Have standards dropped so low, that this is an acclaimed game when its such a mess? 
Lots of decent voice acting. But among other things, those obscenely pregnant pauses in conversations are soo melodromatic that it makes me just read the subtitles and skip the laborious speeches, ruining the immersion completely.
One of the biggest stupidest decisions they have made with the game is that Geralt literally controls like a tank outside of combat. Fine control and movement is nearly impossible and its a joke how bad it is. When in combat he is nimble, quick, and moves like you would expect.
OMFG the Crones fight as Ciri SUUUUCCCKKKSSS. She is a horrible one trick pony to play and just a boring slog. But that fight requires you to load and sit through a bunch of skippable cutscenes before being able to reply (no save point right before the fight). So, every time you die its a pain to sit through the crap before getting to the actual gameplay. Then after, you have to sit through an UNSKIPPABLE cutscene. That was the final straw. I wish I could just kill off Ciri, she is awful. The cutscene is hopefully finished now Ive added this rant to the review. Im so sick of the long winded repetitive story. 
So, Ive finished the ""story"" now.... I skipped through most of the ending. It dull, drawn out, not that exciting for a boss fight. I thoroughly dislike ciri and I really dont care what happens to her, not that I really have throughout the game. She has just been the ""object"" that we chase through the world and an annoying distraction from playing as Geralt.

The mechanics: combat, abilities, arsenal.. there is a great flow to your actions while fighting, or even movement scaling various buildings and obstacles, traversing perilous areas by foot, horse or boat.

The storyline is true enough to novel with enough coverage of lore to make all the possible moral and political choices interesting and believable

The character development is phenomenal, even side characters are a great treasure of conversation, romance and comedic relief, as well as some heartfelt and wholesome moments.

The world and landscape are breathtaking. You won't even realise that you've poured hundreds of extra hours into the game on side quests, material gathering and general inventory/arsenal improvement -- exploring the map itself is a treasure and finding interesting and hidden spots all over the world keeps you on you toes as much as the sunset has you glued to the various horizons. The colour palette for this game is 10/10.

Finally -- THE RUSSIAN VOICE ACTING AND TRANSLATION --    11/10 

It reads and sounds like a Nikolai Gogol novel. The voice actors for Geralt, Yen, Djikstra, and almost every other lovable side personage was SPOT ON. As a native English speaker who lived in Russia, I think the Slavic background is reproduced in the game to an amazing degree.

Again, the colours, the semi dense forest turned farmland and plains, turned river and cave. It was like riding a train from Poland through the old Soviet bloc. The background conversation and dialogue nuances -- so many aspects of Slavic mentality are represented in the various characters and their mannerisms.

The banking scene in Blood and Wine is a spitting image of what it was like trying to get official documents processed in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. From one window to another, with all the personnel ducking and dodging you while feeling they've already done you a great sacrifice. So many small moments and pieces of cinematic experience captured the desperate feel of central European feudal times as well as the blend to totalitarian and communist undertones -- it was all perfect.

''Blood and Wine DLC''

This DLC was a 10/10 with the fact that you get a new city called ''Toussaint'' and you meet loads of new characters with a lot of new enemies and gear like armor and swords. Story overall was way more interesting then the DLC ''Hearts of Stone'' because of the following reasons-

- Larger amount of the characters that you can interact with.

- It has High Vampires in it which is a completely new enemy that you learn to fight against or reason with.

- You travel together alot in the story exploring ''Toussaint'' together with important people that you help to fight againts the vampires which made the experience more interesting.

- I felt like there was alot of more balance between figting and talking in the ''Blood and Wine'' DLC overall which made it better.


''Hearts of Stone DLC''

DLC was okay but felt like it was kind of boring overall, some of the missions were interesting but it didn't feel like it was enough things going on in story like it was mainly just running around talking. I think it needed a bit more balance between talking and fighting because the ''Blood and Wine DLC'' got that done pretty well.

Rating overall 6/10




Swedish version:

''Blood and Wine DLC''

Denna DLC var en 10/10 med det faktum att du f√•r en ny stad som heter ''Toussaint'' och m√∂ter m√§ngder av nya karakt√§rer med m√•nga nya fiender och utrustning som rustningar och sv√§rd. Ber√§ttelsen var √∂verlag mycket mer intressant √§n DLC ''Hearts of Stone'' p√• grund av f√∂ljande anledningar-

- St√∂rre m√§ngd av karakt√§rerna som du kan interagera med.

‚Äì Den har High Vampires i sig som √§r en helt ny fiende som man l√§r sig att sl√•ss mot eller resonera med.

- Ni reser mycket tillsammans i ber√§ttelsen och utforskar ''Toussaint'' tillsammans med viktiga personer som du hj√§lper till att bek√§mpa mot vampyrerna, vilket gjorde upplevelsen mer intressant.

- Jag k√§nde att det var mycket mer balans mellan att fika och prata i ''Blood and Wine'' DLC √∂verlag vilket gjorde det b√§ttre.


''Hearts of Stone DLC''

DLC var okej men jag k√§nde lite som att det var ganska tr√•kigt √∂verlag, n√•gra av uppdragen var intressanta men det k√§ndes inte som att det var tillr√§ckligt med saker som p√•gick i ber√§ttelsen som att det huvudsakligen bara sprang runt och pratade. Jag tror att det beh√∂vdes lite mer balans mellan att prata och sl√•ss eftersom ''Blood and Wine DLC'' gjorde det ganska bra.

I have finished this game on the Nintendo Switch a few years ago, but then decided to buy this game again to play on my PC and experience the next gen update. It's hard to say for many games nowadays, but for The Witcher 3, it is definitely worth every cent that I spent both on the Switch and PC.

The only downside for my own opinion is that I do not like the control, as in the control for walking and riding horse (especially when it involves me turning around corners or tight space). But it only happens in very specific tight situations and definitely does not affect my overall enjoyment since you won't be turning corners and tight spaces every time in the game.

.
After you get pass the game mechanic learning curve, The Witcher 3 provides impressive game play mechanics and immersive medieval Europe experience with vast number of likable characters. The main narrative is entertaining, and the pacing is executed relatively well. 
.
The major DLCs provides additional content and game play mechanics that added up to the based game extremely well. In Blood and Wine you will unlock additional city which lighten the mood of the game itself.
.
All in all, the Witcher 3 is an RPG masterpiece that has stood the test of time since its release in 2015. I believed that this game is worthy for a 9.5/10 recommendation score.

Greatest story game I have ever played and I may say it is one of the best games ever made. Reading the books and playing Witcher 1 and 2 are well worth the time and investment. I am playing through again and if I could forget it all and start anew I'd do so instantly.

It goes beyond mere entertainment and immerses you in a meticulously crafted fantasy world that's teeming with life, secrets, and moral complexity.

The moment I stepped into the vast and intricately crafted world of The Witcher 3, I was captivated. Its open world, meticulously designed and teeming with life, is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in the landscapes, cities, and characters is staggering. Every nook and cranny is filled with stories, quests, and secrets waiting to be unearthed.

The beauty and fantastic craftsmanship of all the characters add another layer to this immersive experience. Each character is intricately designed, with their own unique personalities, struggles, and stories. It's not just Geralt who feels real; every interaction with the diverse cast leaves a lasting impression.

As you traverse this breathtaking world, the soundtrack becomes an integral part of the journey. The symphony accompanying your adventures isn't just background noise; it's a soul-stirring composition that evokes a range of emotions. Whether riding through the sweeping landscapes or engaging in intense battles, the music heightens the experience, making each moment memorable.

Despite being a few years old, The Witcher 3 holds up beautifully and continues to shine as a testament to timeless game design and storytelling. Its storytelling remains nothing short of masterful, drawing players into a morally complex and emotionally charged web of choices and consequences. Geralt of Rivia, the protagonist, faces dilemmas that make players question their values. This narrative depth is a testament to the exceptional writing and character development in the game.

The Witcher 3 holds a deeply personal significance for me; confidently and proudly claiming the title of my all-time favorite game. Its profound impact on me transcends the confines of the screen, creating a journey that has etched itself permanently into my gaming memories. This immersive world not only played a crucial role in helping me through a difficult time but also provided a much-needed escape and a source of solace.

[u][b]Pros[/b][/u]
[list]
    [*]The storytelling is one of a kind, the Witcher 3 has established itself as a all-time great. The entire narrative is complex and contains well-developed characters.
    [*]The side quests are as compelling as the main storyline, which sets the level that the Witcher 3 is depicted at
    [*]Even 8 or so years later after release, people are still finding out new/different dialogue options dependant on what routes you choose
    [*]The combat system is engaging, each encounter is fun and challenging (as long as you play on Death March difficulty)
    [*]Great modding capability
[/list]

[u][b]Cons[/b][/u]
[list]
    [*]The combat system can feel slightly clunky, especially dependant on what input method you use. Game is best designed for controller input rather than mouse and keyboard.

Graphics are just beautiful and gorgeous, so many landscapes that leave me breathless and I just pause for a moment to admire them. Armor in the game looks great, weapons too. Animations are great and the character models are great. CD project red did a fantastic job.

A testimony to the music is the fact that it has been years since this game came out and I still listen to the soundtrack regularly in my free time, it's just that good. I never get bored of this soundtrack and I just wish that there was more of it.

Gameplay wise this game is amazing as well. No weak points with this title in my book. Controls are smooth and the way the combat system is built makes me feel like I am a real witcher. 

Story is also outstanding. The Witcher 3 makes you feel for its characters, you want to resolve their problems because you just care about them, a true example of good writing. And In my opinion the Hearths of stone dlc has the best story of the whole game, just love it.

Overall all an amazing game worth much more than its price in my opinion and I'm not say that you should take my opinion for granted  but that is just how much of influence this game has had on me. After the witcher 3 no other rpg feels on par with it. I strongly believe that everyone owes themselves to play this game, It's just that good. I urge everyone that reads this review to try this game. Definitely my all time favorite game, I may be biased, but I just love this game and I only wish I could replay it blind again, it's just that great of a game!",1604267553,1701109793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In short this game is one   of the masterpiece of this generation. Visually a stunning game. Forests, river, swamps, populated/abandoned villages everything just look amazing. My personal favorite was kaer morhen area. I turned off my hud and minimap just immerse myself into this beautiful open world of witcher. Whales in skellige sea left me mesmerizing.

Story and gameplay was was great. I'm not going to spoil it for you if you havent finished the game already.  Combat works flawlessly. I even enjoyed preparing to hunt or fight a monster, reading the bestiary for its weakness, putting proper oil to the swords, drinking the right potions. Loved the little details developer put in this game, people running for shelter when storm starts, random peasants shouting at the witcher, giving information about quests, children playing and singing, Geralt's facial hair growth and hundreds of other things like this.

The side quests are incredibly designed. They will put you in a dilemma. Also both of the dlc were amazing.

From the breathtaking landscapes to the richly detailed characters, every aspect of this game is a testament to the developers' dedication and passion.

The open-world design is unparalleled, offering a vast and diverse environment that kept me constantly engaged. Whether traversing the bustling cities, exploring dense forests, or sailing across vast seas, the attention to detail is astonishing. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle add a level of realism that enhances the overall immersive experience.

But what truly sets The Witcher 3 apart is its captivating narrative. The story is intricately woven, filled with morally gray choices that have meaningful consequences. Geralt of Rivia is a compelling protagonist, and the supporting cast is equally well-developed. The relationships you build and the decisions you make truly shape the outcome of the game, providing a level of depth rarely seen in the gaming world.

The combat system is both intuitive and challenging, rewarding players for mastering the art of swordplay, alchemy, and magic. The monster-hunting contracts add an extra layer of excitement, as each creature requires a unique strategy to defeat. The game strikes a perfect balance between action and strategy, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging throughout.

The attention to detail extends to the visuals and sound design. The graphics are stunning, and the soundtrack perfectly complements the epic journey, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments. Voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life in a way that's truly unforgettable.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a tour de force in the gaming industry. CD Projekt Red has crafted a masterpiece that not only raises the bar for open-world RPGs but also sets a new standard for storytelling in video games.

In addition to the unique world in The Witcher, there is something that radically identifies it in the space of the RPG - it is a tremendous naturalism of everything that is happening. Developers do not adapt to the toothless norms of artistic expression, prescribing bashfully hide naked bodies and pools of blood, do not offend women and children and, of course, include as many representatives of all races and minorities in the frame, even where they are inappropriate. 
As in the plot relationship, and in the severity of the issues raised, the authors remain faithful to the spirit of the original. There is no good and evil here, the ideals of justice give way to real social problems. Tyranny, infringement of the rights of groups of population, widespread cruelty and, of course, the struggle for power - politicized fantasy in popular culture is very popular today, but in the world of role-playing games - a rare bird. ""Witcher"" is densely inscribed in the artistic basis and confidently uses its resource. Did the developers finally uncover the potential of the universe in the final chapter of the history of Geralt from Rivia? 
Masters of needlework 
As the degree of elaboration of the plot, characters and voiced social problems, and territorially the world of ""Wild Hunt"" has become larger and more complete than in the previous parts. Quite correct in this case will be a comparison, not even with them, but with the standard of ""large size"" - The Elder Scrolls. However, unlike the latter, the scale in The Witcher is not the goal, but a condition for immersion in what the ""Scrolls"" just do not suffice - into the soulful atmosphere of the Slavic epos. 
Galloping the horse overcoming dense forests and endless plains, strolling through the streets of local villages, climbing the snow-covered mountain peaks of the Skellig Island, not only get aesthetic satisfaction from the grandiose landscapes and incredibly beautiful graphics, but also you feel the scale and significance of what is happening. Each frame of The Witcher 3 is filled with life: the trees are swaying from the gusts of the wind, the village children are sporting by the lake, along the roads are gangsters and warriors. In the inn you can throw yourself into a gwint (card game) and have a beer. In Novigrad you can listen to the priest's sermon, and in the tavern - indulge in the memories under the delightful song of Priscilla. The living world of the game, full of adventure romance, is beautiful. 
Chasing a girl 
In order to understand all the nuances and subtleties of the events and better penetrate the atmosphere of the world, it will be useful to get acquainted with the books of Sapkowski. However, this condition is not mandatory: after visiting a tavern in the first village you delve into the political situation. The northern kingdoms are experiencing the expansion of Nilfgaard, people hardly conceal their dislike for the invaders, somewhere a guerrilla movement is formed, conflicts between the local population and the ""blacks"" are erupting. All this, as usual, is just the background for the main action. 
Geralt remains faithful to the indestructible principles of neutrality and refrains from interfering in state affairs. The hero and his problems are enough: the love of his life, Jennifer, is forced to cooperate with Emperor Emgyr, Triss Merigold is hiding from the local inquisitors in Novigrad, and with the adopted daughter, Ciri, the situation is very bad - it is pursued by the Wild Hunt. Actually, it is to the search and rescue of the lady that the main storyline is dedicated. 

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt compares favorably with its closest competitors: from Dragon Age: Inquisition - the manual study of quests, from Skyrim - focus on the plot and its nonlinearity. On
the strength of the feeling of presence, the creation of CD Projekt RED is several goals higher than anything that has appeared in recent years. The trilogy about Geralt receives a brilliant completion in the form of ""Wild Hunt"", uniquely becoming a classic of role-playing games. 

Pros: a huge world, stunningly beautiful and filled with a variety of unique content; a large number of stylistically verified and voiced dialogues; set of choice situations; an amazing atmosphere; an interesting and rich history of the world and characters. 
Cons: weak artificial intelligence; some witch's abilities can upset the balance.

The open wilds already looked great, especially for an eight year old game, but dang, the improved ray traced lighting helps so much. Just more proof that lighting has been the weakest link in 3d game visuals since the second generation of 3d consoles and we can't get to full raytracing soon enough.

And of course, it's still the same excellent game as ever beyond that. Great story, great sidequests, very well written characters. The combat remains as... adequate as ever, and some aspects like inventory in particular and menu usage in general haven't aged very well, but at the very least, the biggest problems have been fixed now. Automatic oil usage is finally built-in, and alternate character movement makes Geralt a little less lurchy and clunky to move around. There's still about a dozen more quality of life improvement mods that should have been built in too, but hey, better some of the few problems were solved than none.

Speaking of improvements I would have preferred though, while the outdoors look amazing under the new lighting, interior lighting seems hardly changed at all. Apparently, sun and sky rays could be traced, but candles and torches couldn't? Not sure what's going on there, but the result is that the interior areas look much more dated than the exteriors, assuming you're using the latest bells and whistles.

Of course, there's more to this game than just beautiful backgrounds, and that's where the visuals don't succeed as much. No amount of improved lighting changes the fact that I just don't care for a lot the character designs overall and absolutely none of the monster designs. Not that they're technically lacking in any way, I just don't care for the designs themselves. But that's just par for the course with pretty much any western game relative to my tastes. If you're totally about realism and intentionally ugly monsters though, than it's all good. And hey, at least the music is a lot more pleasing to my ears than the character designs are to my eyes, the soundtrack absolutely holds up as well as ever.

It's often hard for me to give a simple yes or no, but not here. The Witcher 3 is a game that's about as close to perfect as any game has gotten, and has only gotten even better with the recent updates. Very, very recommended.

Definitely get the Complete Edition though, the DLC is both significant and even better than the main game content. In every way.",1701088012,1701088012,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In 2023, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has undergone a transformative update, gracing players with next-gen graphics that breathe new life into an already legendary game. As a seasoned Witcher, stepping back into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia feels like revisiting an old friend in a dazzling new light.

The visual overhaul is nothing short of breathtaking. The meticulously crafted landscapes, now richer in detail and realism, immerse players in the sprawling world of The Continent like never before. From the sun-kissed meadows to the murky swamps, each environment is a testament to the game's commitment to visual excellence.

Character models have been revamped, granting Geralt and his companions a level of detail that makes facial expressions and subtle nuances more palpable. The cinematic sequences, already a hallmark of the game, now showcase an even higher level of fidelity, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative.

The lighting and weather effects are among the standout features of this update. Dynamic weather transitions seamlessly, casting dramatic shadows across the landscape as storms brew and clear. Sunsets and sunrises paint the sky with a spectrum of colors, adding a layer of beauty to the already captivating scenery.

Performance-wise, the game takes full advantage of next-gen hardware, delivering smoother framerates and quicker load times. The responsiveness of controls adds an extra layer of fluidity to combat, making battles feel more dynamic and engaging.

While the graphical upgrade is the star of the show, the core elements that made The Witcher 3 a masterpiece remain intact. The rich storytelling, complex characters, and morally ambiguous choices continue to shape a narrative that's as captivating as it is morally challenging.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's next-gen update is a triumph, elevating an already outstanding game to new heights of visual splendor. Whether you're a returning Witcher or a newcomer to the world of monster hunting, this enhanced edition is a must-play, showcasing the timeless appeal of a modern classic in the RPG genre.",1450055722,1701077334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 Addressing other game developers ..


 The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a game that has simply phenomenally fallen in love with more than one million players from around the globe.  The game is a direct continuation of part 2 - The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings.  The game was developed by the same Polish studio CD PROJECT RED.  And I must say that the guys from CD Project jumped clearly above their heads.  By the way, it is worth noting that the new story about the adventures of Geralt from Rivia won more than a dozen prizes and competitive nominations.  And even now, 5 years after the release, the game still remains in the TOP of sales and consistently totals 25k people who play it daily.  Well, let's look at what kind of merit, the game has such a high popularity in the gaming community and help people who still, for some unknown reasons, have not passed this game and are in thought with buying it.

 Prologue

 Geralt and Wesemir in search of Yennifer stop in the village of White Garden, occupied by the Nilfgaards during the war.  Yennifer helps Geralt get to the city of Vizima, where the Nilfgaard emperor Emgyr Var Emreis instructs the witcher to find Ciri - for this purpose Geralt must visit several places: Velen, Novigrad and Skellige Islands.

 Plot

 To begin with, it is worth noting that part 3 of the Witcher series of games has the longest storyline.  At SpeedRun, all possible quests will take you + -25 hours of play.  If you pass the game for the first time and slowly, then it can take you about 100 hours to complete it, well, if with all the additional quests, then it‚Äôs 150 hours, if you decide to go through all the add-ons, you‚Äôll need + -200  hours ... Now let's list the main advantages of the game:

 - An interesting storyline with a lot of plot twists.  Although, at first, it can be boring, but only at first;

 - A lot of additional quests.  Moreover, these quests in places give odds to quests of the original storyline.

 - Variability and replayability of the plot.  In the game, we will more than once have to make decisions on which in the future, based on our choice, certain consequences and further events of the game will depend (This feature applies to additional quests too);

 - A detailed lore of the game.  Notes, books, letters, notes about monsters, legends and the like.  It is important to note here that all this is very interesting to read.

 - A huge number of memorable characters.

 Of the shortcomings, I would only note a boring complication, and as a whole, an excellent plot.  10 Geralts from Rivia out of 10.

 Gameplay

 The gameplay in the third part at first glance may seem too boring and complicated, but I assure you that after 5-10 hours of the game, you will understand that the gameplay of the game is simple to the point.  Yes, and almost unchanged since 2011.  And now let's briefly go over its features:


 - A completely open world with various regions inhabited by unique peoples.  As the developers assure us, in order to overcome the mainland along the horse, it will take more than 40 minutes of the present

 - Kraft system and Alchemy.  Our GG, with special desire and due dexterity, can weld or rivet anything to itself, naturally, in the presence of one or another recipe / drawing;

 - Just a huge abundance of various opponents and unique ways to deal with each of them;

 - A modest arsenal of knives, offset by a variety of superpowers of the protagonist in the field of magic and witchcraft.  With a successful combination, you can easily destroy one or another enemy;

 - An exciting and painfully simple, card game Gwint.  which has become a kind of hallmark of the game.  For this mini-game, it will also take you about two to three dozen hours.

 - A bunch of variations in terms of pumping the main character;

 - Customization of your character.  Anyway, but it is still present in the game;

 - Simple controls.

 Perhaps the only drawback of the gameplay component, I would note a large expenditure of time on a ride between quests.  It‚Äôs boring to ride, and sometimes it takes a very long time to ride, which in turn is very exhausting.  Fortunately, random events and a quick journey, which is available after exploring a particular region, save us.  Most of my shortcomings were not revealed.  And my assessment of the gameplay of this game is 9.5 Jennifer from Wengerberg of 10.

 Graphic arts

 The third part of the Witcher franchise, was developed on its own updated engine REDengine.  And here it must be said that the games of the Witcher series have always been famous for beautiful graphics.  The third part was no exception.  I can‚Äôt say that the graphics in the game are just so cinematic, but nevertheless, she will be able to please you with a huge number of competently staged, in terms of staging cut scenes, without any problems.  Among the shortcomings, I would note a meager supply of facial models for secondary NPCs.  Sometimes it happens that the same model of face can be a blacksmith in Podlessie, a military ambassador in Vyzima, and even a sorcerer.  For a AAA-class project, this is such a thing ... And so, the graphics in the game are beautiful, you can make a bunch of beautiful screenshots, I rate the graphics of the game at 9 Ivasiks out of 10.

 Atmosphere and Sound

 The atmosphere and setting in all the games of The Witcher series has always been a mixture of the Epochs of the end of the Middle Ages and Polish folklore.  .  The atmosphere is executed at the highest level, design and locations, monsters and ordinary people, just magnificent and perfectly characterizes the whole way of life and the essence of people's lives, in that era.  I want to believe the atmosphere of the game, when the game wants to show horror, you really experience it, when the game wants to scare, you really get scared.  Believe me, not every game can cling to the player with its trump atmosphere as the third part.  I have not seen such a detailed atmosphere and setting in any game.  Definitely 10 Ciri out of 10. You need to play this yourself.

 You can not say about the sound.  And the problem here lies not in the soundtrack itself, but in the reproduction of sound in dialogs.  It just so happened that in the Polish and Russian versions of the game, the characters in some places speak acceleratedly, and in some they are too slow.  In the English version, surprisingly, there are no such problems.  But the most interesting is that even 5 years after the release of the game, no one has yet to solve this problem.  Therefore, I basically do not give high marks to the soundtrack of the game, even despite the excellent soundtrack.  7 Keir Metz out of 10.

I have not yet had the chance to play the first two witcher games, but I soon plan to go back and try them out based on the success of this one. I have already beat the game twice (one normal, one death March, although I forgot to switch to DM at the beginning of the game and realized too late to switch over. Guess I‚Äôll have to beat it a third time to get the achievement) but each time I find myself continuing the exploration, following the many side quests and stories that the developers incorporated into this masterpiece. Even though this came out a while ago (2015, I think?), everything still feels advanced and up to date (graphics, controls, etc). There are a few bugs you‚Äôll encounter along the way, but nothing a little finagling can‚Äôt fix. All in all, definitely worthy of the game of the year titles it has won. 10/10 would recommend.

Both of the DLC packs add at the very least 30 hours and that is if you take the time to explore very little. If you are even slightly considering buying it, now is a perfect time as the game of the year addition is available practically everywhere for a great price and the free next gen update has already been released.

Ainda que n√£o tenha as mais complexas mec√¢nicas de combate, como outros hack n' slashes, o jogo compensa (e muito) com seu plot, suas quests, seus inimigos e seu mundo aberto.

Costumo sempre explorar exaustivamente jogos de mundo, visto que muitos recompensam bem (tanto em recursos quanto em conte√∫do) os jogadores que o fazem. Todavia, n√£o √© raro que essa explora√ß√£o meticulosa se torna cansativa. Em The Witcher 3, contudo, n√£o senti esse cansa√ßo, quanto mais explorava, mais tinha motiva√ß√£o para explorar mais, visto que o mundo √© montado de maneira a nunca existirem grandes espa√ßos vazios ou sem conte√∫do.

A hist√≥ria √© intrigante e te faz querer continuar de verdade, sempre deixando margem para miss√µes secund√°rias que mesmo algumas n√£o sendo t√£o complexas quantos outras, continuam √∫nicas e interessantes.

Foi a dublagem completa em portugu√™s que fez voltar a ter f√© nelas na √©poca, de t√£o bem feita que consegue ser.

The Witcher 3 √© uma melhoria IMENSA em rela√ß√£o aos √∫ltimos jogos da s√©rie, incr√≠vel para o ano em que saiu.

I was initially put off by how 'clunky' the game felt and how weird the combat was, until i decided to actually git gud at it.

The combat actually has an ebb and flow to it, trying to fight the current by spamming light attacks or heavy attacks will leave you bruised up and weak. You'll need to learn how to fight with the flow, over time you can chain flurry of strikes and dodges with well timed bombs and sign usage. I absolutely love this combat.

The story is actually insane. Instead of following the storyline area timing, Velen, Novigrad then Skellige. You can go Skellige, Novigrad and Velen. The storyline will change itself accordingly and you will definitely miss out a few quests, but your character and those around him will react accordingly! Side with the mad-king and you'll end up with a bad time, choose the warrior hot-head and you'll get a warmonger. Choose the incorrect answers to a mystery, and you may just let the killer escape and it will be YOUR fault.

My only gripe is that the equipment level does not scale save for two swords. You will need to go off the beaten paths and collect 'Witcher Gear' which are heaps above the regular high-tier random equipment you can have. The saving grace is that higher tier 'Witcher Gear' changes appearance based on their tier. The Griffin Armor at top tier looks so much different compared to the base version. It has more usable armor appearance, chainmail here and there, more padding at vulnerable areas.

In my world of great RPG's. I think The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt stands alongside greats like Read Dead Redemption 2, Final Fantasy Crisis Core, and Baldur's Gate 3 for example.

Honestly 10/10. Nothing is perfect in this world, but this game is a solid step beneath it.",1701009266,1701009266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
