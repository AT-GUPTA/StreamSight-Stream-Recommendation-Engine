First, it requires an online account separate from Steam. This nearly always gets a thumbs-down from me.
Second, the Discord channel, which seems to be the main way of getting support for the game, requires verifying a phone number, which is a privacy violation. Another thumbs-down from me.

As for the trainer itself: The training exercises do not compensate for field-of-view being different from the defaults. I quickly reached a stage where many of the training dummies were outside my FOV. I normally play games with a 90 degree FOV, but the defaults for KovaaK's are higher.

This game Kovaak is mostly focused on FPS gamers.
That's sad wish it was more practice for all round gaming than only FPS, like Moba/RTS.

Why do i play it than? 
Jumbo Tile Frenzy makes me active as a gamer. (My jumbo tile frenzy high score is 146)
Before i play any competitive game RTS/MOBA/FPS i do couple of runs.
Mini tile frenzy, tile frenzy and jumbo tile frenzy. Mostly Jumbo tile frenzy
If i do like 5 runs, i'm way more active in these moba/rts games and get higher APM (actions per minute).

I must say some other maps are fun to do too. But i dont think i do improve at all for FPS games.
This aim trainer is way different than FPS games and i do think it's pointless. It's my opinion so.. if you do have a different opinion and you do improve. Im happy for you! But i do not sadly.

The price isn't that high though.. it's 10 euro, so you can always try for 2 hours if you do like it.
- Buy and test. 
- Like, keep it. 
- Dislike, refund.

So personally i can't recommend this game. Sorry you will not improve much.
Only if you get really really the same vibe from Kovaak to your FPS title.
For me it do not work.

Sincerely,
miEye

i bought the core since it was like $1.50 more at the time, and figured why not, but tbh i haven't tried the tracking trainer yet as i hear it's not good; so just been in sandbox (mainly using the voltaic routines). 

there are a couple of annoyances, like not being able to set the startup mode to local playlists or geforce experience not loading correctly (for instant replay), but overall it's definitely been worth the price.

my main complaint is that voltaic integration isn't as good as aimlabs, and having to deal with spreadsheets either manually or using updater tools is kind of a pain, but once you plateau at least you're not updating all that frequently ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",1702096480,1702096480,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Reviews on subreddits aimlab and kovaak about the same and useless to those who have not tried both trainers, which say that the difference in price and number of scenarios, but that's not true. 

The main difference between these trainers is the quality of scenarios and their intensity. The Kovaaks community has really tried to make moderately challenging scenarios that create a challenge without turning it into a routine and stagnant development of your aim in pursuit of points like Aimlab does. My feeling is that the scenarios in Aimlab seem too basic, which develop individual parts of aim for specific situations, where as Kovaak develops your mouse skill into something more whole and complete.

Not playing CSGO at all made me a complete newbie to Valorant aiming. I love playing Valorant and most of my friends have started playing it. Being a try-hard that I am I wanted to gain momentum on the loads of people that are switching to Valorant from CSGO. My aim being sub-par made that impossible for me to win 1v1 against CSGO experienced players. They being well versed with ideas like Crosshair Placement. Now I've played my fair-share of CS 1.6 but never with crosshair placement and all recent developments in tac shooters in mind. 

This is where KovaaK 2.0 came in like a gun-toting angel in my life. The aim routines made by vets and pros are so focused at areas that most like me lack in. I bought a new mouse, switched to a newer, lower sensitivity and started practising a month ago. Now this is no ""Pro-maker"" but it definitely, slowly and gradually adding confidence and efficiency to my aim. I have no idea how I can now peak angles and take kills that still surprise me. They will soon stop surprising me and make these kills second nature. Kovaak will have most to do with that. The times I die because I whiffed my aim is reducing and I die mostly in most situations because the enemy is just plain better than me.

Update: I'm down-voting it now because I am sick and tired of the constant updates and the ""Downloading scenarios"". Such a waste of time, I don't see why it was designed in such a way that every scenario needs an update every-time I launch the game then it updates again when there's an overall update. If the game didn't lag while it was updating the thousands of scenarios, it would've still been fine.. but then the scenario you want to play is also the part of the daily update and does not launch. So you sit and watch the game update, the you sit and watch the scenarios update. WHAT?!! It's a freakin dot clicking software for goodness sake.


Edit 20th November 2023: Kovaak's has matured into an aim trainer that stands a notch above the rest. It caters to the dedicated individual, rewarding diligence with unparalleled precision and control in your gaming endeavors. For those who take aiming seriously and seek the very best in personalised training, Kovaak‚Äôs is the definitive choice.

The sheer joy of boosting across the arena, executing jaw-dropping aerial maneuvers, and smashing the ball into the opponent's goal is unmatched. The learning curve is steep, but oh so rewarding. Mastering the mechanics takes time, but the feeling of pulling off an incredible aerial shot or a perfectly timed save is unparalleled.

The game‚Äôs beauty lies in its simplicity. It‚Äôs easy to pick up and play, but the depth lies in the nuance of car control, positioning, and teamwork. Whether you‚Äôre a lone wolf in solo matches or part of a coordinated team, the thrill of Rocket League is universal.

The customization options add a personal touch to the game. From different cars to flashy decals, the ability to style your vehicle creates a sense of identity in the arena. The various game modes, from standard matches to chaotic extra modes, offer something for every mood.

However, Rocket League isn‚Äôt without its flaws. Sometimes matchmaking can be a bit inconsistent, leading to unbalanced matches. Also, the occasional server issues can disrupt the flow of gameplay, which can be frustrating.

Despite these minor setbacks, Rocket League remains an exhilarating experience that‚Äôs hard to put down. It‚Äôs a game that rewards dedication, skill, and teamwork. If you're looking for an addictive blend of sports and vehicular mayhem that‚Äôs as thrilling as it is competitive, Rocket League is the game for you. Strap in, rev up your engines, and get ready to soar to new heights in this rocket-fueled spectacle!",1700439256,1700439256,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I am compelled to convey to you the depth of my affection for the grand, golden orbs that have, in their own unique manner, illuminated the course of my life. These resplendent globes have been my unwavering companions, tutors, and even guardians through the many trials of my aim career.

Imagine, my love, a time when I was but a wandering mariner, my life's aim shrouded in a sea of uncertainty. I yearned for direction, and it was amidst the tempestuous waves of the ocean that I encountered these magnificent spheres. They became the beacons of my existence, illuminating the path towards self-discovery, discipline, and personal evolution.

Through endless hours of practice and play, I mastered the art of precision and concentration. These orbs taught me that life is a constant endeavor to reach one's objectives. With unwavering dedication and singular focus, success may be achieved. These spheres also educated me in the ways of embracing both victory and defeat, for every missed target served as a valuable lesson, and every triumph a treasure.

My voyages with these luminous orbs transported me to wondrous locations, my dearest. I embarked on epic odysseys across boundless greens, challenged my comrades to spirited games of valorant, and engaged in thrilling contests upon the fortnite island. The exhilaration of success, the weight of defeat, the camaraderie cultivated in the heat of competition, and the personal growth engendered along the way were immeasurable.

But as with any maritime expedition, the journey was not without its turbulent seas. There were moments of exasperation, occasions when my resolve was tested, and the contemplation of relinquishing the pursuit. Yet, it was these same resplendent, golden orbs that whispered to me in those trying times, ""Do not surrender; aim higher!"" The lessons I gleaned from such challenges were invaluable, fostering a spirit of resilience, steadfast determination, and the unwavering conviction that with dedication, all is attainable.

Today, I find myself indebted to those grand, golden orbs that have transformed me from a directionless wanderer into a man with purpose and ambition. They have imparted upon me the wisdom of aspiring to greatness, not only in the realm of esports but in the grand theatre of life itself. These orbs were my companions in moments of triumph, in moments of tribulation, and in the countless moments betwixt.

In summation, I am unable to fully express the depth of my affection for these grand, golden balls that have instructed me in the art of aiming. They have touched each facet of my life, assisting in the forging of my character. My sojourn with them has been a magnificent adventure, replete with trials and tribulations, and I owe them all that I have become. Therefore, when next you encounter these brilliant spheres, know that their profound impact extends not only to one's aim but to life itself. They are not mere sporting implements, my love; they are teachers of the grandest order.

With unwavering love,

824270,121535126,76561198443798981,0,11,2812,0,237,1696948654,"I think the modes focus too much on penalising missing, obviously 'if you miss alot you shouldnt be rewarded for it' makes sense, but it really forces you to go for accuracy and stumps improvement for when you wanna go faster. It really feels like if you go 2x slower and get 100% accuracy you rank better than playing regular (im talking just 85-90% accuracy here) and its not fun to see your graph go to shit just because you wanted to try and get faster 

The penalty should only really kick in from <80% accuracy, hell id take <95% if it was based on how far from that threshold you were, doing modes that dont take accuracy into account doesnt really fix the issue either cause spam clicking becomes viable and by that point the graph is useless 

Better players will always be more accurate but slapping people in the face for attempting to get better in a way that the map creator doesnt take into account isnt great (when i say this i mean stuff like trying to flick between 2 targets immediately for muscle memory flick training, youll sometimes come up short by like 5 pixels but you fucked up by trying to practice this way and now you just played your worst run on that map even if you did a similar number of targets hits compared to a regular run)

tldr i need to get good, besides penalties being way too harsh its a good training program, if you just get into it see if you can turn off your stats because it just distracts you from actually improving",1661968326,1696950170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ability to customize scenarios and drills allows users to focus on their specific weaknesses.

Variety of Scenarios (10/10):

The ability to create custom routines and drills is also a plus.

Community Support (9/10):
The Kovaak's community is active, and the platform has strong support from both the developers and the user base. This results in regular updates, improvements, and the addition of new scenarios. It's easy to find guidance and tips from experienced users on how to maximize your training.

The user interface in Kovaak's is functional but not the most user-friendly. While it serves its purpose, some users might find it slightly overwhelming or less polished compared to some other software. However, the primary focus is on training effectiveness.

Performance (9/10):
Kovaak's is well-optimized and runs smoothly on most gaming PCs. It doesn't demand high-end hardware and provides a lag-free experience, essential for precise aiming training.

Price (8/10):
Kovaak's is a paid software, which might deter some potential users. However, many find the investment worthwhile considering the significant improvement it can bring to their aiming skills and, ultimately, their performance in FPS games.

This aimtrainer is really dope. There's a lot of scenarios you can play to train your weak points and refine your strong points.
1 week after I started training my aim with KovaaKs, I saw the results in games (like tracking people on warzone).
It's also possible that you take more time to see results depending on your actual skill level.
You just need discipline and to always keep grinding to improve.
It can also be a bit addictive tho BAHAHAHAH
Also i'm clicking heads way more, faster and accurately than before on csgo/valorant, and tracking is on point most of the time.
Switching between targets became way faster and accurate aswell.
It's worth the price 10000%, even more if you just started to play on kbm.

But it feels like the developers are just dead. I wouldn't be surprised if groups start moving on and this trainer gets buried by future competition.

[h1] Let me tell you why it's still alive: [/h1]
Scenario count, 
Nvidia partnerships & content creator partnerships
Giveaways, 
Being first in the scene,
Community Benchmarks / Routines (PureG & Voltaic, rip Revosect)

The YouTube videos are cool and all.

[h1] Cons: [/h1]'
I joined the Kovaaks community right when 2.0 came out. There is a noticeable performance dip from 2.0 and 3.0. Every update after 2.5 feels like 1 step forward and two steps back.

I used to hit 300-400 fps on KovaaKs. Now I wonder if I can hit a constant 200.

The connection between developers and the community is dead.
We get told ideas of sens randomizers; only AimBeast receives them. Then Aim Lab. Now Oblivity has one as well. I shouldn't need to download an old intercept driver, banned by many anti-cheats when competitors have it built-in. 
(Though the online playlist, playlist randomizer & graphs were good updates.)

Updates on what's going to get changed are not expressed. I knew they fixed the invincibility of scenarios. It becomes an issue for their partner Voltaic's benchmarks. But the rest can just be popped out randomly. A Trello with a roadmap like Phasmophobia would be good to see what's upcoming. So that we don't just go around assuming developers are dead.

We talk about how KovaaKs needs a UI Overhaul but gets pushed to the side. (It doesn't matter how good the actual scenarios are; users will go off initial impressions when buying. The UI drives people away compared to Oblivity, AimBeast, and AimLab)
People are afraid to go into the settings as it looks too complicated.

Do you know what drove some people away from AimLab? It was the awful default scenarios. Community scenarios in the ""Sandbox"" were embraced and brought Kovaaks up. The Meta is a ""cool"" idea but is the same idea as AimLab default scenarios. Embrace the Sandbox.",1602612833,1693559069,True,59,25,0.828968703746795654,0,True,False,False

I will be splitting this review into multiple sections. Look below to see a table of contents listing each and every segment. This review will be over-viewing some main general topics. This review will go more in depth about whats available in the game for your average day to day player, and what makes the game generally enjoyable and/or useful.

Section 1: What is Kovaaks?
Section 2: Positives
Section 3: Negatives
Section 4: Conclusion

Section 1: What is Kovaaks?
Kovaaks is a aim trainer developed by The Meta Game INC. It was designed as a way for players to get inherently better at base mechanics like aim and all the facets that follows with, and soon exploded into a competitive score-reacher for many. Kovaaks gained much more popularity during the successes of early Valorant, encouraging many to practice and sharpen their aim and their skills. Kovaaks, Aimbeast, and Aimlabs are some of the most popular aim trainers known to date and all provide differing resources and experiences to improve your aim. 

Section 2: Positives of Kovaaks
Kovaaks very flexible, inbuilt nature allows players to test the limits of their aim in ways many would not find possible in other games or scenarios. There are well over 20,000 scenarios on Kovaaks, each of them providing different approaches to aiming and varying difficulties. Kovaaks is also very customizable, allowing for freedom of cross-hair changes, color of enemies, color of enemies when specifically aiming on them, and even smaller things like simulated input lag and others. Kovaaks is also very optimized so you should experience little to no lag or fps issues. Kovaaks supports many games such as Valorant, Apex Legends, Overwatch, and Quake, each group having many instances and scenarios for them to practice on to improve in their respective games. Another positive of Kovaaks is the community. Voltaic, known as one of the biggest aiming communities, is found mainly in Kovaaks and their extensive research and databases go far into the idea of aim theory, allowing you to pursue your aim growth journey at full speed. Many are very supportive; willing to give advice at a winks notice, and plenty of guides and other useful information have been shared by Voltaic. If you'd like to join their discord, heres the link: https://discord.gg/voltaic

Section 3: Negatives of Kovaaks
Kovaaks, despite its greatness, has competition that are free. Because of Kovaaks paywall, that will always be a barrier for some looking to improve their aim. Another negative of Kovaaks is that it can be hard to begin aim training without a general grasp of how Kovaaks works. Many start Kovaaks with no real general direction and start to experiment, however many will also get lost and focus on the wrong things for the game they're intending to play, or just simply don't know where to start or what scenarios to play. This requires the user to be more receptive to knowledge and look for youtube guides and other things to even start their journey, which can be a hurdle for some. While Kovaaks has the highest general diversity for playable scenarios, other free aim trainers are coming with niche features that may give some the temptation to look into more affordable options. Aimlabs, for example, has a sensitivity finder, along with many playlists made by official valorant, csgo, and other big-title pros. 

Section 4: Conclusion
In conclusion, Kovaaks is an amazing way to improve aim, given dedication and effort is put in. I highly recommend playing Kovaaks if you are looking to improve at all aspects of your aim, and are willing to see results. As a reviewer, I saw massive improvements on multiple aspects of my game, and I found myself easily achieving never-seen before aim goals both in and out of game for myself. I came in an aim rookie and I came out with a sense of satisfaction, confidence, and accuracy. And that's not the end! to this day I still improve and sharpen my aim as much as possible with kovaaks. Highly recommend!",1687904365,1691803189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The problem with aim training is that you don't see the tangible benefits of doing it for 30+mins every day soon enough, and are better off just aim training in the in-game environment anyway...

I have a lot of experience with aim trainers, I've used voltaic's fundamentals and benchmarks to monitor and track my progress over time and have spoken on a one-to-one basis with people who have 1500hr alone in kovaaks and play it at the highest level, then they joined me for a game on Valorant and played shit.

It just goes to show that it's not really worth grinding, aim is one of those things where you either have it or you don't, if you're like me and you have decent aim but more of a brain player (in tac-fps) then you are far better off just maxxing out your brain stats, i.e. just focus on in-game decisions, angle advantages, crosshair placement, and general game sense to make the most elo gains.

If you think i'm wrong, please, try for yourself.. just don't come crawling back to this review when you realise you wasted hours of your life to not really improve. It's all based on genetics, upbringing, eyesight, setup.. all these things have an impact on your aim. 

It's also to do with age, if you're already over 25 years old you've got better things to do than waste time aim training, just play the game instead. 

Before you argue against this, remember that 57 hours is essentially 57 days of using this game, and on top of that i've used other tools/softwares for aim training, and before you argue against that just remember I scored 150ms on a reaction speed test so it's nothing to do with my individual skill.",1691763927,1691763927,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

For the more hardcore players with a few hundred/thousand hours in-game, I'd recommend you supplement your in-game practice with Kovaak, and spend more time in your preferred game.

However, if you just want to become an aimbot and don't care too much about getting good at a *specific* FPS, then grind away. Just remember to take regular breaks and do your research on proper aiming technique. Right out the gate, regardless of your level, I recommend looking into the ""Voltaic"" and ""Revosect"" communities, both of which have some of the best FPS aimers of all time, and both of which release tons of helpful educational content to learn from.

I've been playing video games a very long time. From learning from the people that came up with medic strafing in BF1942, I've seen FPS games go a very long way. If you want to learn an aiming skill, chances are this trainer has it. I haven't even been disappointed in community made stuff.

I was in the camp that just because I hit those ""Youtube worthy"" shots once a week that I was doing great. And I am. But I do want to get a bit outside of casual again. Enter Kovaaks for the 4th time. I haven't trained a lot, but if you train with this you will notice an immediate difference. It may not last long the first time, but it works. Exercise your aim!

I know there'll be questions like ""Is it even worth it?"" or ""Does it even work?"" and blah blah blah.
Firstly, yes, it does work. After a month of training aim it became a bit better and now I can blast my friends' asses off and laugh while they're in bursting fire of anger, filling their faces to bloody red with [b]HATRED[/b], cursing me left and right and then scared to even fight against me in any fps game.

Secondly.... eeeeeh to be honest I don't really know.....
You can get practically the same result if you just play fps games for a lot of time
If you play singleplayer fps shooters like Ultrakill or horde shooters (Payday 2, left 4 dead) then you already aim a lot and somewhat ""train"" by getting used to or improving your mouse movement. People who only play competitive games can use deathmatch as a way to train their game sense for a specific game and, once again, ""train"" their aim. In some ways it's actually better than aim training in a game about it.
If we're talking about battle royales or just games where shooting isn't the only part of the game then aim training game will help.

I'll recommend this game for anyone, who's serious about improving their aiming skills, but if you're just a casual gamer I'd, probably, not recommend you this.

[spoiler]Buuuut if you're into just vibing, while clicking some balls like a little weirdo under lo-fi music go ahead, I guess....[/spoiler]

[i]P.S: I'd like to give you one tip that I understood not long time ago. Aiming is strongly based on your feelings, If you have some problems while playing multiplayer games (Performance anxiety, anger and etc) try to deal with them [b]FIRST[/b], then you can solve your bad habits in mouse movement.[/i]",1623596042,1681051212,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Kovaak's WILL help you get good aim. BUT!!! You have to use it correctly. You need the right tasks. It is impossible to discover the right tasks on your own. The only way to do it, is by having a playlist with a lot of good tasks in it. You will also need some guidance or you'll waste a lot of time (matty_ow's advice is the best). 

You'll want to check out matty_ow's discord server, he has a guide and playlists (type matty_ow into twitch and click the discord link on his about page). Check him out first, his advice is the best. Next, you'll want to join the Voltaic discord and look at their guides and use their benchmarks/playlists (the discord link is https://discord.gg/voltaic). 

If you put in the time and effort, Kovaak's WILL give you good aim. 

The only bad thing about Kovaak's is that it isn't being improved as much as Aim Lab or Aim Beast are, but Kovaak's is still the aim training King right now and I don't see that changing any time soon. Aim Lab is free so you should only be split between Kovaak's and Aim Beast. If you are, choose Kovaak's. It has much more content and that content is more easily accessible (assuming you can get playlist codes).

Oh yeah, don't pay for the subscriptions. They suck balls. Just use Voltaic Benchmarks and look at Voltaic team members' youtube channels, that will help more than any subscription services Kovaak's offers.",1680482757,1680483167,True,22,3,0.712566852569580078,0,True,False,False

Can't be fully tabbed out and minimized, it always stays full screen behind windows. Even the windowed-fullscreen mode can't be minimized and displays in full screen, and takes resources in the background.

Haven't been able to look at the UE crash log that comes up cause my system gets hard locked into the Kovaak's window stuck on the last frame before the crash. I can alt tab and look at the previews of other windows but I can't actually open them, can't close Kovaak's. I can ctrl+alt+del but as soon as I click task manager I'm put back into the Kovaak's screen. Alt+F4 doesn't work either.

Kovaak's is a really good aim trainer. I've practiced a good amount that now I get even more reports from players who think I'm cheating and telling me I look sus cause I can flick so good. This all because of Kovaaks and aim theory. If you want to have good aim I suggest you download kovaaks and watch West Proter on YT who explains more on aim theory and sensitivity. You should also Join Voltaic's discord and see where you are in the benchmarks and see were you are ranked. Because I believe that if you see where you are in the benchmarks it will help push you to get better aim and to polish it to make it more smooth. I also suggest going on YT and looking up maps/scenarios that match your game to help you bring it into in-game scenarios.

I also suggest that you should watch SoaR hollow, wrthcrw, Luciian, Shroud, iitztimmy, Dfalt, Faulty L3 and Baranox. I could list more but these people are people I believe to have put the most time in their aim.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Definitely surprised at how well the training is working, considering this was purchased by me about two weeks ago.

It's important to note that if you're looking to buy this, while aim training, it doesn't seem as if your aim is actually improving because there isn't just one tip or trick that instantly skyrockets your game.

From my experience so far, you gradually get better with your movements because you're given dozens of long playlists tailored to most common in-game scenarios.

The more you practice with the playlists, the more you'll see your stats improve on the Kovaak's leaderboard with thousands of online players.

All in all, practicing in Kovaak's absolutely translates into your favorite FPS.

I skipped out on KovaaK's for a long time because it never really went on sale and if it did it was for like 5% off; eventually I caved and I fully regret not purchasing this sooner. My aim has truly leveled up in a way I never thought it would.

I know I sound like I'm praising it like it's the second-coming of Christ with this review but as someone that was Top 500 in Overwatch for several years and got to develop friendships and connections in the pro scene, this aim trainer can seriously make you have laser-beam aim granted you put in the time consistently and research what the actual good scenarios are. Voltaic is a big one (don't just search it up in-game, look for the big google spreadsheet online), but I hardly ever touched it and got to where I was using different scenarios (mostly AIMER7's routines) based on what I was weak in at the time.

I highly advise you take a look at this video if you're still skeptical, as it was what inspired me to seriously research aim trainers and eventually get to where I am now. It's never too late to start.

If you're hard pressed for cash, Aim Lab is free. If you're serious about aim training, buy this and download both.

Now, that's only if you're using the sandbox mode. The Trainer, the DLC, both worthless - they almost seem as if they were made to compete with Aim Lab's original vision (which was also worthless).

That there is a price tag attached to it is bewildering but it appears to come from a place of passion and the price does explain it's positive reception (sunk cost fallacy). It is my opinion that the unique features Kovaaks offers over software like Aim Labs or 3D Aim Trainer are better learned through playing whatever game you want to improve at.

I coast a consistently locked 144fps in Valorant, Overwatch 2, or any aim trainer I throw at my admittedly weak 1050ti, however Kovaaks at min settings brings my pc to it's knees, leaving me with a measly 50-60fps. Considering what this software is doing, the relative performance is unacceptable.

I expected the performance impact a compromise of the games strong polish in it's menus and assets but I can't say they impressed on any real level. A serious lack of weapon model customisation to accommodate a variety of games and somehow passing under the already low bar of unimpressive target models. Confusingly short menu windows designed around a save button that closes you out of the option menu and requires re-entry, is a head-scratcher to be sure. Ultrawide support that lacks scalability for non-stretched resolutions apart from native. UI/UX omissions expected in a free title but very odd indeed to see in a paid excursion.

In terms of user experience in navigating the program I would seat this just under Aim Labs in how it guides players to relevant playlists -which was also not spectacular for any beginner unsure of where to start. To offer some advice I recommend looking at 3D Aim Trainer and it's 'Become a Pro' training section that offers a selection of exercises targeting different categories of aim with ascending levels of difficulty in it's exercises and then providing a four 'tests' which summarises that users skill of that category of aim. I'm under no delusion that 3D Aim Trainer is perfect, these exercises are limited and not perfectly tuned for all games which is what turned me towards Kovaaks in the first place. However this is what I feel is missing from Kovaaks and Aim Labs, a comprehensive and accessible, clearly defined and digestible default segment of the software dedicated to onboarding new  players to receive a baseline level of raw aim that can later be expanded upon using playlists. Similar to how an irl gym functions, yes gym go-ers can do all the research to find a basic routine, weight amounts and number of repitions of exercises to that they will do but some will hire a personal trainer at the gym to add direction to their training and later build off that basic advice and direction once they've been properly acclimated to the environment and routine. 'Become a Pro' is a personal trainer and a guiding light to the uninitiated and that is what Kovaaks sorely lacks.

As it stands now I will continue to vouch for the aforementioned trainers. I hope to see Kovaaks expanded upon and polished up to truly be the crowning aim trainer.",1671828996,1671828996,False,33,13,0.6194038987159729,0,True,False,False

Secondly, it is fantastically suited to any game you want to aim train for. You can customise your settings to specifically what game you want to play along with things like FOV and sensitivity 

Thirdly, there is such a wide range of maps for every possible aspect of a game that you want to improve at. Tracking, precision, shotgun aim, SMG aim, you name it, and KovaaK‚Äôs will have a great selection of maps to help you improve wherever you want to

If you want to level up your aim for the games you love, then KovaaK‚Äôs is for you. It will be worth every penny as long as you put some time into it. Aim training has helped me so much in so many games and competitive performance just isn‚Äôt the same without amazing softwares like KovaaK‚Äôs.",1646487301,1669509556,True,2,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False

Original Review - For the very first hours of the game, my arm starts to get that gym fatigue. I am a left-handed person, which means my right arm is generally a bit weak.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1668574787,1668574787,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1667990370,1667990370,True,52,23,0.720514297485351563,0,True,False,False

In the meantime, literally nothing useful is being added; all i see are new main menu popups that are basically ads. I PAID FOR THIS SOFTWARE why do I have to watch ads every time I launch the trainer?

I would love Kovaak to be what it is supposed to be - an aim trainer. I would love to be able to launch it between matches for a quick 5-10 minute aim practice. I don't need all the extra bells and whistles with featured maps and whatnot. I want quick access to my one playlist I use to click on targets while I wait for my next Apex match to load. Is that too much to ask for?

Now if the devs really wanted to IMPROVE the software they could include an advanced sensitivity calculator into it, similar to what we can find on third party websites. Or hell, even a button that would make Kovaak scan your config files and show you the sensitivity and FOV values you have for games you have installed; this way you could quickly and seamlessly adjust them all to one single value.

Another idea would be to include a quick start option where you launch the software and it sends you straight into a pre-defined playlist - no leaderboards, no settings or menus; just one click that sends you straight into action.

TLDR: great software but the devs overcomplicate it while missing on features that could be actually useful.",1640528538,1667929285,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I was introduced to Kovaaks by a friend - named Frank - while we were out golfing, claiming that it would make me the beast FPS player that all E-girls crave. I, being desperate for some love in my life, bought it when I returned home. Back then my aim was terrible, and I was dogwater at FPS. No woman had ever wanted me; whenever I tried to hit on a woman, they would respond with things such as ""you're so trash - get lost"" or ""sorry, I don't date bots."" As soon as I had accumulated 100 hours on Kovaaks, I went out to a nightclub to see if my friend was right; and sure enough, a beautiful woman with blue eyes, pink hair, and wearing a D.VA outfit, could just not resist me upon a first glance - and soon as I told her that I know my way around a mouse and keyboard, that's when she fell for me for sure. We chatted for a bit while downing down bottle after bottle of G-Fuel, and we discussed our gaming skills as well as other gaming-related topics. I didn't tell her about my Kovaaks aim training, as I kept that as my secret. I took her back to my house, and love took its course. Months pass by, we get married, and then have a child together - a precious little baby girl. Then, inexplicably, I become absolutely hooked to Kovaaks. My wife would frequently come into my room and catch me playing tile frenzy for hours on end - and she DID NOT tolerate it. Whenever I came out of my room, we would argue furiously over my new-found addiction. Every time she claimed that it would not make me better at FPS and that it was useless. She would also call me names such as 'choker' and 'all aim, no brain.' She always felt lied to about the legitimacy of my skills, because this aim training did not translate to any in-game skill. I adamantly swore with my life that Kovaaks would make me a gaming god. This went on for 6 months until she decided to leave me, and take our child with her. She fucking left me all because I believed that I would become a God by playing this shit. Every day since then I would wake up in a pool of tears, beating myself up for being so fucking stupid. I repeatedly wanted to take my own life, knowing that all my worth was gone. I tried fixing this shit by messaging her on Discord and Steam, telling her I was so sorry. She told me to get fucked and blocked me on every means of reaching her. She's was now with a jacked up dude with 10k hours on CSGO, and is playing for Fnatic. I have nothing left.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

[h1][b] I will not review edit aim lab, I'm not gonna bother.

[hr][/hr] Starting with how important is Aim Training?
[b] Aim Training is a good thing and depending on which game you main it might increase your Aiming in that game such as CS:GO, Valorant, or even Apex.
[hr][/hr] Kovaaks or Aim Lab?
[b] I believe both Aim Trainers are very good and have their ups and downs, but one is free and one is not, last time I played both Aim Trainers it seems that Aim Lab would be the better option, although it's a persons opinion on which is better and is not confirmed on which is better.
[hr][/hr] Aim Trainers or in-game Aim Trainers?
[b] Depending on the game, as an example, CS:GO has workshop maps that contain many practices for the player to use like ""Aimbotz, yPrac, and etc"" also including the Deathmatch Gamemode and community servers that also have different servers just for training your aim. It is safe to say just use the in-game workshop maps over Aim Trainers IF you main CS:GO.
[b] Games like Apex Legends (last time I played) don't have many practices for ""Tracking"", which is one of the main things you do in that game, but you can also just play the game enough to a degree the ""Tracking"" is easy, but Kovaak's (or Aim Lab) would also benefit you, I would say you can use Kovaaks for Apex.
[b] Last example but with 2 different games, the 2 games I will be using as an example is Overwatch and EFT (Escape From Tarkov), starting with Overwatch, you could use Kovaaks but Overwatch has servers for Aim Training, and workshop maps (kind of) to Aim Train, but a game like EFT you do NOT need Aim Training, considering the game has many many mechanics including the guns kick and etc, that game you have to play it constantly if you wanna be good at it.
[hr][/hr] My Experience with Aim Trainers
[b] I have used many including Kovaaks and AIm Lab as my most played, I like Aim Lab more due to it being less complicated and having a better looking UI, and it is more fun to just Aim Train for fun, but both Aim Trainers never let me down, it has made my aim slightly better but I never recorded how good my aim has gotten due to Aim Training, I'm still fairly new to PC Gaming only 4 years tops, and it sounds like a lot but compared to people with 5+ I would say I'm up there with the lack of hours in many games.

[b] I will continue eventually.....",1617230948,1663353947,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

Prior to purchasing Kovaak's, I was insecure, and lacked confidence in my aim. I had known of Kovaak's for some time, but was hesitant to buy it - how helpful could an aim trainer truly be? As it would turn out, extremely useful. Now, I am much more certain in my ability to hit shots, and take many more chances which end favourably for me. I enjoy the Voltaic system, and can viscerally feel my aim in games improving, to the point where some of my friends are amazed at my seemingly limitless potential. Aiming has went from something I feared and shied away from to being my biggest asset, and now I am never scared to take easy shots. Once upon a time I would miss headshots on people anymore, and now I can Ferrari peek with extreme skill.

One of the main criticisms I have received from my peers is that this software is a waste of money as it has no textures and you could simply download AimLab for free. This is categorically false. For one, the game has a variety of skins and themes to use, so it can be customised to be exactly how you want it to be. Also, the level of polish far trumps that of AimLab, which is, in my opinion, overmarketed and underdeveloped, and is not worth wasting time on. The level of care and thought put into KovaaK's scenarios far exceeds that of AimLab, and the quality of training is much, much higher.

In conclusion, KovaaK's Aim Trainer is a necessary tool for anyone looking to take their FPS gameplay to the next level, and it has had immeasurable effect on me. Strongly recommended.",1663128739,1663128739,True,0,0,0.45267486572265625,1,True,False,False

The official website of this aim trainer is www.kovaak.com where players can also find content and programs/applications.

KovaaK's shares the same fame as AimLabs to the extent of being known far and wide even if the fact that it's paid means having a smaller playerbase compared to AimLabs, which is free. 

However, one of the most notable aspects of KovaaK's is the higher quality scenarios that can be found within it and significantly lower requirements compared to AimLabs, with it, there's something for everyone thanks to the possibility of being able to create your own scenarios and playlists, not to mention being also able to share your custom scenarios and playlists publicly as well, not unlike AimLabs.

Because of this, famous aim training services/routines to the likes of Voltaic (a free, publicly available aim training service operating mainly on Discord, initially made for AimLabs, featuring in-depth articles about the different aspects of aiming as well as ranked training routines to gauge your progress) also happen to feature a KovaaK's counterpart that are also publicly available for anyone to join them.

As expected, scenarios can range from easy to hard, cattering to different skill levels and also to improve different mechanical skills in regards to aim overall, even beginners with either mouse and keyboard or gyroscope gamepad players can also hone and sharpen their aiming skills in KovaaK's with the different options it offers.

Needless to say, both AimLabs and KovaaK's are the most famous aim trainers in the market as of the date of this review.

KovaaK's fame is to the point where content creators also made experiemnts with the aforementioned KovaaK's Aim Trainer when it comes to basically challenging themselves to use it for a month or so to see if it helped them in improving their aim, some of those videos reaching millions of views while also explicitly mentioning KovaaK's Aim Trainer as the aim trainer used during the video.

Highly recommended for either players looking to warm up before playing their favourite FPS game or as a mean to generally improve their aim, wether focusing mainly on perceived weaknesses in their aim with mouse or gyroscope gamepads, or for a more structured and organized experience as offered by services to the likes of Voltaic.",1663123943,1663124428,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?

Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, ""Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.

Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know? Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.

Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.

Before 3.1.0 update, everything was fine. Now, the game wants more money for stat/skill tracking which is a feature that's 100% free on AimLab. Why would I pay an additional fee just to know I suck at tracking or target switching when I could just check the leaderboards to know how I fair against the population of a specific task for a specific skill? 

Ever since the update, the performance graphs in sandbox hardly works.It only shows the personal and the current sessions best attempts. Without the graph updating, we can't get a visual representation of our progress.

Just give us what we originally paid for:

1. Tasks
2. Basic task creator
3. Leaderboards
4. Performance graphs

tdlr: the program is buggy in multiple ways to the point of aggravation  , both in sandbox and in training. The developers acknowledge this and for a year now have said they were working to fix these many issues. Today they drop a massive update, 5gb patch I was excited the program has potential and they have surely fixed and improved this barely acceptable utility they have sold to me.  ITS ALL BEHIND A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE.....THEY ARE NOW SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE that charges an initial fee like they are pay to own, and none of the other problems have been addressed, ones they have said they would fix for years. The base product is flawed, they will never fix it hoping you'll move to their payed service. 

I payed for this product, it is a very unfinished product, there are bugs and oversight within all aspects of this product. Many times  you're playing a sandbox round,  It signals a round has started you are sure you'll be hitting your high score, then at some point you realize the round has gone on twice too long, you realize its a dud round your score hasn't been saved and the round will never end and you could have played ad infinitum. This is a common glitch, it happens at random, in default mode there is no round timer so you don't know its happening, and it leaves you constantly unsure wether your in a dud round or not. Which is not a good mind space, and a constant distraction while trying to improve and be scored. 

The tracking of your scores and improvements is poor and at most you can only see 4 data point in a graph of your  average (e.g 4 months of 1 month averages, 4 week of weekly average) in a graph. This means you cannot see long term trends(nothing longer then 4 months) . 

At the end of each round it ranks your high score against everyone elses, but this only updates if you beat your all time high score. If you don't top your old highscore youre not updated on how this current score ranks against other players. 

Finally, there is something they call a trainer it was a complete failure as a product and a large part of their marketing, it has a helper bot character that 'tailors' the training based on your performance. This is the largest failure of this program. It simply categorizes your missed shots into 4 directional quadrants, and if you miss too many shots in a single direction it recognizes this: two problems arise. BUT first every round will lack symmetry and this does not reveal a pattern unless it is considered over multiple rounds. 
first:  each level has requirements i.e 'hit percentage' 'number of hits in a row' , 'total hits' mainly. However there is a unspoken requirement that is never discussed. The necessity for symmetry  in your misses. You can greatly over achieve and beat the level requirements but if there is asymmetry in your missed shots you cannot pass. 
second: now it tailors the level so there are more shots in the quadrant you missed. However guess what happens when you have more shots in a certain quadrant, you guessed it. The number of missed shots goes up in that quadrant even if missed shots as a percentage of shots in that quadrant goes down. Call me crazy but they didn't foresee this and didn't program their program to calculate this number  in percentages, but instead in totals. So it creates an infinite feedback loop, where the bot continues to say you missed more in the same quadrant and add more shots to that quadrant. 
Further increasing shots to that quadrant, until you learn to completely ignore the bots feedback and not accept its 'changes'

They were unable to produce what they had hoped for so they kept it their hiding its function so they can justify charging you as a marketing ploy. 

The thing that offended me about all of this was that I believed it was a small developer working to fix these problems, rather slowly and I soldiered on. But  to see they had completely ignored this stuff and put this needed update behind a paywall has offended me greatly.

Once you get to know your way around some scenarios, time spent in KovaaK's can make serious improvements to aim no matter your current skill level, thanks largely due to the great creativity and broad scope of many scenarios.

Update: 2.0 Meta was a bad idea and these efforts should have gone elsewhere. The developers have a vision for this trainer that strays from the light simplicity and user-defined experience that made this the best aim trainer out there. Every update gives Kovaak's a worse feel and introduces & expands bloat. I strongly encourage potential users to look elsewhere for their aim training unless they run a 1.x version before 2.0 Meta. It really seems the new dev team is completely blind to what made Kovaak's the best aim trainer out there and they continue to make changes that push away even the most dedicated players. There are amazing alternative trainers that frequently make positive changes; Kovaak's is on a downhill slide, don't limit your options.

U2: Any subscription-based service does not belong in Kovaak's. Kovaak Plus contains content that should exist as part of the product and already does in its competitors.

I setted up my sens thanks to the Kovaaks game selecting feature, choosing at first CSGO and matching it to my csgo sens, then even though I play at 3200 DPI with 0.19 sens, I started spinning like a beyblade.

So I tried setting it up with overwatch, took a look at my ow settings and tried again, started spinning again and saw I could do many spins although my camera in ow doesn't even go half way around.

Tried switching DPI and adjusting the sens, no luck
Tried seeing more details such as the 360 cm thing no one ever uses and no luck, cause that is broken too

Everything is a skill that can be built through hard work, you just have to put the time in and grind those plateaus out. Never lose motivation or discipline because you think you can't do it. You can, you just need to put the time in and try new solutions to the problem. Ask other people who have been there before, seek out knowledge. The best advice I can give to someone looking to get into aim training is that every ""fact"" or suggestion is really just something that we know helped someone else or ourselves. There's not a lot of science behind this stuff. Until there is, just figure out what works for you. How do you that?
Try new routines, try new scenarios, find your weaknesses, and attack them with training.

Alright it has been around 440 Hours later which now I am updating.
This has the best for your buck, and one of the best aim-trainers out there, I enjoy using it a lot more than Aim-beast or Aim-lab. There is a lot of more guides and support for KovaaKs than any other aim-trainer. 
For my experience, I have gotten better throughout my almost 500 hours in KovaaKs, learning how to do mouse-control and learning/relearning good habits. I will say that a few things about this that I don't really like, I believe it needs more customization in UI, better performance and have it going smoother, don't get me wrong I have 400+ fps but this game after a bit of time if you tab out it will not let you back in and you will have to restart it via Task-manager.

I remember I was in the low 20 - 40% range through most of the scenarios that seem easy for me now (70 to 90%) Like I would always switch my dpi and my sensitivity and I bounced in between 800, 1000, and 1600 dpi until I decided to take 2-3 months to stay on the same exact sensitivity on 800 dpi (44 cm). I feel on some scenarios that i my wrist and arm slip off the mousepad in which I should increase my sensitivity by 1-3 cm. I still got a few more months to grind and gain aimbot worthy control and reactivity but its gonna take hours and hours to get on that level so if you prefer aim lab or kovaaks or any another type of warm up for aim, I recommend it alot but dont play it too much to where you play the same scenario and you don't improve anymore.

KovaaK's is an aim trainer that has personally been more effective for me compared to other aim trainers such as Aim Lab or 3d Aim Trainer.

For the cost of $6, it may not be worth it to a select few but it is to me and I would personally recommend it to others who are struggling to find and build confidence to get better at FPS games.

I came back to this after not being happy with some of the exercises and not being able to mimic them fully there. I feel this program helps more with flicking. The other program really helps your tracking. They both can help with target acquisition and speed. 

One thing this game really suffers from is a really bad FOV scale. For instance if you use fortnite as your FOV with it's 80 FOV, you're not going to see half of the screen, never knowing that a target even spawned if you play with the sound off. So you're kind of forced into at least a 103 FOV to be able to see everything unless you scan wildly. However, if you play warzone @ 120 then this is right up your alley.

They both have their strengths and weaknesses. Yes, I know a lot of the creators for one have started making their exercises for the other, but they do not feel like the same exercises. If you got the extra bucks to grab the core version, do it.",1639630047,1652892088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think it's the most useful for low/mid level players (me) who are maybe uncomfortable with aiming or just keyboard and mouse in general, but generally has diminishing returns the higher up you go in rank.
 The default settings in KovaaK's are complete trash so look up a guide to set it up correctly or it's gonna suck.
You may have trouble figuring out what scenarios to play at first since there are so many different options, and while whats best for you changes from person to person depending on what you play, how you play, and what you want to improve, you can find general benchmarks from aim groups like Voltaic, and people share different playlists in spaces like that all the time. If you ask I'm sure there are plenty of people willing to talk to you about it and give you recommendations.
Overall would recommend if you aren't happy with your mechanics, but don't think you're gonna play it once and suddenly become a god, it's a grind. I have 300 hours and I'm still ass.",1651270401,1651270401,True,1,0,0.500608980655670166,0,True,False,False

I have been practicing mainly with Ascended Tracking v3 and I can definitely feel my ability improving!
When I first started, my Percentile was about 60 and now it is up to 99.1!
Aiming requires familiarity with the muscles used to aim, so it seems to be highly effective for those who have not practiced enough.
I personally like to play my favorite songs in the background during AIM training, such as Amazon music!
Some people say that AIM training software is unnecessary and that playing the game itself is better, but clearly it is the best way to improve ""AIM"" itself. I would recommend AIM training software for the efficiency of practice.
I recommend this game because I play a variety of FPS, but if you only play APEX, for example, you might want to practice within APEX or play the game itself. However, APEX is very inefficient for learning because of the slow efficiency of practicing aim and repetition of game play, so I want to be a strong ""FPS"" player. I personally think that beginners should not do APEX.

Even if you can't update your high score, you can still check your growth by averaging your last 20 scores

(Note: After Percentile 95, there are times when the high score is not updated even after 30 hours, and it is very difficult to feel the growth.
To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if there's any point in doing this. I'm starting to wonder if this is where I'm at my limit. Still, I'm continuing to train my AIM with the support of Gai-sensei from Naruto's famous words of wisdom.

(Further postscript) Ascended Tracking v3 top 1% achieved!
I think it's important to practice while thinking and devising, but I've been practicing pretty much brain-dead, so if you spend a lot of time practicing, you'll get better at it. If you're a slow learner, just practice without thinking too much.",1621366395,1650029354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But there are limitations as what you can practise outside of the curated modes they give you. They do update the game for the games they collaborate with like Valorant and Siege, but KovaaK's has the arsenal of community. The community contributes greatly to the reason why KovaaK's is still around. There is soooooo much you can choose and select for yourself, on top of playlists that others share/recommend.

They are both good, and if you have money to burn, why not get this if you are serious about getting good at aiming and taking the time to do so. The range is far higher in selection if you are willing to search for the ones you want and get used to a somewhat clunky UI.

Unless you want to get good at Kovaak‚Äôs go play a DM mode of the game you are actually trying to get good at, it will be more effective.

With that in mind I don‚Äôt feel like I can recommend Kovaak‚Äôs, It‚Äôs more of a trap for people who think they can ‚Äúget good quick‚Äù, then it is a helpful tool for the masses. The majority of people will also find it boring af to play and the only reason they force themselves on is because they think it's benefiting their aim.

Probably the best aim trainer on the market (although probably mainly due to the community, see: Voltaic.gg). While they have that going for them, it's very poorly optimized for a game about clicking floating balls. While they have extensive options for how your game looks (colors for balls, floor, roof, walls, etc.), they have like 3 video settings (hey, atleast they added a res scale I guess)

While you can get a quite few more frames by going into the GameUserSettings.ini file in %localappdata%\FPSAimTrainer\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor, and changing all sg.xxxQuality values to 0 (with no noticeable difference or game breaking visual bug), or adding launch options for UE4 (-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -sm4 -d3d10 -nomansky -lowmemory -novsync); this really shouldn't be necessary for most, but is. Competitors like AimBeast and Aim Lab offer 2x or even 3x the performance.

I know the Unreal Engine is notorious for subpar framerate, but not to this level. This is just bad code and the main reason I don't recommend or play the game as much as I'd like to. Fix pls

sidenote: when I had this game installed on a hard drive, it would sometimes take 10-15 minutes to open. ???????? I'd shower AND IT'S STILL LOADING?? On average probably like 3 or 4. I bought a ssd recently, so now the loading time seems decent enough, although still not the best
