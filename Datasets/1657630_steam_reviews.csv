Its been over a year of early access..

We have only received 2 major updates overall, in a span of a year, the updates being Snowball Bluffs and the recent Come Rain Or Slime. I was expecting more from Monomi due to the first game.

Overall we have received a major graphics overhaul, making the game pleasant to look at, few features not from the base game (weather system, not really improved resource gathering system and upgrades system) and a couple of new slimes. But thats it.

There is basically barely any communication between the Monomi Park team and their community on updates and road-maps. I understand that they are trying to not leak anything until they are sure that it will be added but atleast give us SOME idea that they are working on something to make the fanbase happy.

As for now, the price is not worth for what this game offers so get it if there is a sale at some point.

Now for the serious review.
The game is amazing for being in Early Access and an appropriate sequel to one my favorite games, and the first game i played on PC. Slime Rancher 2 brings back multiple things from the first game as well as bringing more to the table if your reading reviews to see if the game is for you THIS IS YOUR SIGN TO BUY AND PLAY IT.
Most of the problems i have with the game are slated to be fixed or added but here are some problems i have: Have the accelerator pick up items from containers or have a setting on them that allows them to do that, make a tide pool island instead of them being  fragments on the other islands, and finally please bring back quicksilver slimes.",1708600000,1708842675,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Compared to the soundtrack of the first game, this sequel has barely any instrumental variation. Nearly every track is played by piano and percussion and not much else. Secondly, most of the tracks do not have their own signature melody that the tracks from Slime Rancher 1 had. The lack-luster, barely existing rhythms of each track do not stand out from each other at all; pretty much all of them follow the same pattern of having a repetitive rhythm that essentially are all either triplets or 16th notes played over and over. With these two things combined, it results in the music from all the areas sounding nearly indistinguishable. 

I'm not even sure if this soundtrack is even composed by the same person because I seriously listen to the entirety of Slime Rancher 1 OST on a weekly basis because it is truly unique. For example, the glass desert theme conveyed the sound glass with perfection and the heat of the desert still comes through the accompaniment in the back. I'm very disappointed that the Slime Rancher 2 OST is not even CLOSE to being on par in quality as its predecessor. 

This game doesn't stand out quite enough from the first--especially in the soundtrack--for me to justify recommending it; just get the first game. Been loving that thing since 2018 and it still holds up perfectly to this day.",1708804880,1708804880,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

If any at all?? And then I think a whole year passed and then with the weather update and gadget update I revisited the game. 

My biggest gripe has always been the gadget placement, or at least the decor. I personally wouldn’t have mind if they put a limit on how many utility gadget you could put down but I always wished we could put them wherever we wanted. And holy crap. We can do that now. and the weather update brought a lot of charm to the environments. I don’t want to say that it’s not worth the 30$ But I don’t think it’s a bad idea to wait if you’re uncertain.

Idk what to put here, I really liked the first game and this game is also really fun and cute and charming. SO. Yeah :)

Edit: Months later, and a considerable increase in hours played, I still highly highly recommend this game. Especially if you liked the first game! As of this edit (Feb.20th.2024) the game is still early access. The story won't be finished until the full release and ever ea title is going to have it's bugs. But they're quick to work on bugs and the community is good with helping troubleshoot from my experience.
The biggest draw back it seems for most folks, especially those who have played the first game, is that the game isn't complete yet. Meaning they crave the story and drones and more automation to their ranches. So if you're more for exploration and speed grinding for drones to spend *more* time away from your ranch you might not get as much out of this game. 
That being said, buying it now won't require buying it a second time for the full release. So I still highly recommend this game if it looks your thing.",1664135594,1708474543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The sequel really is just more of what we got in the first game, for better and worse. There really isn't anything unique about the game yet to give it it's own identity separate from the first one. That being said the gameplay loop in SR1 was the biggest draw for me and having more of that isn't something to sniff at, but YMMV compared to mine.

The 2 biggest things  that make me hesitant to outright recommend it right now though is.
1) Updates for this game have been SLOW. I bought this game over a year ago and in that time, only one update has been released. It was an update reworking a major part of the game, But for something in early access it is definitely disheartening.

2) Is the biggie though, The lack of new gadgets and slime science stuff to play around with at the moment but especially Drones. They're going to be coming later in development with improvements from SR1, but the lack of Drones makes it very hard to actually explore the game world whilst still maintaining your ranch without having to constantly run back every 10 minutes lest your ranch fall into disrepair. There aren't a whole lot of new toys to draw attention away from this right now either, most of the new gadgets and buildings are just simple cosmetics. They're nice, but they feel more like a late game focus rather than something to spend time on so early on.

Honestly, give it some time and pick it up once there's more meat here. I trust the devs will eventually get to that point and the game is gonna be a fun timesink when we get to that point, but sadly it isn't there yet.",1708368996,1708368996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

| - As of 2/18/2024 (mm/dd/yyyy), I have 260.1 hours in Slime Rancher 1 on my Steam copy.

| - I even have some of the official(?) plushies!

I can't really come to a real conclusion on Slime Rancher 2 as of currently, as the game is in Early Access. As of now, I would recommended buying and playing Slime Rancher 1 over Slime Rancher 2, as Slime Rancher 1 simply has more content (afaik) and it's generally a good idea to start with the first game in a series.

This does not mean Slime Rancher 2 is a bad game.
It's quite promising if anything, but it's a tiny bit lacking as of currently in my opinion.
And of course it's going to be! It's in Early Access!
Please note that as of currently I've only experienced v0.3.0 when I say that it's a tiny bit lacking, though.

[Now, for the changes I like, and the changes I DON'T like.]
|
[The Good S%$#]
|
| - The game looks damn beautiful!
| - Introduces new cool stuff relating to environments! (like those geysers! ...they're new right)
| - The weather system adds a fun little bit of immersion, along with gameplay change-ups.
| - The new slimes look really cool!
| - WHAT. YOU CAN PLACE STUFF ANYWHERE NOW?!
| - The new GUI f#$@ing rocks!
| - What's that? Actual gameplay needed to get lab resources? That's an improvement.
| - A lotta other stuff which I have forgotten about since I have horrible memory.
|
\______________]
/
|
[The... Not So Good S&!#]
|
| - Just kind of feels like a slightly more empty SR1, although it is in Early Access to be fair.
| - The game is a bit grindy like SR1, but amplified a bit since there's less to do right now.
| - Who's idea was it to make certain slimes only spawn during certain weather conditions?!
| - Same goes for resources. It took me like, an hour to get TWO Drift Crystals! TWO!
| - On the topic of weather, I think that cyclones should be able to lift the player better.
| - Again, a lotta other stuff which I have forgotten about.
|
\______________]

|
[Final-ish Verdict]-[2/19/2024]-[v0.4.0]
|
| - Do I recommend SR2? For sure! But check out SR1 first and complete that beforehand.
| - Wouldn't blame you for waiting to buy, but it's definitely shaping up to be a good sequel.
| - I'll be sure to update this review over time. If I remember to ever, obviously.

Ignore most of the negative reviews, they're made by people that don't read patch notes or dev communications, dont realize this is an EARLY ACCESS title that is currently being worked on, or just believe random rumors and blame the devs when those rumors turn out to be false.

The game feels more like a unfinished dlc then a stand alone game. With only one or two updates that bring nothing new to the gameplay. Its been a year of this game coming out and no news of a release date or if we are getting new areas. While its nice to see improvments to the game, they are very sparce with only 3 noted so far. I am starting to think i might just fall back on the original game and abandon this game all together since it feels like it will never be finished. They promised us new lands, new slimes and new overall system. we have gotten new maps that are very confusing to explore and very hard to find pods in. i have gotten lost so many times in the tunnels i dread going threw them anymore. while farming materials is easy now, there is no point in crafting or collecting plots to craft/sell since there is no reward for such hard work anymore. its just frolicing threw fields and waiting for new slimes if ever they will update it. even the new ones we got are not much diferent. i am missing the excitment of the crystal desert.

I have 3 primary problems with the current beta (4.0) the game has a very fun environment and new slimes are always welcome, however 
1: the game feels a little aimless in the sense that comparing my experience with slime rancher 1 and 2 i felt like i always had a thing to do for obvious progression such as ""there's a slime door and i don't have a key but know where a gordo is"" this for me made it feel like i was on track additionally i found in the second game i was able to climb thing i wasn't meant to and get to places i shouldn't be extremely easy, even before i had the jet pack. 
2 currently there are no drones and being in end game is hell. everything needs food and i want to explore but also don't want my slimes going hungry. i also find that currently money feels kinda worthless. i mean beyond the core upgrades and the buildings i feel as though there is nothing to buy which means i just accumulate money. (currently have $95,000 gold and have no idea what to do with it.) Without any automation it means you must spend days on the farm and just when you finished the last task... The first one is ready to do again.
3 Whilst the warm welcome of new slimes and my personal favourite of the ringtail slime, it came at an unfortunate cost of previous slimes. The Quantum Slime, Rad Slime, and Mosaic Slime are no where to be found as of current. (additionally all of the special smiles: Quicksilver Slime, Glitch Slime, Party Gordo,	Twinkle Slime are also not included but these slimes are less significant. sorry anyone who likes these)
 My final thoughts are still that this game is amazing and has major potential for the future. even right now, without the inclusion of drones this game is worth its money.

The game looks fantastic and I can't wait to see if any new areas are coming out. A frosty-looking area would be cool, with a similar slime to go with it. The gadgets are great too, the energy pad being great for running around the ranch without losing stamina and being able to have market and refinery depositors around the ranch and the world makes the game pacing so much better. I would seriously recommend this game to anyone, I'm not a fan of exploration games but this one is one of the exceptions. Keep up the good work!

Some things I'd like to see in future updates:
- The delivery system to NPCs that the first game had. It would be a good way to unlock blueprints and decorations and something to do while waiting for plants to grow or chicken coops to fill.
- Some more things to buy like blueprints, shortcuts, resource nodes or colours for your vacpack or house.
- A mini-map would be a godsent, even if it was an unlockable blueprint.

The lore continues to be interesting and emotional. Writing this as of patch 0.3.0...I look forward to more and the full release. What wonders await me as the game continues to build?

Unless you're painstakingly obsessed with the entire story and aesthetic that Slime Rancher as a whole offers I wouldn't recommend this game. 



Pros! (DISCLAIMER! HALF IF NOT MOST OF THE BIGGER FEATURES WERE ADDED IN ALMOST 2 YEARS POST OF ITS LAUNCH!) 
* The Graphics are unreal compared to the first game! They're breath taking!  
* Building System: In the first game you had to find pre-placed points where you could place down utilities- But as of the Eighth of February 2024 Slime Rancher 2 has changed their entire fundamentals of buildings! you can place shit anywhere! 
* Brand New map with little bits of lore and story sprinkled here and there! 
* New lore/story progression system! (removed the letters you'd received in the first game which I won't go into due to spoilers but it is definitely more engaging) 
* Weather system! They've added a weather system which is fundamental towards finding certain slimes as well as make the game far more immersive and visually appealing! 
* Like 5 new slimes! 
* Changed how you get resources! 
--------------------------------------------------------
That's all the ""noticeable"" improvements I've found personally. 
Now let me go onto the cons. 
--------------------------------------------------------

Cons! 
* After almost  two years in the waiting the lore/story of the game can all be found/completed in about 1-2 hours! (my personal experience) and after that you better get good at entertaining yourself! 
* They have removed a pretty sizable chunk of the slimes from the original game. They took out A LOT of slimes that were originally in the first game but to their credit they have added I believe 3 slimes back from which they've removed- which is something I guess after waiting for one and a half years? (Saber slime, Tangle Slime, Dervish Slime.) 
* Gadgets! Until The Eighth of February 2024 there were almost no actual gadgets! Like nothing besides portals and some that would send everything back to the refinery!  yet again to their credit they did change a major part of getting resources so the need for pumps etc. have really died down but really I feel like they just didn't put enough thought into the whole gadget system prior to the most recent update as of writing this review (which not to complain and sound ungrateful for but almost 2 years in the waiting REALLY just showed me how barren everything was. (which for a full price game in early access I WILL COMPLAIN ABOUT!)) 
-----------------------------------------

To wrap things up I'd just say ""If you want to play slime rancher buy the first game- only get the second if you're utterly addicted and depraved for slime rancher content (just as I am)

The full price is completely uncalled for, so better grab it on sale if you really want to try it out. I've got it for around 17€ and I'm still experiencing buyer's remorse. There is an upgrade compared to the first Slime Rancher but definitely not enough to spend money on. I should've read more about it and will probably be more careful about my purchases from now on, even on licences I used to liking. 

• Out of 21 slimes, 14 COME FROM THE FIRST ONE. 2/3 of the main aspect of the game is the same as the first game they made. Tarr and feral are still the only ennemies and nothing has changed for them neither.

• You get messages every day or so, yet, no quests like the first. It's just talking and talking just to give you customisation for the exterior of the Ranch or gadgets to help you tp around the place or fight tarrs. No toys for the Slimes either, which I find disappointing.

• The progression is fucked up. Around day 7 in-game I already had so much money I didn't even know what to do with it anymore. There is no challenge around this aspect and so, the satisfaction of building your Ranch is fast to disappear. This is a shame since the materials needed to upgrade your gear actually is a bit balanced because you have to roam around the map to collect them (if you don't put teleporters everywhere that is).

• I've played 17 in-game days so far and I've been bored since 4-5 of them. All in all, I've maybe played around 10 to 12h (I've let the game running while eating a lot, enhance the 17h played) and it feels like I've reached the end already. I've played for less than a week. 

Eventhough I was very pleased at first and felt the same glee I experienced while playing the first one, you feel like you've thrown your money out the window pretty quickly. I hope the devs will put a lot of work in it and implement at least a bunch of new slimes into the game because right now, it just feels like a polished copy and past. I wish I could get a refund.

TL;DR: Game is already really good with minimal bugs, great new world, exploration, and Slime Science system. But a couple of problems and currently feels more like a Slime Rancher 1.5 or Slime Rancher DLC. Moving more and more into a full, new game. Still highly recommended.

—————————
Gadgets My Way, v0.4.0! What an update. Entirely revamped gadget system, allowing them to be placed nearly everywhere. Revamped fabricator UI and blueprints tab in the Slimepedia, allowing you to see the resources required for a decoration or gadget. There's also new areas to explore within each area, and with that comes new treasure pods with the new gadgets showcased in the trailer! They were relatively easy to find, but not placed out in the open, which is good. Apart from that, new resources (Storm Glass, Lightning Mote and Drift Crystal) for the new gadgets, and there's some QoL additions like the new comms notification when someone contacts you at the conservatory. Pretty great update, and I can't wait for another major expansion!
—————————

My experience with this game has been amazing. I played a lot of Slime Rancher 1 across multiple platforms, so I was thrilled for this release. The new areas are amazing, with brand new nooks and crannies to explore, with each area being distinct with its colourful and playful nature. The soundtrack is once again phenomenal, although deciding to be more chill than Slime Rancher 1. (The night tracks are still the best ones in the game, in every area.)

The new Slime Science system is AMAZING. Once you upgrade your vacpack with the extractor, YOU are the apiary. YOU are the drill. YOU are the pump. I think you get the point. You find resources around the island and can vac them up instead of placing drills down in each area and waiting for their cycle to finish. It's a very polished system for being one of the biggest new features and I cannot wait to see it get expanded on.

Slime Rancher 2 does a great job with exploration too. The map is already massive, and as stated previously, each area is distinct and recognisable. Slime Keys are a thing of the past, in favour of you bursting gordos to find twisty things to activate portals, or the gordo sitting directly on top of the portal, and I think they've done it wonderfully. I'm very excited for what Monomi Park has to offer with the areas they're planning to add. 

Starmail has been replaced with a little wireless communication box in front of The Conservatory, pretty neat. Nothing has been heard from Casey so far though :(

No need for the section on v0.1.1 and v0.1.2, as everything since then (bug fixes and QoL improvements) has been improved on. I've ran into even less bugs in later updates, but some areas are definitely still too bright. Definitely going to try and keep this review updated with each update, though.

However, Tarrs are still a MASSIVE problem naturally, and I find the game more fun with them disabled at this point.

Old update, but welcome in v0.2.0, the Song of the Sabers update! With it comes a brand new island, Powderball Puffs, and many new items and a couple of slimes. They've also added 4 new treasure pods to Ember Valley and Starlight Strand. 

In Powderball Puffs, you can find the returning star of the update; the Saber slime. In this winter wonderland you'll also find a Saber gordo and normal slimes such as Rock, Boom, etc. Powderball Puff's real party trick is at night, when its ""Auroral Anomalies"" show up, revealing secret pathways and other really cool things. There's also the new Thundercluck chicken, with a new secret slime, the Yolky Slime, which is an elusive and rare slime found around chicken nests. Another elusive and rare thing is Sun Sap.

With all the new content in the update, I'm very happy with it. It is starting to feel like how Slime Rancher 1 felt in early access. Everything in this update is great, my only gripe is how rare the Yolky Slime and Sun Sap is. This game is finally culminating into something new. See you next update!

Small little update, v0.3.0, ""Come Rain or Slime"". Adds back old favourites, like the Dervish and Tangle Slimes, with Prickly Pears, and a whole new dynamic weather system. The update is alright, but 9 months for this seems a bit... underwhelming. Would love to see a bit more in future content updates.

For now, Slime Rancher 2 STILL feels more like a Slime Rancher 1.5, or Slime Rancher 1 DLC, but with more content updates it is finally feeling like something new, definitely getting there. I'm optimistic about the future of Slime Rancher 2 though, considering how far Slime Rancher 1 came within its time. But for now, be brave, be bold, and stay wiggly. Have fun on Rainbow Island!

something that the original slime rancher succeeded to do, created this clash between wanting to grind and farm all day - to collecting everything and exploring every inch of the map.

okay, look, I'm going to be very honest here.
the game is great. its cute, its pretty and I (personally) find it fun. it's incomplete as of writing this, yes, and gets a bit boring after a while, but I can understand that coding something like this takes a lot of time. the fact it feels more like a DLC isn't even my main problem. I would absolutely recommend this game if it weren't for one thing. I myself and a lot of other people that I have seen all had one issue that happened out of nowhere, that being that when you get to the screen that reads 'press any key to begin' the game crashes. its important to note that for me (and a lot of other people) there was no issue like this before, we had enough storage and everything functioned just fine. it's also worth noting that one of the devs in the 'support' section of the game's page here on steam keeps replying to these reports with the same thing: a link to a discussion trying to detail how to fix this issue. my problem is that every time, it's the graphics card that's blamed by the devs which both me and some other people close to me think of as silly because usually it's just one type of card that doesn't work but the amount of people having this issue would suggest we have different cards. another thing I've noticed is that on one of these boards asking about the bug, after the dev responded with the link, more people came forth about it and then the discussion was locked, making it impossible to respond.

I DO NOT BLAME THE DEVS FOR THIS, though it is a bit shady. I can only hope something is done to fix it.
I could of course be wrong, and it really could be an issue with my pc, but please keep in mind that the guide does not work, no matter what I try. IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS, PLEASE TELL ME (its why the comments are on)",1706878415,1707510120,False,1,0,0.454250901937484741,0,True,False,True

It has a lot of the slimes from the first game as well as a few new ones, including Saber slimes which you can actually capture now, but it's seriously lacking.

Biggest problem is that for some reason they didn't implement drones for automation from the start, meaning you have no time to explore the world or do anything in general between managing your farms, collecting plorts and keeping your slimes happy and fed.
Until they add drones to automate stuff it is basically unplayable and it's unlikely that we will get them for a while considering the latest update - which added a weather system(cool but not interesting or useful) and two slimes from the first game - took several months to release and there has been very little content besides that.

Early Access isn't an excuse to not have a simple feature from the first game that makes the game playable and enjoyable.

Update 08/02/2024
Latest update added 36 gadgets, which the developers called 'functional. What they actually meant by that is that you can interact with them in some way, but they are not useful. 
Still no drones, still not worth playing.

As such, I can't recommend this game to anyone but know that you won't regret the purchase if you really want to play it.

In about 6 hours I had discovered the entire map. 3 hours later. I had experienced everything the world had to offer, built every gadget, discovered and raised every single slime variant, read all of the drones's messages and became ludicrously rich. 
Heck, the observatory is so big you won't even need to occupy even half of the space given to you to be completely self sufficient.

In the first game, it took me about 20+ hours (though I did take my time) to uncover the entire map and another 5+ hours to complete all side activities. Then to my surprise, the game introduces me to an aftergame area? This was great! Still so much to do in spite of its low price!

This is not the case here. There is no aftergame content whatsoever and I got bored of it extremely quickly but like I said, I had a really fun time the whole way.

In my opinion, they should have added more content to the game before launching it as it feels unfinished. (even if it's still in early access)",1706986663,1706986812,False,0,0,0.471204221248626709,0,True,False,True

So yes, you may get bored fast. There's a few things here and there that are different, mostly quality of life improvements.
It is very similar to the first game. If you've played the first, you will have no problem jumping in. I will say though, between that and a cheat engine, each major update I've played since purchase, and once I've finished it, I stop playing until the next.

This is prior to them allowing gadgets to be placed ANYWHERE, so maybe once that comes out, it'll hold my attention for more than a few hours.

Still, with all that said, I think it has great potential. I'm really excited to see what new things are coming, as I'm really enjoying the new content. Once the game is fully out, I'll wipe my save and play from the start with no cheats, just to get the full experience. (I've been playing with unlimited Jetpack, and free building, since it is in beta, just to see the early stuff faster.)

It's still a fantastic sequel. It has a lot of potential and some quality of life stuff already included, but I'd LOVE to see more slimes, more gadgets... and a multiplayer. Multiplayer would make this soooo much better imho, but we'll have to wait and see if that's going to be official, or if it'll be a mod.

From what I have played though, I've enjoyed it a lot. I can't wait to see what is in store, because everything so far is just like the original, but better!

With that out of the way, I would like to warn that the game is truly not in a state to justify it's current price tag. We are over a year in and there have been updates fewer and farther between than the first game. While I am sure the finished product, whenever that ends up being released, is going to be a wonderful experience, I am currently experiencing a lot of buyers remorse and would still opt to play the first game over this by a landslide. It's disheartening that after around 6 months of radio silence, the game got an update consisting of just a weather system, and two slimes from the first game. My trust in the development team is wavering, and I fear it could be several years before the game is at a state where the price justifies the content. Is the game bad? No. Is the game new? Kind of. There are a few new slimes, new areas, but all the gameplay mechanics have yet to be improved upon in any way. The graphics are ""prettier,"" but besides that, it truly just feels like unfinished DLC for the first game rather than it's own identity. 

I'm not ordinarily one to bash small studio games like this, but communication from the team was nonexistent for all of 2023, and I feel the current review ratio does not aptly articulate the state the game is in at the moment. It likely will get better, but if I could go back in time to when I purchased this game, I would absolutely hold off on buying for another two years.",1706848198,1706848198,False,852,12,0.906300067901611328,0,True,False,True

Slimes that were in SR1 and arent in SR2:
Quantum, Dervish, Mosaic, Rad, Tangle (very challenging yet rewarding slimes)

Slimes that replaced them:
Flutter, Cotton, Ringtail, Batty, Angler (definitely lamer than the above 5)

The original 5 in my opinion should have been in Slime Rancher 2. They replaced 5 challenging slimes with 5 basic bitch ones. None of the new 5 pose challenges much like the old 5, and in my opinion that is very dissapointing. The whole point of those 5 in Slime Rancher 1 was to pose a challenge to a rancher, while yielding expensive plorts. It made perfect sense. Why would the devs replace these slimes with mush easier, lamer slimes?

But thats just my main gripe. I overall like the game, and I would love to listen to the soundtrack all of the time. It's just one of those things that take off points in my opinion. 

7/10... would be a 10/10 if it still had rad, quantum, mosaic, dervish, and tangle slimes. sorry

A fun exploration game and there's so much more to do! the new slime are adorable and I love the idea of adding weather I am excited to see whats to come in future updates.

 A few points I want to make note of however.
1. this game does not work with older computer models, my laptop could run stuff like resident evil 8 but not this game due to unitys' requirements. It was extremely frustrating. I had to buy a brand new desktop to get it working (i already had plans to buy one but still) 
not only that but my controls like to f*ck up at times and tars lag my game even at the lowest possible setting
2. It can be easy to get tired of the repetitive game play; finding new smiles, farming, and upgrading your equipment. I don't ever find it boring but thought it would be a good point to make. 
3. the rare slimes are a little.. too rare in my opinion, the farming for a yolky can be extremely exhausting, i get the fun of trying to hunt them but gosh i wish the spawn rate were a little better :|

Batty + Honey
Angler + Pink
Boom + Phosphor
Rock + Tabby
Cotton + Crystal
Saber + Dervish
Ringtail + Hunter
Ringtail + Flutter
Ringtail + Tangle

ESPECIALLY the Ringtail Hunters. I keep those ones in the cave part of the ranch, along with the Angler Pinks, Boom Phosphors, and Batty Honeys. If you're going to have the Hunter largos in the cave, I would also suggest keeping your Flutters in there, so when you feed them, the aura bursts they release will calm them down if the Hunters are agitated and/or feral.",1704770357,1705263791,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I've played the original Slime Rancher for years now, ever since it came out. Absolutely amazing, with enough story and gameplay to keep you going for a long, long time.

But it's been months and the only thing we've gotten was a weather update and old slimes. The new slimes are plain, and there's only a handful unlike the old game. As much as I love Slime Rancher, this game doesn't bring what I wanted when I bought it. The devs should take the game off sale for a while until they *actually* can make a decent update. Yes the weather update it cool, but it brings nothing at all. The game is good, but there's pratically nothing there to make it worthwhile. Wait until like 10 years, then buy it.

The first game was a unique casual adventure game, combining a simple ecosystem simulation with a very well designed FPS/3D platformer/collectathon-y formula. This game has good intentions to deepen the sunny vibes of the original game, but the adventure component just isn't present at the moment.

Love the new visual style, some of the new slimes are good ideas. The new map is probably the biggest shortcoming, it just doesn't flow as a cohesive whole like the old one did. Additionally, it's just still very early access. It will probably take a while before it hits 1.0, and then a few *more* years before it might really feel like its own game.

Don't even think about buying this until you've mastered the first game, and then, maybe just pick this up as a show of good faith. I'm giving it a temporary negative but I'm looking forward to watching it grow, and you should too.",1704953280,1704953280,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,True

The choice to have most of the movement in this game be upwards instead of flat is amazing. 
I love the new slime's designs and their quirks (Ringtails are so obnoxious but I think I would die for a Yolky)
I think the weather so far is an amazing innovation and gives the game lots of room to grow. 
If you like learning the story of your environment more than interpersonal relationships I'd recommend the story; its not finished but its message is loud and clear while very expressive. 
You are much less limited in space on your ranch this time, resources are much easier to collect (they're visible now instead of drills and apiary's) 
Also I hate to bring it up but visually its stunning, I didn't realize how much better this looked until I went back to play my old file on the original, I will say the odd movement of your arm when you are stationary too long still creeps me out but otherwise its beautiful.

I wont deny I miss a lot of the silliness and things like toys for my slime's (PLEASE BRING THEM TO THIS GAME) but I really do think it has a charm to it and I hope it continues to improve into a fully made game and story. <3",1704785315,1704785315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's almost nothing new, some new (relatively plain) slimes, missing old ones, no automation, no minigames, story, and nothing fun to sink your time and money on, like decorations for your ranch or echoes or such. There's no progression in the game anymore past a few hours of exploration. 

And worst of all, there's been so little visible progress on the game from Monomi, last update was a weather system with some old slimes and new music. The update before that was one big new biome that felt rather lacking in content/progression. I used to read the forums and developer accounts on twitter every day to see little hints of what's coming up in Slime Rancher 1, now it seems they're just talking about the weather update and that's it.

Excellent game! I loved playing the first game and was excited to try this one. I played 12 hours the first day I got it. 
After a bit though it becomes a little repetitive and nothing new really gets added as you go along. You enter a new area get a new slime or too then move on to the next area. I loved the drones in the last game managing your farm while you are gone. I found myself sitting in my farm more and more, running between areas, selling plorts.
I also somehow ended up with 100,000 dollars before making it to the Ember Valley.

It feels like this game is a copy and paste of the first Slime Rancher, but the gameplay is WORSE. What was special about Slime Rancher is its novelty; everything was new and other-worldly. The slimes were unique, each section of the map had its puzzles, there were enticing upgrades to work towards, and there was a mysterious plot to unfold. 

In Slime Rancher 2, there is no novelty. You've seen most of the slimes before. The map & islands feel so underdeveloped that it's easy to get lost in the blandness of it all. It has barely any puzzles, and they are a rehash of the previous game's puzzles. There currently are no major upgrades to achieve and work towards. And there's....no plot? You just wander around in a boring environment capturing slimes you've already captured before with no goals, no challenges, and no interests. 

The gameplay is just repetitive, slow, and boring. I wish it had that 'awe' factor like its predecessor. 

I would like to say wait until the game is out of early-access, but after months the only new update we've received is a weather update....so now there's things like rain, and thunder, and sometimes tiny tornadoes. Which do not affect much of anything, just an extra sound in your ear.

I thoroughly enjoyed the new map, music, and story line. I find this game amazing but I look forward to the future updates since I would *really* like to explore the labyrinth!

I'm also excited to see if the devs add the archive feature to the Powderfall Bluffs area. Be cautious with the corrals though since I have found more than a few plorts that must have been launched out of the corrals by the boom slimes or glitching through after I moved the little fireworks.

I'm truly enjoying the new areas and feel genuine awe at the dynamic weather as each new type shows up. In all this time, I've yet to see all there is to see in the worlds we've been given so far. I'm also enjoying the new mechanic for finding resources. 

No, the problem is with ranching. For a game called Slime Rancher, I was hoping the mechanics for, you know, ranching slimes would be complete. Sadly, I'm well past the point of needing drone assistance to maintain my ranch, but there's nothing of the sort in sight. As I've got quite a bit of money built up, I'm about ready to give up on my slimes and take to exploring full time. It's getting far too monotonous to continue caring for all my farm plots and slimes without drones. I can't keep it up and frankly I no longer want to. I may just set this game aside until drones are added to gameplay, because the alternative is chucking all my slimes into the sea and collecting them all over again when this basic mechanic comes back.

I only bought the game to see if any major changes were made since it released and had watched videos about it. But almost nothing has changed, in over a year. One new area, and a weather system is all that's new? No. You've gotta be kidding me. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this, especially if they are gonna take 9 months after they made the new area(February 16th, 2023) to release a weather system (November 14th, 2023). I am wasting time even making this review. I want to refund it now. Also my computer doesn't run well on this, and the first game runs at over 100fps. The minimum requirements aren't accurate. My system has a GTX 1050 mobile(30% slower on average than GTX 960, the minimum listed GPU). I assume they are targeting 1080p resolution, lowest settings, at 30fps with the minimum requirements. Since my GPU is 30% slower than the GTX 960, the minimum required GPU according to the store page, I would expect 30-40% slower performance in this game, with 1080p lowest settings, estimated fps is about 20. Sometimes the game jumps up to 20 fps, but is usually under 15 fps most of the time. FYI, that is in 800x600 resolution, not 1920x1080(1080p). 800x600(or rather 600p) is way lower than 1080p and looks terrible. Even if they target 720p at 30fps instead of 1080p at 30fps, then still, that still would make it about 20 or less fps with a GTX 960, not 30fps. If they are targeting it at less than 30fps, then these devs are a joke. 30fps to me looks choppy and slow enough. I have to force my computer to a custom resolution(480X360!) which would force the game to run at that resolution, and then i can get 40fps, tops. But that is a resolution the game doesn't normally allow. I shouldn't have to force my computer to run at such a low resolution just to play this game. I've done a few things to try and fix this, but everything I've tried so far doesn't work. I'm not forcing my computer to an old junk tv resolution just to play this game. When purchasing I was fully aware my system was a bit under the minimum requirements. But i was expecting 20fps, at either 1080p or 720p, which I have not gotten. It's almost as if they have put something in the game that makes it run terribly if your computer is under the minimum requirements. 

One last thing I must mention is how they want us to give them the ""Labor of Love"" steam award, and they were only even able to do it because the game was over a year old. But steam does give info about steam awards, and this particular award's description is: ""This game has been out for a while. The team is well past the debut of their creative baby, but being the good parents they are, these devs continue to nurture and support their creation. This game, to this day, is still getting new content after all these years."" At the end, it specifically states ""after all these years"", meaning a good 3 or more years but any game that is over a year old is eligible to be nominated. I can't believe these devs tried to convince is to nominate their game, when it is still in early access, and barely any content has been added from release to now. Based off of this, I just can't recommend this game. I will be refunding this, and I'll specifically mention in the note of my refund about how these performance issues don't make sense. Feel free to get as mad as you want, fans. I've allowed comments. But I am not changing my opinion. It'll be 2025 before this game can come out of early access.",1704107621,1704107621,False,3,0,0.442900747060775757,0,True,False,True

I have noticed that playing for long periods of time audio starts messing up, and certain sound effects are either delayed or don't play at all, but those are just minor bugs. I loved the original slime rancher, and new I had to play the sequel. I'm not saying the games a bad game, but I feel they could have done better with this. Slime rancher 2 just feels more like it should have been a DLC rather than its own game. I feel they tried doing what Subnautica Below Zero had done in development. It started out as DLC, but got too large that it had to become it's own game. The only difference is I feel Subnautica Below Zero pulls this off better than Slime Rancher 2 does. It feels a little rushed. The slimes are mostly from the original, minus around the 5 new ones. Like I said, I don't hate the game, I just feel it could of gone a different direction.

The environments are better than the first game, the graphics are better than the first game, almost everything is (except no ""ending"" yet ;-;). Seems to be on its way to being possibly my favorite game so far!

Currently my only gripe in the game is that finding/farming resources is incredibly time consuming I hope to see the machines like the drill and pump from the first game here, where instead you place it on the top of the deposits/resources and it auto harvests it and you just pick it up when you visit it. Doesn't have to be at the start but maybe something for ""end game"" or mid way through.

I really like the aspects of weather and I am hoping for more different types of weather and slimes that result from the weather. Honestly, I'm unsure if it's my luck but I didn't find the weather slimes to be incredibly rare; maybe like 5 slimes per weather event. Possibly maybe a missed patch note, because the people of Reddit seem to highly disagree.

Also I don't mind the wait time for each update, as they all seem to come out finished and polished. I just hope that the game is finished sometime around 2025, maybe early 2026.

My wife was not to keen on me getting this game however i went through with the purchase typed my credit card details in and spent 20.99 my wife was scared i would cheat on her with the slimes. However this didn't stop me from playing the game of my dreams i am now 42 and still loving slime rancher 2, my wife and i got a divorce and i made her leave my home (she is now on the streets) because she doesn't like slime rancher she is begging to live with me and i said no sharon you are not coming into my home with this hatred you carry for for the tabby slime. I tried to bargain with her however she said 'you cannot date the tabby slime' so i left her on the streets and i think she does heroin now . I think this problem was brought upon her because she is a ignorant lady so i said to sharon the other day 'you will not come in my home the rock slime is like a son to me' (she hates the rock slime) i don't feel like i should allow her access to my home. The stress she has brought to me with the noble hatred of my slimes; i am a simple man i quit my job (tescos regional manager) for slime rancher 2 as i feel it brings me more joy than tescos so i quit. I am struggling to pay my rent but i think with the upcoming release of slime rancher 3 i will feel at a all time high.

However my ex-wife is calling my mother and telling her about my unconditional love for this game i don't feel like anyone can stop the joy i get from this game. I just feel like a lonely lemon why does no-one share this passion of the wobbly slimes, its coming up to my 43 birthday this month and i am having a slime rancher themed party hopefullly the tabby slime will give me a lovely present. I just fear for the worst in my slime cage she has been closer to the rock slime than me.What if she doesnt like me anymore?

Anyway
yesterday, i was awoken to a smashing noise, it was my ex-wife she was throwing rocks at my window i scrambled put on my slippys (slippers) and ran outside i then saw my ex-wife who appeared to be under the under the influence she said 'Lawrence take me back and forget about these childish slimes' i instantly locked the door ran to my room, and cried for hours how could someone be so ignorant to not event take 10 minutes to play slime rancher. My brain just struggles to fathom why she hates it so much.

In light of these facts, i have decided to report her to the authorities i believe she is spending time in a phychiatric ward i hope she gets better but i do hope she forgets about me and leaves and my children (slimes) alone.",1703545669,1703545669,True,6,16,0.53394007682800293,0,True,False,True

I still love Slime Rancher, but I'm personally waiting til full release in hopes that they either change the game immensely or they add multiplayer. In the current state it's in, it's just not worth it as opposed to playing the first one in my opinion. If you want to play this game right now, just mod the first game to have prettier textures and a few extra slimes and wait til there's more content.

For the time being I do not recommend purchasing the game in *early access* specifically. I'm sure the full game will be great though.",1703544258,1703544258,False,2,0,0.500792384147644043,0,True,False,True

Where the original game had little loadingscreens (that would otherwise only be used when you teleport to the glass desert or use to teleport to your home via a hom portal) whilst this one is loaded with so many loadingscreens in the game.

This game is early access, but I can't help but think that the teleportation is permanent. Since in Slimerancher 1 you can organically walk around the areas and find your way around it. Which is why a lot of people loved this game. Minimal loadingscreens and where it'd make sense. 

The mechanics I like
1. You can open any treasure pods without requirements.
2. you can get materials organically rather than relying on drills and those other machines.
3. The overall graphics in this game is absolutely beautiful. The artists did an amazing job.
4. I think the weather mechanic is alright.

This game otherwise has some bugs, but thats expected out of Early Access. Its a graphic overall so far. Nothing much to add.

Slime Rancher 2 is more of the amazing game that was Slime Rancher - but with plenty of new and updated stuff to make it its own great game. Just like the first game it is such a charming and relaxing little adventure on an alien world just waiting to be explored with ranch to be managed. 

=== === === === ===
First - new slimes. We got some returning slimes, including (but not limited to) Pink, Tabby, Phosphor, Rock and Boom. We also got quite a few new ones such as Cotton (rabbit slime), Bat and Angler to name a few. Not to mention with new graphics slimes look even blobbier and bouncier!
=== === === === ===
Second - new ranch. While I personally overall liked the OG ranch more, Rainbow Islands' Observatory is still very charming (I kinda like the look more) and has plenty to offer with 4 subsections outside of main area. Alongside new ranch it is worth to mention new biomes - Rainbow Fields, Ember Valley, Starlight Strand and hidden Powderfall Bluffs, each wonderfully unique and ready to be explored. For example Rainbow Valley is a place to learn the drills of the game and capture some easy-to-handle Slimes for your new ranch.
=== === === === ===
Third - changes, cause yeah there is bunch. First I would like to mention change to slime science resources gathering. Gone are pumps, drills and apiaries - now you gotta collect resources from biomes which they are characteristic for. For example Deep Brine and Jellystone can be found around Rainbow Fields. I personally find it more immersive then og gathering but it can be a bit more time sinking compared to OG solution. I would also like to mention that drones have to yet be added, so all the ranch duties are for player to be done. 
With last update Weather is a thing happening accross the Isles so that is very neat.

I wish they would allow a bit more automation, because especially in the late game, i spent a lot of time just carrying plorts from A to B on my ranch. My suggestion is to add buttons that let u send all your plorts to the refinery or to the market all at once right from the plort collector. 
Also adding drones that just harvest your crops and put them into a specific autofeeder.

even though it's early access, there's so much to explore and see and i constantly would get lost because i would find and explore a new area when in fact i needed to go back to the ranch because the slimes are starving. oops.
my only problems so far have been a few crashes, and gameplay-wise i feel like getting and finding resources is more difficult in comparison to the first game - one solution i think that would work is letting the player make their own map markers, so that they can find resources they have found later again once they have regenerated, as currently a bunch of the upgrades and items need resources that i simply can't get enough of because i forgot where they're located.

again, i'm super stoked to eventually see this game finished and i can't wait for future updates. thank you monomi park for being 12 year-old me's first proper gaming experience <3",1702853932,1702853932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's still fun and it is very similar in terms of gameplay to the original. However, because it's still early access, the mechanics feel substantially less fleshed out, resulting in a far greater balance of farming time to adventure time compared to SR1. Extremely important mechanics from SR1 that made developing the ranch easier like resource extractors, drones, and two-way teleports are missing. The distance between the ranch expansions has been expanded, too, so you can expect to spend 10 minutes to every hour trucking 30 plorts at a time back and forth across unnecessarily long pathways to get from the ranch expansions to the refinery/plort market as you try desperately to scavenge enough crafting resources to increase your stack size and/or build market/refinery links. Also, the cutest slime in the game only eats food that you have to manually gather piece by piece at a specific time of night in one specific location because you can't farm it --- really??? 

On the plus side, the ambience and graphics have improved. The environments are prettier than the original game and the music is even better than it was in the original. The increased focus on weather mechanics is fun and makes the game world feel more like a location. Effects and textures have been refined --- phosphor slimes never looked this good. The game world is not as large as SR1, but there's still plenty of space to explore (it feels about the size of the original mainland, before the Glass Desert and later expansions). 

It seems like this is the start of an excellent game that will rival, if not outclass, the original in a few years, once the kinks (particularly the lack of bee drones) have been worked out. Right now, whether it's worth the price really depends on whether you preferred the farming or the adventure mechanics in the original. If you'd like a greater balance of farming time, then it may be worth it. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend buying it for the list price yet, but maybe eventually.",1702840913,1702840913,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The balance is all off.  It took me 14 days in-game and 4 hours real-time for money to become meaningless.  All the upgrades that make the gameplay more enjoyable are locked behind items you find scattered throughout the map in small quantities (the gameplay of moving through the world, exploring, and collecting, specifically).  This means you need to spend vastly more time out and about than tending to your slimes.  I ended up in a position where I essentially had to let my slimes ""starve"" to progress the game.  This isn't exactly an issue, the slimes don't die, but it feels weird.  I would have had to spend an inordinate amount of time pumping out food and prepping all the feeders to support the slimes for the multiple days I'd be gone, and why would I do that when I don't even need their plorts for money anymore?

Additionally, they give you all these cool devices and tech you _could_ place all around the map, but no you can't because those also need the same exploration items you find in twos and threes in a few places on the map each day.  I could have literal hundreds of any given plort, tens of thousands of dollars, but I don't have enough of the other items to utilize what they put in the game.

It's a fun game--I'm enjoying it and I think those with a calmer play style would enjoy it, but it feels off.  Like I said in the beginning, the farming and exploring aspects are not well balanced.  The ""difficulty"" curve is nearly a straight line up, except the difficulty is unlocking the sweet new shoes they showed you from day one, or the ability to sprint a little further, or hold more things so you can explore longer before having to return or find a place to store them.",1702281775,1702281775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've had issues with snares not working, like at all. There is a single slime that is basically impossible to find, and also isn't even needed for upgrades and becomes useless money wise by the point when if you find it, which is infuriating for a completionist, leaving the game open for hours for it never to spawn. There's no drones in this game like there was in the first one, meaning you have to manage your slimes entirely on your own, piling up quickly even when you're away for short bursts unless you purposely minimize your corrals efficiency, and there's no extra mini games or added content like how first game had with the Nimble Valley. 

This game is more or less the same, just new areas to explore, all the other functionality is the same, so with that in mind, this game feels like somewhat of a downgrade with the lack of aforementioned problems above. The only things I can say this game gets right is that you have the refinery lab right from the get go, and instead of needing to drill in specifically set locations for special resources, they spawn all over the place and can be vacuumed up with the vac gun, which is a much better approach to that aspect in my opinion. That and there's also new weather effects which can cause some fun things to happen and make exploration a little more fun.

Overall it's still a fun game, but I think unless they fix the aforementioned issues I have with it, I don't think I can rank it as good as the first game.

 It's Slime Rancher but with better graphics and some new minor mechanics.
It really doesn't add much to the formula, and one of the thing that it adds isn't very good (resources).

 One would expect the sequel of the game to add more freedom, more experimentation or something that would add to the gameplay, but as of today, it is almost as vanilla as it can be.

 It may be a plus for some people, but for me it's more of a downer than anything, still it is an enjoyable game.

 And adding on the materials thing, it is wrongly implemented, you just go farming predetermined spots of resources like its Runescape for minor changes on your equipment, and not even for something that we haven't experienced in the previous game, so the reward feeling is minimal. But worst even, is that if you focus on upgrading something of your equipment, but you can't find the resources because you already farmed them, you just have to wait until they respawn and that, added to the before mentioned, makes the whole mechanic not so enjoyable.

 I would've loved something more sandbox oriented, a lot more of freedom, maybe even having to manually build the ranch, that's one of the ways I can see the gameplay loop not becoming so repetitive.
 Or something more RPG, having slime bosses to unlock new areas, and equipment.
 Even something metroidvania like, having more platforming and puzzles, and unlocking specific equipment to being able to pass those challenges by crafting it with slime rare drops that you get if your slimes are very happy.

Also an extra that could be easily fixed, is that gold becomes too abundant and you get no use for it because you full upgrade your ranch super fast. In this type of games usually the resource management of things and grinding hard but rewarding updates for the base is usually a core gameplay mechanic.

 Still, it's on early access, it has been 14 of the 18 months they estimated for 1.0, the game isn't bad, and still has content to come, for that reason I give it a good review. Personally I feel this game as a ""Meh"".",1701934791,1702048289,True,160,2,0.872341513633728027,0,True,False,True

It's early access so there's more to make but as of now it just felt like I was playing the previous Slime Rancher with better graphics, new island, more slimes, more tool upgrades, but lacking everything else. Some features (farms, cages etc.) are just an exact copy from the first with nothing new while other features that were good from the first game were taken out.

For example, there's really no puzzles or progression in the map anymore. I was excited to open doors just to realize they were tunnels leading me back to places in the map I've already been to. Some Gordos I'd pop just to unlock geysers to places I'd already been to because of the jet pack.

Highly enjoyable if you just want something casual and cute for the time.


Things done in a gorgeous world despite being early access:
-Adorable Slimes
-Adorable graphics and mechanics
-Clear and simple tutorials especially if this is your first slime rancher game
-The weather system adds a dash of flavor watching this tiny pink thing getting launched into next year
-The saber slimes personally are my favorite
-You get a new variety of slimes

My personal experience with the game I would personally say it has alot to offer, with a list of potential on the roadmap I have high hopes as Monomi Park has not let me down yet. I have full faith that they know what they are doing and expect no less from a game that made it big in sales. 

Their advertisements are always properly designed where you get to watch those cuties bounce around after being cleanly informed on mechanics

If you are looking for a little bit of a booster for your mental health I highly recommend this game, the innocence that it brings out along with getting booped by a tabby slime is always so refreshing. 


Overall I do recommend this game and this was definitely worth the money, I have high hopes yet my expectations have already been met

My hope is for more dynamic and fun gadgets! To learn this new world of slimes is exciting.

You really have to take this game into consideration with how alot of whats on the market doesn't exactly appease under stimulating that creative effort anymore. This gives a note of fresh air for that more colorful feeling of creativity. This can really lead to wanting to pursue more for this dynamic game.",1701739189,1701739189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Just like SR1, you have plots to buy crops/fields/chicken-coop/slime-enclosure, there are no new field types. All the upgrades are identical too. Just like SR1, you have to spend money to unlock areas to get plots, and you need to craft teleporters to get around, just like SR1. You run around outside your farm to collect slimes, which exhibit the exact same behavior as SR1, and you collect resources like fruits/vegetables/chickens just like SR1. You sell plorts through some tube-vacuum thing which gives you money depending on the current price, which fluctuates each day. It's all the same.

The exploration part of SR1 was not the best, and there are no new exploration or movement mechanics here. It's not like you're bunny/strafe-jumping through the map, or spinning through the map like sonic, or wahooing all around like mario, etc. I'm not saying they need to add crazy mechanics, it's just tiring to see the second iteration of this game have the same 'generic 3D platformer' controls (hold W and shift to sprint when you have the energy), especially when it feels so floaty and disconnected from the world. This might seem like a weird criticism, but platforming is a large part of the game, & I just find it really boring and uninspired the second time around. I have no motivation to explore.

That would have been fine for me though, since I was most hopeful to have an automated approach to slime farming. This doesn't seem to be the case. There's a lot of manual work involved each day, mostly running back and forth constantly fighting the limited inventory. This was fine for SR1, but doing the same thing in a sequel is just not fun. I don't know why you can't automate the resources transit, or do anything -- why must I do all this myself? I understand they're trying to go for a relaxing atmosphere here, like doing repetitive things in Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley can be relaxing, but with those games you are doing a whole array of different daily tasks. Here, your daily tasks are just to run back and forth, and that's it.

I understand it's early access but rarely will you see a game change its core design principles once it hits this point. It seems they probably discussed their design goals for this game, and they decided to mimic SR1 rather than to expand or change what they had already done. The exploration and the farm are both identical to SR1. It's unlikely that they will add some sort of automation to be accessible from early-mid game that introduces a ton of additional mechanics. If it's just something I purchase and everything is handled for me, that isn't a fun solution & would still feel like SR1 but with less busywork. So I have a feeling that it's something that had to be added early during development. But we'll see what they have in store.

Also, the rendering performance is poor, often tanking framerate when there are many slimes nearby. Perhaps it's just my machine or configuration, I haven't ran a renderdoc/nsight frame analysis and don't really feel up to it right now.

I'm going to keep checked in to see what updates they have down the pipeline, but right now I'd only play this if you haven't played SR1.",1689564786,1701583850,False,13,1,0.60628122091293335,1,True,False,True

I would've loved if they had the rancher in the sequel be personalizable to the player themselves and be introduced as a new rancher, and have Beatrix be our experienced mentor.

Today I saw two honey slimes chasing each other down an incline in Starlight Strand, and then they each got distracted by something halfway down. One was curious about some food, the other stared in awe at a flutter slime. I can't blame it, flutter slimes are very pretty.

This one has less content than the first game, and brings nothing new of substance to the table. The map is boring and confusing, with less detail than almost any other game I can think of DESPITE needing a beefy computer to run it. The lighting is nice, but there are no assets or models that really define one area from the next. It desperately needs a starfish on the beach, or a cactus in the desert. Literally barren textureless landscapes await you. You'll spend WAY more than half your time asking ""am i even in the right area, or am I lost again"". I'm not even a player that gets turned around on games, but this one has such a confusing layout and visual blandness that you'll do the same. The in game map isn't very good at all either, so it won't be much help.

The actual slime ranching is bugged in quite a few ways. In the first game chickens were always a bottleneck. In this game they breed out of control in your basement and it takes HOURS to clean them all out if your computer doesn't crawl to a halt first (edit: i think they fixed this one, but there's a plethora of other bugs).

I figured the success of the first game, despite it being a simple game, would cause the developers to start working on a superior version with their newfound wealth. I imagined breeding slime hybrids on a generational scale to achieve new breeds, and imagined customization of pens that were freeform and fillable with assets, but instead we got ""hit x to upgrade"". Drones are missing, clipping errors happen, unfinished areas abound, the jetpack isn't fun to fly and takes forever to recharge (you'll be standing on top of trees waiting for a recharge WAY too often), upgrades don't go as far as the OG game, every update just adds some decorative rock or grass that's already found in the wild for you to replicate at home base for I guess playing dollhouse..... I could just keep going.

I hope they get some John Carmack level developers and visionaries into their studio soon and pay them some grind hours, otherwise I don't think they have the talents to polish whatever this thing currently is.

as a huge slime rancher fan who has been playing since 2016, you should not buy this game right now. it is just the first game with cutesier graphics and less content. sure it's in early access but it's not very clear as of now what direction the game will go. will it be like the first game's early access and add new systems/mechanics or will it just add new slimes and areas (which is what the first game has been doing for 5 years, so why create a sequel)? from the looks of things right now, that's not very clear.

""How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
“The full version of Slime Rancher 2 will feature more slimes to wrangle, resources to collect, gadgets to build, places to explore, completion of its story, and more. As we develop Slime Rancher 2 we also plan to introduce features that change up the Slime Rancher formula while still retaining the experience that millions of players already have enjoyed.

Slime Rancher 2 is where the world of Slime Rancher will grow and evolve for years to come.”""

>what did they mean by this bros

if new stuff that actually improves the game mechanically and new systems are added i'll change this review, but right now the only different thing mechanically is the resource collection revamp, which i found to be more annoying and time consuming than in the first game where you just put drills and sleep. i'm worried the game won't do anything new and just add more slimes and places to explore, which could have just been dlc for the first game (and we wouldn't lose our worlds we spent dozens, if not hundreds of hours in)

edit: so it's been a year. the only new slimes were 3 of the old ones being ported back and 1 new very rare one. yes, we still don't have quantums, rads, and mosaics. there was one new area added, which is cool, but not really enough, and the disconnected map is starting to hurt the game more as new areas are added. the weather system is great, but i don't like that getting the 2 ""new"" slimes added are basically reliant on rng now. all of this could have very easily been dlc for the first game. the devs promised some new game changing mechanics in the next update centered around gadgets, we'll see how it turns out. you should just buy the first game.",1666140425,1701422381,False,3,1,0.524489104747772217,0,True,False,True

Original review:
I absolutely love this game! I also fully understand this is an early access game and therefore is not yet complete. However, in its current state I wouldn´t wanna play it yet. I remember reading somewhere that the updates will come every 3 months for approximately 18 months before the full release. Ive played about 6 hours and have already lost motivation. Theres no story yet, not all slimes are there. You can only farm ten or so different slimes. There aren´t many upgrades either. And they mostly centre around inventory management. Theres no drones. The game is GORGEOUS though! I don´t have any trouble running it on my laptop on the highest settings. Conclusion: is a super promising game but I would recommend waiting for the full release if you worry about not getting bored quickly. I'm very excited for the next update too. Ill definitely change my review once more content and more optimization is added. Hope you have a lovely day :)",1666991402,1701120972,False,20,0,0.652147769927978516,0,True,False,True

Compared to the last game this is very similar and you aren't missing out on much apart from the obvious new locations, slimes and story-line.
In all there is nothing 'bad' about this game, it still has its charm -turn brain off and play experience, that is very effective and the cutesy art-style that i love. If you liked the original this isn't mind-blowing but it is far from a bad sequel and i see no reason the devs wouldn't keep supporting this game.

The game can get quite confusing at times, especially since a majority of the areas look very similar, getting lost is extremely easy. Though more instruction on how to use the upgrades could be quite useful, since some descriptions are quite vague at times. 
I'd also recommend putting a cute little map in the corner, so navigation could be easier. (to combat getting lost)

This game is still very much in early access, plain and simple. When it's done, I truly believe it will 100% be worth it, but right now there are only signs of something great. The graphics are outstanding and the new areas feel more exploratory in nature. The new slimes are a welcome addition, though I wish more returned (though if the dervish and tangle slimes are any indication, this may be in the cards for later updates). My biggest complaint is seemingly the lack of optimization, or very poor quality of it. I am unable to maintain consistent fps with this game, with nothing else open, unless I play at the lowest settings. I play on a laptop, but it is a pretty good one, and should be able to run a game like this without issue. Instead, I get permanent frame drops that make the game run far slower. I believe this is part of being in early access, and will likely be fixed when the game comes out in full. There is so much here. The new slimes are, as I said, a welcome addition. The old faces returning are a good thing. The new environments feel so well realized.
Additionally, my only other complaint is the 'power wall'. Once broken through with a few mass plort sales, you are essentially set up for the rest of the game, and can afford anything you want. Once again, I feel like this is an issue with the game being early access, more stuff should be added in time.
Overall, it is unfinished as all hell, but shows potential of a good game. If you wanna take the plunge now I won't stop you, but I will at least say to keep this one on your wishlists. Do I recommend it now? Probably not, though I won't stop you. Will I recommend it when it's out of early access? Most likely. It's gonna be amazing when it's finished, whenever that comes. Thank you Monami, can't wait to see the final product.

Everywhere you go feels the same and there just isn't anything to really do once you've got one of every slime. Where as the first one had a lot to do in the late game, the late game is non existent here. Once you've unlocked the other two parts of the map, you've seen most of what the game loop will be. Even then the map is just boring an repetitive, the first one had so many biomes but here its ""grassy plane"" and ""Volcano"", with volcano being a super short segment. Once all the gordo's have been popped you've won the game, something that can realistically take you 4-5 hours if you've played the first. Everything new is just mediocre at best. Theres a weather mechanic but it just feels a bit lifeless? Like yea theres a tornado but it doesn't do anything besides move things up a few feet then set it gently back down. The new upgrade system just removed some of the randomness in getting materials in favor of making you wait forever.

I got Slime Rancher 2 a few minutes after it came out and played it the same day. I have always been navigationally impaired but it seems Rainbow Island has a more convoluted and confusing layout than the Far, Far Range in the first installment. When stepping out of the ranch area it feels like stepping out into the wilderniss, every journey feels like an adventure on Rainbow Island. 

The slimes are slimier and seem stickier than before. The cat-inspired slimes jump at you more often and tarr-outbreaks seem more common. The system for gathering resources now actually demands you explore, rather than build a tiny workbase in every area. The new slimes are adorable and I hope to see many more species added over the course of development. Seeing some of the old ones return is also great, though I'll miss the ones left behind on the Far, Far Range.

As for the downsides...
-  Rainbow Island is brighter and more colorful than the ranch in the first installment which tends to give me a headache, though fiddling with the settings of the game helps mitigate this effect. 

I am extremely excited to see where the rest of the game leads.",1664456204,1700830433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- No mini-map, which I feel this game desperately needs. For some reason, the maps are way harder to navigate than the first game. Maybe I'm just not used to it yet, but after three hours I feel like I should have a better, or even general grasp of where I am in the first area.
- Distance between plots, and especially the refiner, is starting to feel ridiculous. Maybe an increase in movement speed would help. Like come on, this is just annoying.
- Can't store the same items in different tanks. Why is this still a thing? This would definitely help with the distancing issue as well. I don't want to keep running back and forth when I have 100 plorts in the collector, dude.",1700787380,1700787380,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

One night He opened another one of his steam games and it crashed Slime Rancher 2 on my end 'cause it's off his library...

Usually I need my spotify open at all times when I play a new game but this one has such beautiful music I just want to listen to it over and over and over again!

_________________________

No, I mean really. I was super happy when I received the second part. After I finished the first part, the announcement for the second part appeared.

Part 2 with cuteness. Cute things that help you relax, forget about everyday life and just enjoy without someone yelling in your ear how bad you are even though you did your best. (Online games)

It's still in Early Access BUT you don't really notice that it is. For early access, it already feels like a finished game.

I would even nominate SR2 for ""Best Game of the Year"" or the ""Best Game with Love""... but that's already covered with the first part.

I had already completely finished SR2 in the first week because it quickly becomes addictive. In a good sense of course.

It has a similar structure to SL1 but is a bit different. Of course I'm missing things from first part to second part, but maybe it will come in an update in the future. Who knows.

With new Update with Weather give this game more love and spirit. It's really enjoyable to play.
_________________________

[u]Conclusion:[/u]

The game is ideal if you don't want to have any stress, if you want to calm down or if you want to forget everyday life. And best of all, be a little away from toxic online players and only enjoy with cuteness.
The game is both as well as the first part; a game for every age group. Whether young or old; it is for everyone. It is also for every gender. So guys; you don't have to be ashamed to play something cute. It will do you good. ;)",1669169487,1700647450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[h3] Slight spoilers up ahead, I guess? [/h3]


[i]Slime rancher 2[/i] follows off of right after last game, you, the player are tasked to figure out the technology and unknown resources of this island

I lived and breathed the last game (Slime rancher/SR) and I live for SR2 also! 
The game from the start to now has fixed most of its bugs, and added a ton of new things. Yes I know the game is EA (Early access) right now but from the way it was looking before to now... it is a huge upgrade.

For a game which I assume isn't close to being done, [b]the story[/b] we do have is pretty good so far! 
[spoiler]You get a note at the start telling you to come over to Rainbow Island and without a second thought you go to this island not knowing what awaits you! Someone clearly has been there before, and through the drone notes this person left behind, it seems they worked for 7C crop. [/spoiler]
There are some drone notes that are kind of sad but thats best up to you to find them (if you get the game) 
Anyway, like I said, we don't have much on story but I do hope we get a new character to interact with or at least be able to see one of the characters standing in front of us later down the track; It's a lot to ask for but i do hope to see it!
being able to get more messages from Casey too would be wonderful! I know the whole story but I would love to see us (the player) and Casey start to talk again.

[b]The game[/b] is a huge vibe jump from the last game but still manages to capture the same amount of calmness it had in SR, I'm really happy to see that they went with a more rainbow design than another sand/rock theme.

[b]The scenery[/b] is beautiful, even though there a tons of different colours, none of them getting muddy up be each other and in fact most of the time compliment each other!
The habitat for the slime has improved a lot from the last game, both games divided the slimes into their own areas but SR2 improves on this design.
I know the game is in EA but I really do hate the fact that even though you can access Powdefalls Bluffs, you can't do much there but grab some saber slimes and throw some snow around.
On the upside, I am for one loving the map update, they moved some of the islands around so it looks less crowded though it is more on the empty side now but I can't really complain.

Most of [b][the slimes[/b] from the last game are in SR2 now, not much a change in designs but that part is made up for when with the new slimes in the game, even though we only get 5 new slimes they are still amazing in of itself.

[b]The soundtrack[/b] is amazing and really does match the whole game, the music that plays for each island is beautiful and the music that plays when you're near a tar slime or a feral slime is exactly what I imagine fear sounding like in a happy game.

They updated [b]the UI[/b] for the Slimepedia even though the old one was quite fine and reflected SR's UI quite a bit but either way the new is a lot more cleaner looking and it does bounce! (Though i get a headache quick from it)

[b][i]Game settings[/b] are still slow to change, at this point just changed it to a slider, it's a lot faster and I get to control the exact speed/sound/etc I want it to be, it still does it job so complaining would be a waste of time, on the upside you can increase the enemies damage now! You can't really increase it too high but it's still a really good thing to have for people who are looking for a not so hard challenge.

[b]The game controls[/b] are also basic and the same from the last game so nothing to complain on that!

After this most recent update I'm still absolutely loving Slime Rancher 2. The new slimes are great and I'm happy to see old one's return.

Okay so as I am playing the early acces I'll update my review with every update until the final release (and if they do any DLCs) except for bugfixes and things like that:

Song of the Sabers: The snow physics and the northern ligths are absoluteley beautiful and very well optimised, I thought my pc wasn't gonna be able to run it but it does and very smoothly, I don't like that they demistified the saber slimes but they are cute, and the yolky slime is so hard to find and so weird that I thought it was a hoax but its real and cute xD

Come Rain or Slime: OMG the wather system is sooo cool and feels so natural, Thunderstorms are epic, rain is relaxing, pollen is beautiful and slimefall, lol thats just terraria's slime rain, I love it, There are no new areas that I have found, the 'new' slimes apear with weahter and the painted chickens apear randomly I think
But again, abosutely beautiful and very very well optimised.

🙂My 𝙋𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡 Opinion🙃

BEAUTIFUL! this game is huge, definiteley worth the price, I do hope stickers, trading cards and achievements will be added which thy surely will, I love the new graphics, the new relaxing music, the new kinds of slime, this game is just fantastic, the cutest game on the planet, and not preciseley Earth.
Even in early acces It's really well optimised and polished, I haven't found any major bugs and have no complaints
Monomy Park is a really caring company for their game and community so they probably will update this game for years to come, so pretty cool and worthit; So if you're still deciding if you should buy this game, please Do, and if you haven't played the first game you can still play this one but you should go play that one too :b

🚧 Early Acces Sugestions 🚧

The graphics, music and gameplay are absoluteley great but I have some sugestions for future updates
- Have a mini map, Only in areas where the map is unlocked but it would be super helpful for navigating this bigger world
- Map markers, If we have a map we should also be able to mark points of interest, again only in unlocked areas 
- Steam Items: Trading cards, Point-Shop items, achievements and all that stuff, I know they are probably working on it already but I had to put it here anyways :b

That's all xd, the game is actually pretty polished and of course I hope for new expansions and stuff but that's all I ask, thanks for reading :)",1663975108,1700591738,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

There are not enough upgrades or ingame rewards to warrant farming at all - you quickly surpass the amount of money you need for basic upgrades making plort farming a waste of time. Areas are locked behind specific resources that don't always spawn (currently writing this while waiting for my fourth night cycle in a row waiting for a nighttime-only fruit to spawn). The most annoying thing for me is how spread out the base is. This was something I really expected them to improve on after the first game but instead the base feels even more labyrinthine and spread out than it did in the first game. There is a two-way teleporter available but it isn't unlocked until the end of the current content and farming the materials for it is tedious (more world resource drops).

Game is still in early access after 14 months. Not much has changed in that time and the updates have been focused around adding minor content (adding slimes that already existed in the first game...) rather than fixing core issues with the gameplay loop. I hesitate to recommend it right now and would say you would be better off replaying the first one.

Don't buy this. Just get slime rancher 1 instead. You'll have a better experience with a lot more content and a game you can actually put a lot of hours into.

I'm so tired of Monomi Park promising ""big updates"" that turn out to be something simple that is a background feature. Where's our new areas? Where's additions to the story? Story isn't even hard to code- so why is there so little of it without any more being added in the new updates? The ""big"" updates?
It's not even ""new"" content particularly, the slimes we're getting were in the first game. 
Sorry but a weather system shouldn't take a year to make. I've seen entire games of a higher quality being made in that time. But it didn't even take a year when people have dug up evidence this was only in the works late October.

Simply put, this game shouldn'tve been released this early access. I ADORE slime rancher but this is just... such a downgrade. Yeah, it's prettier, but I'm here for content. If I wanted pretty visuals, I'd watch a video. The rate of development makes me think the game hasn't even gotten a written story or conceptualised areas yet. It feels like a cash grab and nothing more.

if you wanted more slime rancher 1, make sure to buy a better pc or you'll end up with the most shitty graphics imagineable.
it really is laughable. the graphics in slime rancher 1 always gave me hundreds of fps and looked better than the graphics in this game that causes my pc to overheat and have 30 fps at max, WHILE still locking biomes and worlds behind teleporters and loading screens, which is what the original barely did and still managed to optimise it better.

the majority of the content like slimes and foods are straight up ripped from the original game and the map is also very confusing to navigate, which is to be expected, but it seems very intentional or intentionally difficult to learn in this case

the game is awfully grindy. i always wanted a bit more grindy slime rancher because for an example the major upgrades to your player character could have been all unlocked with really little coins in the original game.
well, they might've done them too grindy.
upgrades cost a fair more amount of coins while costing materials like deep brine from the original game.
you also need to find treasure pods that unlock the blueprint for said upgrade, which means that you very well could never find the treasure pod that gives you the energy meter upgrade lvl 2 or the jetpack upgrade.
every trip that you take to get the materials for an upgrade take up to 30 minutes and you could very well still not get enough materials, which is very grindy.

at least they made the plort market and the material system much more interesting.
the plort market actually works like a stock market now. when you sell, it goes down, but if you keep your plorts, it goes up and you sell for more.
materials also do not need to be mined by auto miners just like in the original game anymore, you just have to use your vac pack to suck them up from material deposits around the map.

the game is pretty fun at first and i was really hyped but the blatant flaws quickly became obvious and just made me want to stop playing, so i could wait for the full release and have fun playing the game in its released state

The basic ingredients being PVA glue (white glue), Borax (household chemical with various uses, odor removal for fridges, or as an antibacterial wash) and water,

I may change my review in the future, but at present the content available does not warrant this being a sequel that is 50% more expensive than the first game. At the time of review, come rain or slime has been released, and the game lacks the charm of the first. Resource collection is mind numbing as you run around the map like a headless chicken as you desperately search for the resources you need to upgrade your gear, only to realize you need to also constantly hope you find the correct blueprint for the upgrades, and not another decoration. At present, money serves almost no purpose as you can rapidly get enough to buy all the ranch expansions available. It is also frustrating that despite playing as Beatrix, we dont have all the gear from the first game and don't really get much reason as to why. We get minimal content with the characters from the first game. The map is a nightmare to navigate due to its lack of strongly distinct islands. The first three islands share several biomes and it all blends together. The drive to explore is just not there as the rewards are always another decoration and not a hyper rare slime only in one spot, or a mystery or new form of puzzle to solve. The gameplay is extremely similar to the first with the plort puzzles put everywhere. If you are a veteran from the first game, it will feel tedious after a couple hours as it turns into a glorified collectithon. The devs know all this as well, the game opens with a disclaimer that it is a work in progress, but it is a work in progress that offers a fraction of the content as the first game, while missing most of the first games features, such as automation and interesting puzzles, as well as an interesting story. It feels tedious. I cannot help but feel that Monomi Park is somehow in dire financial straights as the fact that they charge $30 for this game while the first is $20 despite this barely feeling like anything more than a dlc that strips everything you had from the basegame.

Early-access release:
The main thing that Slime rancher 2 changes from the prequel is the complete rework of the gadget and resource system. In the original, the refinery was not available until you reached a pretty high level. To the point where you would most likely have completed the main story by the time you unlock it. All of the resources you use to refine stuff are ecxtracted using drills. Now, you get access to the refinery immediatly at the start and resources just spawn in the world around you. This version also reworked the upgrades, in the prequel they all just costed money and as such could all be obtained way too easily. Now upgrades are made in the refinery from resources and money, making them harder to obtain but still reasonable. Other than that slime rancher 2 features 3 new areas not in slime rancher 1, 5 new slimes and the return of 12 slimes from the original. Very good 8/10

Song of the Sabers:
This update features a new area, new secret slime and the return of the Saber slime from the first game. In this game, you can actally encounter un-largo'd sabers and their favorite food is revealed. The amount of new and exciting things this update offers is astounding for the first update in an early access game. I love it. I honestly can't find anything to complain about. 10/10

Come rain or slime:
This update adds a weather system to the game, i never thought that this change could make the world feel so much more dynamic and interesting. This update also re-adds the dervish and tangle slime from the first game as well as their favorite food. Both of these slime spawn anywhere as long as a specific weather is there, this wasn't how they worked in slime rancher 1 and i think this makes them more interesting. Walking through the starlight strand for hunter plort when all of a sudden vines cover the walls and floor and these adorable little guys pop out! It's fantastic. I do have a complaint with this update though, that is that it didn't add anything to do. Like yeah you can collect the tangle and dervish slimes to add them to the slimepedia and if you want make a corral for them in the conservatory. But there's no new upgrades to buy, no new gadgets, areas, treasure pods, achievements, or anything. Not to say this update was too small it is a totally acceptable size for an update, but there's nothing to accomplish if you've already completed the previous updates which not everyone has done but i'm sure alot of hardcore fans have. Anyho, this game is amazing and i love it so much.  7/10

Overall this game is a 9/10",1670257461,1700161216,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Edit: We finally got the second update in November 14, 2023. It added nothing new but a wack weather system that does nothing significant to the game. What a scam of a game this is.

As it is right now, the game is an inferior version of SR1, with many of its core features removed for some reason. It probably has about 4-6 hour of actual content, the rest is just walking simulator to pad out time. The world is pretty, but that's pretty much the only thing it has over SR1. Oh and a 10€ higher price tag for some reason.

TLDR: SR1 is better, this cost more and has less content. Looks like a quick cash grab they abandoned after half a year. It's been 8 month since the last update. Do not buy it even on sale.",1693504076,1700133162,False,10,0,0.491768449544906616,0,True,False,True

Why do I hate Rainbow Fields, you ask? Well, it's more so a problem that there is no HUD compass to tell you what direction you're facing. There's like 4 portals leading to the areas in RF because it's the hub area where your conservatory is, obviously, but since I can't tell what direction I'm facing and RF is very vertical, I constantly get lost and find the wrong portal or can't even find my ranch because I keep getting turned around and can't tell what direction I'm facing in. Might not be a problem for everyone, but I can't tell you how many times I've gone in loopty-loops trying to find the damn conservatory.

And in general, I know it's an early access game like the original was, but I'm finding the micro-managing of this game to be way more tedious and annoying than the original, which I'm not sure why. The ranch area is slightly bigger, yes, but since this version of EA doesn't have drones yet and minimal teleporters, I had my entire ranch's plort collectors overloaded because I just couldn't be bothered spending an entire game day cleaning them when I could be resource gathering. Unlike the first game where I clean up a bit and feel comfortable leaving the ranch for a day or two and be able to handle the plorts, here I'm constantly worrying about all the crap I have to do when I get back instead of enjoying the environments and the graphics. I'm not sure what's different to cause this shift in managing priorities as I said, but somehow this game is more stressful than the original for me despite being nearly identical.

Overall, it's fine. I do like these environments more than the original game since they're more colorful and varied, but there's a reason I haven't played it much and it's not because of the lack of soon-to-come content; I get stressed tf out just thinking about this game and managing my ranch. I don't want to go out and hunt these brand new slimes with their new mechanics, I'm too busy running around crying trying to keep my conservatory from exploding...

Very similar elements to the first one but with some differences too. Getting the Jetpack is a little bit more difficult than the first but it will unlock more areas or make areas easier to traverse. All the new slimes are adorable and some have a fun little gimmick. I know I'm definitely enjoying myself while playing and I'm looking forward to any updates the game will get in the future. There is so much room for more slimes to be added. 

I've noticed while I play that the screen once in a while flicker to black and at first, I thought that it was my TV that was the problem, but I recently got new monitors for my computer and it still did that. It was the game itself and I don't know why it flashed to black for a split second but it was only once and not for a while. The jumping in the game is a little unpredictable and can cause you to fall into the slime sea or miss where you want to land. This is amplified a bit when you get the Jetpack but you have a bit to catch yourself and save yourself from jumping into the slime sea provided that you have enough energy to get back.

Edit 11/13/23: The Flashing black thing is fixed. I haven't seen that since but the jumping is still a little sensitive. I'm finding that I jump farther than I mean to even without the jetpack still and it just gives me little moments of panic where I think I'm about to land in the slime sea.",1665182474,1699916571,True,1,0,0.503816783428192139,0,True,False,True

I once saw a post that there isn't much diffrent between one and two JUST A WHOLE NEW MAP new slimes and some old slimes missing. the new map isn't even entirley connected for heavens sake! the first new area you get to by teleporter giving it a feel of diconectivity if you ask me. lastly the upgrade system is diffrent, instead of just spending money you need to go and find resources where as in the first games those would be in technologys or decoratives, giving it a more simplistic option for those who wanted to just make a ton of money. also before you ask the reason i know what one is like but don't have it while writing this is cause my dad bought it on his steam account and family sharred it to me.

in conclusion its just too high energy to be a slime rancher seqeual if you ask me, but please don't take this as the only information you'll need, look at other peoples opions on it too! and then go but slime rancher one because its better.(yes i know my spelling sucks)",1699583424,1699583424,False,2,0,0.44491887092590332,0,True,False,True

Its fun within the first, 6 hours of gameplay. But after that its repetitive, boring, lame, and overall way to tedious to want to keep playing. If I wanted to subjugate myself to a 2 hour long process of something, I would go make macaroons. I dont. I wanted to play this game and feel like I accomplished something within 30-40 minutes..maybe an hour tops. 

Instead, I spend 2 hours: 
Collecting food that isnt already dead, from my reset 4 times farm because it grows to fast, and I cant automate it.
Shove what I cant fit (which is only 30 at the moment) into storage.
Run roughly 5-10 minutes, to each slime area (sometimes more than once to each) feeding slimes, and collecting excess plorts.
Spend another, 5-10 minutes selling it, sometimes longer. 
Run around outside the farm trying to complete the Gordos (I dont remember, the really giant slimes you feed alot of food too, which...i would have....if it wasnt dead, ya know) 99% of the time, not even having THAT food item, so hopefully finding resources and swapping them for rarer and rarer ones.......

Only to run back. Realize I didnt need those resources. And another 2-3 batches of crops are dead, with all my slime plorts being overfilled and way to much food in the slime pens. Regretting every decision even getting this game. 

Then rage quitting and playing  Dinkum. 

So yeah. Do not buy this game, unless you like repeating the same grueling task over, and over, and over, and over, and over........with sprinkles of hopes that you remember the true resources you need, while crossing your fingers they re-spawned. 

Thats about it. Its a cashgrab I wish I could refund and get my money back. I never regretted buying a game so much as this one....",1664254736,1699343149,False,0,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

Vac upgrades it tried to branch out for, but in a really annoying way.

In the game you could spend 100% of your time just managing your economy with the process of producing food, feeding, collecting/ depositing Plots and so on. Making it necessary to stifle your potential economy by having less slime's to even get really any adventuring done.  This could easily be remedied by allowing for a 2 player co-op so that one player could tend to the slime's while the other would go on expeditions.

There's no plot. No quests. Just pick up slimes and put them in your ranch. It doesn't take long at all to max out on slimes and lose any interest in exploration except to gather the items that you can't ranch, and that's just to build decorations that are very limited in where they can be placed.

This game has a much different upgrade system than Slime Rancher 1 which in theory is an improvement, but in execution leaves fatal flaws that are very easily noticed. Much like the gadgets in slime rancher 1, the upgrades are crafted using materials and plorts. However, materials are locked behind timed resource deposits, resetting every 1-2 days, with some spawns not even being guaranteed. In order to go get these materials, you'll need to venture far across the islands and hope and pray they decided to spawn that day. While you're gone, your slimes will produce endless plorts, too many for one person to handle. When you eventually come home to deposit/use your materials, you'll find that there are way too many plorts to deal with. it will usually take 30 minutes to an hour to clear your ranch of excess plorts. While this may sound like a good thing, there is absolutely nothing to spend your money on. No 7Zee rewards, No toys, and the decorations available are way lamer than Slime Rancher 1, just being trees and rocks you would find on other islands. In addition to money being near useless if you aren't literally within the first 3 hours of your save, there are ZERO methods of automation for anything found in game. No automation for plort collection, sale, or storage. No automation for resource gathering or storage. Ultimately, this leads to the main gameplay loop being: Leave to gather materials > Come home > Spend 30 minutes to an hour cleaning up plorts and feeding slimes > Rinse and repeat. You may be asking yourself why I haven't mentioned any of the mini-games or quests found in Slime Rancher 1. That's because they aren't here. The only impact the NPCs from Slime Rancher 1 have on this game is occasionally calling you and giving you a blueprint or a lame decoration. For this game being over a year into it's early access, it feels like abandonware, the game feeling like a shell of Slime Rancher 1. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you already own Slime Rancher 1, play that. If you don't, buy that instead.

Great start to the game. Really laggy and jerky after you've been playing for a while though. Also the fact that it's been available for nearly two months without even an update on the website is kind of troubling, but SR1 was good so I'm sure they'll get around to it someday. You will run out of things to do relatively quickly aside from the infinite ranching loop, so maybe hold off for the full release and make sure these gameplay issues are ironed out.

Some things were not added such as minigames, and for example the deluxe coop upgrade is just there from the start without the need to unlock it, however, there are no new upgrades to the base buildings, there are no new models, these are all taken 1:1 from the first game and put here, so it really looks like it's copy paste game.
The game also is not as smooth as the first was, there are minor stutters every minute or so, and that was when playing on medium settings. I had no issues on the highest settings in the first game.

Alright so there are of course more slime types, and while cute and fun to play with, nothing has changed when it comes to how the old ones look or sound, nothing has also changed in terms of how you manage your base, as mentioned before there are no new features or items, for the almost 3 hours I've spent I have seen only a single new veggie, brace yourselves for regular or stony hens, pogofruits, carrots and cuberries for at least few first hours of the game.
Market is exactly the same as it was.
Refinery and fabricator are there from the start and you now use them to upgrade your vacpack, the previous upgrades that were purchased with just Newbucks require Plorts and special items such as Brine. It limits how quickly you upgrade everything, and in my opinion is a bit more elegant than the previous ""wait for something to unlock next upgrade and just buy it because you're already stacked on Newbucks"".
The drills, pumps and apiaries are not there anymore, instead the resources such as Deep Brine are collected outside your ranch with your vac after you purchase a Resource Harvester upgrade, these resources are now special nodes that contain 2 or 3 items, and then are put on a timer and you need to return for more later.
Treasure pods can be opened without any upgrades, and they contain decorations or blueprints.
Tarrs are just as scary and dangerous as they were previously. Meaning they can be ignored.

The biggest sin for me was that there don't seem to be any return teleports in the world or available by feeding Gordos like there were in the first game, at least there were no teleports under 4 Gordos, which is a bummer and requires you to either fabricate a one-way teleporter or run back to the base. It's really tedious.
The biomes are no longer connected by land, but they have teleporters that are turned on with the same buttons as there were in Ancient City found behind gordos or ""insert X type plort into a statue"" puzzle, oh and there is also a loading screen whenever you travel from one biome to the other, it's rather annoying after not having to deal with loading screens in the first game.

Overall I would rate the game ""Slime Rancher 1, but less"".",1698507036,1698507154,False,15,0,0.629177093505859375,0,True,False,True

I don't know for sure why its making me so unwell, but I do have two theories;
1. It's so incredibly bright, all the colours are bright and there is bright lights everywhere. There are no dark colours to even it out, and there are too many bright light sources in the game.
2. There is no depth in the game, its a 3D game so I am honestly lost on how that happened. Maybe its the lack of good shadows? idk

the only slightly annoying thing about ~the first game~ for me (harvesting resources) is much better in the second game. you no longer have to hope that you’ll get the resources that you need because you can see them above ground and suck em right up! 

just like the first game, there is a huge amount of land to explore and lots of little hidey holes that will keep you exploring for a long times. there are also a ton of new slimes that are 1000% worth searching for!

for people that have never played slime rancher before, it might seem a little slow in the beginning but PLEASE give it a chance to speed up. you’ll have a lot of tasks and goals to complete in no time, i promise!

There is a lot to explore and discover! The new slimes are adorable. Resource hunting is more enjoyable now that we can use the vac to gather items. It's definitely worth the full price tag even in EA. I got over 20 hours in my first run and still didn't explore or find everything.

This is basically the same game as the first slime rancher - and I wanted more of that, so I bought this and I'm having fun. The same amount of fun I had playing the first slime rancher. 

The ONLY priority they should have for this game, to make it an obvious choice over the first game, is MULTIPLAYER. If they aren't planning on adding Multiplayer, I think Slime Rancher 2 was kind of a waste of time, and should have just been a Slime Rancher expansion. 

It's EXPENSIVE for being basically a new map with some new slimes. The biggest noticeable improvement for me so far is the graphics. However, when I look at the first game vs this one, it's like everything is shrouded in fog. Not really sure why, I got used to it though. 

I do love the (eventual) idea of having funny toys and rides for your slimes, and having different ways to interact with them and the world. I'm excited to have more options to decorate my ranch and islands. However, none of that is actually released as of this review.

So, if you're new to Slime Rancher, you might as well enjoy the first one.
There's no plans for multiplayer on Slime Rancher 2 anyway, and currently it's the exact same game. 

UPDATE OCT 2023: early access took me about 15 hours of very relaxed game play to explore and unlock everything. 

I feel like there is A LOT more work that needs to be done to be comparable to the first game, nevermind better. 

The last gordo slime, the one sitting in front of a rainbow to somewhere - had nothing to do with the rainbow. The rainbow is a place holder for something cool later. Of course I only found out after collecting the rare food it eats over several days. I was very disappointed. 

Not anticipating this being out of early access for a while considering the above.",1696511931,1697030871,False,14,2,0.56691896915435791,0,True,False,True

I absolutely love Slime Rancher as a franchise. This is my comfort game, and has been since I first got it on my Xbox One nearly 5 years ago. This game is no different- though to a lesser extent. Most of the gripes I have about this game purely come from the fact that it's still in early access though. The game has crashed my computer not once, but twice now, the most recent completely rendering both my monitor outputs useless until I restarted my computer. It doesn't have a ton of content right now, but it's to be expected.

The bugs and game-breaking glitches, I trust, will be fixed in time. I'm happy to be patient for Monomi Park, because god, do I respect them as a dev team. I really just hope this ends up living up to its predecessor's name when it leaves early access. I'd still recommend buying this game, if only just to support a top-tier developer.",1696571258,1696571266,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

The main gameplay is the same as the first game; Wrangle slimes and ranch them, but the way you gather materials for slime science is different; instead of machines just drilling/pumping/... you collect the recourses yourself, which I find to be a fun change. The new location is beautiful, and the conservatory looks stunning. The new slime variants are adorable and the ones that return (or are planned to return) are still the same little goofballs. I also like how you can toggle Tar slimes and feral slimes when creating a new save. The way the story (?) / lore is partially it's own thing, but also expands on the previous game (from what i can tell) is also really nice, since you don't necessarily have to know the previous game's lore/story by heart to understand what's being told.

Pros: There are numerous systems to the original slime rancher that have been significantly improved.  The access to the upgrade system from the start is a great one.  Making all the upgrades materials found in the world or plorts is also a great idea. I genuinely feel rewarded by interacting with the games systems, instead of trying to min/max money.  The world exploration is also significantly improved by making meta progression through caches in the world and making them accessible from the beginning.  It was incredibly frustrating in the first game to find a cache and not be able to open it until I did something arbitrary, and then get a lackluster aesthetic reward. I had a lot of fun going through the world to find all the caches and upgrading my gear using them.

Cons: There is a significant lack of content.  I mean a serious lack of content.  There are major features of the first title that were not and still aren't available in the game a year later.  I excused this when it first went early access as I thought this was just a test for players to react to systems and that content would be sporadically released, however the content release has been extremely slow moving.  I completely finished all the content in the game in only a few hours.  I didn't feel like I was playing a game in early access, I felt like I was playing a test demo.  This game went into early access way too early.  I feel like they promised a date, and instead of admitting that they couldn't keep up with that time table, they just polished the stuff they had and sent it out.

Truly exciting!
The story so far is theory inducing, I won't spoil it, but it really gets the gears grinding, just like how it did in the first game with Hobson's notes!

Overall a visual improvement from the first game.
Everything is very colourful, and can be a bit bright at times.
There are a larger variety of slimes without having to complete the game first as of writing this, which I think is nice.

Though, a bad thing is that you need a decent pc to run the game without lag, whereas with the first slime rancher you could play with with a potato pc basically. I think here, the visuals might be the cause of that, I'm not sure though as I'm not a game dev..

But if you got a pc that can run this, then I would definitely get it, though at a discount since in my own opinion, the price is a bit expensive..
Still, go play the game and decide what you think about it for yourself, since I can't decide with a review for you :D

Pros:
- Calm and Relaxing
- Visually Appealing Art Style
- Not excessively challenging (simple game, not overly involved).
- It honestly is just a fun soothing game.

Cons:
- No direction from the game. You have access to the slimepedia, but it would be nice if the game explained some mechanics ie finding the rainbow upgrade globe things around the map, how tarr slimes form, how favorite foods work, how to expand areas, using plorts to open certain areas, even just telling the player they can open the slimepedia-- there just is not any instruction given or tutorial beyond the initial control. Even if you upgrade your character to have pulsewave or other abilities it does not even tell you what button activates them unless you check the controls. You really just have to guess and figure things out for yourself.  
- There is not really any objective or milestones. Other than ""unlock all the upgrades"" or ""expand all the areas"" or ""unlock all the plorts"" is just relatively idle. I would like if the game offered missions or had objectives for the player periodically. Ie bring X of these slimes to this NPC (and it gives you an upgrade) or upgrade a slimes corral to have high walls (and it gives you something else) etc.

there is no fucking communication at all. they dont tell us the updates and planned features untill its too late and they alr started development on it, so when the community is pissed and says ""we dont like this get rid of this fucking garbage feature"" they are too far in development to do that without wasting resources so they just go along with it.

I've been playing Slime Rancher 2 on and off since the release date on XBGP and finally decided to purchase it on Steam. This review will still be updated when I feel the need, but please keep this in mind.

I suppose another thing to note is I was unbelievably excited for the release of Slime Rancher 2. With the announcement trailer I bawled my eyes out because it's predecessor remains one of the main games I boot up when I need to relax and de-stress. I had to have watched the trailers a million times before we were finally given a release date that took place last year. I don't know why I waited so long to own it here alongside the former but I'm glad to finally add it to my collection. 

If the original Slime Rancher gives the calming feeling of coming home after a long day, then this sequel can only be considered the feeling of cuddling up with a warm blanket and diving into your favorite novel or watching your favorite movie; the feeling of sitting out on your front steps and watching the sunset at the end of the day; the feeling of stargazing with your best friend and dreaming of how big the world truly is. That is how this game feels to me. It is simply the feeling of peace. 

There is nothing to state here that couldn't be said about the former as well. The visuals are gorgeous, the colors are so vivid, the music is absolutely beautiful. If anything this game does the impossible and takes everything that makes Slime Rancher a wonderful game and vastly improves on it. It is an absolutely magical experience, even in early access.

Thank you to the team at Monomi Park. I cannot wait to see what the future still holds for the continuation and growth of Slime Rancher 2. It is a beautiful piece of media.",1694062295,1694062295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has familiar mechanics, items and characters - and a beautiful new landscape to explore.  I only encountered one bug during my 24 hours of play time - which was fixed by restarting the game. I've played £50 games with more bugs and less content than the early access of Slime Rancher 2! 

On the whole, I found the story (so far) just as charming and heartfelt as the original's. It's clear that this is a direct sequel to Slime Rancher 1 - so if you want to play 2, I'd advise you to play through 1 first. 

All in all, I bought Slime Rancher 2 only an hour after I got the email announcing it's release, and I do not regret it at all. Like it's predecessor, it is charming, beautiful and so wonderfully peaceful that it's an instant cure for my anxiety.

Personally, i'm not a fan of the pre-built habitation pod thing you spawn in. In the first game it felt less claustrophobic and idk - ""ranchy"" because you were in an open-air farm. Additionally, while this is marketed as a ""next-gen"" Slime Rancher experience, it generally feels the exact same with a fresh coat of paint. I'd have liked more freedom in customizing your ranch, like being able to place farms and buildings on my own.

The first point is that I often get Instant Kill while feeding Crystal Slime, or faint when I take multiple damage in a short period of time even if my health point is at least 75.
The second point and the third point are both Tarr related, when I quickly clear the Tarr or when I catch a glimpse of the Tarr for a split second the background music will change to Tarr's music and continue for the same amount of time, I think if the music can slowly disappear at the moment when the Tarr is cleared or I actively step away from the Tarr instead of waiting for a fixed period of time to disappear, in short, I hope to shorten the minimum duration of the music that encounters the Tarr a little bit or make several variations of the music that encounters the Tarr so that the game experience will not be too monotonous.
Last but not least, my newly purchased laptop would suddenly stall when defeating Tarr due to Tarr's death effect, although this may have something to do with my own computer configuration.

-Being able to receive letters from people in our personal lives again (I have not received one if it is in the game) 
-3rd person POV option (with such a beautiful character design, i'd love to see her!) 
-Further fleshed out story behind the planet itself

The controls feel a bit weird playing with a ps4 controller but I think they're ok. My favorite thing though that I'm able to do, is climb over mountains easily, makes it super fun and difficult which is something I like, being able to freely climb/jump to places. 

The slimes are also really adorable (even the original slimes from the first game), specifically my favorite is the tabby slime.

the short: ive cried like 6 times so far make of that what you will

actual review:
monomi park have upped their atmosphere game tenfold - and that's saying something, since SR1 was my comfort game. to start, the soundtrack is an absolute masterpiece: if anything in SR1 made you cry, expect to absolutely sob at the beauty of SR2. a wonderful balance of old, new and improved mechanics and slimes, all your old friends helping you out, and the promise of some REALLY interesting lore - the kind that keeps one hyped and speculating from the beginning. let me tell you, that unlock changed the game for me. brilliant way of implementing it.
also the map is massive? i feel like i've paid less than enough for the content so far, and more's still coming.

i upgraded my laptop between sessions of this game. even potato quality settings looked absolutely phenomenal (mildly more crashing, but still very pretty).
 
also, this is the most polished early-access game i've ever played or seen. idk what level of perfectionist the devs are on, but i've fallen through at MOST five walls, and they even made sure to put an invisible wall around the Secret Unfinished Spoiler Zone (i just had to. high place, climbing surfaces, you gotta.)

also, if the devs ever see this: thank you for the Ruins piano mix on the house menu radio. it brings me to tears every single time. the ruins, especially its opening puzzle area, have always been my favourite location and tracks in the first game, and i'm so glad to hear it's followed me here too.",1692993011,1692993011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I bought this day one early access release, as I loved playing the first edition of Slime Rancher. Unfortunately, the communication is absolutely horrible.

If you don't know already, Slime Rancher hasn't had a major update in over six months, and now we have a new post about what's to come next. Not an update, or at least a minor update to fix some bugs. My infuriation and many other fans of the game would have been at least more patient and happier if we got updates, or at the very least announcements on the progress of development, regardless of how long we have to wait.

I understand that Monomi Park is an indie game company that doesn't work off of crunch culture and fast development. However, it is inexcusable to be left dry in the dust as we receive no input or announcement, only to speculate what could come next.

To people reading this review, don't buy this game until it's fully completed or we finally have better communication. If you still want this game, buy it when it's on the 25% sale. Otherwise, just play Slime Rancher 1 if you haven't done so yet. To Monomi Park, I'm very worried for your future, especially on Slime Rancher 2. Please don't do this again, and I might consider changing my review.

The game is beautiful, the music equally so. The slimes are just as adorable as they were in the first game, and seeing some new kinds of slimes, is always nice. But the game feels, far too fast, compared to the first game. Slimes become hungry much faster than in the first, and plants and crops grow, much faster, when compared to the first. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem for some games, but for this kind of game, it is. A very, large, problem.

This game wants you to explore the islands, the new world, and that's fine. They're all beautiful and fascinating, and I loved every second of exploring it. But the problem boils down to the absolute lack of automation that also ends up killing the desire to explore at the same time. While in the first game, this automation was unlocked slowly with bee drones that help manage your ranch from selling or stocking plorts, or feeding and managing your slimes. This game, as far as I've seen so far, doesn't have that yet. Keyword, being yet. 

This lack of automation means that you have to remain around the ranch to make money to unlock more things that become a near necessity to explore, and you need to explore to unlock newer things. But you never have time to explore. One thing that made the first game so wonderfully pleasant was that the game was, intentionally slow. The ranch was slow, the world, was slow. Exploring and gathering resources with drills and pumps, was slow. Everything was slow, so you had plenty of time to explore the world in your own, steady, slow, pace. But this game moves far too fast to allow that. If you take time to explore, your ranch falls into chaos. If you take time to tend to your ranch, you make no progress due to a lack of exploration. Ultimately leading you to have hundreds of thousands of ""Dollars"" to work with, but nothing to ultimately spend it on.

I do love this game, and I do recommend it as an experience. But I must warn you, its incomplete, and as a tremendously avid fan of the first game, I desperately hope this game gets some adjustments to make it more similar to the first. With a recent update, my save file randomly deleted itself, so I'm now going through the game a second time to explore it all again and my review may change. But for right now, I can only give this game an approximate 7/10. It's a great game, but its just not as good as the first yet.",1692913856,1692913856,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

I have nearly 10 hours of playtime and I've explored nearly all of the mainland (save for some hidden areas I may have missed), done all of the Gordos and with the exception of the recently released powderfall bluffs, gotten all the slimes, plorts and most of the capsules. I never looked up a guide so that should explain how that 10 hours is 10 hours well spent and not blown out of proportions. I enjoyed all of the things I did and was able to optimize my slime farms with largos and proper food sources and generally, had a great time. 
TL:DR, game is good, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one.

However nothing is perfect and I am a firm believer of this. the game is in early access so this is more feedback than criticism, but it has some issues. Definitely on the smaller side all things considered however. The current size of the ranch is way too small for the scope of the game. We only have access to half of the slimes right now and even with optimized slimes, you use up nearly 3/4ths of the ranch on slimes and their food sources alone, not including excess plot things like silos and duplicate slime plots (for more plorts). I imagine/hope the hub will be expanded in the future. The crafting system is cool but also a bit hard to work with due to several factors:
-no tracking of resources for specific recipes (IE 5/20 fire plorts) while out and about
-RNG factors for some resources like honey (which is a very crucial resource) makes some recipes very hard to craft
-by the time you can easily gather said resources, the upgrade is no longer needed

also, the new system of crafting tech and decor that can be placed out in the world seems very poorly thought out. Take the hydro cannon for example. The crafting cost for it is too great for its usefulness, and there is no reasonable place to use it. Where do you need it? The obvious answer might be the ranch but Tarr doesn't spawn there (unless you mistakenly put the wrong plorts in the wrong pen) so you're supposed to put it out in the world somewhere, but where? you have a hydro cannon strapped to your vacc-pack so why would you need to place and automatic turret anywhere? theres no reason for its existence. 
And unless I missed the capsule for this, a set of 2-way portals of a certain color would be a great idea imo. like 2 purple portals, you can set one in the ranch and one in the powderfall bluffs.

This brings me to my next issue, teleporters. I like the concept of the final gordo in a zone giving you access to a portal that makes travel to the region much faster, however WHY would you need to travel back there after 'beating' the final gordo? by then, most efficient players would already have all the slimes and farmable plants/animals in the region, thus making returning to the region pointless. Maybe I am in the upper percentile of players with optimizing (LOL) but I find it hard to believe some players are rejoicing at the idea of faster travel AFTER they've completed an area. its redundant.

Powderfall bluffs on that note is a huge pain to get to. Not only is the area super hard to find (too hard if you ask me) but it also is a LONG trek to get to from your ranch. (spoilers for where its hidden) [spoiler] even with the convinience of the fire zone teleporter, you still have to walk all the way to the crystal gordo spot, jump into the falls, walk through the cave, teleport (load zone), walk through another cave and then finally you're in the new zone. [/spoiler] The first time I went there, I saw some material caches on the side of a cliff with some stagnant air waves next to it (visual glitch I presume), so I jumped on these air waves thinking they were solid considering there was no other reasonable way to reach said materials and promptly fell and died. I considered how long it would take to get back, and considered turning off the game and I chose the latter. I did not do it out of rage, I was merely satisfied with my experience and didn't feel like it was worth running back to the new zone just for an hour or so more play time.

In the end, I still love this game. I patiently look forward to the full release and will most likely start a new playthrough at that time, and even then, what we have now is a fun little game. I wish everyone at Monomi park a good development cycle and hope that you all take the time to deliver what you want to deliver 

For anyone else reading this, I would say thanks for reading and I would strongly recommend this game if you enjoyed the first one. It is pretty much more of the same, but the first game was great fun so more of the same is good.",1692670554,1692670554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

SR2 was created after some issues with how SR1's foundation didn't allow reasonable scaling beyond where it was and into the new goals they had.

Now that the background is out of the way - lets look at what we got as a result of that:
- we started with 1 additional biome and a few extra slimes over where sr1's early access started. With similar development time before the launch of early access. We got to keep slime science and we were loaded with more slimes immediately which is something.
- after about 11ish month now of development, we are at a point where sr1 in early access, with a smaller team, had 2 additional small side area expansions for biomes over where sr2 currently is. less slimes however.
- Limited actual communication as to what to expect since last november, and no significant update since febuary

Steam does lend itself to verify the game is still being developed, but that's the only reason i haven't really jumped on the board of 'its abandoned'. When your only source of information as to what to come is a third party in this relationship, and that's the only source there's been for months... you've got yourself issues. You'd think even with a no crunch environment we would see more progress in the updates, or at least communication on the progress, with a bigger team than a smaller one. Yet so far the smaller team they had back in early sr1 days is what i'd actually say wins out a bit... 

I might change my recommendation status if we see an actual improvement in the communication, but to go from what they used to be in sr1 to what they are now, just raises too many red flags for me to recommend spending more money on sr2 than sr1 was...",1692570251,1692570251,False,7,0,0.507220208644866943,0,True,False,True

It was announced recently that  there is a Slime Rancher movie in the works.

I think it would be fair to say that they're heavily involved in this film venture, which would take away some of the staff's time from working on the game.

These developers simply don't have their priorities in order. They release this game in early access, but would rather focus on other things than finishing it.

I stand by my earlier statement. It's very unlikely that they're going to finish the development of this game.

**END OF EDIT**

**EDIT 8/8**

Yesterday, Monomi Park posted a road map on their site for what to expect of the full release. The road map is incredibly bare bones, only providing vague insights without any sort of time table, and doesn't tell us anything that we didn't already know almost a year ago.

I predict that there is severe issues going on with the company and wouldn't be surprised if we never see the full release.

**END OF EDIT**

It's been nearly a year since the early access launched and there's only a single (small) content update in that time. And what's here isn't exactly that good either. This game is merely a rehash of the first one without doing anything to really separate itself from it's predecessor and improve on what came before. 

There's way too little content here to justify the price tag. What's here can be played through in a few hours. Definitely not worth $30.

Lack of content would be fine if we had some kind of assurance that it will receive regular updates. Except, as said before, there's been only a single update since launch and it barely added anything.

The devs are keeping silent on anything regarding future content. There's been no progress updates, teasers, anything that would actually give their customers assurance that content is coming. Instead, whenever a developer responds in the forums, they can only provide vague statements and make excuses that 'it's hard to manage a growing team, and we're going to keep growing'.

Right now, there's no reason to buy this game. There's nothing here that you couldn't get out of the first game. People buy games in early access because they expect the game to actually continue being developed.

overall the gameplay loop of SR2 is a lot similar to SR1, but featuring a few new upgrades, some different flora and fauna, and of course the stars of the show- a whole new world full of new slimes. if SR1 was fun for you and you wanted more from it, then SR2 is definitely a good choice.

of course if you've never played slime rancher 1 and want to know if you can jump straight to this game- yes, it's fine to just hop right into SR2 (thought at time of writing this review i'd still recommend SR1 first, considering it's a full and finished game and SR2 is not).

overall, the gameplay loop involves exploring new areas, capturing slimes, building up your ranch with agriculture (for food) and slime pens to farm plorts (for money and upgrades), collecting natural resources (for upgrades), and passing obstacles to progression in the form of giant slimes that need to be fed until they burst and gates that can only be opened by a specific type of plort, as well as just generally having to explore an area to find the way through to more new stuff.

in general both slime rancher games are best suited to people who:
- enjoy resource collection/management and ranching slimes via optimizing those resources and manually ferrying food to the slime pens when needed
- exploring around an open, interconnected world via simple key/door puzzles and gated progression in the form of what are essentially resource type/amount checks
- enjoy management and simulation aspects of games more than combat and exploration (although the latter 2 are still present to a degree)

tl;dr: worth the price even in its early stage, but i hope to see more worlds and slimes of the game soon, as  right now SR2 can barely crack 10 hours of gameplay before you run out of new places to go and new things to find. if you're interested in the series then SR1 is a better starting place, but if you already played that and want to know if the sequel is worth the trouble, i'd say it is.",1691905412,1691905572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Of course, the graphics have become much better, the animations have become more beautiful and the slimes have become even more realistic.

Specifically the GPU. There is an area of the game called Starlight Strand, which when you enter this area, your game will crash if the GPU does not meet the requirements.

To make things very clear: just because you can play the first game DOES NOT mean you can play this one!!

Furthermore, if you do encounter this problem, you'd better hope it doesn't take you longer than 2 hours to get to this point of the game, or else you will not receive a refund from Steam (even if you request a refund the very same day you purchased it).

If you are somewhat tech illiterate (like me) I would recommend reading through the support and discussion pages on Steam before purchasing the game. You'll find instructions on how to check to make sure your computer meets the requirements and you won't be out however much money (I got it on sale, so thankfully didn't pay full price) you would have spent on the game, not knowing your computer can't actually play that one specific area. 

I wish I could recommend the game because it's a cute sequel to a game I greatly enjoy. Unfortunately I couldn't progress enough to rec it.

I like this game. But it has its fair share of flaws. I do recommend this game, but I feel that it has a while to go before it reaches the height of its predecessor (which is self-explanatory for an early access game but it's more than just that)


Also, slight spoiler warning. Nothing major, but I feel comfortable saying I've seen most of what this game has to offer, so there might be things I talk about that a new player might not want to know. There are also a few things about the first game I mention here, so keep that in mind. But I've tried to keep most of the larger things about this game in particular secret.


The graphics and presentation are stunning, but I switched away from default settings quite a while ago and never looked back. They're very resource intensive and they kind of make the game an eyesore to play with how overwhelming they are. If you tone it down, it looks, feels, and plays a lot better.

There a few quality of life changes I appreciated, such as the removal of any grinding necessary for Slime Science or Treasure Pods - they're all there from the start. Granted, the upgrades do require you to get slime science resources now (and regular gadgets also require you to spend money), and while I found it to not be that big of an issue while playing, I do have to wonder how sane some of those requirements were. It definitely makes it hard for me to want to get some of the later upgrades, but it's hard to complain when the jetpack is basically the exact direction I want them to take the core gameplay loop in, (at least for a larger part of the game) and the extra tank and tank guard upgrades, which while something I didn't really want when I played the first game, are honestly great additions that help to cut down some of the tedium (even if I've never died, so I've never been able to use the Tank Guard, but it seems like a nice addition)
Some people have complained about the general lack of money sinks like the 7Zee Rewards Club, which is an opinion I don't particularly agree with, but if you liked the padding, then get ready to coat the entire map in decorations, because you've got to make it longer yourself this time around. Not a problem for me, though.

The environment and map design is better than it's ever been, with incredible detail and quite a few secrets that's an absolute joy to experience for the first time. Granted, the places aren't as memorable to me as SR1's personally, but I think the reason for that is that I haven't etched all the crevices, valleys , rivers, and caves into my brain yet. The jogs that you have to take to get to your ranch expansions do get pretty annoying, though. The main area you ranch in is also pretty sprawling, which isn't a problem to me, but something tells me it's because of the way I played this game, so I'd have to take a look at everything later, if/when I play the game the way that you're ""supposed to"". At the very least, that's a potential flaw you can bypass. Which is nice.

I've seen people raise complaints about the game's length, which - fair enough, the game is quite short in its current state but the game has also fairly recently been released in early access, so I don't think it'll be a problem for too long. 

The new slime designs, while cute and usually at least mechanically unique, are probably my biggest gripe with this game overall. Practically all of them are just based on animals, and while they don't stick out abysmally, many of the game's much more inventive areas feel like they would have slimes far more interesting than what we got. To me, it seems like the game keeps banking on returning old favorites instead of building its own diverse, new ecosystems of slimes for its unique areas. It might make some sense for the game's dreamlike aesthetic, but for me that's no excuse. Of course, this game is too much of a whimsical, fun, fantastical adventure to not have animal slimes, but I feel they really should've taken more time to make more unique slimes so that the roster could've had more diversity. Although, while they're still animals, I do at least enjoy how the [spoiler]Angler[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Flutter[/spoiler] slimes look. One of the slimes they introduced in the new update does feel like a step in the right direction, too, even if I'm not really a fan of it personally.

The area introduced in the new update was really cool, and I'm in love with the aesthetic, but it's a little on the small side and the slimes found there just don't really fit all that well. Some of the new designs weren't a perfect fit for their environment anyways, and the first game didn't exactly knock it out of the park on that front either, but reintroducing an old slime and giving it a new gimmick, while not bad, really needs some new, interesting, more unique slimes to go along with it. Here's hoping they give the place some more revisions and improvements later..

Since it's also important to note here, you can modify some of the ways the game works, and I absolutely love this. It's probably one of my favorite parts about this game. I played the game with Tarrs turned off, Ferals on, and an increased damage modifier. The fact that the game lets you play Tarr-less without sacrificing the aggressiveness of the Ferals is already an incredibly great decision, but allowing you to bump up or even turn down the amount of damage you get is even sweeter, and it makes going through Feral-inhabited areas without health and energy upgrades a risk to your own life if you increase difficulty. Going Tarr-less also means you can put a bunch of different largo types on your ranch to roam free and watch different types of slimes hanging out, replacing the mundane busywork of feeding corrals and harvesting plort collectors with a nice, chill walk through your lively ranch, surrounded by gelatinous friends. If you find regular ranching to be tedious, I highly suggest you play the game like this. It's just great stuff, something the first game is now slightly lacking in comparison, and something I don't see enough people talking about. The only thing that I think could make it better is if you had the option to give every slime one of the Hunter's signature traits and make any largo go feral after long enough, to help make the game a just a bit more tough, if you wanted to.


It's good, I might even call it great, or maybe something more, but it's still in Early Access and it's got quite a few flaws and bizarre, unnecessary changes, even if quite minor ones. (It's also not particularly revolutionary which isn't a problem to me but you know) I'd consider it an improvement, but it needs more time in the development oven first. Still, if you have 30 bucks to spare, and you're fine with Early Access games and sequels that are quite similar to their predecessors, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1664095235,1690573710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It was one of the few games that i would play for a very long time, mainly because it was overall pretty peaceful and didn't require a lot of linear progress. You can go at your own pace and unlock things in different orders. It definitely wasn't a high paced nor a high action game, but it always did a great job at taking my mind of things. It quickly became the game that I tend to play when life becomes stressful. 
Slime Rancher 2 has been all of that, and more. The graphics are gorgeous! It's more colorful then the first one. It feels like there are a bit less slimes then the first one, however I haven't counted, and of course the game isn't finished yet. The new slimes are absolutely adorable. I loved them putting a refinerary link out in the map for us, it definetly helped remind me that I could do that while exploring. The ranch and certain spots on the map have 10x more details. I'm not super fond of the large amount of tunnels/paths that lead nowhere, mainly located in the lab underneath our house, but they do look very pretty. As far as I know there's no rewards club or slime toys in this version. I would like the slime toys, simply because it made me feel a bit better about locking them in a small square. The water turret, that I most definitely didn't use, are infidelity more useful for this game. I found the large slimes escaping a lot when I would be off exploring and not being there to feed them. I'm not completely done exploring the world, but I'm happy to know the slime statues being in use way more in Slime Rancher 2. 
Overall the game has been great. There are still multiple ways to get into areas, and some ways to get around unlocking doors. There are still the little pods for gadgets and decorations. Most of the utilities have been gotten form the characters we call so far. We still get to communicate with Mochi and Bob and everyone, however trading isn't available. I would most likely rate the game a 9/10 in the cozy game category. It only being a nine because as I mentioned it feels like there are less types of slimes so far. It is definitely worth the money if you enjoyed Slime Rancher or are just looking for a chill calming game to play.",1690428413,1690428413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Alright, I have written a review of this game before however my opinion has changed.
In my old review I recommended this game, however almost a year later I have changed my mind. This game was something I had been waiting for, for ages maybe a few years I don’t remember when I found out. As soon as it came out I bought it, but was disappointed to say the least. 
Here are my reasons why you may or may not want the game: 
Pros:
- The graphics are beautiful and defiantly an upgrade from the last game, I spent ages just admiring the scenery and graphics. 
- The adventuring feels like the best parts of the first game combined into one game, its fun to have to solve puzzles to get to the next stage in the game it also adds more hours to play.
- You do not need to play the first game to enjoy this, the story does continue but it’s not that connected. 

Cons:
- Its small, there is not a lot of content and while I can play slime rancher 1 for hours over and over, it just lacks charm in this one. There are not a lot of different biomes like the first, it feels like your getting lost in a maze that looks pretty much the same all over. 
- The game does have some glitches (to be expected in early access and a lot have been fixed.)
- Where is the new content? Perhaps I had been in the wrong to be under the assumption that there would be new slimes quite new on, that was what I heard and maybe that was just a rumour, however not much has been added almost a year later which is disappointing. 

Summary:
I enjoy this game, Slime Rancher will always hold a special place in my heart however the sequel just wasn’t the satisfying the urge to get new content for Slime Rancher 2. Like I said before this feels more like a new map with a few unique slimes rather then a sequel. I do not recommend spending money on this game until there is more content.
I defiantly do not regret spending money on this game and I’m sure there is much more content to await however I’m just disappointed I have yet to see anything.
Perhaps I am comparing this too much to the past game but that was just what I have experienced throughout my game play.

I think that this game is absolutely a masterpiece but as most early access games, just not a lot of content at the moment to make it worth the price, if you are coming back as somebody who played the first game I do recommend this to you, but not those who want a NEW game, I would recommend you to play the first one instead.",1664266295,1690289010,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

> Tanuki Slimes.
> Really cute relaxing Game. 
> Story is very cute.
> There is a LOT of content, if you spread out your playtime.

Cons: 
> If you don't spread out your playtime, then you can finish all content in around 18-20 hours.
> Like any other farming game, feeding/collecting slimes can be extremely repetitive.
> No multiplayer. (I do think there is a way to incorporate it, which would add a aspect to the game that would be way more enjoyable.)

Overall:
> When you play this game for the first time it will be EXTREMELY fun and comforting.

When I heard that Slime Rancher 2 came out, I was BEYOND excited for the second one. Despite it being in early access, I am in love with this game. Maybe it's because I'm biased from the first, but this easily makes it in my top ten favorite games. I'm so excited for the full release, and I'm hoping that there's gonna be more interactions with other NPCs like Ogden or Viktor later in the story (I haven't progressed too much in the actual story because I keep getting distracted by the BEAUTIFUL aesthetics), or maybe even introduce new NPCs entirely. The only problem I have with this game is that it runs pretty slowly sometimes, if that makes sense. I guess saying it can be laggy is a better description. I had this problem with the first one on my laptop, Xbox, and on my switch as well, but it's not to the point that it's unplayable, it's only ever now and again. I still would recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing and peaceful game.",1689455071,1689455071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- The falling in water being a “death” thing is pretty rough and made me not want to explore things. Looked away from my screen for a minute and lost 40min of resources.
- Having to walk back and forth all the time is pretty annoying. I want to go explore new areas but needing top back and feed slimes was a bit exhausting. Some means of knowing the status of the slime back home might allow for longer journeys with confidence. 
- does the base need to be soo huge and spread out? 
- story wise I had no idea what was going on, I did not play the previous game but feel I need more information on who these characters are and what happened in the previous games.
- the map is helpful but it would be nice if I could mark locked doors, nodes ext. 
- I pretty quickly ended up with heaps of money and nothing to do with it. Even after unlocking all of the areas.Not really motivated to make more corrals because that’d have led to more work and less exploration. 

Suggestions

- optional extended intro for those who haven't played game 1, or at least a written account that is readable by the player.
- a character guide 
- a corral /pen upgrade to freeze everything, this way if we want to focus on exploration we can just shut down the ranch for a bit 
- cheaper warps and more of them, maybe a 2 way warp
- free warp points in the ranch",1689452720,1689452720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My viewpoint will mostly be comparing SR2 to SR1. SR2 feels like it's having a bit of an identity crisis, struggling to distinguish itself from SR1. 90% of the game is basically the same, with the exception of a few new slimes to collect (and some missing as of right now), a new map and a change to how resources are collected. 

The gameplay is largely the same, so if you're coming  from SR1 and hoping for some larger improvements or changes, this game isn't for you. It's heavily leaning on exploration and the busywork of slime farming. There is even less of a story than SR1 (which was one of the motivating factors for me in playing SR1). SR2's story is told in the same way with notes scattered around the world, but each note feels far less impactful and more like meaningless drivel in a lot of cases.

I could go on, but the point I'm trying to get across should be clear at this point. I've already had enough of SR1 and SR2 doesn't offer enough for me me to want to invest my time in it. People interested in SR2 but haven't played SR1 I think should just go buy SR1.

1) This game is extremely tedious early on. There is too much redundant running due to limited inventory space (you have 4 slots starting). Early game teleporters are in limited supply and one-way back to base only... reducing your running around by only a fraction when you consider that there is so much more to explore. If you want to re-place a teleporter, you have to completely destroy it and make a new one so have fun RUNNING around in search for the resources again. Sucks if you accidentally put it in an un-ideal place.

2) Caring for slimes imprisoned on your ranch is also SUPER tedious. Automation tools required. Micromanaging crops, feeding, gathering, and selling plorts gets old real fast. Unfortunately, if you want to make any money at a decent rate, you have to go through this process. Money is required for pretty much all upgrades, so you desperately need it.

3) There is no clear objective system as far as the story and unlocking new areas goes. I had to google whether I was missing something or if the other areas of the map just were not available yet. If you still feel like playing at this point, I recommend waiting till the full version is out.

4) Last minor observation is how the game makes all these optional craftable decorations available to you. When resources are a pain to gather, it is smarter to prioritize the upgrades that allow you to travel efficiently and expand your inventory. Who is actually creating decorative rocks and grass in the first few hours of gameplay? If it was not for the fact that the hidden chests around the map sometimes hold critical upgrade components, I would not bother opening them. Also, have fun wondering whether the chests you missed have something useful in them. You will probably be referring to the internet to make sure you did not leave something good behind.",1688789213,1689116610,False,2,0,0.528741598129272461,0,True,False,True

Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for her. I remember seeing her playing it from time to time, the message indicating that she'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that she was enjoying my gift.
Last September she committed suicide.

After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up her computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Slime Rancher
She had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. She had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of loot. It was only then did I see just how much she loved my present. No other game she played quite captured her affection as much as this one. None of her friends really knew about it, however; it seems like she preferred to keep it to herself. Like it was her own little bit of heaven she could turn to whenever she wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (I'll often find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours.",1689022623,1689022623,True,357,17,0.866163432598114014,0,True,False,True

In more detail, the game is constructed in a creative way, bringing colour (and cute slimes) into different locations: The Conservatory, Rainbow Fields, Starlight Strand, Ember Valley and Powderfall Bluffs. Each section has it's own unique properties. 

The Conservatory is home base, and where the money is made. I love the giant tree growing in the middle! The Rainbow Fields is the first colourful landscape that lies in front of the Conservatory, the start of our adventure and gateway to other locations. The new Cotton Slimes hop around, in search of vegetables to chomp down on (and merging with Pink Slimes to my great annoyance while gaining food and resources). 
Starlight Strand is my favourite part of Rainbow Island, displaying a bi-coloured pink and blue map that holds colourful flora, cave networks, ancient ruin and, uniquely native to the Strand, Flutter Slimes. 
Ember Valley is next, bringing in warm orange and cool blue/violet tones with a Jurassic landscape. Batty Slimes are a more common occurrence in the Valley, and we get to see our old Fire Slime friends too! Powderfall Bluffs was added in the recent update. I have taken a great liking to any map involving a winter landscape filled with snow and ice. Powderfall does not disappoint. It hosts a stunning snowy landscape, complete with a large mountain, prehistoric plant life surrounding hot springs and a few secret spots. How can I forget the Saber Slimes, that have made a comeback?

The mechanics are similar to the first game, so starting business at the Conservatory was easy. I do like the new mechanic of physically collecting resources, it adds another layer of farming and exploration. Also the fact that the Fabricator is right under the Conservatory is convenient. Gordo popping is always a blast! I love the new selection of our giant pals, and I'll admit finding a few of them had me stumped. 

Game play is incredibly smooth for Early Access, any bugs I've come across have been minor (such as hens stuck in walls). Exploring is made easy, with the keenest ranchers being able to get to the highest peaks in the map with sheer will and a jet-pack. 

Sound design in general is good, enough to immerse me in the wiggly adventure. Oh, and everyone loves our bouncing little pals peeps and squeaks!

Next, the soundtrack is my main motivator, filled with emotional pieces from Harry Mack, probably one of the best composers I listen to. Seriously, the Ember Valley and Starlight Strand tracks are so cheery! I love the range of the soundtrack too. Like the first game, Harry composed several pieces for each biome, depending on the time (Day, Night, Late Night), and adding his own, Serene and Dreaming. These pieces all follow the leitmotif of the respective day theme, but with noticeable differences, such as pace and selection of instruments. 

Story wise, it seems unfinished at the time of my playthrough, which is understandable in Early Access. I'm excited to see how the story evolves in the final release!

I 100% recommend buying this for a peaceful and colourful adventure on Rainbow Island. I find myself completely immersed in any task, admiring the different landscapes and beautifully constructed soundtrack.

You'd think if someone made a sequel there would be something to set it apart from its predecessor but SR2 has the exact same gameplay, the only thing that is different is that now everything is harder to tell apart because nearly every surface is the same color. I had to tone down a lot of the settings - especially the chromatic aberration at the edges - because I had a hard time telling what was what. I get that they wanted to make a colorful game - they did succeed in that - but when everything is colorful, nothing is. It just makes stuff hard to look at, and this came apparent after a couple hours of continuous gameplay.

Another new thing is of course a few new types of slimes but... This game is suffering of all the same tedious things as the first game; namely the limited inventory and having to go back and forth the same goddamn routes. Arguably probably even worse this time because you have to harvest materials by hand instead of automating it. By 5 hours into the game I would have wanted to get something a little... ""more"", little something new that would set it apart, something that would warrant it being a game of its own and not just a coat of rainbow paint. Something that would make my life as a Slime Rancher a bit easier - some new gadgets or tools or something. As a player I would like to feel that the devs respect my time, but that wasn't the case here. Equally the world felt stagnant - I was growing increasingly frustrated when all the NPCs I heard of were the same ones from the original game. Could've at least introduced a couple new faces to make things more interesting?

Oh, and I think this game poorly on-boards the player. Having played the original SR I knew what I was supposed to do and how things function (especially because everything is pretty much identical to the original). But the player is just dropped in with minimal info about what to do. Speaking of, I found myself wanting a little more in-depth descriptions for the entries in Slimepedia than just a couple words (usually nothing but a pun).

Some performance issues are present as well, the framerate drops near the teleports and whenever blasting Tarrs with water.

I dunno. I loved the original SR but this sequel isn't different enough to be interesting. It will have to get some radical changes later in the development if it wants to grab my attention better.

This early access sequel offers a unique and calming experience centered around collecting slimes.

From the moment I started playing Slime Rancher 2, I was immediately drawn into its enchanting world. The game provided the perfect escape from the stresses of daily life, allowing me to immerse myself in a peaceful and delightful adventure. The simple act of collecting slimes and tending to my ranch became a source of relaxation and joy.

The visuals in Slime Rancher 2 are visually pleasing, with vibrant colors and charming environments that make exploring the game world a pleasure. Each area I visited was filled with its own distinct beauty, from lush green pastures to mysterious and otherworldly landscapes. It was a treat for the eyes and added to the overall serenity of the experience.

One of the aspects that stood out to me was the variety of slimes I encountered throughout my journey. Each slime I encountered was unique, making them a joy to observe and interact with. From mischievous troublemakers to adorable and friendly creatures, the slimes added a sense of wonder and discovery to the game.

While I can't compare Slime Rancher 2 to its predecessor, I found the gameplay loop of exploration, resource collection, and slime management to be incredibly satisfying. The game struck the perfect balance between simplicity and depth, allowing me to easily grasp the mechanics while still providing enough depth to keep me engaged. It was a pleasure to experiment with different slime combinations and witness the results.

Although Slime Rancher 2 is still in its early access stage, I was impressed by its polished gameplay and overall stability. The developers have created a tranquil and enjoyable experience that offers a welcome break from the intensity of other games on the market. However, I do hope to see the addition of features like NPCs and multiplayer options in future updates to further enrich the world and allow for shared experiences with friends.

In conclusion, Slime Rancher 2 provided me with a serene and delightful journey into the world of slime collecting. I found it to be an accessible and enjoyable experience that offered a much-needed break from the demands of everyday life. The captivating visuals, charming slimes, and relaxing gameplay loop make Slime Rancher 2 a worthwhile adventure for anyone seeking a peaceful and engaging gaming experience.",1676193651,1688776831,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The game itself lacks quality of life features and a break from the grinding the first desperately needed, and instead focuses mainly on exploring new environments you can hardly interact with.

Materials are now found around the map, instead of using drills. I'm personally not too bothered about this, as it adds more of a reason to run around the map to gather them, although it is time consuming if you don't know where to find them.

Upgrades take a lot longer to get too, as you now need plorts and other materials to make them, including coins. (im not too sure if the first game required it too, it's been like 4 years lol.)

New areas are unlocked with teleporters now, usually having a gordo slime covering it. instead of using slime keys

Pros: [b]#1.[/b] I haven't found any yet.

Cons: [b]#1.[/b] No fast travel system.
[b]#2.[/b] Terrible inventory system. You can only carry 4 types of items and nothing more... so your inventory can be full after carrying just 4 single items. It's the stupidest inventory mechanic possible.
[b]#3.[/b] Loot that's on the ground disappears after some time has passed.
[b]#4.[/b] Carried loot disappears when you die. That's massively punishing. And believe me, with this terrible inventory system, you're going to be leaving A LOT of loot on the ground, so this is a big problem.
[b]#5.[/b] No tutorial to speak of. Almost nothing is explained at all.
[b]#6.[/b] Runs very poorly. I get less frames per sec in this game on medium, than I do on high in Cyberpunk 2077.
[b]#7.[/b] The regional pricing is really bad and the game is heavily over-priced in many countries
[b]#8.[/b] The game is for sale in russia

I can't come even close to recommending this game. Rather play something like Dinkumm Stardew Valley, My Time at, etc. This game COULD have been playable, but #1, 2, 3 & 4 just make it the most asinine experience you could possibly imagine, instead of being a fun and casual farming sim.

I love just roaming the map and collecting. However, as with all early access games it doesn't feel complete. The areas for exploration and slime designs are amazing, but the actual ranching feels monotonous. It feels like no matter what slime you get the solution for ranching them is to largo them with something relatively docile and easy to feed like honey, bat, cotton, etc... A great example of this are the flutter slimes. They eat only a nectar that you can't farm, but provide a calming aura when they eat, however as the player this creates heavily incentives to just largo it and forget because you can't get a steady food source for them. On top of this, despite the slimepedia suggesting to let the slimes roam around your ranch there isn't really any way to let them do so. If you were able to restict slimes to an area of your ranch, make flutter slimes unlargoable and make limmited of their food source, like an upgrade to a pen to add the flower to make use of the aura, they would be the unique tool there design has potential for. But, for now they, like many other slimes, are amazing in the wild and lose most, or all their character when they come back to the ranch.",1688250869,1688250869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I believe the game should have more ways to use your money, with sr1 (slime rancher 1) you'd of course unlock the different areas which is how the second game approaches this, but you had the upgrade system for your ranch (i don't remember it specific name). But with this addition you can only spend your money on upgrades for your tools, but due to how easy it is to get these materials now as they are scattered everywhere as well as how they replenish every few days, youd expect the cost of them to be higher to account for this but it doesnt. (Though maybe my levels arent high enough)

I also believe that either how easy the jetpack is to obtain, or how strong it is makes upgrading it seems a bit void, as after one upgrade i can reach anywhere as without it your soft locked. And i think it takes away the feeling of explorartin a touch to me. 

This may be nit picky but i believe that some tunnels are less helpful than others, and felt almost useless to unlock. Though i would say the burts of water that would push you upwards, especially from one of the gordo slims felt very rewarding.

This may be because of the size of the game, which is a feat and i cant thank enough as some sections felt incredibly rewarding to explore, this being pointed specifically towards the first gordo slime. But i do feel like ive had to use my map so much more in this, it may be the obvious of again its size, or i haven't gotten used to it but i feel like the environments arent specific enough or varied enough, as in my opinion in the first game each area felt so difference if i picked a random screen shot i could tell you where in the game i was from its colour, tone and fauna.Yet i feel many areas blend together almost as two areas stand out the most to me.

One thing i wouldve liked is more reasons for the pond area, as from my point in the game it can only be used for puddle slimes at the moment, and id assume if it was anything like the first game the incinerator would follow the same trend.

Though these are all my opinions i want to say the adding of the tanuki slime has been one of the most funnest moments within all of my play time and with slime rancher 1, One thing i can endlessly praise the game for is how blind i am to it, exploring and learning the mechnics have been amazing and i cant thank the team enough.

Game is colorful, very entertaining, kid friendly - shooting water is your ""weapon"" - and simply, just a good time. You can capture a multitude of different slimes which you then need to build a housing structure (cage, but a nice one) to house the lil critters. You then need to supply it with food, typically meat in the form of chickens, vegetables or fruit. You can craft chicken pens to raise your own, you can build farms to grow your own fruit/vegetables. 

Once you have housing and food for your new slimy friends, you then feed the lil boogers. Once they eat, they create a ""plort"" which has multiple uses. One, it makes money. Two, you need certain plorts for crafting different tools/gadgets. Lastly, you can use plorts to combine slime species. For example, the most basic slime is a pink slime. They have the most forgiving diet, they eat anything. Some slimes, like the Flutter Slime, will only eat dew, which is difficult to find and you cannot farm/grow it. So, to make keeping Flutter slimes easier on yourself, you would feed the Flutter slime a plort from the pink slime. It then has the attributes of both slimes. They combine their diets, so the Flutter slime can now eat anything and they combine their appearance, in this instance it would turn into a pink largo(generic name of combined slime species) with butterfly features. 

All in all, the game is very entertaining, easy to play and if you have a young one who is interested in some gaming, this title is certainly one you could play with your kiddo at any age level.

The game so far is still in early access making it difficult to say there are no issues, but issues I have with this game are completely overshadowed by the trust I have in this company and the potential for the game as a whole!

Little suggestion: with such a different landmass which may be difficult to navigate, perhaps consider implementing a mini map which players can choose to display- perhaps craft on their own- so as to avoid the frustration with retracing and getting lost.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

As a dedicated fan of the original, I can confidently say that this sequel captures everything I loved about the first game and expands upon it in exciting and innovative ways.

One of the standout features of Slime Rancher 2 is the charming and vibrant world it presents. The visuals are absolutely stunning, with vivid colors and beautiful landscapes that make exploring the Far, Far Range a delightful experience. The attention to detail is remarkable, and each area feels distinct and alive, teeming with unique flora and fauna.

The core game-play loop of slime ranching remains as addictive as ever. As a player, you'll find yourself venturing out into the wild to capture and collect adorable slimes, each with their own characteristics and quirks. Managing your slime ranch, constructing new facilities, and taking care of the slimes' needs is a satisfying and rewarding experience. The addition of new types of slimes and resources adds depth to the game-play, ensuring that there's always something new to discover and experiment with.

One of the most significant improvements in Slime Rancher 2 is the expanded world and increased interactivity. The addition of new areas to explore, such as dense forests and mysterious underground caves, adds a sense of wonder and adventure to the game. The expanded range of activities and tasks available keeps the game-play fresh and engaging, offering more opportunities for creativity and exploration.

The game's progression system is well-paced, striking a perfect balance between providing new challenges and allowing players to explore at their own pace. The introduction of new gadgets and upgrades allows for greater customization and enhances the game-play experience. The well-designed tutorial ensures that both newcomers and returning players can jump right into the action, while still offering enough depth to satisfy experienced slime ranchers.

Beyond the engaging game-play and stunning visuals, Slime Rancher 2 boasts a delightful soundtrack that complements the whimsical atmosphere of the game. The sound design is top-notch, with charming sound effects that bring the slimes and the world around them to life.

Furthermore, the developers have shown great dedication to the community, actively listening to feedback and implementing improvements and updates.

I decided to actually get the game as a friend of mine had slime rancher and was planning to purchase slime rancher 2. I was understandly disppointed with the amount of content I got for 30$. Of course it's still in early access which forgives it somewhat, but honestly, first problem is that you gain coins really fast, and it quickly becomes more of a hassle to go around collecting slime plorts(which takes quite a bit in it's own right), coins have limited uses for the amount you can gain. The lack of challage of any sort is pretty annoying, finding new things can be fun, though the biggest obstacle was falling into the slime sea, the slimes are rarely anywhere near as deadly(Even in the ranch most slimes are easy to care for, especially with too many reasources), In the end. The game is lacking much challage and gets boring rather quickly, at the moment of this review it's not worth it's high price tag but, that may change in the future.",1687302923,1687302923,False,0,0,0.345425903797149658,0,True,False,True

I feel like there are some things that can be added as QoL additions like a system to automatically transport materials to storage units. I wish exploring could be a bit more faster- energy cool downs are so slow-  also movement is very stale dynamic movement could help (like pulse wave could have an upgrade where you'd aim it at a wall or at the floor to blast yourself away like a rocket jump). Hostile slimes are pretty lackluster especially tarr slimes(maybe they could also produce some resource of some sort when defeated) Also why is gadget placement so strict I feel it could be a little more relaxed.

I would love to start with a big problem; The game is only available for PC.
Why is there no PS version, SL1 was on PS so it's only logical that SL2 should be available on consoles as well.
Also you should add party gordos every friday back.

P.S. Imagine how wonderful our world be if we had SL2 for consoles (PS5) or in VR version with party gordos every friday.

Other than that, it's a pretty good game.

I played the first Slime Rancher right after it's release. I've bought the game on multiple accounts, and platforms as well. Slime Rancher 2 definitely lives up to it's prequel, and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future.

Don't get me wrong, it is just as good as the first one but... The additional features that the games provide currently feel more like they should have been DLC content rather than branded as a whole /new/ game because of how minimal they are. The story is pretty hard to follow in my opinion, feels like its barely there and I finished it a lot quicker than I expected versus the past game. The exploration is very very minimal to me, there isn't a lot of places to unlock and most of the big bois really only unlock unrelated items. And to top it all off; to me personally, the lack of any updates that actually add to the game rather than decor and already existing content from the past game really draws me away from it.

The first game was a wonderful, beautiful, and very fun experience, and I just knew this was going to be the same. New locations, new slimes, new memories to be made. 

The only thing I truly wish from this game is for it to be multiplayer. When I was playing the first, all I could think is how much fun my girlfriend and I would have owning and taking care of a ranch together. I'm sure adding multiplayer might mess with the story line a little, but a separate multiplayer mode would be a nice addition. Not only do I want new memories, but ones with her as well.

Another thing; I've noticed that a lot of sounds stop working the longer I play i.e. the chickens no longer cluck or chirp or ruffle their feathers, the slimes don't make their splat or spinning up sounds, I can't hear myself run, etc.

While I like the idea of the fabricator, getting the required components (that are not plorts) is a grind. And you unlock certain upgrades at total random it seems like (like the increased backpack size) which just makes it even more grind-y at certain points. And the warp portals are locked behind the fabricator as well, so that doesn't help you navigate the massive world. There are certain things I unlocked like near the end of the game (signs to place where you find fruits/veggies) that are entirely useless by that point.

Everything in this game is on-par with, if not an improvement to the first game. The soundtrack is phenomenal, I love the whimsical music in Rainbow Island, It was fantastic in the original game and it's fantastic here, each track perfectly going with the region it plays in. The environments are drop dead gorgeous, and every turn is background material.
        And they did Not forget about exploration, as each region is Littered with secret passage ways, collectibles, and gordos. This combined with how beautiful everything is really makes wondering around an absolute treat. Ranching slimes is pretty much the same as ever, though without the automation drones at the moment. Science and resource collecting is available from the start, and I like the changes they made to resource collection, where instead of creating a machine, placing it in an area, and waiting for it to slowly expel resources like the first game, in here you just siphon resources from various deposits scattered around the place that regenerate by the next time you visit.
        Overall, would very highly recommend it in its current form. If you're just wanting more of the same Slime Rancher experience, this game is perfect for you. The only minor nitpicks i have really is; The starting area in Ember Valley doesn't have much to look at, just a lot of dull yellow grass and gray cliff faces. The way you enter each environment is just by walking through a portal, which I think diminishes a little bit from the presentation of entering a new region that you experienced in the first game.

whit that being said this game has a lot of improvements from its predecessor, the most jarring changes for me was to resources and equipment upgrades. now instead of waiting for harvesters you can go explore the map to gain the materials you need to make a gadget or upgrades. witch now need to be earned by finding the nessesery components in pods and making them using the fabricator insted of paying relatively small amounts to get them. Even being in early access this game already has a similar a mount of slimes to the first game, i am assuming that the current number of slimes might even be dubbled considering the empty spaces in the plort market.

I got the first Slime Rancher game during the Christmas of 2017, and have loved it ever since. Slime Rancher has been one of my best gaming experiences ever, and the second game has only ever raised my opinion of the series.

There are so many new features and places to explore. One of my favorites is the snowball machine, where you can start snowball fights with you and your slimes, which is super fun and silly. Not only that, the scenery is gorgeous, as well. The sunsets and sunrises we see in-game are almost as beautiful, if not, more beautiful than the ones we see in real life. The Rainbow Fields, Starlight Strand, Ember Valley, and Powderfull Bluffs are all diverse environments and are all stunning in their own ways.

The game also shows amazing diversity, A good handful of characters have dark skin and are all very ethnically diverse. In the previous game, there was also a character who was in love with Beatrix named Casey, who's gender was left intentionally ambiguous, which could signal that there was a queer relationship between them. All the characters have interesting personalities and backstories, despite the character not being relevant to the game all the time.

Overall, I would highly recommend this game. It's excellent and has always been a positive experience for me.",1684073647,1684073647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. There needs to be some way to dowsing rod treasure pods/strange diamonds. I have spent hours on end looking for treasure pods and strange diamonds that i need to progress and i cannot find them. It is really boring after a bit to just run around aimlessly looking for these items and while i could look up a guide a game shouldnt need to have a guide up inorder to play it. I am still stuck on the first two areas of the game with no clue how to progress. Once these issues are fixed the games progression should feel much better.
2.My other gripe is performance and optimization, this game runs like ass. I have a 3070 ti and this thing is overheating consistently to run this game at just 60 fps. Before the game adds more features it needs to optimize better because this is currently the most taxing game I have played on my PC including many triple A titles. If my PC can run COD at max settings 144 FPS but struggles at 60 for this game somthing is wrong with optimization.",1683994112,1683994112,False,9,1,0.555111706256866455,0,True,False,True

You remember that requests thing where you could send stuff requested to NPCs and then receive up to four items for completing the request? Yeah that doesn't exist any more from the looks of it so it's harder to progress to the point it feels less relaxing and more grindy now when compared to the original. I think we could do without the plort requirement for upgrading the vac to be honest, but that's just me...

On the plus side, there's even more slimes to collect and care for in this than in the orginal Slime Rancher game. Will be honest though I prefer the original simply because it feels less grindy and more relaxing. Would I return this game because of the grindiness? Probably not, but I see myself playing the original more when I want to relax because while it's still fun and keeps a lot of the original features, it's way too grindy when compared to the other one. Still recommend it though if you don't mind it being harder to upgrade stuff than in the previous one.

UPDATE: I played longer and actually once you know where to find everything you need (Slimes, Crops, Locations, etc.) it's actually a lot easier to upgrade stuff, however it still requires some grinding to get all the things you need since there is no minimap to help you from the looks of it, so you kind of just have to get familiar with where everything is to know how to get to certain places.

There are still some minor issues. In my case those are following:
 - freezing graphics by the corral half full of deep brine (my fault, I suppose - corrals are meant for slimes, not resources); 
 - sometimes it is not possible to vacuum resources - have to spend some time, until I get the correct position, from which resources can be picked up (mostly at Powderfall Bluffs); 
 - resources fall into the water, even though vacpack is directed at them (and again - Powderfall Bluffs).

Overall, however, Slime Rancher 2 is a great game and I am absolutely sure, that it will be even more amazing, when fully released. I do reccommend it for everyone, who enjoyed first Slime Rancher.

P.S. I do not reccommend early access Slime Rancher 2 for those, who are too impatient to wait for full release and keep asking the same questions of when will there be added this or that.

Everything that made the first game so fun is in this game too. The joy of ranching, exploring, and crafting is just as prevalent in this game and far improved. More slime science, more fun, unique, and infectiously adorable slimes (and tons of cool new cute species, such as the Ring-tail and the Batty Slimes), and more beautiful areas to explore and uncover. The story so far has been engaging, and they brought back all our friendly familiar faces from the first game who now add so much to trying to uncover the mystery of the new island. And as much as I loved The Ranch, I have to say that Rainbow Island really blows it out of the water in terms of design, size, and exploration. It's so expansive and there's a ton of areas to explore with huge variations to them all. Even the individual islands like Starlight Strand and Powderfall Bluffs are so large and varied that you can find tons of different ecosystems on each one. The amount of content in the game already is far more worth than the price tag on the game, which I haven't been able to say for a lot of Early Access games... This game actually feels more complete than many final release games do, but with so much of the enormous game world/map still left uncovered, I feel there's a lot we have left to see from Monomi Park in this game.
I highly recommend this game. I rarely ever buy early access cause it's such a gamble, but I loved the first one so much that I gave this a chance and was not disappointed in the least. It's literally everything that made the first one so great, just bigger, better, and even more expanded upon. If you loved or liked the first one, I feel you're going to have a similarly great and enjoyable time with this game. It adds quite a bit, but doesn't really change the formula of the game much, and some people may find that a turn-off, especially if you didn't enjoy the first, but to me they had such a solid game that there really isn't a need to change it that much, so instead they just improved greatly on what they had, and they did an incredible job improving it.",1683501466,1683501523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But, unfortunately, most of what I've seen looks mostly the same. The world is a pastel blur with mix-matched colours everywhere that turns bland rather quickly.

The game itself feels and plays exactly like the first one does. It feels like a DLC to the original. If you just want more Slime Rancher, this game is for you. If you're looking for something new in the series, you might want to wait. Other than cramming a bunch of different concepts into the first area and adding more slimes that for the most part are reused or literally just animals, Slime Rancher 2 doesn't add much.

It's like the original, but with less incentive to do anything. It feels slower, and the lore messages scattered about the map are barely worth reading, as they're nearly the same as the first game but less personal. Other than that, the sense of progression isn't good either. You stumble around lost for a bit (because everything looks the same) until you find a treasure pod that you can open immediately, making the game feel linear and taking away the sense of re-exploration the first one had.

Tarr have somehow become even weaker than they were in the first game. In the original, they were one of the least threatening dangers, especially when compared to mosaic slimes, etc. In this game, they are borderline harmless. Most of the time, they won't even attack. Cranked the damage multiplier up to max, and the damage they did after staring at me for what felt like half an hour was bare bones.

The tutorial doesn't feel real. It gives you a message or two, and then tosses you out to do whatever in the first area. I felt little drive to keep playing after that, it just feels like the first one but with a large chunk missing.

In conclusion,
Please make more original slimes.",1682582570,1682582570,False,9,0,0.540074706077575684,0,True,False,True

However, with Slime Rancher 2; 5 minutes of playing make me feel the urge to throw up everywhere. I don't know if its the harsh colour scheme, confusing layout or the limited options in the settings that make it so hard to play but the first game had none of these issues. I know it's early access but I expected something better then the original Slime Rancher - not a pastel rainbow induced copy, this could honestly just pass as a DLC world for the og.

I'm someone who will spend hours doing what the game doesn't want me to do... and what I have found is that climbing is as fun as ever, till you get to the top. And I don't mean the top where the gordo or the map data is.. I mean the tip top, so far you can't see the drop, the rocks become somewhat.. questionable.. and your only view is of fog and distant landmarks. I would absolutely adore if the devs would leave something up this far for those of us who work their way around invisible walls and odd canyons. A little ""Are you happy now?"" on a sign for example would make me so overjoyed. Though there wouldn't be many who see it, isn't it wonderful to leave easter eggs of sorts for those who do? Just a thought.... 0.0  :D

Other than that, general thoughts on the game as it evolves..

I would have loved to see more plots in the initial greenhouse, one or two just outside the walls perhaps on the sides? It just feels very cramped and the roads down to the separate areas make for long and annoying treks back and forward when your farming becomes too advanced (overflowing of sorts). Another thought on this is that it would be oh so fabulous for hoarders like myself if the house itself had storage, silos not only take up a whole slot but don't actually hold that much.. if the house storage is a no go, an extra upgrade for silos where it can hold say 300 instead of 100 in each slot would help significantly. 

Some other minor things are that you can' make slime toys or lil helper bees and those would really help when I'm off climbing some rock I shouldn't be and my crystal slimes are going mad on the farm without me.. so would love to see something similar to those return as a mechanic. There's also the lighting issue, I know that in a recent update it's been adjusted from paparazzi are bombarding me to now, coming out of the gaming cave in the middle of a summer afternoon.. still need to play with my lighting adjustments down, especially when playing at night/ in a dim room.

I'd also love to see more customisation of the general farm area. My money is expansive with no end, if only I had a capitalistic, million dollar paint job to spend it on..

My only other random thought that I can think of right now is how much I would love a para-glider... though in my heart I know that would be an impossible ask... *sad*

If you need an extra bug tester don't be shy devs ;D
Thank you for your amazing work! You guys show heaps of passion for this little world and I can't wait to see what's coming in future updates <3

If you guys haven't bought this already? I'd 100% say to do so. There's more than enough to play with for the price right now, and if you know you'll eventually cave (just admit it) then you may as well get it now and support it to get where it needs to go! Get slime ranchin' !!

First off it feels the the first game, art style feel of the game and how amazing the different area's look. Since this game is still in early accesses am not going to talk about what is missing from the game compared to the first game. Some thing i will talk about is whats been added, as of this post 4 new and cool looking zones a few new cute slimes and new upgrades for you. the Story line so far is kinda bitter sweet but i enjoy it. over all for a 30$ price tag if you liked the Original Slime Rancher then this good chance will be right up your alley.
With that said i do have some concerns for the game over all. first off the area that is your base i feel is quite small, when you want to have all plot types and foods right now its not impossible to have it all but with out a further expansion to your base i don't see how you can have it all. also with the latest big update they added snowball's and snow ball fights witch i love however i can only do it with wild slimes. back home i cant do it witch makes me a bit sad. also as of right now there is no way to play with my slimes. i want to fun things with my slimes run around, perhaps a big slime farm area that will feed them but plots will be destroyed so i can play with a few of my favorite looking slimes. this game is fun but its kinda sad watching my slimes in there cages and no good reason to let them out. also resource gathering, while getting more tanks are nice and most resources fine to get you had better grind to get the more rare items for important upgrades. with no way to find them then a sound randomly in the wild you will be spending a few hours looking 1 or 2 rare spawns.
over all its a very promising game. i enjoyed the first one and this one so far is just a upgrade from that. while yes i have my concerns am not going to say this game is doomed to fail unless they add them all. so far its a upgrade with a lot going for it. is it worth the 30$ price tag? hard to say as of now but am enjoying it.",1681195643,1681195643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I like the gameplay in Slime Rancher 2 so far. I like the new graphics/art and the new slimes/resources. However this game runs way way more laggy on my computer than Slime Rancher (1). I experience a lot of dropped frames stuttering and freezing with this game that just isn't present when I play the original Slime Rancher. It could be my hardware, but I've dropped the settings as low as they can go (while keeping framerate high) and it still feels like I'm playing this game in slow-mo with intermittent freezing. Slime Rancher (1) plays smooth as butter on my computer with absolutely no lag and dropped frames. I wish Slime Rancher 2 played as smoothly so badly because I want to enjoy it as much as the first one! Part of what makes Slime Rancher so fun for me to play is the snappy quick movements I can do during gameplay and Slime Rancher 2 just isn't as fun for me because that's missing.

The graphics are the only thing that is better, but in my opinion the decoration in a lot of places is a bit overdone, it also lags heavily, I have to play in the lowest setting to get a consistent frame rate, and even then it's not always fluid, the portals are the worse, whenever I'm directly looking at them I go down to 20fps, and I don't even have a bad computer.

No shit, guys. It's in EARLY ACCESS. It is BEING DEVELOPED AS YOU PLAY AND GIVE BACK FEEDBACK. Feedback is not saying 'weeeeh it's not finished sob'. We know. Stop.

Real feedback would be this;

Incredible graphics and very colorful; I like that there is an option to adjust gamma and brightness, which really saves your eyes in the long run!

New slimes are adorable, and a great path so far; I can't wait to see what new ones come. It's nice to see slimes with gimmicks or special attributes like the [spoiler] ringtail slimes needing to be in the dark or they turn into statues, [/spoiler]- I'd love to see more of this to make it feel more unique in slime gathering instead of just slapping a few in a cage and forgetting until they revolt.

I like that I can turn off ferals and the Tarr. [spoiler] I found that the sheer amount of slimes spawning all around made CONSTANT tarr due to them all eating eachother's plorts non-stop and it turned into a constant tarr fest with no end in sight. Yeesh.[/spoiler]

I do find the farm travel a bit time consuming, but nothing game breaking- Its just so very big, at first, and I felt like I spent more time running back and forth than exploring- but that gets easier with teleporters and more energy to sprint.

I also find that the jetpack tends to act a bit wonky. Sometimes, I'll aim straight up, just using the space key to move, and it'll make me slide along objects to the side, or just not propel me up at all. Even worse if I use directional keys at the same time. Gravity hates you in this! 

Everything said; THIS IS AN EARLY. ACCESS. DEVELOPING. GAME. Stop bitching that it isn't complete, or doesn't have enough variety, or isn't as vast. It won't be for a while. You are here to get involved with this game as it develops. Not shit on them for not providing you a perfectly finished game step one. 

TL;DR;
Super fucking cute I fucking ranch those slimes forever YEE HAW

So now you wanna know about the game itself, it’s stunning, its gorgeous, the grass changes colors under your feet while you watch slimes do the goofy shenanigans they always do like catapult into that slimy sea, it plays amazing, the controls feel very good on controller with good responses. 
Some new features like upgrading out vacpack and being able to have more slots available? 10/10. The amount of upgrades are great so far I look forward to see if we get more. 

[i]The slimes? Cute obv,[/i] im quite weak to the Bat and Yolky slimes, the new intricate needs of each slime is very fun and I like the more need for care. 
[b]THE ONLY[/b] glitches or bugs ive seen thus far is things getting stuck in the world, and the floor disappearing for a few seconds, thats it. It’s not a joke when they say its incredibly polished, especially for an early access game. 


[b]MY SUGGESTIONS:[/b]
[list]
[*]I’d like to see all OG slimes in the game again, we might we might not, it’s perfectly fine if we don’t I just think lore wise maybe the rad slimes and quantums and Dervishes would fit great into the game. 

[*]Ability to edit current standing corrals, remove certain things with a cost of money rather than demolishing entire plots to rebuild. I know keeping music boxes and shade roofs isnt a big deal I just like to be weird and detail oriented so i might be the only person who feels this way. 

[*]Solar based slimes? Slimes that need sunlight to live and survive? Probably complicated and weird but idk could be cool. Could be like lizard inspired. 

[*]Ice slimes, yeah thats really it.

Managing the farm, especially when you get all the types of slimes, is a nightmare without drones. Every other day is going to be set to emptying the plorts and feeding takes a long time too, which is okay because when drones come back, it'll be no problem. I kind of ran out of things to buy with my money really quickly. I bought all the land and maxed all the upgrades quicker than the first, I'm not sure why there was a difference since it felt the same. I really love this game, the colors are stunning, the sound design is calming and in depth, the aesthetics of everything is so soothing.

This game is great for those who like to relax after a long day and the stunning visuals and beautiful music helps in that regard. This is a great sequel as it expands on the story via exploration, adds new and interesting slimes, as well as returning slimes. The upgrade mechanics in this game are better than the original because you must explore to get the materials and you no longer need to spend your currency on them but instead harvest ores and other material without drills or pumps, as you can directly harvest the material yourself.

The game looks great, that is undeniable. The islands are distinct from each other while still fitting the magical theme of this game (as apposed to the much less magical theme of the first game). The story has been, so far, quite good (even if it is a bit slow for each piece of info, but maybe that is just because I'm not at the conservatory much). I really like the drones  [spoiler]and fact that you can hack them to get more information[/spoiler] and having to feed Gordos to directly unlock sections rather than getting boxes of junk crops and slime keys to unlock doors (which were a bit buggy [I have unlocked all of the doors, but I somehow have 1 slime key left over]). The change from extractors with tiers to just running around and collecting the ore manually was an interesting one, but by no means bad (even if it did make me question my sanity the first times the ore node disappeared at some point after harvesting).

The islands are where I have most of my issues with the game. 
Each island has a completely different biome, which is good because it provides locations for all of the types of slimes (and each slime unique to each island feels like it belongs there), but it also makes the map (to me) feel more disjointed than the original Slime Rancher, which also had different zones (albeit not as extreme) that were blended together into one continuous land mass in a logical way.

You get to the islands with teleporters, which is a cool idea, but it can be difficult to just find some of them, let alone activate them (chiefly, the teleporter to get to frozen island, [spoiler]which is hidden behind a waterfall[/spoiler]).

After uncovering all of each island, it seemed like the map was smaller than the original game, which may just be because the playable area is split into four islands instead of two. With this in mind, there are also two large impassable (I've tried) walls, one in the volcanic zone and one in the magical zone, and (at least to me) it feels like I should be able to get past them and there should be more on the other side. This is especially true for the one in the volcanic area, which looks like a giant round door (to me), and it feels like the perfect place for an epic cinematic of the giant door going down into the lava, akin to slime gate (or whatever it was called) in the original game at the end of the Ruins. But instead of this, you feed a Gordo in a comparatively small doorway, and walk into a mostly empty room. All that is there are a couple of pods, some floodlights, and another flat wall.

Another point (loosely related to the islands) are the number of slimes. A lot of new slimes were added to fit the more magical theme, which they did, and other slimes were likewise removed because they did not fit the theme, which is understandable, but the net number of slimes has only increased by 1 from 17 to 18 and, strangely, the number of spaces on the Plort Market has increased from 22 to 34. This slight increase in the number of slimes when compared to the drastic 
increase in the number of spots in the Plort Market seems like either the developers have or had more planned, but it seems like it would probably be ""had"" since I don't see how they could add so many more slimes without building another game's worth of area to find them in, unless they just planned on finding ways to slap on some of the other slimes from the original game.

I know that this whole essay won't change anything, but still.

I haven't even explored the Saber area yet, so I'll get to updating when I'm finished with that shit.

Alright, first off I'll talk about the main thingy of the game, the design choices and landscapes. They're beautiful, all of them are, they really outdid themselves with SL2's graphics. However, there are a few downsides to note:
Slime rancher 2's UI system.
It is, really bad, compared to the original. Another thing would be how they are adding steam deck compatability, which is really, REALLY nice, but the problem is even on the lowest graphics settings, I still get frame drops (and I have the most expensive steam deck), it's terrible. It's not from just having lots of slimes. It happens all the time. This is a nitpick but the colors are wayy too saturated, much unlike the original.
Another thing is the 'wilderness' theme. Second thing, awesome as it is to have many new slimes, basically all of them are animal related, which feels just.. bland compared to all the crazy slimes found throughout, which had very different mechanics that made them a bit hard to contain.
Like dervish, boom, mosaic, rad, Quantum. The new mechanics just feel.. off. I can't explain it. I doubt anyone would care about this review, especially devs because it's only an issue with me.

The open world thing is gone. You have to wait a while, then you're there. It does increase performance, I guess.. but.. why? And what happened to all the cool science stuff? The Drills and pumps now getting those resources are even more of a pain in the ass. It encourages exploring but not in the good way. I despise it. Especially Silky sand. And the teleporters are gone for all my knowledge, replaced with only 1 way teleporters. It helps but it feels lame. 

There's much more I wanna talk about but I don't have much time, I'll edit later.

Don't get me wrong, there are new slimes but they kept ALL of the slimes in Slime Rancher 1 and just added a few new ones to them. This definitely feels like they just made improvements to slime rancher 1, plopped you in a different environment, and released the game. I could understand keeping 1-2 new slimes and keeping all the old gear and base mechanics between games...but this really feels like a slightly tweaked slime rancher 1.

I am still recommending it because I DO enjoy playing this, just as I did the first slime rancher, but I am incredibly disappointed in lack of variety for a $30 dollar game.

I absolutely loved Slime Rancher 1, and was eager to purchase the ""sequel."" I wanted to support the developer and encourage them to make more games like Slime Rancher. Unfortunately, Slime Rancher 2 is not at all what I was expecting. It is, rather than a sequel, simply a continuation of the story and feels more like DLC than a stand alone offering. The first game had progression and a story, this game does not. It punishes you for exploring, as you will have to work hard to get your ranch back in order when you return. There's no joy in finding treasure pods, as they turn out to be cosmetic items 95% of the time. The story line is barely there, and your friends only contact you to give you--you guessed it--cosmetic items. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this game, but I prefer the first game 100x more. If you just want to catch and feed slimes, then you will love this game.  If you are looking for something with progression and you love to explore the world, then this is not the game for you. I know it is still in early access, but my hopes are not high for the future of this game. If you absolutely LOVED Slime Rancher 1, and have not yet bought Slime Rancher 2, then I recommend you wait on this one.

Players take on the role of a rancher who must explore a colorful, alien world and collect various types of slimes. These slimes can be fed and cared for, and their produce can be sold for money, which can then be used to upgrade the ranch and purchase new equipment.

One of the biggest improvements in Slime Rancher 2 is the addition of multiplayer. Players can now team up with friends to explore the world together, share resources, and tackle challenges together. This adds a new layer of social gameplay that was not present in the first game.

The game also features new areas to explore, including a desert biome and a frozen tundra. These new areas introduce new types of slimes and challenges, as well as new obstacles to overcome.

In terms of graphics, Slime Rancher 2 looks very similar to the first game. However, the graphics have been updated to take advantage of newer hardware, resulting in smoother animations and more detailed environments.

Overall, Slime Rancher 2 appears to be a solid sequel that builds on the strengths of the first game. The addition of multiplayer and new areas to explore should provide plenty of new content for fans of the series. While some may feel that the game is a ""cash grab"" of the first game, it's important to remember that sequels often build on the mechanics and concepts of the original game. As such, Slime Rancher 2 may feel familiar to fans of the first game, but it also introduces new elements that make it a unique and enjoyable experience.",1679857687,1679857687,True,1,0,0.46875,0,True,False,True

The original game was pure perfection - any criticisms I have about it are total nitpicks. This game on the other hand, is headache / frustration inducing for me. I have vision problems, and the new graphical style of this game makes it very difficult for me to distinguish between objects / colors / movement / environment. I did not have this problem with the original game's graphical style.

This lack of ability to distinguish between objects / environment causes me extra grief since I'm constantly pixel-hunting for my desired targets, and also falling into the Slime Sea every fifteen minutes (only to lose the resources I took so long to find). (Note: I have tried tweaking the video settings such as brightness / gamma which made things even worse for me)

So far in EA this game is far-less-featured than the original, the pacing / tutorial are a bit haphazard, and if I hadn't played the first game I'd be completely lost (the original's pacing was so perfect it didn't need a tutorial). I'm also extremely disappointed with the unremarkable soundtrack, it's far less engaging than the first one. I understand these types of things are to be expected since it's still in EA, so I'm hoping some of these lacks will be fixed in upcoming updates.

I'm certainly in the minority with some of these disappointments (a few other people report photosensitivity and motion sickness issues with the new graphics), and I'm certain that some / most of these concerns will be fixed in time. I'm just hoping it happens before I give up trying to play the game, because I truly enjoy the Slime Rancher premise and gameplay, and I really want this to be my favorite game of 2023.",1679410410,1679410410,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

When I'm not pulling out my hair in frustration, being attacked by 20 tar, or falling through the floor into an endless abyss with no kill box, its pretty okay.
My main issues with the game at the moment are that nothing goes anywhere. I spent 2 hours hunting down and popping gordos and putting plorts in statues hoping to find some new slimes, or new content, and made absolutely no progress and found nothing. I know theres a cave with bats and crystal slimes or whatever in it somewhere but I for the life of me cant bare another hour searching for food and plorts trying to find it. Every single gordo and statue I found led too a dead end, a shortcut I couldn't even use because I needed to do something else on the outside of THE OTHER END, or just a kinda cool looking area with no use other than, well to look cool I guess. It's really hard to feel like you're making any sort of progress as unlike in the original game, every gordo you popped had a purpose, you knew where to go next because there was a stone door blocking the next area, and when you did find a new area it actually felt like A NEW AREA, everywhere looks the exact same, you could shuffle the map around and I wouldn't even notice. Speaking of the areas they are so meaninglessly large for what they are. I get lost so frequently from a lack of any distinguishing land marks what so ever. The only truly unique area is the one with the butterfly slimes where the steep cliffs and highland castle like envirement give it some personality. Even with such a large map area thet can fit a select few varieties of slimes into their own little areas I am constantly battling tar. I can walk into a brand new area and it will already be absolutely polluted with tar. This happens in pretty much every area of the game and I think that can be attributed to the phospher slimes that decided that they can spawn where ever they damn well please and destroy an entire ecosystem. It's an absolute shame I can't experience the soundtrack of this game because at least every 2 minutes the tar theme song decides to bud in on what I assume to be a pretty good soundtrack. I spent 90% of this current build of the game being lost and wandering aimlessly through a land of pure tar and slimes screaming in anguish. Although the game is in early access I don't really have high hopes for the future as I don't see any really new ideas over the original, this could have just been DLC at this point other than the addition of collecting items without machines or taps which I guess is a pretty nice quality of life change. This feels rushed, laggy, and like most content was hastily added to pad run time because it fells like everything is intentionally blocking my path in a way that it wasn't an obstacle, but a time investment. I really really hope this turns around because I know what this studio is capable of, and I surely hope its not Slime Rancher 1 + New Marketable Blobs. 4/10
edit: I know its early access theres gonna be unfinished areas just PLEASE tell me when the content is over so I can stop looking for it.",1665014315,1678832388,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

From the moment I started playing, I was struck by just how cute and charming the game is. The brightly colored slimes and adorable creatures that populate the game world are simply irresistible, and I found myself completely absorbed in the game's whimsical atmosphere.

One of the things I love about ""Slime Rancher 2"" is how easy it is to lose track of time while playing. Before I knew it, hours had flown by as I explored the game's open world, caught and cared for different types of slimes, and searched for treasure. The game's relaxed pace and gentle difficulty curve make it the perfect game to play when you just want to unwind and escape for a while.

Despite my lack of experience with the original game, I found myself invested in the series and eager to learn more about the game's lore and characters. The game does a great job of gradually introducing you to its world and mechanics, so even if you're a newcomer like me, you'll quickly feel right at home in the game's quirky universe.

Overall, ""Slime Rancher 2"" is an absolute joy to play. Its cute and colorful aesthetic, relaxing gameplay, and addictive mechanics make it the perfect game to unwind with after a long day. Whether you're a fan of the original game or a newcomer like me, ""Slime Rancher 2"" is definitely worth checking out.

-would prefer if night sky was not blurry, I mean not completely sharp but stars I am looking at may become sharp. I believe that would look better. This way during night when I look at the sky I just can't shake off the feeling that the character is myopic.

-map overall can get a bit of more love. Map looks beautiful don't get me wrong, but the base, or teleport locations looking so good, I feel underwhelmed when in other sides of map. So I believe non-special locations of the map can get better, probably not to the level of special locations, but even half of it would look fabulous.

-optimization needs work.

-idk if it can be worked out but loading screen for teleporting to different locations is kind of bothersome and is the only thing that got worse compared to first game. (though it may be a side-effect of the 2nd game being more  complex idk)

Things I liked;
-sun.  (watching sunset-sunrise is quite beautiful (SLIMES SHOULD ALSO WATCH THIS VIEW 100%) and sun's effects is not limited to this. I love the red hue it gives to all map during sunset-sunrise, even slimes should stop and adore this view
-overall feeling of night time.
-the base, special locations
-gordos blocking entrances rather getting keys out of them
-oh nearly forgot musics, they are DAMN good

Things I would like in the game;
-ofc much more content :D, its never enough :))
-moon's effect is kind of underwhelming compared to sun. Moon is kind of blurred atm so we cant see much detail but other than that maybe it could have a cycle. Sometimes a crimson moon giving night a crimson hue or a yellow moon, not necessarily having any effects. even only visual effects would be interesting.
-slimes sometimes should enjoy the scenery, since they like music why not (maybe smalls on top of largos and enjoying the sunset)
-more generous use of water in maps, but in a detailed way, rather than slightly covering the ground, maybe drizzling through rocks, little waterfalls here and there. Maybe a medium sized one dominating a corner. (edit: OK, I have seen a part of the map dominated by a waterfall, which is nice, but its textures is a bit muddy)
-while running vac takes too much space pov-wise, I would like to see game more even while running",1677193546,1678453902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game is still very new, being on patch 0.2.0 at the time that I'm writing the review but there is always the possibility of ""seemingly big"" but empty updates coming out all the way to version 1.0 of the game so just because its in early access, doesn't mean the game will improve over time.

The game has enough positive comments already because the first game was a massive success, but its good to keep in mind that the game has not changed at all. I will be going into more detail below.

I wish we had some earlier access to rare resource automation in the game. Most of my time spent playing was running around the very same locations collecting resources from the ground like deep brine or jelly stones just for 1 machine which doesn't feel rewarding enough anyway. 

If you want to progress at a moderate to fast rate, you'll most likely have a couple of spots dedicated to slimes and what I found was sometimes I would spend 10-15 mins purely collecting and selling plorts and feeding the slimes which honestly at first it might sound ok, but people underestimate the amount of time spent doing this in the long run. Sometimes I spend the entire in game day feeding slimes and collecting plorts or the auto plort collector fills up and all the plorts go to waste or the auto feeders run out of food.

In general, I think if you are patient enough and want to just kill some time, its quite good. It really is a reskinned version of slime rancher 1 though so bare that in mind.",1678114518,1678114518,False,20,0,0.642040908336639404,4,True,False,True

Slime Rancher 2 is a sequel to the popular indie game Slime Rancher, developed and published by Monomi Park. The game is a first-person sandbox game where players explore and collect various types of slimes, which are adorable creatures that can be fed and kept as pets.

In Slime Rancher 2, players will once again assume the role of Beatrix LeBeau, a rancher who must explore new lands, collect new types of slimes, and build a ranch to care for them. The game promises to expand on the original Slime Rancher's mechanics, adding new slime types, new gadgets, and new challenges to overcome.

If you enjoyed the original Slime Rancher, or if you're a fan of cute and colorful games with light-hearted gameplay, then Slime Rancher 2 might be worth checking out.

Sadly have to give this a thumbs down for now, primarily due to the graphics / optimization.

[spoiler]The new zone entrance was also way too difficult to find, I had to Google it after doing many laps, and it was a confusing location given the direction of the original maps (what's with the dead end cave at the end of the lava zone???). Why hide it like this?[/spoiler]

All of this quality content has me eager for what is to come in the later updates, and goes to show the amount of effort, soul, and passion that has gone into this game so far.

Since 2 is in early access, it's hard to recommend to people who haven't played the first game, but either way I find both to be worth playing. I love the art direction and improvements to the core gameplay loop has made the experience so much less janky.

My gripe with the first game was that the upgrade system, 7Zee and crafting felt at odds with eachother and it was difficult to get over that massive progression bump that is currency cost of expanding your ranch and upgrading your gear, THEN into resource cost for tech after having played long enough to afford the lab. Then steeper cost for 7Zee cosmetics, etc, etc. The challenge was rewarding, simply because access to automation and cute decor was actually quite fun and satisfying for the challenge. Especially since the automation gave push to perfect your ranch layout. But I wouldn't say it all felt naturally integrated.

With how Slime Rancher 2 is, currently, I think the balance HAS improved! Upgrades and crafting are now all united into one neat package, with the new upgrade and tech progression obstacle being finding the locked orbs. Which, depending on much you explore, has the potential to hinder your progress if you don't keep your eyes peeled and your nose to the ground, but it really isn't that bad. I'm also truly over the moon with how much better the movement system is integrated into exploration, although a lot can be traversed on foot, if you know how to use the jetpack you can use the environment to your advantage and get past a lot of the locked doors or find very well hidden treasures. Compared to the first game it has a lot more intended paths and intentionally reachable areas, rather than leading to what [i]felt[/i] like boundary breaking. Early on resource cost is a little rough but really it just pushes you to explore, and with how gorgeous the game is I have nothing to complain about!

The game takes everything that was great about the first installment - the adorable slimes, the immersive world-building, the addictive gameplay - and elevates it to a whole new level. The graphics are stunning, the new areas to explore are filled with secrets and surprises, and the addition of new slime types and ranching tools adds even more depth to the already impressive gameplay mechanics.

But what really stands out to me about ""Slime Rancher 2"" is the sense of joy and wonder that it brings. The world of the game is vibrant and colorful, and the slimes themselves are just downright cute. Every time I come across a new type of slime or discover a hidden area, I feel a sense of childlike wonder that is all too rare in adult life.

But beyond that, ""Slime Rancher 2"" is a game that brings people together. The community of players who love this game is truly a joy to be a part of. Whether it's sharing tips and tricks or just admiring each other's ranches, the sense of camaraderie among ""Slime Rancher 2"" players is truly heartwarming.

The slime science is more involved, and doesn't need me to sit around waiting for an RNG machine (although I do wish the spawn rates were a bit higher for the materials). My biggest issue with the previous game was how difficult it was to keep carnivorous slimes happy, since chickens always seemed to reproduce so slowly: in SR2, chickens spawn much quicker, to the point that I even have enough leftover Roostros to feed my Hunter slimes.

I do miss the drones though. Once your ranch gets big/efficient enough, it's difficult to find time to explore.

Nothing astounding, but a fun new entry, and while yeah, its very similar to the old, I sort of like that. Its another chance to build a ranch and create all kinds of largo, yippee, its more of a game that I wanted more of. And it feels like a more polished or smooth version of SR 1 in how the character you play as handles and the designs/graphics which is dope. I would recommend it but only if you really loved the first and want more of it. If you haven't played the first, get that not this. Oh, and the soundtrack is also just as good as in SR 1, knocked it out the park again with that.

However, there are some criticisms I have outside of recommending it. I do think the worlds seem to have a bit less flavour in places, like the starlight strand etc just don't quite feel as iconic to me as the indigo quarry or the ancient ruins or the glass desert, they are pretty to look at and still pretty good, just not as good. But, maybe thats me and it is minor. The new slimes themselves are really, really good, just A+ on them honestly. Very lovable, perfect.

The CPU usage is a bit insane, I had to put graphics on lowest setting and for the record my computer has ran sims 3 and another game in the background without lagging before so its not that I have a weak set up. I hope that is fixed/optimised and anyone with a weak computer should note it, maybe wait till developments further along.

The game is also very incomplete. That's not an issue on its own, I just really hope updates aren't too slow. Monomi Park seems like a trustworthy developer though and SR1 was always getting fun constant periodic updates so I'm not too worried. The biggest thing is just definitely not seeing more of the trend we're always seeing these days, incomplete games going early access then staying in that state for 5+ damn years. But again, I still recommend because while its always a risk, overall I trust this developer given track record.

That being said, one thing should be a priority that isn't in the game currently - drones. The actual ranching part of the game is just unplayable without them sadly. I mean sure, you can have stock food for the slimes and collect plorts yourself by hand, but you can only reasonably manage about a single or maybe two ranch expansions while still getting to explore enough. Otherwise you're constantly hurrying home and tediously removing plorts back and forth back and forth gets old real quick. The drones NEED to be a priority for the updates, I think really they should have launched with the base game honestly, but still, putting them in ASAP would certainly fix a lot I feel like. More exploration can come later when the tools to equip players to leave long enough are in place first!

As a final minor aside, I do honestly wish the conservatory was fully enclosed, or another one of the ranch expansions was, like with a fence or something. Probably just me but I longed for it in slime rancher 1 as well, just a way to have stuff free ranging if you so wish would be really neat. So good for chickens... half the time farming them is even more fun than the slimes itself hehe.",1677361769,1677362824,True,34,1,0.778267741203308105,0,True,False,True

The story is a lot more compelling than the last game as well, as I feel myself theory crafting in the mystery of rainbow isle. The new slimes are quite funny, and I like how they've expanded the background of them. Ringtails and Yolky slimes are a step in the right direction, they're creative and have a lot of personality.

This time exploration feels more rewarding, even if a bit daunting at times since it can be super easy to get lost in the areas, but after a bit I got the hang of landmarks and such. Having natural resources be an incentive as opposed to something you just plop an excavator down for was a good choice. Also kinda've glad I don't have to open more love letters from Casey every few minutes.

This game is heading in a great direction, and I'm eager to see it grow. I bought the switch copy of the first game for my little nephews, because deep down I think we all would like to retire to another planet to ranch happy blobs of our own in peace. My only ask is a multiplayer mode would be nice as the franchise continues to grow, so I can play with my friends and family.",1677352593,1677352593,True,1,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,True

This game is so darn FUN, its cute, calm, charming, beautiful, pretty. It looks so good, and is a really good sequel to slime rancher 1.
So the game seems way more exploration based now and i love it, the game looks very good no matter were you are, the goofy slimes make everything better, its genuinely fun to explore AND ITS REWARDING WHAT?!?!
Farming slimes isnt the best, its cool and personalised, but like its not the most engaging, it isnt boring though, its fun organinsing your farm to have farms for crops (fruit n veg), hen hens (chickens) and the slimes them selves, OFC u could just not have a slime farm and explore or just have a chicken farm plot, BUT the game has crafting o_O
Crafting is one of my fav features becasue it encorages exploring and rewards, you can run more, have more inventory space and slots, BUT it requires resources you get from slimes AND exploring actually HUGE
THE game is in DEVELOPMENT and new content is still being added, but imo its already better than Slime Rancher 1, but currently it has less features i guess but its really good and will get more stuff as time goes on, my only real complaint is that the slimes are now more based of real life animals and not fictional creative ones BUT it doesnt hurt me that much cause ITS IN DEVELOPMENT and the slimes are still cute AND original and creative slimes still exist and are being added! I also wish i could choose were i can build pens etc, but its not that big of a deal either because i just dont mind i guess.

This game is really fun to play, just do a little slime farming and exploring, i do recommend it 100% BUT idk how well every computer will run it lol simply no clue! but its a great game super chill and fun",1677281547,1677281547,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,True

However as a fan from playing the original, I am disappointed... I recommend purchasing this and not the original if you're looking to play the game, but if you have the original... It's the same activity with a few new slimes.

The only thing I enjoyed about the game was the aesthetics of the new areas, but it's not enough to warrant this game as a ""sequel"".

I would have liked to have seen some new mechanics, like a bigger vacuum tank, a fishing game maybe - or even the multiplayer so many people requested in the original. Any other NEW activity other than vacuuming slimes in a new environment for money, to unlock more potential for money, for... What, exactly?

When I was playing through ALL of the original slime rancher I only encountered the lucky ONCE. But I managed to see this lucky slime 6 times while playing.

Easily the biggest issue is the collectible treasure capsules on the map, which unless you want to spend hours trawling (and re-trawling when an update comes out) the map, your going to have to go on the internet and find a guide to show you where they are, if there was some kind of detector/gauge that showed you how close you are to an unopened capsule it would be immensely more fun.

Secondly, and this is actually a lot more minor, but slime ranching feels to be a really small part of the game currently, it feels currently the game is all about scouring the world for resources to get upgrades and decor, with very little slime ranching actually required.

Third is that all the convenience tech (teleporters, warp depot's, etc) takes a ton of grinding because they all require diamonds, so it just feels like a grindfest if you want to actually do stuff.

That said, for all 20 hours I have played the game I have had lots of fun, and I don't regret purchasing the game, but I'm not sure I would recommend this if you didn't know about the current shortcomings the game has.

- The new resource system of mining them in world instead of using machines is fun but makes it very slow, if your gonna stick with this please either add markers to resource nodes like the Gordos or letting us make our own map markers for them.
- Make the other NPC's useful, overall i love Viktor but don't really care for the others because he is one of the only NPC's that gives you useful objects. While Ogden is giving me the recipe for a small bush Viktor gives me the recipe for a pink portal. not very fair to them right? I'm not saying to make them give portals as well but maybe things that make sense for them like bringing back Slime decals, drones (and maybe decals for them as well)
- The game lacks a driving force, Slime Rancher 1 had the Z Rewards giving you drive to make your farm more efficient and to explore to make your system even more optimized (and maybe find some gold or lucky slimes while your at it)

Graphics settings are irrelevant for the most part as well so just turn them all up (other than depth of field naturally) if you have at the minimum a 2060 Ti / 2070.

Other than that early-development problem basically everything has / had at some point, it's an excellently stylized game that's generally pretty relaxing- if a little frustrating at times with the lackluster map but that's more of a me problem as I have a history of having the navigational ability of a blind and deaf toddler.

Overall? Definitely a good buy, as long as you know what this actually entails. It's really chill, not a ton of mechanics to worry about, let alone sink tons of time mastering. Although there seems to be some early lore which has a lot of potential if Monomi decides to really develop it!

First release Review, Sept 27 2022:

It's actually surprising how much more SR2 is. When SR1 released in EA, it was less than half the size of what Monomi Park has released for this first release of SR2. The map is surprisingly large, with a plethora of nooks and crannies and a ton of underground tunnels to find and explore. The three islands we have access to are gorgeous, each with unique but vibrant color palettes. Gordos are now nearly guaranteed to hide a reward, whether that be lore, a treasure pod, a shortcut, or a teleporter. Extractors have been replaced with a simple add-on to the vac-pac, with nodes found throughout the world. Slime Science is now integrated from the very beginning, and upgrading Beatrix's kit is now a mix of money and science instead of an outright purchase from the 7ZeeCorp. Beatrix herself is also more ""alive"", with a few idle animations and different poses within the house depending on the time of day. There's way more conversing with the other Ranchers now, and though there aren't many lines of dialogue for repeat situations at the moment, the conversations about the lore and about what everyone is doing is a delight (still no eyes on Hobson, though!). There's a ton of hints to a ton of secrets and possibilities for upcoming updates that have me very excited alongside what we have now -- and all the upgrades that we have gotten already speak greatly to Monomi Park's growth over the development period of SR1. 

This is a FANTASTIC start to what is going to be a great game, and I'm happy to be supporting it and watching its development.

Update, Song of the Sabers, Feb 20, 2023

The first content update to Slime Rancher 2 is surprisingly huge! A new island, a glacier that's risen up from the Slime Sea thanks to the volcanic activity on Ember Island. Find the secret entrance and end up in a snowy little wonderland. 

Firstly, the snow mechanics are great. Beatrix sinks in, the slimes create furrows as they trudge through, and the snow sticks to them when they hop out. You can start snowball fights that will have slimes chucking tons of snow at each other, and you! The aurora plants are gorgeous, and the mechanic of the auroras becoming solid enough to walk on at night was a delightful thing to discover. The environment suggests that the glacier is broken off from the Ember Valley mainland, which is a nice touch that could have been ignored. It's a truly beautiful place with, again, its own unique feel. Monomi Park really knows how to design environments!

The saber slime returns in its pure form, with a cute roar mechanic that startles other slimes -- and the very first ""utility slime"", the yolky slime, who hangs out with the chickens and helps them reproduce faster. 

Story wise, there's more to see with the new drones, and even more speculations to be made.

Some of the elements need refining or to be built out more. Looking forward to hopefully having more slime and food types, slime pen and bird coop upgrades, maybe slime incubators, and slime to item refinery tech, etc. Also I think it's a little silly that it costs currency to clear a building slot rather than refunding you.

Farm simulations/pet simulations, and other sandboxy sim games are among my favorite game genre. The first slime rancher is a very cute casual game that gained a lot of depth and things to do over the course of its development, including some MUCH NEEDED quality of life updates that made the game feel more of a joy to play than work to play. I was super excited about the idea of a new world for the devs to expand upon and make even better than the first game.

Slime rancher 2 feels like work to play. The barren and rough around the edges atmosphere of the original slime rancher is acceptable, it's the first game in the series as well as being a new dev team at the time. I have played and enjoyed many games in this genre that start sort of empty in early access, but I have NEVER played a SEQUEL of one of those games that feels just as empty as the first one. 

I see a lot of arguments about how ""Well the first game started with almost no slimes, no drones, no achievements so why are you complaining??""""  This isn't the first slime rancher game, this is the 2nd game. It should have no reason to launch as barren as the original title. ""Developer mental health"" Is not an excuse AFTER large portion of the audience already bought and played the game, if the devs aren't in a good condition to work on it or they didn't want to through the holidays, they should've been open with the audience about this BEFORE the game launched. 

I was super patient waiting for this first big update of 2023, and I'll admit I haven't played it yet. But after looking through the log it seems there's pretty much no quality of life for this update, just a new chunk of land and maybe 2 new slimes. 5 months is too long for an audience to wait in the dark for an unsatisfying first update. I'm going to give this new update a chance but I am already disappointed reading it over, as the game has been unplayable since launch without drones.

There is no reason to play slime rancher 2 as a new (or a veteran) player, I recommend the first slime rancher or any other related game in the genre.",1676818840,1676818966,False,18,0,0.516632914543151855,4,True,False,True

This was a game I've been waiting for for a long time. I'm so happy with it!

I will preface this next part by saying this game is early access, so I know there are going to be some minor issues. I don't really mind them! I know they are going to be fixed at some point so all is good :)

UPDATE: All the bugs i've mentioned below have been fixed :)

Some minor bugs I've come across:
-Same issue from the first game (exactly the same) where you can't pluck food from the plants. Which also makes it worse because this game you don't use drills, you use the vac to take the resources; so with this bug you aren't able to take any of them. Only fix for this is to close out of the game and relaunch. I've only ever noticed this issue if I've been playing for a long time (3+ hours). This is the one bug I hoped they would fix in the first one, and am sad to see it continues on this one.
-Small audio bugs throughout, but nothing too major. Only consistent one is I'm not able to hear plorts landing from the slimes anymore. It worked for about half an hour and then the sounds disappeared.

In all, not too bad, especially for a game in early access it runs great!",1663912694,1676796966,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

BEFORE YOU BUY
The recommended specs are misleading, and a 2060 super is more suited for 60+ fps gameplay. On RTX 3060, I could not reach target 120fps (steady 80-110) with or without external screen/mux switch. So bear in mind this is a graphically intense game better suited for a GPU paired with a multi-thread cpu. This is all based on medium-high settings.

For perspective, cyberpunk 2022 on ultra settings DLSS2 sported the game GPU temps as this game does for both my pc and gaming laptop (RTX 3060/3070Ti respectively) so laptop gamers beware.

If you're considering buying this because you love the original Slime Rancher, I'd advise against it. The game itself is good, and captures the feeling of the original game. However, in terms of content it's still far behind its predecessor. I'll probably change this review in future but for now it's a tough sell.

Right now there's about as many slimes as in the original game, however most are brought over, and only like 3-4 of them are actually new. The locations available right now are also lacking, only three unique ones in total and the starting area is pretty similar to that of the previous game.

From what I can see, one mechanic changed for the better. Gone are the time-consuming resource extractors where you had to wait for them to finish. Instead, you now simply vacuum up the resources yourself. Overall I would consider this a positive change, as I hated waiting for them. The gameplay is otherwise virtually identical to the previous game.

I've not finished, but I'm fairly late into the game, and barely any meaningful tech has been revealed to me. I've explored most of every biome, as well as corralled every slime in the game, and yet have not found any usable drones or two-way portals like in the previous Slime Rancher. Gameplay is thus a fair bit more tedious than in the previous game.

TL;DR, if you want a more complete experience, give it another year or so, and wait for more content updates.",1676527890,1676527890,False,28,2,0.663030743598937988,0,True,False,True

The game feels like it's a fully fleshed out experience. There's already sprinkling of story lore throughout and I'm curious to see where it goes. The slimes are adorable and fun. The map actually marks discovered gordos or other important things you find which is a big help to not getting lost. Some of the lighting effects are a bit over the top (the refinery, refinery links, market, auto-feeders all let off a starry effect when you put things in them) and it can be a bit blinding especially with all the glowing plant effects, so I feel like that can be tweaked some. I have had some minor lag and texture loading delays, but nothing game breaking. The new resource gathering adds more player control rather than the original RNG of the extractors, so long as you know what to look for. Looking forward to more exploring and seeing where these incredible developers go with this amazing concept.

Edit: Still very few bugs or glitches. My biggest issue however is about controlling Bea. Her character seems very slippery/bouncy depending on what terrain you're travelling over. Running over a small rise can launch you five feet into the air. Trying to get to higher ledges can be difficult as some terrain bounces you off or is too slippery to land on (this may be by design to prevent breaking the environment).

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

Yet again, for a second time in a row, this is how Early Access is meant to be done!

Slime Rancher 2 is a game developed and published by Monomi Park and is the sequel to Slime Rancher

Slime Rancher 2 is a first-person management strategy game where you own a ranch full of adorable slimes, some are pink, some are blue, some are burning hot and some are very dangerous

The gameplay follows you, a rancher, where you have to build a pen where you stack slimes and you have to feed them and keep an eye on them from escaping whilst taking care of the ranch

Slime Rancher 2 is currently (at the time of this review) is in Early Access, but you really don't know that this game is in early access, because the game is big with a lot of content offered to you

The game is really good, however, the game can get repetitive after a while because you have to go back and forth with collecting slimes, food, water and so on, but overall, Slime Rancher is a very entertaining early access game!

So far, I've come across very few bugs, In fact none that i can remember off the top of my head besides one bug that wouldn't allow resources to be vacuumed up. That was an easy enough fix of restarting/reloading however.

The graphics and music are just what I expected from a game in the Slime Rancher franchise. Beautiful and absolutely relaxing. Its hard to describe the feeling from it aside from being deeply at ease. I find myself playing for long duration's at a time.

Moving onto the story line from what I've gathered thus far;
Bea has decided to continue her journey through a portal in slime rancher 1(or so it seems) and has continued to explore the planet. Many popular slime from the first game have reappeared joined by many wonderful new ones. 
Not much has been mentioned about what happened with Bea and Casey and casey seems to be entirely missing from this game. I won't say much more to prevent spoilers from the first game.
I think there could be some more work done to explain the transition from the first game to this one.

Its lacking a full story at the moment of course as while I am writting this, the game is still in development and incomplete.

Besides all of that, even at its current stage, it is a definite recommendation to play. You get the playtime currently of other rpg type games and theres a LOT for those who like to take completionist routes and unlock absolutely everything they can.


In conclusion, even in development, Slime Rancher 2 is a very well executed game. And if we're being honest, not a lot of players tend to play only for the story. Slime rancher is, in my opinion, the standard for relaxing games that are just an absolute delight to play (and not turn the in game music off in), and Slime Rancher 2 is definitely checking all my favorite things about the first Slime Rancher. I hope to see this franchise expand even more in the future


I would like to add, while yes its almost exactly like the first game, the story has been laid out a little, as well as some premonitions to future possibilities through in game mail. 
I would not recommend purchasing YET if you are only interested in story. Like some in the non recommendations have said, its beautiful and true to the franchise BUT not much happening story wise or new content wise yet! If you're solely looking for that, I recommend you wait to purchase until more is done, but keep in mind, Monomi isn't a big company. Acording to their website, theres only roughly 30 people working on the game <3 so things will go slow at first im sure! Just remember its a smaller company, and content won't come super fast (Also coming from someone currently in an alpha/beta test under NDA where there's been roughly 4 months between play sessions/content updates and each test only being for around a month)",1676176032,1676176742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First I am gonna talk about the little few positives this game has:
The menu revamp is amazing, the ability to disable tarrs and ferals is also a nice edition.
The new slimes, of course. A little lazy with design but still adorable.
The general map, the textures look beautiful and staring at them is like looking at a painting at a museum.
Now for the many negatives of the game:
The music is bland and repetitive, the thing that made the original slime rancher so great is how the atmosphere suited the music, for this it does not at all.
The fucking lighting, this is the main thing that makes this game so flawed. I have a moderate PC and I had to change the graphics to the lowest possible and yet still, the lighting is like looking at the damn Sun. If you go to hunt slimes, food, etc then you get completely blinded by the light above. If I wanted to get that effect then I would be staring at a flashlight which would honestly be a better experience. I also have several friends who got seizures because of this game's lighting.

And the gameplay while ranching the slimes has become super boring now because of the lights and the fucking intense lights. It is like I am playing the game at gun point whenever I try feeding my pink slime a carrot. It is stupid.
The bugs, the bugs... where do I start? First off, slimes spawning in your base, fucking stupid. I don't know if this is a feature of a bug, but I am listing it off anyways. The possibility of having a slime popping up in your base in very... unexpecting and seeing a Tarr pop up from fucking nowhere is unbelievable. I have lost so many slimes to this.
This could just be me, but whenever I try jumping on a rock, it flings me across the damn map and into the fucking ocean. Fix this.

The point is; if you want a good Slime Rancher experience without worrying about blind lights and Tarrs popping up from fucking nowhere in your base; Go play the original Slime Rancher, the graphics are generally worse but it is a fun and better experience then Slime Rancher 2.

The exploration aspect of the new map is superb, with numerous hidden nooks to explore and secrets to find. However, the ranch is too big to comfortably manage, the portals in the world are extremely inconvenient, and system of manual portals isn't properly in the game yet. That makes repeated expeditions and managing of your slimes more of a chore than they should be.

There is also no money sink in the game, not yet at least, which quickly kills the need to manage your economy. Paired with annoying size of the new ranch, at some point it became optimal to just dump all my slimes in the ocean, saving myself from the need of hauling plorts over excruciating distances. This will somewhat get fixed once they reintroduce the drones, but so far they aren't in the game either.

New slimes are really great - Ringtails and Battys in particular introduce fun new mechanics to consider when making hybrids and planning the ranch. All of them also look great. Bunnycats? Bunnycats.

The food is also rebalanced. Chickens are finally a viable food source, arguably more viable than gardens even. This finally gives freedom to the hybridization system - if you want to make exploding cats, nothing is stopping you now.

The resource system is a massive change for the better. Instead of placing extractors and waiting for their production timers, you are now venturing back in the world to explore it more and gather the stuff you need. It reinforces the exploration aspect beautifully, though I think a few more resource nodes, especially in hidden areas, would make the whole deal even better.

The upgrade system, on the other hand, is a change for the worse. You aren't buying the upgrades anymore, you are crafting them from your resources, and SOME of those resources need to be gathered from specific treasure pods. Didn't find that one pod with final boot upgrade? Boy does it suck to be you. Better open the guide and kill the exploration thrill completely.

The story is in the same format as the first game - text logs found in the world. It's obviously unfinished yet - however, it offers an enticing intrigue to eventually uncover, and offers a nice spin on the logs themselves later in the game.

And that's about it. A very similar experience, fixing some issues of the original. A very solid foundation for an EA game, with some hiccups to eventually polish, and some incomplete parts. From this foundation, I hope devs add more unique mechanics to the future biomes, like with Glass desert, and new ""modes"" like they did with expansions of SR1. Then this game will truly outgrow its predecessor.",1675782310,1675782310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
