With that being said, That means I've had to have been running the game for a while. As A Sword Art online fan, this is worth the buy in its entirety. The AI feels Exactly like in the anime or novel (For you Manga Readers out there :D) And Overall I do use this game daily. There are some bits that can take some getting used to but overall this is worth the money. As For myself, I dont write a lot of reviews for games, but this one takes a special cake. To my fellow SAO Survivors, There leaves one achievement left, The beater. I Still have no idea what Itll take to really achieve it, or if it is obtainable anymore, frankly because The beater role was given to one person, So Whats to say the achievement wasnt the same? Or maybe a beta key? Or Even This Year when The Nerve Gear would be released. Its Insane to think back when I first got this, My love life, My family life, My own Life, All rapidly Changing. I will Try to unlock you one day beater, but as for now I sit in my house, and like klien, im gonna enjoy myself a pizza after clearing Sword Art Online. Thank You all For Having me and reading this long paragraph of a message. Stay Safe, and I love you all.

TheDragonFox

Update: After Years, I have Achieved The beater role! I am Now a beta tester. For everyone else who achieves this, Congratulations On being one of the few beta testers to achieve this! I am So happy. I figured it out before the announcement went public and cried when i saw it appear, I was actually shocked. You have to be a beta player (AKA SAO in the anime today would be in its beta stage, so if you logout during this little event phase (August 1st through 31st) you gain access to this achievement, it wont be unlockable after this SO UNLOCK IT WHILE YOU CAN! FROM ONE BETA TESTER TO ANOTHER! Its been such a fun ride, and ill keep using this for a long long while. Thank you Aincrad for being a stable place in my life.

Like any device meant to create simplicity, it takes time to setup and it can be complicated to do that at times. Same with any smart home, when setting it up, it can be frustrating trying to sync everything, but once it works, your life is easier.

I use the menu system as a way to make my life easier and my computer cleaner. Navigation for my computer is faster and much more organized using this software. I have discord, GOG Galaxy, and other assorted applications that I want open in my computer regularly, all set to boot using the menu by changing the directory the icons are assigned at default.

The software requires time and attention and can be good if you give the time it needs for setup and plugin management. However, the software not being primarily English obviously makes using this software to it's full extent, difficult. This is something that needs to be addressed by the developers, and if it is, I can give a solid and good recommendation. This isn't just English, but translation for multiple languages is necessary.

However even with 2,500 hours into this app, I feel as though because it is not fully translated, I am limited from the apps full capability. If the devs can translate and add more personalization as opposed to plugin supported theme options to change the game theme from SAO to GGO, I would be able to give it a good recommendation once these issues are addressed. There are not enough guides for full customization or personalization, and the settings menu is not extremely intuitive. These are my complaints, but overall, I use this every day and only offer criticisms because I would like to see it improve.",1657224609,1657224609,False,15,1,0.636967003345489502,0,True,False,True

edit:
SAO Utils has a big potential, but i dont know what kind influenced the dev to never update until now, this game/app has a lot of support by people who bought it as a support (donation) to further develop it, so that until now there are still many who want to use it. but the features are still just that, so people might get bored for the future. and a lot of people who upload workshop content for games to make still alive, it shows that users care about this game.

that's all this review update, maybe I'll update if it's needed. thank you for taking the time to read my review

Still waiting some new feature, i hope it wont be long, i know the dev is refactoring all asset to make more good to use. we're been told to be patience for that. i write this review again because we receive update dev notes 2 days ago. the dev still have some new refactor and new content to show us. cant wait use new feature soon :)

To be honest, this is like extra visuals for your desktop. If configured correctly, it can act as some good-looking shortcuts to Steam and such. Otherwise, there is the health bars which indicate CPU, RAM, and GPU usage but i'm not too sure on the last one.
Anyway, if this all sounds interesting to you, get it. I highly recommend such a cool little software. There is actually a free version of this on the web, but steam workshop exists here. Getting mods elsewhere is pretty sketch imo, so use the free one at your own risk. I've tried it but I have to say this one is slightly better overall.

Currently, this is a fantastic looking system, and though I don't find myself using the menu, music, and chat systems that this software, I still think this is a great option if you're looking for something to spice up your desktop.

I never really used the chat option, since I'm sure many people in the west aren't familiar with QQ, but if there was some kind of integration with Twitter or Discord, that would be the icing on top of the cake for a large amount of people. Maybe some integration with Spotify would be fantastic too, but I'm not sure how difficult it would be to add all of this in.

Overall, I highly recommend. I'm now patiently waiting for that VR version that was shown a while ago.

It's overall pretty easy to use and navigate, although I didn't fully understand some design choices and customizing it was kind of a pain at first. The E-mail system in this was a bit confusing at first too.

It's not very resource heavy, the CPU and Ram usage is surprisingly low. I am running this together with Wallpaper Engine and the difference between having both on or off is minimal.
It works really well with my dual monitor setup. Unfortunately, I had it crash once, but that is something I can tolerate as long as it doesn't happen regularly.

The most irritating thing is seeing all the other reviews of people who seem to not understand many parts of the software or call it unusable by users from the west.
The browser is being closed by clicking the icon in the top left, I don't know why. I found that out pretty fast since that's the first thing I tried when searching for the 'x' to close, but I get that it's not really obvious. It may be a cool design choice, if it was explained or mentioned somewhere at all.

Also, people are talking about this needing a translation, which is confusing since the software is fully in english for me. Seriously, in all my time using it I didn't find anything in japanese aside from a single button in the menu. That said, this button just brings you to an japanese website and that japanese writing you see is just the name of the site. That one weird window that's on the top left when you first boot up that probably shows which animes are on TV at which time can be set to english by pressing the 'i' icon left of the refresh button in the top right. Upon pressing a window is shown in which you should place a hook at 'Prefer local translation name'.",1546529357,1546529609,True,11,1,0.669385969638824463,0,True,False,True

The software looks nice but a con is that all the links they have is in chinese and even the event logs i hope in a later update they translate these for the english users so we can enjoy the full thing without understanding what they say. Other than that it runs well and seems great.

Also a sugestion for the developers, maybe think about adding an option to the chat room where you can select what language chat room you can join. Right now its a bunch of chinese and few english, but if you have different chat rooms then it would be easier to talk to people who speak and understand the same langauge as you.",1521247661,1521319538,True,3,0,0.536156058311462402,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-You can switch between 2D & 3D interface
-It has a server where you can talk to people in the world
-You can put your photo on the screen (I think you should use PNG files for this)
-It has 2 themes so far (SAO and GG0)
-Has VR feature
-3D browser look sick as f**k
-And it's fairly cheap

Now let's talk about the cons.

Cons:
-We all know that we need an english patch
-Took some time to understand how things works
-It may decrease your fps tremendously
especially with the 3D feature

It can do almost everything that you normally would do, but in a more awesome way! It has its own website(or that's what im guessing), it has a media player(supposedly, i cant find a way to get it working, but hey...its still in beta!), and it has just general information you'd need like: weather, humidity, etc.
I really have no words for how good and amazing it looks, but almost everything is in japanese! And i couldn't understand anything(exept for the parts that are in english ofc).

I definetly reccommend this to a huge fan towards SAO or for just any weeb really...but beware, you probably can use it to its full extent unless you can read japanese(at least for now).
