The Good
The game looks a little better than wrc 6.

The game runs better.

It’s easy.


The Bad
It feels like wrc 6. Having played wrc 6 and 7 back to back in a couple of days, instead of waiting a year for another release, to me, it’s just wrc 6. They used the same assets and maps for most of the game as far as I can tell. Physics feel a little different though.

The career mode is boring.

The game has an error pop up ingame when you load into the main menu.

Recordings I made at 1080p for the game are still 22+ gigs.


Conclusion
Because it just felt like a copy and pasted job of wrc 6, I decided to not even play the game for more than 2 hours. I have more games to play.",1708485103,1708485103,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

physic of WRC5 and 6 was good enough to don't hurt your gameplay and i can say that was fine in overall. but here in WRC7, physic is like something that developer never heard about. your car bounce over the place's like a fidget ball and the level design just make it more horrible. not to mention that even goes much fun when you see car spinning in air because of 5cm rock.

reset on track that i talked about in WRC5 and 6 review, got his way to another level in some stages of WRC7, now its randomly reset you even if you where in middle of the road.

graphic and visual part of the game didn't change, they used same texture of WRC6 just with more grasses and tree. the lighting is worst part of it.

gameplay and handling now far away from being realistic and can't even say its arcade.

lets talk about the reason that convinced me to not talk about improvements : [u]Achievements[/u]
there is a fookiyung achievements that wants you to drive 5000 Km and the fun part is it didn't count in online. [h1]WTF[/h1]
500 Km on snow and there is only 4 stage available for it :)

+ Graphical effects are noticeably better, especially lighting
+ Tracks are not completely flat anymore, surfaces have contours and texture now

- Man it gets repetitive after a while, not least because...
- ... tracks repeat too often again, as they did in WRC 6. Also, beyond improving the textures and track surface contours, most stages are actually just copy-pasted from WRC 6. This wouldn't be a problem if the stages were real, but with fantasy tracks this feels cheap and lazy (or low development budget, at best). AND...
- ...No extra cars to give the game some longevity. Oh there is a Porsche DLC available for 4.99€, but this isn't what I mean by extra cars.

I went into this expecting a different kind of challenge, hoping to have fun figuring out the trails, looking at gorgeous vistas and basically try something new and fresh to me, at the price of a coffee (90% discount purchase). I will summize:
Pros:
- Great onboarding experience I was impressed by the UX of it all, audiovisual cues, test drive to determine driver level, contextual questions beforehand etc. I am playing on all things beginner basically, and it's definitely manageable. Most of the time (played like 20-30 stages by now) I am first by a large margin, but sometimes I come in 2-4 place or just clutch the W with a second to spare.
- Trails are pretty diverse in terrain and length and I've ridden on all surfaces now before writing this. 
- Very fun and somewhat challenging to figure out the core mechanics of driving, but I will say achieving a desirable level (top 1-3 placements) happened  faster than I anticipated.
- You can turn of HUD separately, as well as control different volume categories for the sounds.
- Cars look pretty good, despite the lack of customization.

Cons:
- Multiplayer is not only dead, but the server is not online even. So zero opportunity to find out how it plays online. Shame, they should take a page out of Dark Souls franchise here.
- Graphics are amazing for 2017 but they certainly show their age, esp vegetation. Still passable but immersion is 8/10 for me. 
- Zero visual customization, you get a choice out of 1-3 vehicles thus far (I played a 2 year season with one vehicle and now started a diff season in a new class with a new vehicle.)

Short & sweet, if I think of something else that's important I'll chuck it in later. Definitely give this game a try if you're on the fence, it's currently the best bang-for-buck according to my criteria out of the whole franchise in any category (apart from the latest game, for which I don't have an opinion yet as I'm not their target demographic. Might give it a go in 1-2 years on a steep discount.)",1699310044,1699310044,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sound design is amazing. You can hear all the ambient and environment sounds, gravels and pebbles hitting the underside of your car. The car sounds are pretty basic but they sound believable and realistic enough. Definitely doesn't sound like vacuum cleaners. *cough* WRC 10/Generations *cough*

Physics are a bit off but for the more casual players on gamepad, this is the one for you. Very easy to control yet it doesn't feel like the game is handholding you with assists. In fact, you still need to learn how to control your throttle, brakes and steering. It's just very gamepad friendly compared to the new ones from WRC 8 onwards.

It says I've only played for 8 hours here. That's because I bought the game a second time on this Steam account so that I can play both the vanilla and modded version. The game is THAT good. In fact, I also bought WRC 8 and 9 TWICE for the same reason.

Give KT a chance. They're great at what they do but time and money against them. Had Nacon pour all the resources and money they can to KT, I'm sure Generations could have had the same success as 7 did.",1699163711,1699163711,True,12,0,0.673366785049438477,0,True,False,False

Nearly every track is a visual feast due to its meticulous environmental splendor.

I think that, to an extent, people are accustomed to giving this series a hard time.

Most tracks feel like bicycle trails filled with vietcong booby traps. 
Trees, rocks and bystanders convincingly placed in spots you most likely will enter, exit or just clip during cornering, all designed to make it harder.
Tracks so narrow you cant even boge or else you will clip something and flip 180 or rollover! 
Game eventually becomes fun when you learn stages layout and how to properly set up car, it takes time but fortunately graphics,sound and stages design is so great that it encourages to play.

I wish Dirt Rally 2.0 had some of this games courses, because the actual tracks I've tested on are nice, and the physics feel pretty good until you need to get the car to turn in and slide. Any throttle input at all induces immediate understeer, and it basically ignores the hand brake. 

I'd say, physics are probably close to Dirt 4 over all when it comes to the lack of cars being able to rotate properly, though better, because at least these cars don't yaw from the center like they did in dirt 4.

It's not a bad game, but personally the handbrake issue just kills it for me, too many tight turns that I feel like I'm driving a bus instead of a rally car around.",1674000757,1674000757,False,8,0,0.627016305923461914,0,True,False,False

Rally's: 13. 
Stages per rally: 4. Including Epic Stages (longer stages) and SSS. 
Cars: 14. 
Carrier: WRC Junior - WRC 2 - WRC.
Total: 52 stages.

Colin McRae 2.0 from 2000.

Arcade tracks: 6 + Japan Challenge
Cars: 10

I have felt a long time that I wanted more stages and less cars from rally games and I thought WRC would be a solution. 

The real World Rally Championship  have 13 rallys 2023 with a range from 17 to 20 stages each. I can imagine to cut some of the graphics to achive that. 

Otherwise I would recommend beginners to try this game. It is fun, have variation with tarmac, snow, gravel and mud and is very forgiving with mistakes.

The negative: 
It is to few stages on each rally. Specally when you have 5 stages and you have to drive the same stage twice or drive the Epic Stage which is really a combination of two stages. Or drive a stage backwards. It feels cheap and you just want to move on. 

I dont feel so much different from car to car. 

It is a leap from Beginner to Medium. I could win with 30 seconds on every stage but when I changed to Medium I could be 8 seconds behind. 

I would want a more dynamic co-driver. He reads every instruction normally. I want to hear some passion when he says HAIRPIN RIGHT! So I as a driver knows that something serious is coming our way.

The multiplayer seems dead. Havent worked seen I bought it. But the leaderboards seems to still work.

I've been playing for the majority of that time on ps4 gamepad on Hard difficulty and Pro settings. I managed to climb up to WRC championship through career mode, but this is where the stuff gets really hard. IF you want to be at the top of the game and beat drivers like Neuville and Ogier you have to drive extremely well, and when I mean well I mean REALLY FUCKING GOOD. You can't fuck around and lose time on stupid shit, otherwise you'll be left in the dust. Career as it's whole is monotonous, you get to set up your car for the races, objectives can be misleading for newcomers, some ""media"" inputs, nothing major. Graphics are ok, nothing outstanding just fine. What I really hate about the game is that offroad parts surrounding actual track are for some reason really fucking rigid like you're driving in a quarry, and just hitting it by a fraction of a car flips you in the air. Physics are absolutely busted, KT Racing really messed up in that sector. All in all, WRC7 is a decent game and I give it a pass, but I can't say that it pissed me off more times than I can count.

This game is also a RALLY game, not a RACING game, they are two completely different generes. in one you drive as fast as you can. in the other you listen to what the co-driver says, and carefully (or recklessly) drive down the track following his instructions. m'kay? don't bother reading most of the negative reviews, as they don't state why they think it's a bad game. it's not, just for a niche audience, 

I got this game for my dad, and decided to try it out for myself, and to be frank with you, it's a blast. I love how sensitive you need to be to not crash after 2 seconds from start. 

Now if you look at the reviews, this game was made for a steering wheel. Which, i mean is kinda obvious, looking at the third video here, however the game is perfectly playable with a controller. This game was clearly made for people who are a fan of this series and/or rallying in general, and thus is made for those people who, probably has a steering wheel. if you want something more beginner friendly play DiRT Rally or some shit.

Edit: All right folks some of you have said that IF you are good at driving THEN you can drive good with a keyboard, i mean, sure i guess. And yes Madmonkey68 good keyboard controls for the old games is kind of a given, controllers for pc racing games weren't that common back then as it is now, so keyboard controls isn't as much of a big focus point now. i'm not using this as an excuse for my driving abilities in any way shape or form, i know i suck at driving games, and i embrace that. most of my playing time is with my dad or someone else.",1561508184,1658345861,True,169,9,0.82062762975692749,10,True,False,False

The physics engine in this game is dreadful, or rather the handling of the car itself.
It really feels like trying to maneuver a sit-in lawnmower down a gravel-y hill. And funny enough - tarmac is even worse.
I get the point that realism is a big thing in rallye games, but when there neither a semblence of speed, the feeling of do-or-die cornering nor any type of understandable vehicular behavior...then there is no realism in that at all and, what makes matters much more severe, no fun either.

Heck, my Audi A3 with 125hp in real life feels more nimble and quick then this game's rallye cars.
R A L L Y E    C A R S  !
You should be able to take a corner at 30km/h without the turn radius of an 18-wheeler.
You should also feel like you're driving at 140km/h when...well, you're driving at 140km/h.
And lastly, you should feel like your life depends on taking a corner well, because that is a big part of what makes rallying so interesting and unforgiving.

Also, but much on the smaller side of things:
- Graphics are underwhelming - not terrible, to be fair, but certainly not good even for release date standards
- Narrator/Announcer/Bloke who does not shut his gullet for a second gets annoying very quickly
- Co-Drivers are voiced less coherently then in Colin McRae Rallye 3 on PS2 (I wish I was kidding)
- Camera is somewhat weird, but that may very well be very subjective criticism
- Career mode (and tbh the whole design) seems a bit bland and soulless
- Borderless Window isn't available in 1440p (cmon lads...)

It is pretty unusual for me to criticize a game this harshly but it sure is a let-down.
I, again, got it as a bargain and for 2-3 euros, it's aight. But when I think about the fact that even the Offroad segments in Need for Speed Payback felt more like Rallye to me than this does...

If you really just cannot physically stop yourself from buying this game, at least do so at a very, VERY discounted price.

[CO-DRIVER]
The Co-Driver instructions are superior to Dirt Rally 2 but the voices are worse.
The corner instructions on top have all the other little things you might have missed in the voice, giving you knowledge of the corners ahead.

[CARS]
This is a game called WRC so don't expect to be driving historical cars like Subarus, the car choices are alright and defo fit WRC.

[CAR SELECTION]
What I hate about Formula 1 appears in this game, you get to drive as one of the drivers instead of yourself, both Dirt Rally games (one coming out 2015 and another 2019 2 years after this game) have the ability for you to select out of 9 liveries (even though that's not much) and let you choose your character name, nationality etc but this game doesn't, instead wanting you to select a team, which is the biggest downside of this game in my opinion of my 0.6 hours of playing (btw if you're wondering that is quite a long time)

[TRAINING]
I'm not new to racing games and I have a G29, but this game would be frustratingly hard for anyone who drives with keyboard or controller at the start, as there is no freeroam area. Even I struggled to learn it (but that's normal when playing a new game) although I've started doing good.

[START TUTORIAL]
It's a pretty bad tutorial at the start of the game. 

[UI]
What the hell? This is the worst UI design and control schemes I've seen in my entire life I swear.

[CUSTOM CHAMPIONSHIPS]
Custom championships suck ass in this game, not allowing you select what stages you want to run, instead running randomly selected stages which is annoying.

[TRACKS]
This is this is the only thing it has over base game Dirt Rally and Dirt Rally 2, the amount of different countries is nice and large, with way longer and more demanding stages than those of Dirt Rally 2.

[GRAPHICS]
Yikes, even though this game came out 2 years after Dirt Rally 1 it still has worse graphics than it, although graphics are not the expectation in racing games so it doesn't matter much, it's easy to get used to.

[OVERALL]
I will def keep this game if I ever get bored of Dirt Rally or have no other car games to play. Currently I am in no rush to play it more but I will to refine this review. It's not the best but it's also not the worst",1625912906,1625912906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Comparing to the Loeb Rally EVO it seems that it has different driving model. it's definitely a bit more realistic. It’s not a simulator, but you can feel it’s different character. And it's still very pleasant, you only have to get used to it.

Tracks are nice and narrow. And quite long... thankfully not too long.
I really like cockpit camera and pilot notes customization, manual start and manual switching headlights and wipers.

Unfortunately there are no older/historic cars, only current season models – not much to choose from. :(
There is really poor sense of speed. You drive 100 km/h and you wonder why you can't take simple ""3"" turn... because you think that you drive only 50 km/h...  You have to get used to it.

Game is a bit sterile indeed - but it’s nice, runs smooth, looks good, sounds good... Game doesn’t provide [b]the same kind of fun[/b] as Milestone's productions. But it's still very entertaining and in the same time it's accessible for the less experienced drivers for whom DiRT Rally was too hard. It's more serious than Milestone games.

I enjoy playing rally games, but I'm far from a pro at it. I'm a casual rally player, and thus enjoy games that are more casual in nature to match my skills. I started out with Colin McRae Rally 2 when I was a wee child, and then continued from there. My most played game was CMR 2005, but then dabbled into Dirt 3, Dirt 4, and finally Dirt Rally. Of these, I enjoyed Dirt 4 the most due to the smooth controls (while Dirt Rally was absolutely uncontrollable - and don't tell me it's because it's a simulator, real life cars can go in a straight line without going off the road unlike the cars in that game) among other notable points. However the random generated tracks became stale after a while (due to being really sterile and soulless, no notable features and such), so I started looking at other games too. 

Thus I arrived to WRC 7, as it was a recommended game. It's officially licensed, and the tracks are supposed to be true to real life. I cannot verify this, as I did not walk or drive on those roads, but they are pretty well done, and enjoyable to play. They are varied, look really nice, and in some cases I felt like I was driving on something like a Far Cry map. One thing to note is that the forests of Germany look a bit like the jungles of Vietnam. 

Now on to the cars. Unfortunately the selection is rather small, as only those are present that took place in the WRC 2017 series if I understand correctly. This is a huge negative point for me, as rally games' staples for me were the Ford Escort Mk I-II, the Lancer Evo, the Ford Focus, Subaru Imprezza, all the classic rally cars. Sadly these are not present, and the newer cars leave me somewhat cold. They control well, and they are different enough to have to experiment with what fits your playstyle, but still. 

The career mode is fine, however I enjoyed the team management aspects of Dirt 4. 

To summarize - the game is good, especially if you want lot of different tracks and don't mind the small roster of cars. However if there was a game with a lot of vehicles and a similar track selection and decent controls...that would be a dream coming true.",1576950771,1611854683,False,0,0,0.482758641242980957,0,True,False,False

Cons: The driving model is not as good as in DiRT4, in DiRT4 you can almost feel the movement of the car making the  driving more intuitive, in WRC7 you don't have this feedback so driving feels off. The copilot is not very good and the voice acting is bad, almost like an smarphone app voice. You can't own your car or create your team. The interface, music and the general mood of the game is more cool in DiRT4 than in WRC7.

If you sim race with a wheel, get Dirt Rally 2.0, if you like more arcade racing, get Dirt4 (technically Dirt 4 is a brick too but at least Codemasters understand the player base and other wheels are recognized), pass on this crud. Setting up a wheel in this game is not possible. Codemasters and other developers actually implement in-game support for multiplayer control platforms for different sim wheels. Apparently KT Racinging & Bigben developers are unaware of fanatec, thrustmaster and other manufacturers. You would think, with the fantastic wheels coming out, from gear based, belt, or direct drive, you would ASSUME that a developer making a racing game would AT LEAST make their title compatable with thrustmaster, fanatec, and AccuForce. Sadly, this is not the case. If you own anything other than a G27 wheel, pass on this POS. A developer that cant even make high end wheels compatible with its DRIVNG GAME. But they wont hesitate to put microtransactions in though.

DO NOT SUPPORT LAZY&GREEDY DEVELOPERS LIKE THESE

UPDATE - well it looks like the money hungry sociopaths proved me right, not only did they attempt to make a rally racing sim, corner the WRC market THEN not even implement decent hardware support or VR?? How the hell do you release a driving sim in 202 with no VR support AND start selling the new game when the current release is crap???

Let's just concentrate on the important: driving and presentation. Licensed cars, authentic locations, career mangement are all irrelevant if you fail the first two. I will also use comparison to other popular games to illustrate these issues better. Maybe I can save someone a few bucks.

First, a bit of background. I am more of a 'driving enthusiast' then a gamer and mostly play only sims and simcades. I solely use a steering wheel for driving. My experience with using a steering wheel in rally games, to narrow the field, goes decades back to original Colin McRae Rally. Since then I have squeezed out the living soul of it's every following instance including the later DiRT and DiRT Rally series (except DR2, I have a serious resentment towards Codemasters politics regarding this title). Albeit that, my all-time rally favorite is Richard Burns Rally, still unmatched in 2020. If you are like me you played them all, the good ones and the bad ones, and now you are looking for more. Well, I'm sorry to say but there aren't any when rallying is concerned. WRC series is the perfect example of developers continuing incompetence to produce a quality rally driving experience. You do know that all the awards this title got are just politics and have nothing to do with actual playability or sim community acceptance? Well they are, and if you're old enough as me you've seen this happen many times in the history of gaming, especially of late.

Overview:
- It is a console port. The entire series was developed for console which just proves how shortsighted the developer is.
- All cars have exactly the same handling. Which is a combination of drunk elephant and a bathtub, depending on the track.
- Graphics are attrocious. Murky and clunky, plaqued with all the wrong fx effects. Much ambition, poor execution.
- Performance is simply awful. No matter if your specs overshoot game requirements by 2 generations it will run like crap regardless of the settings. Constant framerate is impossible to achieve. Well, it is a console port so this is unfortunately expected.
- Steering wheel setup and feedback is a joke. Clearly this was not developed for proper steering wheel use. 

I can see people comparing it to DiRT 4 and DiRT Rally, which in my opinion has no comparison whatsoever. Both of these games are light years ahead of this one. If anything, it compares remotely to original first DiRT, the weakest one of the series. Very remotely, DiRT is still hundred times better in all aspects. What they have in common is next-to-awful graphical presentation and clumsy car handling. At least DiRT had variety when it comes to cars and some of them were very driveable, this one has none. Regarding graphics, WRC 7 looks as if it was also designed in the mid 2000s. Not that I especially care for graphics, I mainly care about driving experience, but this is a 2017 game with dated graphics over the top slaghtered with unnecessary fx in effort to cover the flaws and to induce ""realism"" when there is none, much like DiRT. There are older games out there that look and feel immeasurably better than this one.

I honestly cannot recommend this to any seriuos driver. 
If you are new to sim racing and looking for more rallying explore older, sim community confirmed games. Richard Burns Rally for example couldn't be recommended more. It has a strong ongoing community with tons of mods, cars, tracks and updates available. The driving model has yet to be matched, let alone surpassed. It still is, even today, the benchmark of rallying sims. 
If you are experienced driver then you already know all of this and more. In case you were wandering to try WRC 7, don't bother they still can't get it right. You will refund, as I did. An' lemme tell you, demos are gettin' pretty expensive these days... ;)

Pro tip: Maybe it's time to turn to track racing at this point in time, there will be no more new good rallying titles in the near future. I know you don't want to hear that but it is what it is. There are many excellent track racing sims available, choose wisely and you won't be dissapointed. Assetto Corsa is recommended, fantastic driving model(s), highly moddable, strong community with immense quantity of available mods, has rally mods as well.

There are slight graphical upgrades and music was changed a little, but there was no changes at all: rough recreation of the courses in the various WRC rallies (J-WRC, WRC2, and WRC). The difference being J-WRC runs weaker FWD vehicles and only a few rallies, WRC2 runs mid-graded AWD vehicles and more rallies, and WRC runs full-powered AWD vehicles and the full schedule. Everything stayed the same. 

Having played Dirt series and Dirt Rally series, I find the vehicles in WRC series extremely sure-footed. Collision almost always results in a horizontal spin rather than any vertical motion, and damage model is rather minimal, even at pro difficulty, with a 50 mph centerline tree hit merely results in bumper damage. 

Driving-wise, the cars just feels extremely stable at the default config, and the additional setup seems to have very little effect. On the other hand, the car adjustment interface left a lot to be desired. One must create a ""custom race"" to experiment with different setups, and only a few set configurations (tarmac, gravel, snow, etc.) are allowed. You can adjust a config further on stage, but you can't seem to save them as custom configs. 

The extra vehicles, only available in custom games, such as the R-GT cars, doesn't really feel that different. 

One thing I don't like... the ""Driving Test"" appears to be WAY TOO HARD and classifying the drivers wrong. According to the ""Driving Test"", I scored like a 50, and was relegated to ""semi-pro"". But I was able to race comfortably at ""pro"" level and putting up competitive times (even winning a rallies in J-WRC and WRC2) 

I did not race online, and the additional content server is no longer available. Other than custom races with the full suite of vehicles (including bonus ones), there are no alternate content. 

One thing new to WRC7 is ""news"". Back at racing HQ after finishing a rally, you get ""news"" that speculates how well you'll do in the new season, reports on your failures and successes, and so on, and ""competitor message"" which either congratulates you or vow to beat you in the future, or gloat over their win over you. It's a bit of ""meh"" as it has very few variations. I'd rather seen them as new reports after each stage, honestly. 

The tracks are varied and provides plenty of different challenges, such as hairpins, chicanes, jumps, narrow bridges, gates, and so on. But once you've ran the stages a few times, you'd have learned them. Sure, how you approach them with different vehicles would be a little different, but the overall idea would be the same... And many stages were recycled at different times of day for other stages, or large sections of track was reused to create another stage. So you actually don't have that many genuinely new tracks. 

All in all, WRC7 feels like an add-on pack for WRC6 rather than a full-fledged product.",1593780253,1593780536,False,70,4,0.844015777111053467,0,True,False,False

Now, I've not really played a WRC game since WRC4, back when Milestone Srl was the developer. I've an admitted DiRT bias. I figured I'd give another shot to KT Racing. 

I consider the WRC series to be the most direct competition to DiRT, the main DiRT series. Not necessarily the DiRT Rally series. I have a host of problems with DiRT Rally 2 but those are largely due to their monetization practices. 

[h1]Juxtaposed to DiRT 4, this game is comparable. Except where it counts; the part where you're actually driving.[/h1]
The career mode has sponsor deals, crew management including morale based on performance as well as a plethora of offerings to customize your experience. But, the physics are just nonsensical. If you play it as a sort of casual off-roading game it's quite fine. Especially if you like driving around like you've covered your tires in soap. But, as far as a simulation... It's just not up to par. 

[i][b]THE GIST:
As a passionate Rally fan. (At least of rally games, I don't pay much attention to the real sport.) The actual driving, the part where you're playing the game and not just bustling about in the menus is what's really important. And while DiRT Rally 2 doesn't offer much in the way of sponsor deals or crew management or really even a traditional career mode, racing is what it comes down to, and WRC just hasn't found the right amalgam yet.[/b][/i]

Pros

Handling feels nice and the stages are interesting and challenging. Random events are interesting with the rare appearance of broken down competitors on the stage. Endurance stages are a great feature. Sense of speed is good and a completing a stage feels like an achievement. The game sets realistic team goals for a more authentic real world WRC experience.

Cons

Co-driver note reading needs some work, with the occasional call out not matching the turn (e.g ""Right 3, Don't cut"" but fails to mention a hidden cliff edge at the exit) Sometimes on the rally cross stages the car gets reset even though the car didn't leave the track-- very annoying. ""AI"" stage times are laughably slow at times.
The damage model is a bit too forgiving.

The feel & feedback from track to wheel is none existent & very disappointing.
The physics are useless & nothing like the real thing' dealing with the instant uncontrollable torque is like trying to steer a rocket on ice...
For most of the time it feels like an uncontrollable chore trying to keep the car on track......not very rewarding  & the effort needed to play is far from enjoyable.
 Messing around in the setting has little effect...
THIS IS AN ARCADE GAME....no doubt about it..
Probably great on a control pad' but in my point of view that kinda defeats the object of 'sim racing'

INPUT LAG was one of the biggest problems that I give up this game after total 1 hour experience. It takes me some time to fix it, but still it happens. I doubt it why players on streaming (probably PS4) were playing so smooth. It is really difficult that I have to predict different turns with 1 sec delay to the steering wheel, probably my bad sports vision I just can't handle it.
Steering feedback is bad, I nearly can't feel anything from the steering wheel except the strong centering feedback force against my arm during my car is turning.
No H-shifter and clutch. Let me take it personally, i know modern rally cars are sequential transmission, but I really like the way that Dirt Rally games can let you switch between automatic / sequential / h-shifter (you can do this while driving on the road).

Besides of those cons, something in WRC 7 really makes me impressed.

Since there are a lot of crests and blind turns or blind jumps I expect the co-driver to tell me to which side of the road lean on to approach the next corner, but he never does. I mean, I can see the jump, could you tell me useful information instead of ""oh, there is a jump""?! The fun fades away when you lose precious time (a lot of) because you hit spectators in idiotic (and also prohibited in real rallies) spots and when you end up too far from the road after a mistake. Making three mistakes costs you around 30 seconds, and considering that the average length of a stage is 4 minutes that is an enormous amount of time to give an idea. It feels like this game was made to punish the player in every way possible; i know i am a bad driver, the fuck you want developers?

The cars
There are effectively 3 cars. Yeah I know there are more but all of the cars above J WRC feel the same

The driving
The cars lack feeling when I drive them. No sense of traction or surface feel. Everything feels like you are floating everywhere. For instance on the one track (In Poland I think) there is a bit where it became super lose compared to the rest of the stage. I went over the surface slowly and there was no visual or feeling change over the section. Back to the feeling. I think it could be better with a physics redo but I do not see that happening. 

The tracks
The only redeeming fact about this game is that the tracks are plentiful and there is variety. 

A comparison to Dirt Rally 2.0
Dirt has many more vehicles to choose from with all of them feeling different even within the same class (Dirt wins)
Dirt has a better physics model and you can feel things happening to your car while you drive (Dirt wins)
WRC 7 has a better stock location selection but Dirt you can now buy more locations (WRC wins)

This is clearly a better experience than all other WRC titles I've played in the past few days so far. Is it better than Dirt Rally though? A game that came out 2 years before.

Let's get to the most important aspect first: The driving.
I don't dislike it. I thought WRC 6 was too weighty, the cars were too easy to control, but every corner felt like a fight against gravity. Maybe that's more realistic, but eh. WRC 7 has a floatier, driftier feel, which makes cornering much more enjoyable. Though it also has a weird acceleration feeling that seems very unrealistic. The cars are still ridiculously easy to control, even with all assists off. I think Dirt Rally still nailed it better by a long shot, because the cars felt heavy and powerful, you couldn't just slide into a corner, you had to put some effort into it, but then it actually felt great. This on the other hand feels a lot more arcady. Not necessarily bad, just know what you're getting into.

Difficulty: Still a mess. I also can't figure out a difference between hard and hardcore difficulties...I can pretty much achieve the same positions in both. Maybe there's a rewind feature I've missed? The older ones had them and upping the difficulty also disabled that, but also made the enemy pilots way better. This doesn't seem to be the case here. Veterans will be bored very quickly, because even for a noob like me the hardcore difficulty is barely a challenge (meaning I can comfortably come in in the upper tiers, a veteran should be able to win every race with ease).

Graphics: Really good actually. Lighting, weather effects, track design...all pretty neat. Dust clouds are almost non-existant though.

Cockpit view is still bad imho.

Tracks and cars: Now this is the BIGGEST problem this game has. For starters, as with WRC 6, the car selection is just pitiful...A Ford, a Skoda, a Hyundai, a Citroen and a Peugeot, as well as a Mini and a VW from the ""classic"" list (where you only race against 3 other racers...great, because everything has to be according to teams). This is pointless for a rally game, since all of those cars share pretty much the same characteristics: same weight, same HP, similar handling, because of similar build...etc. There's not much reason to experiment, unlike in DR where you can select from a vast variety of very different looking, sounding and feeling cars from all epochs.

The locales are the exact same as in WRC6 with individual tracks being a tad different I think. The good thing is that every locale, every stage feels unique and great. Elevation, surface texture, all that is great. What isn't great, however, is that every locale (bar Monte Carlo) only has TWO stages (MC has 3, because it has no super special stage, which is basically just a short circuit nobody needs). And you have an ""epic"" stage, which is for the most part just the previous special stages cobbled together. There is no mirroring, no backwards racing, nothing. Believe me, you will get bored very soon between the non-existant number of cars and the limited amount of tracks.

You might say that other racing games offer way fewer tracks and you'd be correct, but most racing games also have you race against other cars and not against a clock. I think this game needs at least 2 more stages per locale more. That might be a lot to ask, I know, but instead of re-releasing this game every year with the same content, they could simply work on an all-encompassing WRC game and go from there with DLCs and updates, like Dirt Rally 2 does it (without the scummy practice of re-releasing tracks from Dirt Rally 1 for additional money).

And they've also combined daytime and weather effects into 1 setting, so now you can't race with snow at night in Sweden, because apparently it only ever snows at dawn there. Say what?

A nice effort, but not worth it in a world where Dirt Rally (and now 2) exists.",1575218062,1575218062,False,8,1,0.635942399501800537,0,True,False,False

As with most Rally Games the pacenotes are not great... for the most part they're not even good.
I'm loving the tracks/courses, they're far wider and longer than you would find in the Dirt franchised games and I find them a lot more technical in terms of having to pay attention to what you're doing... there is very little flat out sections where your car runs out of rpm. And on a HUGE plus side unlike The Dirt franchise.. every rock, tree, bump, dip, pebble, shrub and blade of F'ing grass hasn't been deliberately placed in such a way along the track for the pure purpose of wrecking your run.
The physics are to a certain extent quite rubbish... as a person who has had the misfortune of being in more than one catastrophic vehicle misadventure... I assure you... the floaty, flying, spinning, dancing all round laughable vehicle behaviour is absolutely rubbish in terms of what actually happens to a car when it rolls, spins or flips end over end(I have real world experience.. I don't recommend it)

The cars do seem overly ""grippy"" on occasion but remain pleasing to drive and throw around, However it sometimes feels like you're driving a train.
But my biggest pet hate is the ""in car"" audio... every single one of these cars sound like you're driving a hairdryer... there is no throaty rumble from the exhaust when you gear down... speaking of gears... clutch support... maybe I'm just overlooking a setting somewhere... but there is no use of a clutch... not that I've found anyway.
There is no head tracking support... which for someone like me that likes the ability to look out my side window while going sideways around a bend ... it sucks.. you can't adjust your seating position either... ie. higher/lower/closer/further which is a bit of a bummer but no major issue.

Car setup is definitely lacking, for new comers that don't really have a clue... figuring out what to do to make your car behave better for your driving style... not easy! and not particularly detailed either.

Lastly force feedback, I have an older Logitech G27 which I love(I see no reason to upgrade as it works 100%)
It took me the better part of 90 minutes worth of mucking about with the settings and FFB before I got it to even remotely feel like I was driving... and it's still pretty crappy but I can live with it.

So... should you buy or avoid... my 2 cents! I'm enjoying it a whole lot... it looks good, it's fun, it runs well on my pc and despite all the things I don't like about it... there are more than enough about the game I do like that I would recommend it to ""some"" of my friends because I know what they like and expect from a Rally sim.",1573491326,1573491326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The stages became prettier, more demanding and longer, but at the expense of actual miles of avaliable roads - the ""epic"" stages are basically a combination of two other stages with some extra parts added. The career mode is very simple and has pretty much no depth - this was finally much improved in WRC 8, but it will remain unavailable on Steam until next year.

Stages are real life replicated, very pretty and the highlight of the game. Surfaces change during stage from, snow to ice, mud to light gravel etc. This is credible and makes the game simulate the real WRC enviroments accurately.

The Cars are WRC only with no historics etc but tarmac handling is good and very quick. Gravel handling is OK and completely servicable. Suspension and steering are good with bound/rebound  ans steering geometry are simulated well but the weight transfer and cars momentum are too minimal for the friction of the non tarmac roads. The cars should slide in the direction of travel much more, like in real life and the FFB does not communicate the angels through the wheel very well. The FFB is , again, servicable but if you used to other racing sims , you will be missing the feedback  that makes it feel more intuative , like you feel in real cars.

From a sim-racing perspective the game could be improved with these implimentations:
1. True to life car weight and momentum ( especially on gravel) translated through more realistic FFB.
2. Function to completely adjust cockpit camera to suit seated position to screen in real life, up/down in/out left/right etc..
3. Multiple USB inputs need to be available for separate Handbrake/button box etc.
4. Support for current VR headsets! Significant amount of immersion in the cockpit in VR and would help the game stand out as a true attempt at simulating the real experience of being a WRC Driver.
5. In depth career mode with vehicle upgrades and team management, for are more complete experience.

So I would recommend the game for fans of the WRC, and players wanting to experience the closest thing possible to driving a WRC car in a WRC stage. However as a true "" racing sim"" it lacks the true-to-life handling and FFB, as well as crucial simulation options as listed above to meet the expectations of sim racing players.",1552814858,1565771702,True,5,0,0.56152045726776123,0,True,False,False

Once again, my experience seems to be completely at odds with the opinion of the internet. I have 65 hours in Dirt Rally (the first one) and I prefer WRC7 by a country mile. Guys this is a 7 pound game (in sale), and you will have at least 7 fabulous hours from it.

First, a word of warning: the controller support for this game is absolutely atrocious. I have an old wheel (actually if I'm telling the truth, it's a flight yoke). This game expects you to have an xbox 360 controller, or one of the coded-by-case-basis modern wheels. It doesn't recognize standard windows controllers through the usual channels (directx something maybe, dunno).

My first reaction was to immediately return this, but not without giving it a quick blast with keyboard controls (yes, I know). And, holy mackerel, I am having so much fun. So I reinstalled Dirt Rally, to compare it's keyboard control, just as a fair test (perhaps I'm lazy and just had never used keys before). Nope. I still MASSIVELY prefer playing this. I'm not going to go into a minute comparison, especially as the comparison should really be with DR 2.0 which I don't own. But the physics in this are amazing, I can now actually use my brakes on tarmac, there's no artificial delay between input and the wheels turning, the drifting feels perfect, and the stages (tracks) are just so lovely and stimulating. The FLOW of this game is amazing, it's tough, but doesn't punish you with concrete shrubs. When you start getting into the zone, and everything works, it feels like you're actually there.

Look, I know if you're a hardcore racing-head, you're gonna be playing Dirt Rally 2.0 anyway, and this doesn't apply to you. However, If your looking at the price on sale and thinking ""Seven smackaroons, that looks reasonable"" then google it and decide it's a pile of pants, I'm telling you, you may potentially be missing out on some smashing good times. And for what it's worth, I prefer the physics of this compared to the original Dirt Rally. This doesn't feel arcadey to me. But sure, i'm (now) playing on keyboard, what do I know.

The physics are really solid (setups matter), the pacenotes are customizable (how many details and how fast the codriver gives them to you) and the visuals and sounds are really solid as well.

But the best aspect of this game are the tracks. Lots of small and narrow roads which results in a great sense of speed when you are blasting through the countryside. It really gives you an actual sense of pride and accomplishment when you nail a stage without any damage to your car (not the EA way).

I wish the career mode would have a bit more depth to it. It's fine but the team aspect could have been fleshed out more imo. Also something that I found slightly annoying was the fact that you couldn't change the setup of the JWRC car in the career mode. I guess they do this to not overwhelm the people that try out a rally/race game for the first time. But in my case it was kind of annoying because some of the settings during that season didn't feel optimal for my driving style.

Also I tried the game with a gamepad and steering wheel. My steering wheel isn't supported however so I would recommend anyone who is interested in buying this game to definitely check the supported peripherals on the game's website. Anyway controls with a gamepad are rock solid as well. 

Lastly a tip for anyone who starts playing this game. Use the manual transmission not automatic! I always try the automatic settings in racing games and in this one... oh man... it seems like the gearbox is constantly fighting you when you take a slow tight corner. Refusing to go into a higher gear at the right moment. I usually play with manual so this wasn't a big issue for me. But for someone who prefers automatic settings without having to think about gear changes, it's not ideal imo. That combined with the narrow courses make this game not the easiest to learn but really satisfying once you get the hang of it.

For those that are new to rally games the game is worth it if you are willing to deal with quite some challenge in terms of the gameplay (manual gearbox + narrow stages). The medium ai difficulty setting is already quite forgiving so I assume the easy setting will be ideal for new players. So you can easily learn things at your own pace.

For experienced rally fans this gets an even bigger recommendation because of its challenging stages, excellent physics and the more (I don't like to use the word but...) ""hardcore"" approach. Not necessarily in terms of the physics but more so in terms of the stages and focus on manual shifting.

[Original review]

Right out of the gate, my Logitech G920 wheel was detected and I was able to make some changes to my settings before playing. So many games throw you right into a race before being allowed to set up your wheel. Not this one. Oh and it allows me to use my Thrustmaster TH8A shifter as a handbrake as well. (edit) now I run a Thrustmaster TX  wheel with the game and it's even better.

Also, coming from WRC 4, 5 and 6, this game is quite a jump forward. Tracks are BUMPY, maybe too much so? Don't know, but I can tell you, that alone, make this game much more challenging than all the other rally games.

Tracks are narrow, with lots of hidden dangers lurking in the grass and bushes. You can't just drive off the track and then back on all the time. You will probably smash into a large rock or end up with a flat.

Not sure why people are having issues with graphics or stuttering. Game plays butter smooth on my old AMD FX 8320 (stock) with an AMD RX 480. I mean finely churned butter. I will have to check my framerates, I was too busy trying to stay on the road and enjoying these gorgeous tracks! (edit) Game defaulted to high settings with all post processing on... framerates never dropped below 60... like butter.

Highly recommended to get away from the Dirt games, which after I refunded Dirt Rally, I have lost all faith in. These guys are committed to making a good game and it shows. Whereas, Codemasters seem to be mailing it in for years now.

Surface grip matters. You will feel the difference between gliding across the dirt paths compared to hitting the tarmac and almost feeling your head being thrown back from the grip. Seriously, it's that good. There is even variation for types of dirt, mud, dug up sandy areas, etc.

This is going to take some practice. Good thing I am up for it.

(edit) game gave me amatuer settings on easy by default (cause I sucked) first stage I took the lead 12 seconds ahead, second stage 26 seconds ahead... too easy... changed to pro settings on medium... 3rd stage I came in 6th place. That's more like it. Oh and I only race in cockpit view. Never use outside camera, that's a good as cheating, if you want to race for real. Super easy when you can see way ahead of you.

Remember, when you start out, you are only WRC Junior... not at pro level yet. Which means the cars are not as good either. Get to WRC and you will love the traction and power of those 4wd vehicles.",1529818863,1558077581,True,11,2,0.595120072364807129,0,True,False,False

But the control is very much a game control. The car responds kind of like a car should, but its very clearly not a simulator.

With that caveat out of the way, this is a great little game if you just want to power around and have some fun. There are the usual career and free modes and there are a good number of vehicles to choose from and for the most part its genuinely good fun.

I think it does a lot of things well that Codemasters could learn from,  but it also suffers in other areas too.

$40 is a bit much for a game this old,  but get it on sale for $25 or less and you won't be disappointd.

Pros:
Plays extremely well on a controller
Accessible car tweaking
Long & Short stages
The car feels very grounded in reality.
A variety of locations
A good mix between Arcade and Sim gameplay
Doesn't feel like you are bouncing around on the moon like Dirt 4

Cons:
Sound design really suffers especially with cars
Picking teams and cars doesn't feel like it matters.  Everything looks and drives the same.
Colors seem to have a more muted pallet, even in ""colorful""  stages.  Sometimes everything just feels flat
The co-driver is too boring and doesn't feel like he is in the car
The menu graphics and sound could use a little polish.  Smoother animations in some part, etc.
A Team system similar to Dirt 4 would have been nice.

I recommend this game if you want something you can drop into and play for a few minutes or couple of hours.   I have not played previous WRC titles, but I am looking forward to seeing what they offer with WRC8.   The game feels a lot better than Dirt 4 which I was really disappointed with.  In WRC7  it does not feel like you are driving on the moon or struggling to keep your car on the ground.   It feels pretty good overall and you can especially notice suspension tweaks and how they affect the car.

The tweaking system could use some better writing, but overall I am able to get a good grasp and what I need to change to make the car ride or handle the way I would like.  I found the system to be slightly more accessible than  DiRT Rally and DiRT 4  

One problem that really sticks out like a sore thumb is the lack of any kind of Team system to add that additional challenge to the game.  You really just are racing for the sake of racing,  I've never had to worry about money or losing a sponsor or anything like that.  Having a Team system like Dirt 4 would make this game a lot more fun,  especially allowing perks like more durable parts, faster repair times,  stuff like that.",1556472770,1556472815,True,0,0,0.448210924863815308,0,True,False,False

Although, this is my first and only rally game and I also own Grid Autosport which I would judge as the better game.
The AI navigator in the car could have more detailed customisation as it can confuse the driver a little with its timing and can sometimes overload the driver with too much info, at least in my low experience with the game itself.

Would say it's simcade but has a lot of sim in it, iRacing still has the best feel and incar look but you're limited to rallycross.

Would like more variety of cars.

Better cockpit view and better visuals at highspeeds, things get too blurry versus 3rd person where everything is crystal clear but feels slowmo.

I recommend WRC7 with a caveat or two, if you're looking for a rally game that's as close to real in terms of physics you may want to check out Dirt Rally instead. If you're looking for a somewhat less hardcore experience, something to play with a controller, to kick back with after a hard day at work and run a stage or three then WRC7 is right up your alley. The other bit is the price, it's not worth the full $40 - especially considering that support for this title is done at this point and the next title is about to release in a couple of months, if you're interested in this one wait for a nice sale and grab it then (I got it for 6 bucks.)

Now some differences I noticed coming from hundreds of hours of Dirt Rally. Firstly the obvious, more locations but less vehicles. I definitely like that there are more than twice as many locations as Dirt Rally. The fact that there are a lot fewer vehicles to choose from is sort of good and bad IMO, bad because less choice but good because you'll end up using the same vehicle for much longer and actually get used to it. In Dirt Rally I keep switching groups and vehicles and never get to a point where I feel confident (except for when driving the classic Mini cuz I spent tons of time with this one.)

Graphically it's a lot more colorful than DR, DR is a bit gloomy - especially wales and finland. WRC7 has a lot more going on graphically - I had to turn some of the effects down even as it was almost like playing CoD or something. It's not bad looking, I can't even say worse than DR, they're just different yet both are good.

Mentioning the classic mini brings me to my biggest complaint about WRC7, not even a complaint really more like a wish. Classic vehicles. Yes, I just wrote that less vehicle choice can be a benefit but I still want those classic vehicles available. Even as DLC - perhaps DLC per group, that would be great.

I bought WRC7 specifically with the purpose of having a less hardcore than DR rally game that I can play with a controller and WRC7 (so far at least) is exactly what I was after. 

The couple of annoying things are that it didn't seem to detect my wheel so even if I do want to use it I can't. Also there's something weird happening when launching the game, sometimes it has a tendency to crash on startup without any reason given and it will keep crashing when you try to run it again. I found that restarting steam (or the PC if that doesn't work,) and setting wrc7 to launch as admin and I'm not having these issues anymore... initially I was going to refund because couldn't get into the game.

Lastly, if you're looking for a multiplayer competitive experience it seems that WRC7 is mostly done with that. The esports events have finished and I'm guessing that there will not be any more as WRC8 is coming and I checked for online lobbies each time I played and found zero each time.",1554157131,1554157131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I´ll try to make it short: It´s a good game. This is for people who look for
-Some Rally fun on very beautyful tracks
-a game they can play perfectly fine with a controller
-racing some quite challenging tracks while not being punished for every mistake they make

it is clearly not for those who are looking for another Dirt Rally, because this is not one... And imho it doesn´t have to be. 
It´s a semi-arcade game that has a medium tendency towards realism and it is totally okay that developers make such games. not everything has to be a hardcore simulation. If you want Dirt, play Dirt :D 

For WRC 8 i hope that they build upon what they have here and just make it better and don´t mess it up just because some people expect another Dirt Rally... 

Conclusion: i give it a solid Yes, especially during a sale. But better stay away if you are looking for a ""real"" experience with your 900° FFB wheel, it´s really better suited for controllers ;)  

Word of warning: It needs some beefy hardware, the nice look comes for a price!  


Deutsch:

Also, das Spiel ist gut. Ist halt ein Rallyspiel für Leute die
-die mit Rallyautos durch schöne Umgebungen brettern wollen
-ein Spiel suchen, das man wunderbar mit dem Controller spielen kann
-herausfordernde Strecken suchen, ohne für jeden kleinen Fehler bestraft zu werden

Es ist mit absoluter Sicherheit nichts für Leute, die ein weiteres Dirt Rally erwarten. Das ist es nicht und das ist auch gut so. Muss ja nicht alles eine Hardcore-Sim sein. WRC7 ist eher ein Semi-Arcade-Spiel mit einer gewissen Tendenz zum Realismus. Und ich hoffe, dass die Entwickler für WRC 8 darauf aufbauen, was sie hier haben, es einfach verbessern und nicht alles umkrempeln, nur weil ein paar Leute jammern, dass es kein Dirt Rally ist.

Ergebnis: Jop, ich geb dem Spiel ein klares Ja, besonders im Angebot. Aber lieber Finger weg, wenn Du nach der ""echten"" Erfahrung mit deinem 900° FFB Lenkrad suchst. Das ist wirklich eher ein Controller-Spiel...

The tracks are great, and offer a nice alternative to the Dirt titles. Not necessarily better or worse, but fresh. The driving is scenic, and there's a large number of tracks, some of which are 20km long.

The physics feels good once you sort out controls, and the different surfaces have different feelings. I'm always driving on ice in RL, and driving on ice in this game felt realistic.

Which leads me to my biggest gripe with this game, and why it has mixed reviews: the technical problems. The game booted up with my integrated graphics card, once I sorted that out, I spent my first two hours trouble shooting and messing around with controls to realize the game will only detect one device at a time, and my pedals weren't supported. There's limited device support, so check the list if you're keen on using a certain product. Then you'll have to mess around with sensitivity and FFB to get the game feeling right. After all that, it's finally playable, and there's a good experience waiting for you if you're patient, but the game really could have benefited by making it more accessible to PC gamers. I haven't had these problems in other driving games like PC2, Dirt series, or even Truck Simulator. I ended up playing it with a steam controller, and a G29 - and if I had just tried to use these from the beginning, I probably wouldn't have had any problems.

After the disaster that was Dirt 4 - this seventh entry in WRC is almost ok, but just almost. It still feels vastly inferior to games as Dirt Rally 1. 

Now that Dirt Rally 2.0 is out; there is absolutely no reason to recommend this game.

The graphics are pretty bad for a racing game and although the tracks are quite good the car handling is just about a little too arcadish for a rally game. It's a game for racing tourists who like games such as Need for speed and The Crew. The game punishes you too little for going slightly off road and the car seem to rubber band into track even when you should be hurled into the forest or facing the wrong way.

The team building and everything else not directly related to the actual driving feel rushed, incomplete and pointless, so does the map reading.

It's ok to just speed through the tracks once, but that's about it. No reason for staying to learn the tracks and becoming good.

And the DLC car with the rear wheel drive? Well, that isn't allowed in the game's campaign mode...

The cars feel heavy enough to seem real, but they still slide around a bit too much even at low speeds.

The game is buggy, glitchy, and crashes randomly. The physics aren't realistic and feel unbelievably like bumpercars on ice, and the co-driver is reading a mistaken script that doesn't describe the course.

Constant crashing
The community is really helpful and decent, and is to point you in the right direction regarding DX diagnostics and driver update information, but after going through a fresh W10 install with multiple different revisions of drivers, I've finally given up trying to get the game to work as it will consistently freeze on the larger career courses for seemingly no reason. I'm running a 3rd gen i5 with a 7970, the game lives on a non-windows-install SSD with 16gb of ram, and sure, this isn't the most modern card or setup available, but I'm getting 60fps+ on low settings and I'd be fine with that if it weren't for the constant crashing. I wound up opening up my case, cleaning off old thermal paste on both my cpu and gpu in an effort to see if heating was the challenge, but even with the fans cranked and thermals on the cpu at 50c-55c and the card at 50c-55c, I still had constant crashing.

Physics
There's also the physics, which are sold as 'realistic', but listen, there's no need to lecture you, go look up the videos and gifs that the community has uploaded. Flips and two wheeled driving are common. I've played multiple generations of drifter simulation games and I've never had to deal with such poorly reacting car physics.

The co-driver and the turn descriptions are dreadful. 
Lots of times you'll be given the description of ""right 9"" only to encounter a ""right 6 tightens"" which are completely different classes of turns. Incredibly frustrating and even though the voicing is tremendously well done in multiple languages, there simply isn't a direct correlation with what the co-driver is telling you and the course itself.

1.its seems a bit more forgiving than i like. i need more damage and consequece for pushing too hard.
2.i wouldnt call it a simulation game but dirt rally doesnt come close to a sim. i know its going to hurt people but its true.
3.price there never seems to be a drop in price even when its been out dated but the next wrc game.

i have most of the dirt games never looked at this due to bad reviews. after watching the esports comp i wanted to have a go. id say well worth playing. i would say buy both dirt and wrc if you can if not dare i say buy WRC. it will last way longer and stay enjoyable for longer due to way way way more stages and better esport competition.",1548855375,1548855375,True,13,0,0.619817912578582764,0,True,False,False

WRC 7 is surprisingly sim-like, WAY more a simulation than any past WRC titles. Actually I rate this game higher as a SIMULATION than the disappointing Dirt 4. (Well, Dirt 4 Rallycross was okay, but their ""physics upgrades"" effectively sucked the fun out of rallying)

[h1]PROS[/h1]

[b]STAGES[/b]

Best stages in any Rally game, period. Detailed, narrow, full of danger and surprises. Puts Dirt 4 to shame. The stages themselves are actually better than even Dirt Rally.

[b]PHYSICS[/b]

Actually, they are quite realistic. More convincing than Dirt 4, who would have thought. Not far off from Dirt Rally either (while these are modern WRC cars, so can't be directly compared to Dirt Rally), tarmac feel is actually better than Dirt Rally.

Definitely way more sim, than past WRC games. Only thing bothering me is the braking, the cars just stop a bit too easily. If you lock up, in real car you would get into more trouble than here I feel (while I haven't driven a real WRC car obviously). However, tyre wear is simulated and if you abuse the tyres (two compounds selectable, Soft and Hard) early on, you'll regret later.

People saying there isn't weight transfer are clueless.. There definitely is weight transfer, and you can use brakes to load the front and rotate car around corners. Sliding feels very natural, controlling drifts feels spot on. Steering with throttle is very much possible, unlike the terrible understeery mechanics of Dirt 4. Different surfaces truly affect the car, even overheating tyres will work like you'd assume. Tarmac, snow, wet, gravel, all feel different 

Check also this video (not mine), closely matches not only WRC 2017 car pace, but the movement over bumps and in corners: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0A2XlGsW_g
Game has also the 2016 cars. 2017 WRC season brought aero upgrades, which makes cars more planted at higher speed. You can really notice the difference in the game too.

[b]CONTENT[/b]

52 stages in 13 countries that all really look and feel different. Longest one is 23 km.

Cars are the 2016 and 2017 WRC, WRC2 and WRC Junior cars. So no historic stuff, but to be expected. Career, Custom Championships and Online challenges should offer plenty to do.

[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]

[b]FORCE FEEDBACK[/b] 

Note that Physics and FFB are a separate thing. Physics in this game are good, car moves and behaves very much like real cars. You can see that from the visual feedback. Game can have great physics, and poor FFB. While they are connected they aren't the same thing. Good FFB doesn't exist without good physics, while good physics can very much exist without good FFB. 

FFB in WRC 7 is serviceable, while not mind blowing. Make sure you have Spring effects in your profiler at 100%, otherwise FFB will be dead. Damper I prefer at 0%.

I'm assuming many people complaining about the FFB had their driver settings wrong, this game ABSOLUTELY needs Spring to feel right. Many sim racers have disabled or lowered it from their driver, which will feel horrible in WRC 7. It's programmed effect here (not constant Spring), and forms the core of the FFB. 

Don't expect Assetto Corsa or rFactor 2 here. FFB communicates what the car is doing, but it's not the most detailed. Communication of SAT (self-aligning torque) is lacking.

[b]SOUND[/b]

No music to speak of. Cars sound okay, while not as good and detailed as Dirt Rally. Basic engine noises and backfires are fine, transmission whine, chassis flex and such things aren't there though. Sound is okay.

[b]DAMAGE MODEL[/b]

Actually, it's pretty detailed. However, same as Dirt Rally, the cars are a bit too tough. You can keep going, when IRL you would be on a tow.  You can total your car, just takes a bit too much effort. On higher difficulty levels the damage builds up quicker, but still not quite realistic

[b]CO-DRIVER[/b]

A bit wooden, but gives 99% right calls. Also supports multiple languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and Japanese). 

I didn't have a problem about it, while it's not great. Does it's job. You can set the calls later/earlier and adjust the detail level of them. I wish it didn't tell me to ""BRAKE!"" though because it tells me that, even if I've just messed up and barely moving.

Edit: Actually you can delete the braking callouts, game works and they won't be played:

C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/WRC7/WIN32/Sounds/Voice/EN/PACENOTES

[b]MOTION & SIMVIBE SUPPORT?[/b]

The game seems to have native D-Box support. There is D-Box .exe in the install folder, which has loads of settings. So it clearly outputs required telemetry. 

But at the moment SimVibe is not supported, if it ever will be is a mystery. For me SimVibe is pretty important for immersion. Hopefully they can add support, but past WRC games don't have it.

[h1]CONS[/h1]

[b]NO TRUE TRIPLE SCREEN SUPPORT & NO VR[/b]

Triples image is stretched, while otherwise works fine. So, just like in Dirt games. 

WRC 6 had experimental VR support they showed in conventions and such. Didn't make it to full release. And this one still doesn't have VR, sadly. A developer said on Steam forums, they don't have plans for adding it.

[b]LIMITED FOV / SEAT POSITION SETTINGS[/b]

You can't adjust the seat height. Which is too high for Triple Screen users. Also getting the camera close enough isn't possible either, even with ""Very close"" dashcam setting. I ended up using the bonnet cam. Which I wouldn't normally do, just works better here. Hope they could patch this issue.

[b]PERIPHERALS ISSUES[/b]

Game's understanding of multiple input devices is bit of a mess. 

There is a function called ""Axis detection"" which is supposed to recognize unsupported & multiple peripherals. But currently it's not working very well. However, you can get separate pedals working by assigning them as buttons. For some weird reason, they will still work as Axis in the game. This is very confusing, and needs patching ASAP. 

Was able to get TH8A working as a handbrake by this method. Seen also footage of people driving with high end pedals and wheels, with separate USB connectors. However, I've heard some having trouble getting a G29 to work in the game. T500RS worked out of the box. 

Suggest testing with your peripherals. Steam refund works flawlessly, used it many times. 

[b]USES DENUVO[/b]

So, there's that. 

The performance is fairly okay though. Able to run triple screens 60 fps with 980ti, by dropping from Very High to High and dropping Post Processing SSAO to medium.

[h1]STUTTERING ISSUE FIX[/h1]

Run the game in borderless window. For some people it works flawlessly even in full screen, for me only in borderless, or using Alt + Enter twice (into desktop, and back to full screen)

I'm using also V-Sync (A mode) to get smooth experience, which I wouldn't do normally due to the input lag it creates.

[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]

Pleasant surprise, went in with zero expectations, finger already on the refund button. But what do you know, best rally game of 2017. If you enjoyed Dirt Rally, you might like this.

Don't expect it have the best FFB in the world, but if you think this is another arcade crap WRC release, you're seriously mistaken.

- The somewhat unrealistic physics makes you feel like your drifting better than the actual WRC drivers
- The graphics suit the game
- The car sounds are great quality
- There are lots of maps to drive
- Most maps are replayable especially because of the leaderboards
- Lots of settings to tweak
- Good community 

Cons
- There isn't too much customization for the cars
- Some stages can feel really streched out
- the multiplayer is hardly active ( it's fun when you get into a game though)
- There are some minor bugs, for example i fell into a ditch and got launched

Good points:-

Best WRC yet.
Engine sounds improved, R2 cars are spot on.
Handling much improved, FWD cars feel exactly as they should and front diff physics are good.
Authentic feeling to the game in relation to the WRC series.
Stages are very true to life, decent in length and narrow as expected.
Real cars.
Real names.

Improvement areas:-

I don't see other slower cars on the stage with issues etc.
I don't see other car retired/stopped on the stages.
A proper cockpit view would be a nice addition.
Super special stages appear to be non-lane-change type, I might be wrong.
A real co-driver doing the voiceovers would bring a more authentic experience.
Trophy presentations are bland and the same each time and the off ramp doesn't appear to have enough room for a car to exit.

Bad points:-

Nothing truly bad, in the context of the following. I come from a hardcore PC sim background, full on direct drive wheel, cockpit, VR, triple screens etc and this is not a game I wish to use in that setup, it's perfect for sitting back in a armchair on a single screen with an XB1 controller and working your way through an authentic career, the real cars and liveries, real names and a good challenge.",1546384798,1546384798,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great visuals - beautiful vs WR6 was somewhat ugly (at least on Xbox).  I'm running with a Vega 64 and can run close to 4k wih settings at ""very high"" and achieve 60 fps reliably.  At 4k it was stuttering too much and lowering the resolution results in better picture than lowering the eye-candy. :)    The handling model is fairly forgiving which makes it for me very fun (not as punishing and frustrating as Dirt Rally).  Love the stage designs so far as even though they are narrow they are very believable and fun as heck to drive ( no bizarre let's torture the driver for fun type of things in there).  I expected to have to set it to easy to be competitive but actually finding on medium difficulty I've been able to win a few stages (yay!) .

I have to admit this game is a lot more pretty and more detail around the courses and Rally doesn't even really compare to it, in Rally it's much more just a whole bunch of trees were spawned in. This game has vineyards, bushes, etc.

One part of Dirt Rally that I prefer is the use of the handbrake, the handbrake feels much more flexible, whereas in WRC I am afraid to use that handbrake; and that's a problem seeing as handbrakes are a large part of rally. The other part that I prefer in Dirt Rally over WRC is the tarmac, tarmac is much better feeling (in my opinon) on Dirt Rally and is a lot more fun.

For what each of these games offer, they are both awesome rally games and you can get a lot of enjoyment out of the games. For me so far, due to the courses and the more enjoyable time on the dirt and gravel paths in WRC, WRC beats out Dirt Rally.

I'll keep this short. The driving in this game is not really hard. You can get the feel for all the cars in a stage or two. It's hardly a simulator as well. It's serviceable. Best played with a controller; wheel force feedback is inadequate.

What really makes this game is the stage design. Each stage feels different from another, sometimes even in the same country. The environments look great, feel realistic. Even the roads vary, from smooth, wide tarmac to bumpy, dusty and incredibly narrow roads. Same with the gravel and snow stages. Starting a stage almost feels like setting off on an adventure. I don't remember feeling like that in a rally game (or racing game in general) in a long time. Credit to the Kylotonn guys for this, this really sets the game apart from it's competitors.

Like I said, the driving physics aren't anything special. The cars' speeds and abilities are grounded in realism but aren't nearly as nuanced as, say, the Dirt games (even 3!) or SLRE let alone RBR. The difficulty and challenge comes from the previously mentioned stages. The sounds aren't that special but they help the immersion. The graphics are serviceable - again it's the environments that really make the whole thing. 

The career mode is probably the biggest disappointment. It is quite basic and doesn't pull you in to want to play more. It also doesn't give off a feel of accomplishment (something the Codemasters games do really) well.

Definitely worth a look if you're a rally fan (note: not a fan of simulators, a fan of rallying) and a fan of driving games.

It looks like developer patches must have done the trick. I haven’t experienced any glitches people were mentioning right after the release. The visuals are very decent, even beautiful at times, especially sun reflections and weather conditions in their variety. The locations astounded me. For the first time I could race in my home country, Poland!

Driving feels good. There are 4 difficulty levels & 4 tiers of driving model setup which I think is enough for everyone. Coming from DiRT, I was shocked to see 18 kilometer tracks and stages taking over 15 minutes to beat. Co-driver hints are executed properly. You can adjust how soon they appear. Learning curve is OK, but the last German stages will initially destroy you for sure.

To me, DiRT is better. It is really a personal preference. Comparing the real world locations to the mediocrely implemented [i]randomly mixed tiles[/i] idea from DiRT4, WRC7 beats it all the way. However, I’ve completed WRC7 in 20 hours, whereas spending over 100 hours in DiRT4, not counting the multiplayer experiences whatsoever. This shows much bigger single player value delivered by Codemasters’ product.

Nevertheless, WRC7 piqued my appetite for the next instalment. I seriously recommend this one already, especially when it's on sale again. 7/10",1536175120,1536175140,True,3,0,0.559779882431030273,0,True,False,False

Love it; the tracks are beautiful, scenic locations and of course, exotic, not your typical city fare although they are some events that take place in city circuits. Weather is dynamic so track conditions aren't always the same. Car headlights does its job adequately.

Tried it during the free period and got immediately hooked because of the beauty of the tracks. Not sure which rally game has the best looking tracks but this game's track design and detail impressed me enough to make me want to see more and experience driving in those environments. Car selection is very limited and the music is inadequate; there is no music in replay mode and the menu music is only slightly above average, repetitive and minimal except at the podium finish. Dirt 4 does better with music but the rally tracks are bland and samey. Here the track locations have a unique charm to it.

There is no rewind function like in Sebastien Loeb Rally Evolution but it's easy enough to win against Easy AI and the cars are easily controllable with keyboard. You don't need to win first all the time like in SLRE or other racing games but it's nice to get the achievements no? The teams you join have varying win conditions and all you really need is meet those winning conditions and you can progress to the next event.

There is also the Quick Race mode where all cars and tracks are already unlocked; just mix and match your selection. Even the weather is selectable.

[b][u][i]OK, now to refute some of the negative points mentioned in other reviews.[/i][/u][/b]

[olist]
[*] Too much grip - Maybe on tarmac but that is not the case on muddy surface for example.
[*] Doing turns is awkward - Increase acceleration sensitivity and reduce brake sensitivity to induce wheel spin and reduce understeer for keyboard. Don't know what the settings are for wheel since i don't use it.
[*] Too arcady - Snobbish much? Some people don't need or want complex simulation controls or overly twitchy cars. IMO the physics is just fine. FYI i play F1 games with keyboard and i don't say it's too hard or not suitable for casual gamers. Conversely i don't equate arcady with easy.
[*] Limited wheel support - Privileged much? A driving game is not obligated to support every brand and model of wheel to be considered a simulator or even a good game. Wheel users feels entitled, hence their biased view and whine a lot when a game doesn't support their favorite toys. Keyboard users are easier to please; heck, even a basic Logitech K120 keyboard will do; at least for me. I'm using a Logitech G105 gaming keyboard and i feel ripped off; the K120 is far smoother and more reliable.
[*] Crowds are static without animation - that's either a lie or they're not observant enough.
[*] Ain't Colin McRae - Well duh! ain't anything else either so what's the problem?
[*] No Skoda - Huh wut? Someone obviously didn't explore the game features enough.
[*] All cars feel the same - Well they all have exactly the same performance specs for each class. Not sure about the geometry and handling though, that might be different. A smaller car like the Citroen DS3 should have a smaller turning radius. Identical performance isn't a bad thing if a level playing field is the desired outcome. 
[*] Sounds terrible - Well i dunno, sounds pretty good to me for the most part except the Junior WRC cars seem to hum a lot.
[*] Roads are flat - Simply untrue; there are bumps, crests, cambers and undulations. Even uphill and downhill.
[*] Surfaces not much different feel - well how much is much? IMO they are different enough to warrant a change in driving technique. There is much difference between tarmac and mud for example.
[*] Shift lights don't work - I dunno what's that suppose to mean because i see the gear change indicator.
[*] Co-driver robotic voice - Robotic? Really? It's a human voice ffs. Others described it as too much alarm in the voice sometimes so how can it be robotic? You can't have both a robotic voice and an alarming panic voice! I've not encountered any rally game where the co-driver pace notes are perfectly timed because they are not AI driven; they run on separate timers independent of your driving speed. If you're too fast they are too slow and vice versa. If they are AI driven or triggered by track location rather than timers than the pacing would be perfectly timed always.
[*] DR is better - Well i don't care about DR, i like this one.
[/olist]

Almost everyone compares this to Dirt Rally, i don't like DR; the cars feel too light and fly all the time; hardly any grip. Plus it only runs on 4 cores; why the FCUK is that? It's a huge step backwards, really HUGE step when games made in 2005 before Ryzen existed can run on all cores, even CM F1 2010 runs on all cores. Some games like the World Ship Simulator can even run on all 16 threads at 100% but it has other problems. So no, DR is gimped intentionally for Ryzen and that stinks to high heaven. For me anything but DR is good and i mean anything that runs on more than 4 cores, regardless of what genre or what rating; they are good in-principle, simply because they don't try to cripple AMD's Ryzen performance. So DR is bad in-principle and in practice. A game that ignores half of Ryzen 7 cores is not worth my time or money.

As for WRC 7, IMO the graphics is pretty good when you can see the depression in the mud layer when your car runs over it. Also you can see water droplets on the car surface in rainy conditions. Although the water droplets don't move with the fricton of wind resistance on the surface, it's good enough IMO.

Some say it's too arcady. Well there are Amateur, Semi-Pro, Pro and Simulation physics. Each progressively disable a driving assists although the assists are few and quite basic. In Junior WRC class, you can't change the car setup but you can in WRC 2 and WRC class so i dunno why the rally experts here refuse to acknowledge that it has simulation traits. You can even manually turn on and off the wipers and headlights and have working instruments displays. Only thing that doesn't work is the rear view key.

The damage model is... erm well i can't say with certainty one way or the other because i have never damaged it too badly. Collision detection seems good, nothing wonky.

And oh the graphics options available for tweaking are quite reasonable and the game runs smoothly at max settings in Full HD. No low fps as reported in a certain review; i wonder how that could even be possible. Well actually, low fps was encountered at one time in the menus. Don't know what happened. Restarting the game fixed it. It never happened while racing so far.

My score [h1]8/10[/h1]No bugs, beautiful tracks and easy handling. What more could i possibly want? Oh yeah, better music and more cars, maybe. If you prefer DR, good for you. Just don't try to sell me on it but if you want to gift me, by all means :D

I made a quick video upload mainly to show that Skoda is in the game and to support my other rebuttals. Other locations have more undulations and steeper elevation changes.

And by that I mean, multi-input support is poor, but if you use something like a G29 with a shifter, it's ok. I recommend a gamepad of some kind. It's actually very good. I'm using a steam controller, mostly as if it's an xbox controller (ie. no gyro or touchpad nonsense).

Moving along, every surface weather combination, actually feels different. It doesn't seem like just a sliding multiplier. It comes with both good sound, the surface geometry, road widths, the works. It's great. Gives you a real unique feel for each area. Love the locations, and the sheer variety of vista's you drive through.

Pace notes are quite simply the best I've ever had. It's a no brainer. You don't need to think. It's succinct, quick, and perfectly timed. So much so, that you feel like you can ride the limit of each corner. If a racing game can feed you enough info, to allow you to do that, you have the beginnings of rally sim...

Physics is serviceable. It does what you kind of expect it to do, with one or two quirks, but nothing that immersion breaking or irritating, that it's. Examples include: driving through water slows the car down too much, reported speedometer doesn't always match hairpin speeds ( i didn't just do 100km/h through that bend). Graphics is good enough, not too average, and not fancy enough to stand out. What i mean to say is, as a whole, it's great. The cars fit the game, that fit the locations.

Replay's cameras are rubbish. Don't watch the replays, just enjoy the gameplay for the moments they give you.

Finally, this game grows on you. I thought it was average, but the more you play, the more you unlock, the more you acclimatise, the more you realise the driving experience is varied and nuanced. Fun more from a driver adapted satisfaction, that the wow factor, that maybe a DiRT Rally would give you. Well worth the buy. Shit, buy it full price. This game is fantastic.

You can decide if these are deal breakers for yourself but I won't be buying another one unless they address at least the first two.

 -Force Feedback is poor. The effects feel canned to me, I'd describe it as feeling digital compared to a more 'analog' feeling in other games, if that makes sense. It feels very 'on and off' rather than being applied progressively, it's not natural or intuitive at all for me. Due to this I actually find this game more enjoyable with a controller, which seems to have been their top priority. There is also no clutch support.

 -Various minor technical and performance issues. Nothing major on its own but they do add up and I had to spend a decent amount of time dealing with them. Certain weather and daytime combinations cause performance issues on some stages for me for no discernible reason. Considering the game's modest graphics, this really shouldn't be the case. The game also just doesn't seem to run smoothly without v-sync for me, which adds a considerable amount of input delay that makes it even more unplayable with a wheel.

 -The cockpit camera needs options, such has hiding the wheel, adjusting seating position etc. Just copy and paste how it is in Dirt Rally / Dirt 4 and I'd be very satisfied. I also found visibility to be very poor in the rain, wipers don't seem to do very much. As is I have to use the bonnet cam.

 -The co-pilot sounds really robotic. I think there's no good excuse for this, the co-pilot in the MUCH older Richard Burns Rally sounded far more natural. Fix it. Also, the ""BRAKE!"" calls need to be replaced with something more realistic like ""Slowing"" or 'Caution'.",1516753559,1530254188,True,0,1,0.382371336221694946,0,True,False,False

The cars feel properly weighted. The aero works brilliantly. With the interior view or hood cam you really feel like you're in a big car on a small road fighting to stay in control at speed

Again as i had previously said the stages are amazing. They've chosen some real iconic stages and left no detail out.
The sound could do with being a little better but maybe i've been spoiled by how high quality the sound from Codemasters games is. The visuals are okay - Fairly nice in places. The mud on the windscreen could do with being a much higher resolution too.

I've been reluctant to give this game a shot, being a long time player of various racing- and rally sims. The previous WRC titles have been rubbish with lots of game breaking flaws, but now they're apparently getting somewhere!

The physics don't feel as intuituve as Dirt Rally, but I'm biased.

Having all the official rallies and all the official teams definately adds a lot of immersion! And the game supports multiple controllers without any hassle, force feedback is ok, graphics are ok, sounds are ok. The cockpit view even works ok with my racing rig. Dynamic FOV is ... interesting. So this is actually way better than I expected. Thumbs up!

Pros:
- Content. All offical rallies. This is one point where WRC7 beats the content poor Dirt Rally hands down. I don't even miss the retro cars or group B, because I know this is WRC.
- Physics, graphics, sounds are ok. Not great, but ok. Good enough to not be a game breaker.
- Support multiple controllers without any hassle, but with some issues.

Cons:
- Physics, graphics and sounds are ok. The physics are a bit unpredictable and not as intuitive as in Dirt Rally, but absolutely fun to play. Graphics have one antialiasing option: FXAA, which is crap.
- Doesn't support SimVibe.
- Menus show icons for Xbox controller, for some reason, which makes navigating a bit hard.

There's not the same sort of huge budget behind this title (and you can see that at times), but it has a real old school racing vibe to it. It's almost the sort of game I hoped the Dirt series would turn into. Maybe think Colin Mcrae (RIP) Rally 7 and you might get an idea about how this game handles. Graphics are impressive with the stages ranging from 'good' to 'superb', with some interestingly unusual locations. Weather effects are selectable and good, while particle effects do their job. Trackside details are unusual...birds swish across the front of your car on costal stages, while blood-sucking insects swarm in clouds on the Finland stages. The physics are excellent. I suspect it just about sits alongside the Dirt titles now, with really interesting road surfaces possibly helping to edge it ahead in some areas. It's also a very focused game, remaining entirely focused on pro-rallying with none of the garbage that Codemasters has shoveled over their titles in the recent past.

If the steep learning curve of Dirt Rally puts you off but you aren't interested in an all-inclusive simcade like Dirt 4, this game is your golden goose. It provides a professional, realistic, accurate, and most importantly fun rally racing experiece that pays a very keen eye to detail as far as the source material (this past years WRC season) and the painstakinly recreated tracks (of which there are many) from real-world locations down to every detail (even -haybales- can be found in game where they were near the courses during the actual races) 

Though I personally found the physics a bit sluggish and hard to get used to (I'm typically careening ahead with audacity in Dirt games), I cant argue against the realism thats represented on the tracks/roads. Like any racing simulation (especially rally), it simply takes some getting used to and you'll be feeling it once you get your bearing and find yourself climbing up the time rankings. Just make sure you pay attention to your cars intricate hardware. I personally was ready to shelve this until I saw I could use hard tires as opposed to soft, which made driving the cars much more enjoyable on certain tracks.

Also, much to my enjoyment, this is one of the few present day rally games where I'm able to just pick a track, car, team and be racing in only a moment. Theres options for custom events and the like, but this is a very welcome thing for me as I usually find practice/pleasure in driving on random tracks to perfect time trials and obstacle avoidance.

My only gripes are things that were not touched up or flat out missed. The co-drivers sound like robots and lack the fluent, more human tone of Dirt Rally's much-venerated (and apparently standard setting) co-driver. For me, listening to a co-driver is one of my favorite things about rally racing/sims, so having one that has no feeling or soul is a bit of a killer. Given that I only understand English fluently, it's kind of a bummer to be stuck with a British co-driver who sounds like the love child of Max Headroom and a Game Boy speaker.

Secondly, I personally do not like how there is -zero- means of using a H pattern gearshift. Seriously, you just cannot do it. I fully understand this was not included given how all present day rally cars use sequential shifters and realism was a key objective, but it is still a real bummer that I cant use my Thrustmaster TH8A the ideal way when playing this game. Sequential shifting is easier, but kind of boring and lacking in the thrill of jamming on a H-pattern gate during an intense set of turns.

All in all, this is well worth your time and purchase, especially since this is easily the best entry in the series after a string of mediocre entries in the series. Buy with confidence and enjoy.

Here, enjoy some gameplay I recorded. :)

Many rallies and stages are beautifully made and the lighting is at times awesome, perhaps best demonstrated in Rally Monte Carlo, the way that light shines through the leafless trees and from angles realistic to life. So, graphically, great game. But where's the mud????!! Where's the grime?? The RAIN??? The weather effects are hugely underwhelming, as in WRC 6. The game's attempt at rain can't even be called drizzle, and rally isn't rally without mud and brutal, challenging conditions. 
Although lesser in graphics I think WRC 6 was slightly better overall than WRC 7, even if the same problems as I mention further down existed in that game as well. I liked the controls better in 6. Car feels so lightweight in WRC 7, and bouncy... There are also fewer stages in WRC 7, although longer. But I'd rather take more stages of medium and short length to get variation. The graphics and the fact that most of the stages are beautiful and good on the eye, and that all 13 rallies have very unique feel and look, is what partially saves the game. 

* Career mode is still lacklustre. Your created driver doesn't age, nor does the other AI drivers, and new young blood doesn't come up to replace the old ones, and frankly they could have made so much more out of career mode - living the life of the driver, from season to season. The GC has no dynamic whatsoever. S.Ogier (Top tier) and P. Tidemand (2nd tier) literally wins every rally and every stage, except in the very rare cases that they have a flat tire or a crash... T.Neuville is always second. There is no fight for the championship points. I can predict the results in each rally and on each stage 96 % accurately before each new season, and I can definitely predict the Overall GC in the end accurately beforehand. Because it's always the same. Considering that Ogier wins every rally, except if you, the player, can beat him, you basically have to win a minimum of half the rallies in a season and finish 2nd in the other half to win the championship. That's how lacklustre the General classification is... Don't mistake my meaning, this is not about difficulty setting, it is about the AI drivers' strength relative to each other. There is no dynamic whatsover between the drivers, it is as uncompetetive as it can possibly be. What were the devs thinking?

* Time gaps (player's time relative to AI drivers) are also unbalanced. There should have been far smaller margins. Fairly small gaps between top and bottom to punish the driver harder for mistakes. You can drive a completely sh*tty stage and crash and crash and still finish in the top 6, even on the hardest difficulty. It is almost impossible to finish outside top 6 on a stage, because of the huge gaps between AI drivers. 

* You still can't customize your car. Big disappointment. You only have a few cars/chassises to choose between, which may be true to real life, as WRC is a small sport with such a small peloton, with only 4 car manufacturers in the top tier and only 2 drivers per team. But really, as career progresses we should be able to customize the car, and the whole career mode concept should be a greatly expanded. 

* I will recommend the game, but only just. Improving key areas could make future sequel(s) outstanding. So, it's not all dark and gloomy. There is hope.",1526933902,1526934308,True,10,0,0.647887349128723145,0,True,False,False

The issue i had was the camera zooming in and out all the time.
It just made the game unplayable for me.
I like to play the game from an external camera behind the car with a joypad.
I use a pc version of the xbox 360 controller.
I hardly ever use cockpit cam.  But as i recall the zooming effect was present for all cameras.

Now after waiting 5 months and seeing the game on sale for £10 i thought i'd try again.
And i'm really pleased to see the game has been patched to fix the issue.
And what a joy to play this game now is.
The zooming effect is still present on one external camera, but for the other it isn't.
I would have liked the option to enable or disable the effect for each camera, but at least now i can play the game the way i like to play it.

I can now recommend the game.
I would value this game at £25.
Anything over that i would consider overpriced and would advise people wait for a sale.
And anything under £25 is a steal.

I bought my copy for £10 in the pro mo sale and consider this a steal.

Above all the game is VERY FUN to play.
The course design is outstanding providing a lot of variety.
I did recognise a few stages that were similar to WRC 6, ( i've bought and played all WRC games from 5-7 ) and see that these stages were modified versions from the previous games.
Some stages were huge in length, taking me 15 minutes to complete.
But most are about the 5-6 minute length.

The graphics are a step up from previous versions too.
Although i play the game on max settings with just a couple post processsing effects disabled.
Combined with course design make this game outstanding to look at and play.

The car physics are an improvement too.
The car seems more controllable than in the previous games.
With controlled slides now possible.
The physics are still nowhere near as good as Richard Burns Rally, but it's getting there.
And most importantly for me, is very fun to drive.

I only have a couple of little niggles.
I would like tooltips for all options.
I spent a while researching what half of the post processing effects were and still don't know what vignette is.
And there is no option i could find to disable the effect of dirt appearing on the camera.
Also hate the lense flare.  There should be an option to disable this too.
Turning off bloom helps reduce sun glare but the lense flare i find is quite annoying.

So to sum up.

Highly recomended.

If you're a huge fan of the WRC, love racing titles and aren't too concerned with actual simulation, then this one should be right up your alley. There are arcade style physics and enough to keep you busy.

If you're a sim rally fan and are looking for a decent modern day rally experience, then I'd say pick this up on sale. The physics are probably a little better than what you've heard, though they still need a lot of work. I had a little bit of fun in the WRC Jr cars and even more fun in the WRC cars, but the WRC2 cars just aren't right. They seem to understeer at the weirdest times regardless of setup. The stages are pretty decent, and while there aren't many stages per rally, there are 13 rallies. The career mode is fun, has a few issues, but overall is nice if you want a solo rally experience.

A few things that really bug me.  The graphics. They aren't bad, but they just aren't that great. The weather effects, especially the rain, just aren't impressive. The replay cameras. This really is no excuse for this one. The replay cameras are terrible. One of them clips in and out of the codrivers head, and the others are just boring. The in car cameras have almost no options for adjusting, making the cockpit cam almost unusable for me, which is super disappointing. The force feedback needs work. You can get it feeling -OKAY-, but it takes a lot of adjusting and testing.

Overall this is a big step up from WRC6, but I feel like it's still missing a bit. In addition to working on the most important part, the driving and stages, I hope they work a bit more on immersion. Make us feel like a WRC driver. Let us slow down and drive up to time control instead of just stopping the second we cross the line while our brakes glow with the heat of the thousand suns and stop us in less than 4 feet regardless of how fast we were going. Has there ever been a character creator in a racing game so we're not all just 'generic guy' behind the wheel? The things they've given us, like the wrecked cars on the stages, are awesome but it's something I'd like to see more of.

TLDR

Still lacks some information, but it doesn't feel off like it was in the previous title, and the FFB sweet spot can be much more easily found now with the in-game settings. (I recommend all forces starting from 50% to less using a G27)

Car handling is much better, with weight transfer and throttle oversteer behaving like they should. Physics are also fine, with acceptable downforce and grip levels more correct and in a much more lifelike manner (especially if compared to the two recent DiRT games, where each of them went to an extreme). Collisions could be better and the damage system is too forgiving. Being faithful to the real ones or not, all of the cars have good response and are joyful to drive without being too easy or a hell on wheels. I think the game properly fulfills what one could expect from the modern WRC cars and all their hi-tech apparatus. If you prefer the old-school hardcore stuff, Dirt Rally still is the place to go.

Sadly, the dreaded frame stuttering present in the previous versions of the series didn't go away. But it's not persistent like before and since the game got better in many other ways, now it's more a nuisance than a game-breaking factor. This stuttering looks like an engine-related bug and at this point I doubt there'll be a fix someday.

Graphics are OK, sound effects are great. That's a good side of being an officially WRC-endorsed game, since developers will have full access to the cars. Tracks are few but much better crafted, they took the Dirt Rally's approach on them and this is definitely a good thing.

I picked this up on sale after a year or so of playing DiRT Rally, which for me, is the current standard bearer for rallying titles. This could scarcely be more different. Online discussion of the handling in WRC 7 generally falls into two camps: 1) ‘I can’t slide the cars like in DR so it’s completely unrealistic’ and 2) ‘It’s super-realistic, it’s just that real life 2017 rally cars handle so differently’. I think the truth of it actually lies somewhere between the two. I certainly started getting more out of it once I changed my driving style to suit the more understeery nature of the modern cars, but there’s also some strange quirks that don’t feel quite right.

For cars that want to stay pretty straight, at low speed they will completely 180 with little provocation. Going over a slight bump with minimal steering input will often completely over-rotate the car, as if it has no weight. Likewise, using the handbrake often feels like a gamble to the point I’ve all but stopped using it. The handling isn’t [i]bad[/i] – it’s just got some annoyances that make me feel I’m driving against the challenges of imperfect physics and FFB rather than the stages. It’s still generally fun to drive.

The FFB is pretty average and I had to turn some of the effects completely off to remove a heavy steering feel that made quick inputs feel like I was going to break my wheel (a Logitech G920). 

Some of the above can be improved slightly with car setup changes and that’s actually one of the game’s plus points – tinkering with your setup yields really tangible results. It’s good too that surface changes are notably different and locations vary in their feel – gravel in Wales is not the same as gravel in Australia etc.

The visuals are good and although I’ve encountered the stuttering issue some have mentioned, it’s been very minimal. The game runs well on high settings with my modest spec (i5 4670 3.4GHz, 8GB DDR3 RAM, GeForce GTX 770).

That being said, there are some seriously rough edges, too. The real life WRC 2017 season was brilliant and varied, with multiple winners across all four manufacturers. You’d never know that here though, with every stage and every rally ending with almost the same finishing order and Ogier cleaning up. It makes for a championship that is neither realistic nor engaging to compete in. Worst still, the points awarded from the power stages are completely broken in all three tiers and screw up the standings. Shipping the game with that issue isn’t just bad, it’s [u]completely unbelievable[/u]. There are many other bugs that aren’t as game-breaking, but when I’m even finding typos in achievement descriptions it does kind of demonstrate the lack of attention that went into some areas of the game. Kylotonn need to wake up and realise an official sports license is an important commodity. The WRC and its fans deserve better.

Still, I keep coming back to the game for one reason – the stages. They’re truly excellent. I know some say there aren’t enough and complain that the epic stages are just shorter stages stitched together with some parts reversed, but it’s really not an issue. I’ve been playing rally games for over 20 years and these are some of the best stages I’ve ever encountered. Each event is distinct, interesting and believable and the epic stages live up to their name. This is by far the game’s strongest asset and make it worthwhile if you’re prepared to spend time getting the game feeling right for you.

7/10

[b]TL;DR:[/b] If you’re a fan of rallying, you’ll absolutely want to drive these stages – just do as I did and pick it up in a steam sale so the shortcomings don’t **** you off too much.

It just never get's me feeling like i'm on the edge, the way other rally games do.

Controls:
This game was made for gamepads.
The steering wheel axis has a deadzone and a delay.
I've played it with both my trusty old spare G27 and my T500 and the delay is there on both wheels.

Physics:
From sitting stationary in a Front Wheel Drive car...
if i turn my wheel all the way left or right and apply a small amount of throttle,
i can get the car to turn 90 degrees in about five meters of travel. It's like a forklift with rear wheel steering.

Locations:

13 countries/locations with about 12km of road on average.
A World Rally Championship, are you kidding me.!!

For this Developer to say ""the epic stages(plural) will take you over 15 minutes to drive""...
That is seriously a blatant lie.

The epic stages are 12 maybe 14km on average at best and when competing in a rally,
that epic stage is split into two stages.

Poland has the longest stage which is Kruklanki, it is 23km long.
That is the only close to epic stage the game has.

ouninpohja is 10km - 6(six) miles long.!! what is that about...

So yeah...
if you decide to go to single stage and only drive the epic stages to see what they're like...
You'll be well disappointed and finished in a couple of hours.

Support:
Over on their official steam support pages, there is a user that abuses anyone and everyone that happens to make a new post or asks for help.
This in turn makes it very difficult for anyone to receive help and support,

There's some pro's and cons about this game after playing it for an hour and 6 stages of sprint rally. Please note that i'm an average gamer who likes some racing game and already spent about 130 hours on dirt rally. And to give perspective, I'm giving the comparison by (sometimes) comparing this game to Dirt Rally, the game that i played long enough til i knew i can drive in it (not being the best driver out there, but at least i can handle their cars till finish lol). So here they are :

PROS

- Fully Licensed WRC Tracks
In terms of choosing between Dirt and WRC always like choosing between PES and FIFA, FIFA is fully licensed, PES isn't but fully moddable. For Rally, The Tracks and stages on WRC is very variative, while there's only a few places to choose in Dirt. It sucks as a Dirt player knowing you can't simply just add tracks there. Another plus point is, if you start the career mode in WRC, you'll play those tracks according to a real WRC Calendar.

- Fully updated WRC Cars for 2017 season (including some bonus cars too :) )
Damn i really gonna miss driving those Skodas, i just love that Fabia. It really brings me back to the era when i still play WRC PSP. This game includes WRC Cars from all teams and manufacturers participating in the season, and WRC2 Cars (R5 class they call? CMIIW), WRC Junior (is it only ford fiestas there?), and Bonus Cars like the retired VW Polo 2016 WRC, and DLC including a Porsche. Not to mention real teams and real liverys, all with their respective driver. Now what Dirt has? they do have some cars included here in WRC 7, but not with all those teams and liverys, so you gonna need to mod that up.

- Great career mode
The career mode is just like FIFA one in their the journey mode. You're the driver, they give you contracts. Win more you get better relationship with your team and maybe bigger lucrative offer will also come later. Contracts last 1 or 2 seasons.  And Each team has their own perks, use it accordingly to your driving style. Simple as that. You can still configure your cars and tell them what parts should they repair. And it's more forgiving in WRC where you got 45 minutes out of 60 minutes for repairs, where in Dirt Rally all you got is 30 (if it's a rally). You don't have to hassle which engineer suits you here like in Dirt Rally.

- Local split screen
This is a big win and one of the big reason why i initially want a WRC 7, i reckon every rally game should have this, especially if you just want to show off your skill to your mate side by side in a duel. Sadly Dirt Rally didn't have one :(

- If it says easy, then it's easy
YEP. The difficulty set here is right what it is supposed to be. But maybe it's too much. In a career easy mode, i even beat the fastest WRC driver in that stage while i'm equipped with a slower Junior WRC car. Lol i really laughed so hard. You might really having fun with this, especially us noob gamers sometimes like to start at the easier modes.

- The Graphics
It's pretty much good graphics for a rally game these days, but i don't know what others are thinking about.

-Esports Modes
They do have an Esport competition with this game, and the winner of the WRC 6 even made it to medias news. So it's good if you want some competition with the rest of the world.

CONS

- Not much old legendary cars :(
Well i wonder if they would add them in some form of DLC? They are pretty much focused in whatever cars running these days, so say if you're a fan of old roaring Group B monsters then go to Dirt Rally lol.

- Physics Sucks
when people says it sucks, i really think twice before i buy. It turn's out it really sucks. I mean this is too arcadey. I dont like a sim too, but to me the cars seems to go sideways 5 times easier than in Dirt Rally. If they want a more balanced ones then they should do it just twice easier than in Dirt rally. It would make the game still appaling to noob gamers without removing a learning curve and the fun efforts of doing so. By saying this doesn't mean it's easy to switch from Dirt Rally to this, but the learning curves just not that long before i master those cars.

- Camera Sucks
Yep, i dislike their camera somehow, maybe it's just personal preference. The only best option for me is the close cam.

- Stuttering issues (in my system)
I don't know what causes this. Currently my system seems more than capable to handle even in it's high settings (I'm rocking an Inspiron 7567 with i7 and 1050Ti). BUT IT'S STUTTERING. I even updated the NVIDIA Driver, checking if any FPS cap or whatever, checking and ends off any background tasks and even lower the settings but it's still a bit laggy. Don't really know what causes this (i don't spend so much time trying to work on those issues, i'm bored by the gameplay), but hopefully it doesn't happen in yours too.

- Lacking other rally disciplines
WRC only covers WRC not including RX or Pikes Peak. It's the same principles where FIFA only covers footballs without futsal counterparts. If you want great RX experiences go to Dirt, as they hold the licence for FIA World Rallycross. Still, it's nice if they do have other rally discipline aswell because more options means less boring. This one is solely pure my opinion.

- Co-Driver that sucks
Even CMR2.0 with Nicky Grist is better than this Co-Driver. They should let the Co-Driver flows naturally when telling us the pacenotes because it is one of a big point of fun rallying

- Steering Wheel issues
I don't have one but many says that their steering wheel isn't supported or whatsoever. Whatever it is, it's definitely an issue. Hopefully they'll fix this issue.

In conclusion, for me the biggest setback are the physics. It's not challenging enough and really reminds me of old PS one racing games. They say WRC 6 is worse than this, so if this is an improvement, it's just not enough. If they give good physics then i wouldnt try to refund this.

The rim is not listed on the supported device list, but the Porsche rim is. Is this the problem? If so, WOW. 

I don't understand how in the year 2017, a game on release day doesn't support multiple input devices, out of the box, and for hardware that is not on the supported devices list. I mean, I can make my fightstick think it's a keyboard with a free program, yet a racing title cannot handle assigning an axis to an analogue device without a degree in engineering from the user? Many users point out the fact that hardware that didn't even exist in the heyday of RBR works, out of the box, flawlessly. Hell, Simvibe and my motion platform work as well. Not as refined as current sims, but at least I don't have to tear down my setup to try and access my wheel for fear of having a forgottten USB plug connected somewhere. Shameful.

Please game industry, you are an embarassment to the people that have grown up with you, shared your success and your terrible terrible failures.

Edit 02/01/18:

Since the review, I have persevered with finding a solution to the technical issues this title presented. As such, I have now am able to actually bind my hardware to appropriate controls. Such is my interest in rally driving and the fact that there are far fewer options for off road simulations compared to tarmac their counterparts, I rebought the game. I am still unsure whether to change my original recommendation, but once accessible, WRC 7 handles fairly believably save from some lackluster force feedback.

I play with a keyboard so I can’t comment on the use of a steering wheel. The game responds well with the keyboard though.

Games modes include multiplayer (which I’m not interested in) and Solo. Solo gameplay include Quick Race, Custom Championship, Driving Test and a Career mode that is based on actual calendar dates (which I like a lot). It makes the career mode more authentic. Like the previous instalments of rally games you get contracts to choose from and which is set for year or two. In career mode you start of in the lower ranks. That adds to the authentic feel to the career mode. The stages are pretty tough and it includes both day and night driving.

Dirt Rally is better and currently cheaper when on sale. The car variety is better and can use an H-pattern shifter with clutch if you want (with certain / older cars - the newer cars are sequential / paddle shifters only). The sounds and overall immersion is better in my opinion. I prefer the wheel settings and feedback in Dirt Rally as well. Dirt Rally is more of a simulator - no mercy.

WRC7 menu layout and options are better - its more user intuitive. You also get way more tracks.

I have not played WRC6 or any previous, so my opinions are based solely on my experience with WRC7, in comparison to other racers like Dirt Rally (of course) and the other standards like iRacing, etc.

The greatest thing about this game is the stages.  They are excellently created, look gorgeous, and are fairly true-to-life from the real WRC stages that are run during the season.  I can't say if they are ""exactly"" the same in the way iRacing copies tracks, but they are close enough that I believe they match the real-life stages.  

I've read some complaints about the co-driver, namely that it sounds ""robotic,"" but I have to say that I've been very happy with him.  The calls are very timely and very accurate.  I've also read complaints about the ""Brake!"" calls, but again, these have been super helpful when roaring up to a blind hairpin.  Overall, I am quite happy with the co-driver calls and quality.  

In terms of physics, this game is not a pure simulation.  The developers have even stated as much - the aim of the title was not a full simulation.  That being said, with the in-game settings on the most realistic setting, it feels good.  Having never driven a 2017-spec WRC car, I can't say for certain, but it certainly matches my expectations and doesn't feel ""arcadey.""  This isn't the strongest point of WRC7, but it doesn't detract either.

The wheel and FFB settings are my first serious problem with the game.  The key bindings are clearly not made to favor a PC gamer, especially not one with a wheel.  I am using a Fanatec CSW 2.5 with Universal Hub and v3i pedals.  I struggled to get the game to recognize the appropriate axes for pedals, and had to futz with the setup for around 30 minutes to get it right.  Furthermore, the FFB settings have some weird items in there, including engine idle (?) which is clearly a carry-over from the console/controller settings.  The same, unfortunately, goes for the sensitivity settings.  I have looked long and hard for a clear way to set my steering, acceleration, and braking to a simple 1:1 ratio.  I have yet to find it, and I don't believe it's possible.  I tried 100% but I'm not convinced it's accurate.  Again, I believe this is due to the wheel settings being a carry-over from the controller settings, where sensitivity in a non-1:1 ratio might be more useful.  

Despite my frustrations with the wheel and FFB settings, I have thoroughly enjoyed the game thus far.  It's campaign/solo mode is rewarding and seeks to emulate the WRC season.  It does so admirably, and keeps me coming back for ""just one more stage"" over and over again.  This is a huge improvement from Dirt Rally, where I ultimately didn't care too much about the seasons because they were supported so little in game.

My final bit of feedback is the lack of view support.  The FOV is only adjustable from a ""near to far"" perspective, and means you must adjust it to certain settings for certain cars in order to see the gauges/revs/gear.  The FOV is also not adjustable in terms of degrees, meaning it cannot support multiple monitors or proper FOV setting based on monitor setup.  Finally, no VR, or even TrackIR support, means you are stuck to a single monitor with a single point of view for the entire game.  I can (unhappily) live with this, but going forward, this MUST be remedied for future titles to be relevant.  (A patch certainly wouldn't go amiss in this department either...) 

Overall, this is an enjoyable racing title that fills my need for a satisfying WRC/rally experience.  It doesn't offer the most hardcore simulation available, but it offers a great deal in how it emulates the WRC season both in the ""campaign"" and the excellent stages.

Let me first state that the wheel I used to play this game was a Logitech G29.

When I first played this game when it came out, it didn't impress me enough to keep it. While there were certainly a lot of pros, there were some serious cons for me that I simply could not overlook.

I've now picked the game back up again after the recent patch (I hoped) might have fixed some of the issues I had.
The only small issue I had was with the co-driver calls being a bit rubbish, but I didn't expect that to be fixed. It's only a small preferencial problem and nothing worth slating the game over.
The two main issues I had were with the way the game handled my steering wheel and the flickering bug.
I can happily report the flickering bug is gone.
However, I still have a major issue with my wheel. While the addition of several extra settings for steering wheel FFB controls have been added and are very much appreciated, I still cannot alleviate the terrible chattering my wheel makes with this game. After talking with a few people, I think I can say it comes down to my wheel itself. The G29 uses gears to control the wheel instead of a rubber belt. This unfortunately will lead to chattering noises when the wheel receives multiple tiny FFB signals. With a belt driven wheel, you would simply feel the tiny tugs and pulls at the wheel. So does the fault actually lie with my wheel? Well.....no. See, I can play games like Dirt 4, Dirt Rally, and to a lesser extent Assetto Corsa. Granted AC isn't an offroad game, but I can still feel when the very edge of my wheel is on the apex. None of those three games make my wheel chatter one tiny bit, yet the feel of the FFB in those games far surpasses what I can get from WRC 7.
The other problem I have noticed now after reading a post on the forums is the fact I seem to be suffering from some incredible input lag. As one person wrote, ""It feels like your steering column is made of rubber"". I couldn't put it better myself.

So those are the only REAL problems I have with this game.
As for the pros, I can only echo what everyone else says. The tracks. Amazing. I love them. Varying from teeth grinding technical stages with narrow roads, to wide sweeping stages and insane speeds. The tracks are the best I've played. Yes, even better than Dirt 4 can manage. On par with Dirt Rally, as every single stage in that game is real. Even the surroundings on the stages are varied and changing all the time. It keeps the stages looking and feeling fresh rather than seeing the same bland environment over and over.
Graphically the game isn't amazing, but it's certainly good enough. Lets face it, in a game where you get tunnel vision using extreme focus to keep your car on the road, next gen graphics aren't your top priority.
Sound quality is....on par I guess, borderline sub-par. It's the least impressive aspect of the game. Engine sounds seem fine, but the collision noises and the sound of your car bottoming out remind me of some old arcade boxing game from the early 90s. In a word, lacklustre.
Menus all seem pretty clean and good looking, no complaints there.


Overall I would probably rate this game a 7/10. If the sound quality was better, the co-driver wasn't awful, and I had no issues with my wheel, it would be a very solid 9/10.
If you can overlook the sound, co-driver, and you don't have a Logitech wheel, then by all means buy this game. You won't be disappointed. If you do have a Logitech wheel, be prepared.",1506105996,1512764136,True,0,0,0.536924302577972412,0,True,False,False

The co-driver is terrible--had to mute him after an hour of play. He sounds like a robot and never seems synchronized with the track. The Dirt games have extremely natural sounding co-drivers and I feel like it should be stated that this is not one of this games strong suits.

There's splitscreen! Many people won't care about this but I like to play racing games with friends, even if it's in the rally format and we're essentially just taking turns, starting staggered and all that.

A useful tip when first loading the game: Make sure you press A on your wheel when the game first loads up to get your wheel to be recognized.

I am actually starting to think that it's even better than Dirt Rally! Quality of stages in WRC7 is pretty much on par with stages in Dirt Rally, except here you have much more locations to drive on, with an ability to play each location in ""epic stage"" (one very long stage, instead of more shorter stages).

Handling of the cars is very good. I don't think it's as good sim as Dirt Rally (while connected with the road), but that it's somewhere in between D:R and Dirt 2/3 handling models, where handling is more accessible, while still being very rewarding. The biggest drawaback is the weird FFB, so I switched to gamepad, where it plays a lot better.

Visuals are...mixed. During sunny days, dawns and sunsets, it looks VERY good. But when it comes to rainy, foggy, or night conditions, it looks very bland. Optimisation is great. I am running it with mostly stable 60 FPS, all settings maxed out on my GTX970. I only experience some framedrops to 40's during foggy conditions, but it happens very rarely, so it's not that big issue.

Sound... well, car sounds are OK. Engine sounds in particular are great, but after playing Dirt Rally/4, you will quickly notice that a lot of sounds are missing, or sounding kinda meh. Co-driver on other hand is just terrible. Listening to his robotic voice was giving me a headache for the first hour, but eventually I got used to him.

All things considered, it is a really good rally game with a few minor flaws. If you were disappointed with Dirt 4 and it's deja-vu track generator, you should give WRC7 a chance.",1509535671,1509886265,True,5,0,0.528678476810455322,0,True,False,False

Wish there were more per location, variety is nice though. Overall the graphics are just okay. Some aspects like lighting and particle effects are amazing, but overall the landscape has a bit of a mundane look. What you actually drive on is extremely detailed when it comes to ruts, dips, rocks, etc. The courses are pretty narrow too. I love this aspect as it makes room for error pretty small. I'll take better physics over graphics, but eye catching landscapes would be a nice addition. FFB is passable. Could be improved. Default FFB settings felt terrible. With my Logitech g29 I had to make quite a few adjustments to get the feeling right. I think DiRT Rally has better FFB IMO. Difficulty settings are accurate. with each one becoming less forgiving as you move up. The amount of changes you can make to the cars in the form of adjustments is simplistic compared to DiRT Rally. Co-driver is robotic and the call system can be annoying at times (please get rid of ""BRAKE!""). DR outshines WRC 7 here too. In regards to damage, I think they did a good job with how it affects your car, but it takes too much effort to get to that point. You have to crash into a few trees pretty hard to get to a point where the car barely runs. I want a bit more realism!
I purchased the game after FOV issue was patched (camera zooming in and out with braking nad acceleration). Now you can just go into settings and turn it off (thank you devs).

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. Having never played the WRC series games before, I am impressed. I will still play DR since I've only put 200 hours into that game, but this is a nice change up, esp. with the current WRC cars.

Pros:
+Physics and handling:  WRC 7's handling model is shockingly authentic and realistic, the performance of the cars reflects the WRC 2017 cars more faithfully than any title.  Side-by-side comparisons of gameplay with on-board footage makes for a hilariously similar show.  
Force Feedback was not so great on release, but update 1.2 has improved this hugely.

+Stages:  The stages of WRC 7 are some of the best in the genre.  They're beautifully crafted, full of variety, challenge, and rhythm.  I have nothing to complain about here.  The Epic (Endurance) Stages bring us some of the longest rally stages ever seen in a rally game, and it is gold.  Every locale of the 2017 WRC is represented here!

+Career mode:  The style of career mode aims to reproduce the 2017 world rally championship season, and it does this well.  Complimented by a full set of stages for every location, it's a ton of fun to fulfil the fantasy of being a privateer climbing up to the top of the World Rally Championship all the way from a junior driver to hopping into one of the blisteringly fast 2017 WRC cars.

Neutral points:

*Graphics:  WRC 7's graphics are very adequate but nothing particularly groundbreaking.  I have experienced some struggle to maintain a full 60fps as well.   Again, not alot to complain about here, but nothing to get excited about either.

*Sound:  Similar to the graphics, the sound is adequate and nothing more.  It's a huge improvement over WRC 6, but it still can't compete with Dirt Rally.

Cons:

-Camera customization:  There really aren't many choices to adjust the camera to your liking.  There's no FOV control, and you can't adjust your sitting position in cockpit views.  As a result I just drive with the bonnet cam, which is fine, but It'd be nice to feel like I can drive in cockpit view and still be able to see the stage well.

-Lack of setup saves:  You can't save custom setups in WRC 7 so if you have a custom setup for certain stages or conditions, you'll have to write them down elsewhere and re-customize to implement them.  The setups you can save are limited to gravel, tarmac, and ice/snow, so if you edit the gravel setup, that setup is used in all gravel rallies. It would have been great to be able to save and share setups.

Conclusion:  WRC 7 is absolutely worth a buy if you're a fan of Rallying.  The excitement this game provides can only be rivaled by Dirt Rally or Richard Burns Rally, and in some ways I think it can be even more exciting and authentic.  There are minor flaws, but I have a hunch that the developer will patch this soon as some of the problems have already been patched within a month of release.",1509189639,1509189639,True,23,1,0.610087692737579346,1,True,False,False

People often moan about sound - apart from co-driver (a bit dull and robotic) all other sounds are great! Especially i love the noise when you cut the corner - dirt spray on underbody and loud bang from suspension - who tried to cut corners in real life will know it is super real!  Also you can hear brake discs and antilag (very characteristic especially on Fiesta R5). Physics of the suspension is also great - any venture too deep of the main road will result in loud bang and harsh bounce... like in real life - now - people who like to beat the ""world record"" and drive through corners on a stright line (plenty of thic crap on YT) won't be happy, as they will bounce around, but people who are after realistic car behaviour will love it!

Being able to turn wipers and lights during the stage is also great! Tyre wear is brilliant.

1. Co-driver - i want someone like Nicky Grist, or that Woman co-driver from Dirt4 with sexy american accent :-)
2. handbrake - too sensitive.

The question ""Is WRC 7 more realistic than DiRT Rally?"" does not have a simple yes-or-no answer.

The question ""Is WRC 7 a better game than DiRT 4?"" does. The answer is yes.

It's brilliant. It is not, however, Richard Burns Rally 2, nor is it DiRT Rally 2. If you're looking for a ""more realistic"" experience after putting 1,000 or so hours into DiRT Rally, this might not be the solution. The realism or believability of the handling varies from surface to surface. 

In Rally d'Italia Sardegna, it feels almost like you're playing RBR. The car is ludicrously skatey and floaty, but in a fun, satisfying way that is easily controlled using your throttle and brake. Moments like this are where the game really shines, handling-wise. It's responsive and lively like DiRT Rally, but slippy and elegant like RBR.

In Rally Finland, the car feels like the tires were manufactured by Gorilla Glue. I don't just mean that you have a lot of grip (you do). I mean the cars tires, through my G27, literally felt sticky. It's a strange and not-so-true-to-life experience. Sometimes you'll find yourself going flat-out around bends that would have killed you in DiRT Rally or RBR (or real life), planted firmly to the ground without a bit of lateral motion. Other times, you'll suddenly frisbee off the side of the stage and cut down more trees than the Finnish Forestry Commission. It can be inconsistent.

Besides the variable handling in terms of expected grip, as a player, the handling was almost immediately intuitive and comfortable after bingeing on DiRT Rally while the game downloaded. DiRT 4 felt confusing and alien - it took me several hours to even gain the ability to hold a line or a drift angle, and even then never for long, or to my satisfaction. The cars in D4 practically begged to understeer into an outside spin at some times, and refused to move the rear out a single degree at others. In WRC 7, the cars love kicking their tails out. All it takes is a solid flick (or tap of the handbrake) and a feathering of the throttle, and the cars take an angle and - more importantly - HOLD that angle so long as you keep it steady. They'll turn in or out at your behest, or hold fast and drift like crazy if you tell them to.

That's the main thing for me. Even if the game is - on average - less realistic than DR, which was never an incredibly realistic game to begin with, the cars are intuitive and they behave. The rear does what you want, and you rarely feel confused or frustrated by the car making its own decisions in terms of angle or balance.

PROS:
+Stage design/stages from actual WRC events
+Career mode
+Sometimes handling
+Multi-surface stages
+Fun and intuitive, to contrast with D4's incomprehensible feel

MEHS:
~Performance
~Lack of FOV options
~Wheel compatibility issues (my G27 worked fine but there are tons of reports of issues here)
~Sometimes handling
~Graphics (vary from solid to ridiculously dated on a moment-to-moment basis)

CONS:
-Overall, less ""realistic"" than RBR or DiRT Rally in most handling cases
-Co-driver is robotic and kinda shit, but I didn't mind so much in terms of playability
-Sometimes handling
-Lack of car variety

I bought WRC 6 thinking it might be a nice game to play around with when not playing Dirt Rally. But the handling was too erratic (albeit with promise), the stages were wide and too arcadey, and the FFB was really bad.

Happy to say that WRC 7 improves on WRC 6 in every regard. 
Car handling is up there on par with Dirt Rally. The feeling of the tyres digging into the gravel is not quite up to DRs levels, but the distinct grip level changes between different gravel types is real nice. Tarmac handling feels quite nice and believable. The cars feel like they have mass, and weight transfer is modeled nicely. Overall the handling has been a big surprise, and overall I find it more believable than DRs. 

The stages are quite nice overall, much tighter and more technical than WRC 6. There aren't a lot of stages for each location, so I suspect they'll be feeling stale after a while (like in DR), but they're varied and distinct and many of them are absolutely fantastic. While I personally give DR a slight edge with their real to life stages, there are some stages in WRC 7 that I feel are better than DRs. And the epic stages are awesome, so much fun to finally drive long stages. 

FFB is much better than WRC 6, but still nothing to write home about. I'd call it adequate on my T300RS. Not much to adjust, and it feels a bit like canned effects. Still, when you get the levels right (I found about 50% strength felt right) it works quite OK and communicates what the car does in a decent way. So fully functional, but can get better.

Codriver calls are overall OK. I find that I can trust them overall, and I seldom get caught out on bad notes. There are times when the note pace gets a bit off, but generally OK. Codriver voice is a bit sterile and machine-like, hopefully something they can improve for the next game.

Graphics are OK, neither good nor bad. Car models and stages look OK in general but ""wow"" moments are rare (there are some, like Mexico). 

Sounds are OK. Gravel kickup and tyre squeals are good, as are brake sounds. Engine sounds range from slightly bad too OK. Some sounds feel quite off, like the loud bang when the suspension punches through that just sounds completely wrong. Crash sounds are also very muted and undramatic.

Stability wise I had some troubles for the first week, where I was one of many that got the heavy stutters even though I have real good hardware. Big Ben handled the problem well though, got a thread up about the problem and got some testers fast. New patch came out which fixed the problems for the vast majority and it seems to be trouble free now.

I had no expectations firing up this game and I must admit I was very skeptical first and not sure buying it after reading all the mixed reviews but what a ride! Seriously, I'm happy I did these devs a chance! This game came out of nowhere and it look amazing and plays very well. 

The reason why I thought it would be a nice idea to put this review together is to try to describe how exactly the handling feels as I've scrolled the whole steam page reviews without knowing exactly what I was buying and wanted to help others like me. Also, if it can be of any help, I really hated WRC 5 and 6 handling and I'm more a fan of sims like Richard Burns and DiRT Rally.

---Handling model---

The physics of this game to me feels close to Sebastian Loeb Rally Evo. The best I could describe it is a kind of blend between WRC 3 and SLRE physic-wise, but with better axle pivots and a more dynamic suspension geometry modelling. Don't get me wrong, WRC 7 is still a simcade game.

It's very fun to drift around corners (much better than DiRT4) and seeing your suspension working over bumps is a real joy to experience. Inside the cockpit, models are a bit rough around the edges... you see just a bit of the steering wheel, you can't adjust seat and FOV and I must say with a pad, the handling doesn't feel as dynamic as the exterior view or bumper cam. But with a wheel, it feels much better, I would not say as great as DiRT Rally, but it's actually surprising.

I plugged my T300RS + T3PA Pro pedal set and the game instantly recognized them with the buttons mapped accordingly. The FFB effect is not very good and the slider in option menu is odd as it doesn't let you select each angle... I wanted to put it to 540 degree but it just let me choose between 508 and 560 although you can go straight up to 1080 degrees?!? Also, the virtual steering wheel look out of sync and I do get some minor input lag.

The handbrake could make you slide more as right now it make you stop to a dead end. The cars behavior doesn't feel as predictable  as DiRT Rally, the cars feels more floaty and less responsive making them harder to drive than DR but they're intuitive and you will experience countersteer, oversteer and lost of control without ABS. The only negatives worth mentioning here I think is the landings after a jump and interaction of your car with the roadsides... it feels a bit clunky at times and you have that weird looking cloud of particles effect going in the air.

--- Graphics and stages ---

About the graphics and stages, the shaders to me looks better than DiRT4 (specially lens flare and reflections), the vegetation is luxurian and very dense but above all, the road are a real blast to drive... they're narrow, bumpy, packed with elevation and camber changes. I'm happy to finally be able to drive between vineyards on these narrow Germany roads, something DiRT Rally is lacking. You can feel the immersion as you're going deeper in these wonderful forests. The stages have been crafted to perfection and are amongst the best I've seen, if not the best ever in any rally games. You can go from a mountain top to a valley and back into forest, etc. the landscapes are so much different, we can easily see these guys were very inspired when they've designed them. The landscapes are never the same and the saturation of colors in Australia and Wales are top notch. The textures looks very natural and realistics, and each country look different and are packed with lot of trackside objects. So far, having always been impressed by the DiRT serie stages, I think these guys could show some tricks to help Codemasters refine the variety of their environments but one point goes to DiRT Rally for having more detailed road surfaces. Speaking about the graphics,I think the car models could benefit from more polish (especially rims) and the watersplashes effect could be reworked. This game is one of the few featuring the great Kopecky's Skoda Fabia R5.

---Performance---

Lot of reviewers complain they have microstutters, and some of them have killer rigs. It's not the case for me. For reference, I have a first generation i7 920 with a GTX 1060 6GB and 12 GB DDR3 and the game run perfectly fine at a constant 60 fps locked, even using local splitscreen which is a nice addition btw. Hopefully a patch will come soon to fix these microstutters but on my setup, game runs like a charm.

---Conclusion---

As it is currently, it's still too early to talk about the career mode as I just finished the first country, but so far, I've been very impressed. I recommend this game to any rally enthusiast out there looking for a different racing experience.",1506037865,1506134993,True,1,0,0.496951103210449219,0,True,False,False

Physics are intuitive, stages are absolutely amazing, and after some tweaking of the wheel I found it more immersive than any other rally game out there.  This truly wonderful game deserves VR and an analog hand break.  If we got these two things I wouldn't be able to stop playing.  

In terms of specific car physics, I can only compare it to the real life.  If you have only driven the Fiesta in this game as the Junior WRC entry, then you might be sceptical as to how you can trash it around so hard while the car maintains so much grip and feels sort of like a rear wheel drive car.  I own the same gen Fiesta, and with summer tires, rear sway bar, and front and rear strut bars, my car feels exactly like that.  And I can't imagine the upgrades the rally car goes through to make it what it is.  I also own a heavily modded WRX track car, and I have to say that the nimbleness and accuracy of my Fiesta with limited mods over my WRX with fully upgraded suspension and far better and wider tires still boggles my mind.

I own a fanatac v2 wheel and my graphics card is a 1080, and with everything maxed out I had no issues that people are speaking of.  The stages truly are a work of art! Not only how they look, but even how many surfaces change over a stage, and for example, how a patch of ice can feel different from one area to the next.  I also love the attention to small details like tracking of each tire on the gravel and snow surfaces, how twigs break and shatter after you have hit them, the sparks from hitting a guardrail, and how the interaction with each of these objects effects the car in a way that I would expect it to in real life.  It's too bad the replays right now can't show off these amazing stages in the right way.
  
Even still, I believe this is the best rally game out there today.  I say game, because it's not quite a simulation, but pretty darn close to it.  It crushes Dirt 4 in every aspect except graphics clarity, which can be a bit of a turnoff, I have to admit.  That motion blur really has to go you guys!  I can't stress enough how important it is for the graphics to be crystal clear in a driving game.  The game has plenty of sense of speed, and does not need anything to enhance it.  It's better than Dirt Rally for sure, unless you play with the RFPE mod.  RBR is only better in terms of the damage and setup.  The physics in RBR are really not relevant anymore, no matter what people say, and I do still love the game.  Assetto is still king in terms of physics for tarmac rallies (especially if you have a motion rig), and stage mods by Simtraxx and others are amazing!  This reminds me, Sim Commander software absolutely needs to support this latest WRC title now.  

WRC 7 really captures the essence of current rallying, which the developer did a masterful job of.  The speed of the cars also feels right.  The time and control it takes to execute a hairpin feel perfect to me, but you have to really get the game and wheel settings right.  With that in mind, it's not about how fast you are going through a stage, but just the enjoyment of driving and getting the technique right, which naturally results in fast stage times anyways. 

Keep in mind, my review is solely based on playing the game in simulation mode.  So, for those casual arcade racers, sorry you had to waste 30 seconds of your life readying above writing.  I have no idea if you would like this game.  

And lastly, although I fully understand the financial reasons of creating the game that reaches a broad audience, it's too bad this can't be an out and out simulation game, because it's clear that the team really has the talent and the ability to make that happen. I was really disappointed in the last WRC title, but now I'm back being a fan again in a big way.  Keep up the good work, and please don't forget about us drivers out there ;)

but having said that it seems to be more at the start of the rally stages for a second or two and just as your coming to the end again for a second or two where the frame rates suffer the most. 
And In comparison with WRC6 i have noticed that the frame rates are better on the whole.
which makes the game extreamly playable.

the game feels a little less like an arcade racer than WRC6. 
But less of a simulation than dirt 4 !

my conclution is that if you have a fast computer and you enjoy the thrill of shooting at high speed down country lanes with brilliant scenery and a good impression of speed then this game is definately worth buying.

but if you are a simulator person and want very very realistic car handeling, with no frame rate problems dirt 4 still comes out tops.

Well I've reached my 2 hours and I have no intention of getting a refund, so I will update this review after a few more hours and let you know if this makes up for the disappointment of DiRT 4. :)

I can confidently say that this is the second best rally game in my steam library behind DiRT Rally. I'm having a great time with this game. That being said, I do have some criticisms:

1: Performance is really inconsistent. the game looks amazing but certain stages in Germany, Spain and Italy (I think) really hit the framerate on anything above medium settings, while other areas such as Poland are completely fine with everything maxed out.  

2: There are enough stages overall, but the individual rallies feel a bit short. An option to run every stage reversed or even mirrored would greatly enhance the feeling of doing a full rally, rather than simply a few events. These are some of the best stages ever in a rally game and I would love to enjoy them as much as possible. 

3: Replays are a huge issue. Firstly, the quality of the replays is poor, with bad camera angles except for the helicopter one and not enough roadside pans. Also, it resets your in game viewpoint for the next stage if you watch a replay which is really annoying. 

4: GIVE US AN OPTION TO REMOVE/REDUCE HEAD/COCKPIT SHAKE! It is really annoying and kinda makes me feel sick. 


In all however, Kylotonn has done an amazing job of WRC 7 and this has turned out to be the most surprising gamen of the year for me. The old days of having New Zealand stages in a WRC game are long gone, but now I can race Hayden Paddon's Hyundai through amazing stages in a licenced rally game that is actually good!",1505703298,1505865437,True,2,1,0.481768280267715454,1,True,False,False

Intel Core i7-7700HQ/ 32GB DDR4-2667 RAM / GTX 1060 / OLED Screen (Yes, it's an Alienware)

That should be plenty to drive this game considering that its ""recommended"" setup is only a GTX 780 with a skylake CPU.  BOY was I wrong.  First, the game was slow.  This was attributed to the fact that the nVidia drivers did not recognize that WRC 7 is in fact, a GAME, and not something like an office document or YouTube video that can work with integrated graphics.  Second, it started up every time in non-fullscreen AND windowed modes.  I had to go into settings multiple times to change this before the settings finally stuck.  Lastly, the input lag was monumental.  I get that there will always be some lag because of latency from input controller to machine, but when some inputs lag upwards of half a second before the input is seen by the user, it's not a ""game ready for release""; it's a game that was released because WRC's design studio realized that Dirt 4 came out.  Put simply, this game was caught sleeping.

Moreover, stuttering was terrible.  Not ""this is too slow to run this game"" stuttering (which I would accept if I had an ultrabook with only Intel UHD or HD graphics), but rather ""this game's programming code was not tested thoroughly.  What the game has in difficulty, it lacks in fps consistency and it lacks in smoothness.  Cockpits look generic, with no real attention paid to things such as how the speedo / tach / other dials look, and while I like the copilot's dry readout of directions (adds to accuracy), I do wish that there was sarcasm when the player messes up (ie: I never knew a right 6 was a right 9... you sure you finished grammar school?).

There are vast improvements over the previous installments but that is not to discount the glaring issues currently experienced by this game, namely in graphics and controls.

From a pure physics standpoint, this lands solidily competeing with the likes of RBR and Dirt Rally, but with the FFB issues and inability of the game to recognize some controllers, its hard to enjoy those physics, much less get a bead on them and improve times. If the game had propper FFB settings, I'm imagining it would feel like magic.

Content wise...its the FIA World Rally Championship. Locations, cars, drivers, everything is here. Nothing special, but nothing negative about it either.

Graphics are last gen, and that can't be argued. So what makes this a negative even more is that there are glaring performance issues from dropped framerates, stuttering, and INSANE amounts of screen tear (My rig sports a 7700k and a GTX 1070, so having said issues on this hardware is a HUGE problem). If these issues didn't exist, then one could look past the lack luster graphics, but this is more of an issue because of the performance.

Audio? Meh. The co-driver seems to be asleep at times (even when setting him to call corners and hazards to the ""far ahead"" option). Cars somewhat sound muted, but the outer environment sounds nice.

At best, this game is meh to boarderline unplayable. If performance and control issues are resolved in future patches, then this game should definetly be in any sim racer's library. Beyond that? Skip it until then.",1505756185,1505756185,False,3,0,0.528696775436401367,0,True,False,False

Zemin fiziklerinin Dirt Rally'ye oldukça yakın bir hissi var, Service Area ve setup ekranları görsel olarak çok güzel ancak diğer eksikleri bunları kolayca gölgeliyor.

-Arcade tarzı etap startı, copilot var ama, geri saymıyor.launc kontrol yok, varsa da ben bulamadım.
-Sürüş kamera ayarlarının ileri geri yükseklik, FOV gibi seçeneklerinin olmaması ve seçilen kameranın kayıt edilememesi, 
-Replay kameralarında seçim şansının olmaması ve replay anında kamera önüne gelen görüntüyü engelleyen nesnelerin olması, (Tepeler, Copilot siluheti vb.)
-Debriyaj ekseninin bir etkisinin olmaması,
-Menülerde mouse çalışmaması

İlk göze çarpanlar.

Hoşa giden bir direksiyon ayarı için gereken zaman ve emek sonucu elde edilen netice can sıkıcı olabilir.

Dar ve zorlayıcı yapısı ile gerçeğe oldukça yakın etaplar Dirt 4' ün sık tekrarlayan bölümlü yapısına göre kat va kat daha iyi. Fafe deki jump, Ouninpojiha'daki sıralı jumplar dirt rally nin jump larına göre bence daha iyi.Tarmac fizikleri de Dirt Rally e göre daha iyi gibi, ancak Fiesta R2 de el freninin, zaman zaman ayak freninden daha durdurucu bir etkisi olabiliyor.

Etap gerçekçiliğine örnek açısında özellikle Polonya SS sürerken, aynı etabı daha önce videoolarını izlediğim anlarda ""bu ne ya"" dedirten traktörlerin durduğu yerler gözümün önüne geldi.

Bereket oyunda aynı yerde saman balyaları vardı :)

Benim sistem biraz eski oluğu için grafikler full oynayamıyorum, ancak internette mevcut pek çok videoda grafik kalitesi oldukça iyi görünüyor.Düşük sistemler için performans optimizasyonu konusunda birşeyler yapılmalı.Postprocessing kapalı olmasına rağmen sürekli bir frame atlama hissi oluyor.

Bu tür oyunların hele de sim olmak istiyorsa, olmazsa olmazı FFB şu an için büyük sıkıntı (DR, D4 daha iyi).Umarım bir an önce update ile düzeltirler.
FFB leri kapatıp oynayınca daha iyi bile oluyor :) denebilir.Dolayısı ile controller severler için biçilmiş kaftan bir oyun olabilir.

Update gelirse yine paylaşırım ama şu an için hissiyatım, eski serilere göre oldukça gelişmiş görünüyor olmasına rağmen, gerçek bir sim (hatta simcade) olmak için çok yolu olduğu ve career moddan sonra kenarda tozlanacak gibi göründüğü yönünde.

On first start-up the game throws you into a driving-test without any possibility to set up anything beforehand, and the button-config is VERY un-intuitive making me search for buttons as well as not knowing which to push to get the changes I want (I finally managed to set up the wheel so that I at least know what buttons do what, but only AFTER my 2 test drives)

There was also some on screen instructions when you get thrown in when starting the game, which are really hard to read since you are trying to drive a car with buttons you have not set up etc, so I may have missed some info there..

As for the driving itself, some of the call-out seem blatantly wrong as I have had several ""3-opens"" turns that feel MUCH tighter than other ""2-tightens"" turns for example. Again, since there is no FFB its  clumsy and ""jerky"". The graphics are good and better than last year, draw-distance seems to be much improved as well, Sounds are ok I think -early days yet.

Physics: 5/10
Content: 9/10
FFB: 0/10
Fun: 6/10
Overall: 5/10

The game looks good. I don't have stuttering issues. It runs very well in 3D with tridef 3D default profile (i2600k GTX970).
The physics really improved since WRC6. But still a lot of room for improvment
The physics alone would make it enjoyable. Unfortunately the very disappointing force feedback holds it down. FFB is a real mess and doesn't allow me to feel the car at all.  
The big plus is the content. The stages are really good and plentiful. Junior WRC, WRC2 and WRC 2017 + 2016 is enough cars to play with.
If only they improve force feedback it would become an awesome title, I would highly recommend it and it would be worth full price. Right now I don't recommend it at full price to wheel users.",1505575255,1505575420,True,3,0,0.549211978912353516,0,True,False,False

I'm not an expert, but it feels good.
The FFB for me is also pretty good. Maybe not the highest standard I've experienced, but it's pretty good. I have the Thrustmaster T150. I heard some people with the G27 are not having such a good time, but it's going pretty Ok for me with the T150.
I wish this game had Rally Cross events, and some older cars.
It may not be perfect, but I think it's a big jump up in quality compared to WRC 6, and the physics are good so it gets my thumbs up.
I suck at rally games and this game is pretty punishing. The tracks are pretty much all narrow! Not for the casual arcade racer.
Some reviews mentioned Stuttering. I didn't have much of a stuttering issue after setting the correct fps and Vsync. Make sure your monitor hz is set to the same as the games fps.

Apart from forcing me to race the first two stages in a window, the game ran fine. No stuttering here - I wonder if this is related to the Geforce 10 series. 1080p, vsync off, nearly all settings on very high. 

The steering wheel also worked from the start. I copied a few suggestions from the RaceDepartment forums and it kinda works, but the FFB doesn't really feel right yet. Perhaps a patch or someone with more skill and patience than me will be able to get the settings right :)

The game itself seems really fun to drive. After tweaking the ingame settings a bit the cars are much better, and they are VERY fast. The graphics are nice and the tracks are really narrow.

This game might be great for the casual gamer, as it looks fantastic and have 
great stages. However, I want a game with great handling where the car reacts 
to my input, similar to real life. 

SIMULATION MODE:

Started the game and liked the way I was taken straight to what mode I wanted. 
Simulation and hardcore. But from there it went downhill. 

Suddenly I was thrown in the car with the view from the camera behind the car. 
Since I had not set up my buttons yet, I had to hit ESC to get this sorted out. 
While I was in the menu, I turned down a lot in the graphics settings, as the FPS 
was very low, down in the 20s.  I noticed some flickering, and then the game 
crashed, and took Steam along with it. 

After getting the game up and running again, I ended up setting every graphics 
setting to low, which still looked surprisingly good. I did not need to turn everything 
to low, but I did not want to waste my 2 hours by optimizing graphics.

After getting all settings sorted out, it was time to drive with hood cam. OMG... 
The lag! I changed view to headcam, and there it became obvious: 

https://www.youtube.com/edit?video_id=CdhInvUmJjE

How can they release a game with horrible lag like this? And just to be clear, 
I do not have any other controller connected.

I already had all the graphics settings on low, so it can not be that that causes 
it, and I tried with VSync on and off, but the lag was still there. This made the 
handling feel terrible. I played around with the wheel settings, but the car was 
no joy to drive. 

Wheel rotation cannot be set as you like. It was something like 256, 298, 346 
and so on with strange values. I usually drive with 270, so this was a 
disappointment too.

Then there was the problem with the FOV. There is not wide enough FOV for 
3 screens. On top of that, the FOV is changing as you brake or accelerate. 
WHY?? If you are going to simulate that your body is moving because of 
acceleration and braking, you need to move the point of view, not the FOV! 
Seriously? 

I wanted to check what FPS I had, so I went to window mode and enabled 
on-screen display in RivaTuner. Game crashed again. 

At this point I had already decided that this game is not for me, so I uninstalled 
it and got my refund. 

THOUGHTS: 


I kind of expected this game to fail, based on my experience with earlier WRC 
titles, but really hoped to be proven wrong, as we need a new rally game to 
replace DiRT Rally.  This could be a fantastic game, but seems to be made by 
people who just don`t understand what it takes to make a great sim. Handling 
first, then everything else...  

I don`t know if there might be some workaround to get rid of the lag, but since 
there are no DEMO, I`m not wasting my refund trying to find out if some setting 
might fix it.
