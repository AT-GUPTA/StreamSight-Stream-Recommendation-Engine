1. Real world physics. (Pretty close)
2. Nearly every vehicle in the game is based on old Soviet military technology. (1950's to early 70's) As such the springs are stiff (bouncy) and shocks are non existent on most of the trucks.  
3. The tires. Military type balloon tires and/or partially deflated tires for, you guessed it, mud running.
All these factors add up to vehicles designed for going slow and steady. 
 And the title is a bit misleading. Instead of MudRunner it should be named MudCrawler.

Here are some list that I liked the most in this 
Physics Oh my god I mean what are you guys eated on that time when you made this simulators most highlight part very impressive .
the way every vehicle behave when get them into the muds is so realistic . 
vehicles selections with their category .
varieties of different maps with different terrains .
enviroments sound is very acurrate I think
old russian trucks sounds 
I think it is also better than snowrunner overall 

players If you wants real offroad experience with no compromise than this is defintely for you you will love it .
No other offroad simulator ever come close to this simulator . And please support this simulator 

And please developers I request you to recieve updates . Do not leave this simulator alone  please

Gameplay is pretty thin, you can set AWD and Diff lock on and just hold W through most obstacles, theres never a reason to turn off these options.
Given that Snowrunner is basically a full price clone of this game its safe to say these games are both low effort cash grabs. My friend and I gave this game a couple of good tries but didn't have any fun at any point. Refunded.
Would not recommend.

It should also be noted that we both paid under $5 for this game and it was not worth that, so sales should not encourage you to purchase this.",1707510585,1707510653,False,5,1,0.415408521890640259,0,True,False,False

I play what 40 hours and Im already so fvkcing fed up with it its like any other slavic game studios. you walk around for days like in dayz. or you just put it in cruise and wait for it to get out of ... mud. and once you're out, there is more mud. so get prepared to sit there and watch the screen as you're racing out of mud pits doing not less than 1mph. Yes I get it some ppl love this. Watching the screen walking around in fps shooters just to then sit infront of a fire cooking your friend that you just killer or watching the screen where a truck struggles to get out of ridiculous and unrealistic amount of... you guessed it, mud.

Mudrunner is an off-road driving simulator set in Siberia. It's a slow but peaceful experience that definitely won't be for everyone. It wasn't for me. The game went from fun to boring quickly. There's not enough content or incentive to play with what we have. There are also other problems that I have listed below.
Personally, I can't recommend it. Still, if you're looking for a game about driving a truck through the wilderness, you may give it a chance. It's a niche genre, where you can't be too picky. 

[b]Story[/b]
No story mode.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
First and foremost. If you did operate anything in real life, then you'll find that the simulation part of the game isn't good. Almost everything is simplified and far from being realistic. If you expect something truly faithful to the real thing - you won't find it here.
The biggest selling point of the game - mud - is really fun. It can be a real struggle to get your car/truck out of it, which is not something common in gaming. How many games outside of Mudrunner, Snowrunner, and Spintires does it? Not many.
You have a few options to get out of the mud. By force but it can often backfire, with a second truck, or with a winch. Winching itself is done fairly well. Bigger trucks need to be attached to larger trees. Trunks or smaller trees may be enough for cars/small trucks. You simply can't do whatever.
The driving itself is not that good though. Almost all the trucks feel the same no matter the terrain. You barely feel the size and power of the machines that you're driving. 
This may not be a problem for some people, but I need to point it out. It feels like there's not enough incentive to make you play the game. I did finish almost all the missions, then did some freeriding... and it was enough for me. I couldn't force myself to do any jobs. I think that a currency and something to buy for it (like fuel/trucks/upgrades) would help a lot. Maybe an option to invest in your own business? Unfortunately, we got nothing.
I also dislike the controls. Just driving? Fine. Doing anything else? One big chore. Moving trees into the truck was especially painful.
The tutorial is poorly made. You won't get much out of it.

[b]Visuals and Audio[/b]
Visually, Mudrunner is solid. Certain textures and models aren't the highest quality (mainly things in the background, like trees or buildings), but the trucks themselves are great... as long as you're not looking at their interiors. They are just a low-quality copy-paste, that you don't want to look at.
The dynamic environment helps to hide ugly elements of the game. Nights and foggy weather are especially beautiful, and they help create a peaceful atmosphere.
Enjoy the sounds of trucks, because there's nothing else. No music and no radio.


[b]Technicalities[/b]
No stuttering or performance drops. It would be hard to achieve fps drops anyway, when the game is locked on 60. 
I did have one random crash. When it comes to smaller issues: no slider to change FOV, certain features are limited when playing in coop, and bugs with the physics of trucks.

But if you manage to find keys of the game with all dlc for a reasonable price then go for it (can go up to 500euros for the china dlc).

Cons:
-Of course graphics are outdated, the gameplay seems rather slow compared to snowrunner.
-Missions are just exploration and hauling logs.
-Multiplayer is dead unless you play with friends. 
-Not a colorfull game

But the way the vehicle behave and the feedback they give is by far superior to snowrunner.
Pro:
-One of the best offroad game games out there (even better with mods).
-Seeing the trucks going out of the mud is very satisfying as they get dirty and throw mud particles everywere.
-Because of the slower gamepace the vehicles are balanced and dont seem overpowered (like snowrunner), they have 
 actualy weight to them, not bouncy like the sequel.
-Once you understand the game, Mudrunner is by far easyer to play than Snowrunner because the engine is just superior (in Mudrunner each wheel is a connection to the road, wheras in Snowrunner the connection is in the middle of the axe, you can see that when the truck a ripping sideways)
-The manual gearbox with autotrust so you dont spend hours on the W or the controler trigger to advance

Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

""MudRunner"" delivers an authentic off-road simulation experience, but its appeal may be limited to a specific audience. Released in 2017, the game's dedication to realism and challenging terrain sets it apart, yet it also falls short in certain aspects.

One of the game's strengths lies in its impressive mud physics and environmental details. Navigating through various terrains with a diverse selection of off-road vehicles can be both satisfying and challenging. The sense of accomplishment when conquering difficult landscapes is a testament to the game's commitment to simulation.

The variety of vehicles and the open-world maps contribute to the game's replay value. Each vehicle feels distinct, offering a different experience in terms of handling and capabilities. The expansive maps, featuring diverse landscapes, provide ample opportunities for exploration and experimentation.

However, ""MudRunner"" might not resonate with a broader gaming audience. The deliberate pace and emphasis on realism make it less accessible for those seeking a more casual or action-packed gaming experience. The absence of a compelling narrative or structured progression may leave some players yearning for a stronger sense of purpose in their off-road adventures.

While the cooperative multiplayer mode adds a social element, the game's appeal may still be niche, catering primarily to enthusiasts of the off-road simulation genre. Additionally, the graphics and overall presentation, while serviceable, don't necessarily push the boundaries of what is expected in modern gaming.

In summary, ""MudRunner"" is a solid off-road simulation, but its appeal is likely confined to a specific audience. If you have a passion for realistic off-road challenges and don't mind the lack of a traditional narrative structure, ""MudRunner"" can offer an engaging and immersive experience. However, for those seeking a more diverse or fast-paced gaming experience, the muddy middle ground might not be compelling enough to warrant the journey.",1687949567,1704781263,True,6,0,0.459644407033920288,0,True,False,False

I love how they handle the cockip camera, it's so great to look around from inside the cockpit. In all other games, there are buttons to look around or even if you use the mouse to look around they always make you look from where your character's face is. In this game you use the mouse to look around but your character moves his head around so you can look outside the window, to the back and to the side almost as if looking out the window and can actually see around properly and realistically.

I'm sure people already talked about the various great features of this game and how good it is in general so I wanted to mention this specific thing I like about it.

I finished all missions in hardcore mode and always from the cockpit (only used outside cameras when stationary) and had a great sense of achievement.

I remember when Spin Tires originally came out and seeing videos of it's impressive simulation of mud physics. I was impressed but not convinced to buy in to what looked like a tech demo simulation of what could be a bigger game. To say I'm pleasantly surprised by Mud Runner would be just the surface level of what I could say about this game. I have Almost 10 hours in this game, and that was only spent doing the optional challenges. Those optional challenges that the game recommends you do before playing the main single player part of the game were so fun and genuinely challenging that it sucked me into this game. I played this entirely on my SteamDeck and was amazed by not only how well it ran, but how good the controller feels when controlling the game.

[h3] +Pros [/h3]
+Mud and earth physics that are very accurate.
+Workshop
+Many maps to play on with varying degrees of difficulty.
+Post release DLC that is pretty good. Quite a bit of it is free, as well.

[h3] ~Neutrals [/h3]
~This game is a slow burn , and takes time to play. I've played it for 30 hours, and most of the stock and DLC maps take roughly 2 hours to complete. I'm an experienced SpinTires and Snowrunner player, so noobs will spend more time that I did.

[h3] -Cons [/h3]
-Crashes frequently after reaching more than an hour in 1 sitting. Save often, and reboot the game every 30 or so minutes to avoid progress loss.
-Camera.
-Color palette is too close to photo-realism, and ends up looking extremely washed out.
-Sudden music when completing objectives.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4 Stars) - A hidden gem for the patient gamer

MudRunner, a game I heartily recommend to most players, is a title that excels both in its graphical and mechanical construction. In this game, you'll find yourself immersed in a world where precision and patience are the keys to success.

üåÑ Graphics and Mechanics - A Well-Built World üñ•Ô∏èüîß
MudRunner impresses with its attention to detail, both graphically and mechanically. The environment is beautifully crafted, immersing you in a world where every puddle, every tree, and every mud pit feels authentic. The robust mechanics behind the game's physics engine give a sense of realism that's hard to come by.

üöö Missions and Challenges - A Test of Skill and Patience üìã
The heart of MudRunner lies in its missions and challenges. From delivering garage parts to locked garages, transporting logs from point A to B, to exploring the vast map, every task demands precision. The beauty is that you have a variety of vehicles at your disposal, each strategically placed on the map and customizable in your garage, allowing you to tailor your ride for the task at hand.

üö¶ Patience Is Paramount ‚è≥
In this game, rushing headlong into challenges isn't the path to success. MudRunner rewards those who approach each task with caution and patience. It's the most crucial skill you can possess in the game. When you embrace patience, MudRunner transforms from a potentially dull experience into a highly enjoyable and satisfying one.

MudRunner is a game where the journey is as important as the destination. It's not about speed, but about the art of off-road maneuvering and conquering the unpredictable terrain. So, take a deep breath, go slow, and savor every mud-splattered moment. If you're looking for a game that rewards a measured approach and a steady hand, MudRunner is a hidden gem well worth your time. üåßÔ∏èüõ§Ô∏èüöú",1542962813,1697881631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Did you want to drive a truck?  Many trucks? Do you want to drive a truck that when you steer it goes where you want it to? Did you actually want to drive to an objective without it taking hours? 

OR Do you want to always drive at 5 mph on any terrain, and anything faster you will spin out of control?

This game SUUUUCCCCCKKKKKKS.  I, for the life of me, have no idea why, between this game, and Snow-runner, does ANYONE compare it to ATS.

I have a game I can compare it to...Ship Simulator: EXTREME.  Where the ships go as fast as the trucks in this game, and the ships control as shAt as molasses, just like the trucks in this game.

I've never not wanted to play a game so much until it comes to this game.  Every time I start it I forget how much it sucked the last time I played it.  I don't want -to get stuck all the time-; to spend hours getting myself -unstuck-, for it to happen again 3 minutes later.

The terrain is shAt. The controls are shAt.  I don't understand how any sim living in this environment gets anywhere.
It's like Canada (or West Virginia) on steroids.  Going to get a gallon of milk I feel they would have to pack survival gear because there is a possibility they aren't coming back.  It's like Oregon Trail, but with gas.

How, anyone in their mind, would ever want to play a game, where, there is constant failure every time you start it....
oh....That would be the Dark Souls franchise.  This game is the Dark Souls of truck driving.

If you are that, enjoy this shAt game.",1697716082,1697719522,False,2,1,0.485243052244186401,0,True,False,False

""MudRunner"" is an off-road simulation game that immerses players in the challenging and often treacherous world of navigating through thick mud, dense forests, and rugged terrain. Developed by Saber Interactive and published by Focus Home Interactive, this game offers a realistic and exhilarating experience for both off-road enthusiasts and those looking for a unique gaming challenge.

The heart of ""MudRunner"" lies in its faithful recreation of off-road driving. You take control of powerful, customizable vehicles, including trucks and all-terrain vehicles, as you traverse harsh landscapes that pose a constant challenge. The physics engine is a standout feature, accurately simulating the interactions between your vehicle's tires, the terrain, and the mud, creating a dynamic and immersive off-road experience.

The game's environments are expansive and diverse, featuring dense forests, rivers, rocky hills, and, of course, lots and lots of mud. Each map presents a series of challenging objectives, such as delivering cargo or rescuing vehicles, which require careful planning, strategy, and sometimes a bit of trial and error. The sense of accomplishment when you successfully navigate your vehicle through a particularly tough section of mud or terrain is immensely rewarding.

""MudRunner"" offers both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing you to team up with friends to tackle the challenging missions or engage in freeform exploration. Multiplayer enhances the experience, as coordination and teamwork become essential for success, and it's also where the game's community shines with custom mods and additional content.

While ""MudRunner"" excels in many aspects, it's not without its quirks and potential frustrations. The game's learning curve can be steep, especially for newcomers to off-road simulation. The user interface and controls may take some getting used to, and the lack of a traditional tutorial can make the initial hours somewhat daunting.

Additionally, the game's pace can be slow, as off-road driving demands patience and precision. Some players may find this deliberate pace enjoyable, while others might prefer a faster, more action-packed experience.

In summary, ""MudRunner"" is a niche game that delivers a remarkably authentic and satisfying off-road simulation experience. It caters to enthusiasts of the genre who crave the challenges of navigating tough terrain, battling mud, and mastering their vehicles. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its learning curve and methodical gameplay, those who appreciate realism and a unique challenge will find ""MudRunner"" to be a muddy, thrilling adventure that captures the essence of off-road exploration. Get ready to embrace the wild, dirty world of off-road driving and discover the joys and trials of conquering the elements one mudslide at a time.

In general, this is a hardcore, realistic driving game in voxel dirt. You failed and your truck is stuck? You drive carelessly and overturn? –íring another truck and pull yourself out. You run out of gas? Well, take another truck, drive to gas storage and bring some. You get caught by nightfall? Well, drive through the night. Turn on all wheel drive. Lock differential. Use simplified manual shifter. All for hardcore! The only thing I miss is wild animals that could be a threat also.

Another thing to praise is great atmosphere. The game gives very authentic look of wild eastern forests of Russia, far from big cities. The forest, all the machines, the dirt, all places look very-very true!

First and most important is that there is no way to compare different vehicles or see what equipment is compatible with them. Without any indication of the differences, there is little to no reason to switch between them, especially when you can just 'make do' with whatever you have currently selected.

The second problem is that the core gameplay is extremely similar in every single map or mission, to the point of becoming monotonous (even with just my 14h of playtime). This is exacerbated by the fact that there is no way to fully supply a lumber mill in a single trip (at least not without resorting to cheesy physics exploits), so you are forced to do repeat trips.

Aside from the points above, it is rather frustrating that there is little to no visual indication of which terrain can be easily crossed and which terrain will bog you down to your axles. Blindly fording rivers is also an exercise in frustration, as it is impossible to predict which parts are traversable and which aren't.

Honestly, if they added a bit more info on the vehicles and had destinations require different amounts of cargo, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game.",1694426752,1694426752,False,1,0,0.478908181190490723,0,True,False,False

The terrain deformation is amazing, mud sticks to your wheels, you can see the [i]trucks[/i] deforming when handling rough terrain... The way the vehicle interacts with the ground has no equal, really.

But then the game looks bleak, and there isn't much of a game, really. Every map is about the same thing : pick a truck, explore and place whatever you need where you need it to repair and refuel or transfer cargo from truck A to truck B, then pick up some wood and deliver it. I get it, it's more of an excuse to drive the vehicles and give the player a goal, but that's all. It's not a bad thing, it plays kind of like a puzzle game, ""what am I gonna do to deliver that wood here"" is a nice problem to solve, but it certainly is something you need to be aware of.

It's a good thing you don't need to spend time advancing a career mode to enjoy what there is, but it's also a bit... lacking. The little brother game, Snowrunner, has a much simplified physics (still great, better than most games, just not on par with this one), but it's a better game overall, as it looks better (it's important to enjoy the scenery when you're crawling at 5 km an hour, and gives you many more excuses to carry stuff from A to B. Whether the career progression is a good or bad things will depend on your personal taste.

Still, I do recommend MudRunner. You can get everything it has to offer for the price of a cofee to go during a sale, and thr modding community makes sure it won't go stale. However, if you're looking for a game that is more game-ish rather than a mud physics framework, I would recommend Snowrunner instead. Be aware though that the little brother has a shit-ton of paid DLC, so if you really do enjoy it, it might cost you quite a bit to collect everything you'd like to have. That being said, the base game is good enough to start.

And in case of doubt, buy MudRunner. It's cheap and you'll quickly know if crawling through the mud at snail pace in a hulking mechanical beast is your thing or not.

Now as a snowrunner player myself, and some of you might not like me at first.

I honestly think this and snowrunner are in the same kind of abstract pain, but i love it, i do have to adjust to this game's controls simply because i'm not used to them. but all in all, i love this game the same way i do snowrunner!

8.6/10, Just the same rating as snowrunner, because both of these games are good. i don't care what you folks think! they're both good!

P.S. The music of the trilogy goes WAY HARDER than it needs to. i love it! from the music where you boot the game up, to the achievement track, it's still going hard every time i hear it.",1690941087,1690941087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Games are great because they let you do anything or be anyone. You can be Aloy, an adventurous warrior adept at killing robotic animals in a far-flung future. You can explore entire planets and travel through a vast galaxy in No Man‚Äôs Sky. In Everything, you can be, well, anything. In Spintires: Mudrunner, your goal is to move logs around a particularly muddy patch of land.

That‚Äôs perhaps a little unfair of us, though. This is an impressive off-road simulation title that, while on the surface may appear dull as dishwater, is surprisingly compelling. As we said, the basic objective in the main game is to traverse treacherous terrain in heavy duty vehicles, delivering timber from A to B. It sounds like a simple enough task, but there are a number of factors working against you.

One of them is the brilliant physics simulation at the heart of Mudrunner. The trucks are slow, heavy things with a convincing weight and realistic suspension that reacts as you‚Äôd expect to the conditions at hand. Equally, the mud and water react dynamically to your vehicle as you drive. Deep tracks are carved in the muck as you push through, your tires clogging with earth and slipping in the increasingly poor conditions. Water displaces realistically and washes the mud from your wheels. Rivers have currents that can force you off course or tip you over if you‚Äôre not careful.",1626517245,1690188389,True,8,0,0.642857134342193604,0,True,False,False

from hauling logs to just going off-road, it's a lot of fun.

Mud runner is a very unique game: This is a rock (or rather mud) crawler simulator. You must drive off-road with mostly USSR trucks. There are other vehicles, but these are kind of useless compared to appropriately equipped trucks. There are many maps to complete. The objective is to transport wood from specific points to sawmills.

The cool thing is that you can solve every map the way you want. There is no money, nor time limit. Just your own choice of vehicle, equipment, and paths to reach the goals. You can explore the map to unlock garages where you can equip your trucks (with trailers, tanks, cranes, etc.). You can also find vehicles ‚Äúlost‚Äù in the map, and quickly remove the fog of war by reaching special watch towers.

PRO:
* The graphics and sounds are really good and appropriate.
* Physics simulations are top notch. Probably one of the best.
* The immersion is surprisingly good, especially in cockpit view: from the sounds of the swamps to water streams clearing the mud from your tires, you really feel in are deep in the bog!
* Gamepad ergonomics are good.

CON:
* Very slow pace: not for everyone. This is a simulator, therefore, like in real life, you will craw at the speed of a running man.
* There is not much variety: As soon as you understand what and how to do things properly, the game becomes kind of easy, it is just a matter of doings things slowly‚Ä¶
* I would I liked more challenging or originality in maps. Only a very few maps have mountains, most of them are just the usual forest and swamps.

Now, I believe all the cons have been improved in the sequel snow runner.

All in all, this is an original and entertaining game if you just want to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù with a slow driving simulator.",1686510417,1686510417,True,8,0,0.582771778106689453,0,True,False,False

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)

MudRunner, the ultimate off-road driving experience, immerses players in the challenging and gritty world of navigating treacherous terrains and conquering the unforgiving power of nature. This realistic driving simulator delivers an adrenaline-fueled adventure that will put your skills and patience to the test.

One of the standout features of MudRunner is its attention to detail when it comes to recreating the mud-filled environments. From dense forests and rocky hills to swampy marshes and rivers, every terrain feels meticulously crafted. The physics-based mud simulation is superb, making each tire spin, slide, and dig its way through the muck with impressive realism. The sense of weight and the struggle against the elements create a unique and immersive driving experience.

The game offers a variety of challenging missions and tasks to undertake, ranging from simple deliveries to intricate rescue operations. The open-world maps are vast and provide ample opportunities for exploration and discovery. Every mission presents its own set of challenges, forcing players to carefully plan their routes, utilize winches and differential locks, and make strategic decisions to overcome obstacles and reach their destination.

The selection of vehicles in MudRunner is diverse and caters to different play styles. From sturdy trucks and off-road behemoths to nimble scouts, each vehicle has its own strengths and weaknesses. The sensation of handling these vehicles feels authentic, and mastering their nuances adds an extra layer of satisfaction to the gameplay.

MudRunner also offers a multiplayer component, allowing players to team up and tackle challenges together. Coordinating with friends or fellow drivers adds an exciting social element and enhances the cooperative nature of the game. Overcoming obstacles as a team is immensely rewarding and can lead to some truly memorable moments.

While MudRunner excels in its realistic and immersive gameplay, it may not appeal to everyone. The slow pace and deliberate nature of off-road driving can be seen as a downside for those seeking more fast-paced action. Additionally, the lack of a traditional narrative might leave some players craving a more structured and engaging storyline.

In conclusion, MudRunner delivers a compelling and authentic off-road driving experience. The attention to detail, challenging terrains, and realistic physics create an immersive world that rewards patience, skill, and strategic thinking. Whether you're a fan of off-road adventures or simply crave a unique driving experience, MudRunner is a muddy delight worth getting stuck in. So gear up, embrace the mud, and prepare for a thrilling journey that will push your driving abilities to their limits.",1672109998,1685707893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is also co-op mode so you can play with friend. I highly recommend getting it on sale where you can pick both game and expansion for about $5

[h1] Pros [/h1]

- Good truck selection, basically all famous Soviet machines are in the game, American Wilds Expansion also adds few cool American trucks and pickups. Vehicle mods are also decent, you can add stuff like cranes, extra repair equipment and such.
- Vehicle physics for muddy roads are well made, weight of your truck can easily get you stuck proper if you are not careful.
- There are ""regular"" maps and ""challenges"" which are fun. Maps are not too big but not small either, perfect size for about hour or two of gameplay per map.
- There is no bazillion DLC's like with Snowrunner.

[h1] Cons [/h1]

- Optimization is not the best, I get fps drops in some areas, especially if truck is loaded with cargo.
- Game can become bit repetitive quickly, basically end goal of every map is to deliver logs to lumber station, It would been nice if there was multiple cargo delivery objectives (Snowrunner improved on this fortunately).
- Vehicle physics on paved roads is hot mess, luckily there isn't many paved roads.",1683449454,1683449454,True,8,2,0.575739800930023193,0,True,False,False

It is definitelly unique, I like the graphics, I like the physics how is used in this game, driving all trucks seems to be quite realistic for me. Therefore I think game is implemented very well.

What I think about the game content? First you need to finish a tutorial - it explains very well how not to get stuck in mud - there is always a way how to get unstuck.

Then you can start the main game. Goal is quite simple - to find a log station, load truck with logs and then go to the lumber mill. There are about 8 various trucks in the whole area. You need to find that truck to unlock it and then you can swith between all unlocked trucks. I recommend to find some bigger truck, then go to the garage. There you can convert truck to log carrier, then you can load some logs and go to the lumber mill. All of this is much easier said than done- because you need to travel quite long distance with each truck, quite long distance to lumber mill, you also need to go to the fuel station to refuel your trucks from time to time. Therefore it actually takes quite a lot of time, this game is slow paced. You need to spend a lot of time in mud before you deliver your first truck load of logs.

This game is based on few quite simple principles, therefore you don't need to think too much while playing it. This is actually quite opposite of racing games - you are going at speed like 15 mph most of the time :-)",1680981424,1680982553,True,4,0,0.534601151943206787,0,True,False,False

The game focuses on driving large tractor-trailers and ensuring the transportation of timber and other loads over various obstacles and difficult terrains.

While this game is a great experience for some players, I can understand how you might find it boring after a few minutes of play. Without enough interest in heavy vehicle driving simulators in challenging conditions, it can be difficult to find fun in this game.

However, the game offers a wide variety of games and game modes that may be of interest to those interested in truck driving. Players can drive through different maps and terrains, face challenges and complete various tasks. The game also offers a multiplayer mode, which can be an interesting experience for those who want to team up with other players and overcome obstacles together.

Overall, MudRunner can be an interesting game for players who are interested in driving simulators of heavy vehicles in challenging conditions.

Pros:
- Alcoholism in SIberia
- The land actually remembers what you did, if you rut up a passage too much you'll have to find a new way, very realistic
- The vehicles, though slightly limited, are nifty, random Russian jeeps, Chevy Blazers, etc
- Relaxing, this is a great game for people who are sick of games with timers or people shooting at you

Cons:
- The driving physics they tried to nail, in real life deep mud and stuff your steering IS a bit wonky, this feels too wonky
- I wish you could change your tire pressure, because when ya DO drive on a real road its still all over the place cuz the tires have like 15 lbs of pressure
- The views or lack thereof, and constantly having to shift them  with the right stick, gets old quick
- Cruise control, you cant change the view just put it in neutral or whatever

The level design was exceptional and the attention to detail was remarkable. As I played through each level, I found myself analyzing the game mechanics and studying how the developers were able to create such a seamless and immersive experience.

The physics engine was also incredibly impressive. The way the mud and water behaved, as well as the various types of vehicles and equipment available, made for a truly engaging and challenging experience. As someone who has worked with physics engines in the past, I can say that MudRunner's is one of the best I've seen.

Overall, I think MudRunner is a fantastic game that any game developer or level designer should play. It's a great example of how to create a cohesive and challenging experience that keeps players engaged from start to finish.

I've downloaded the DLC, but even then, the gameplay is lacking. The first mission is to deliver wood. Fair enough. Issue is the only route is the longest route around the map. It's extremely grindy and for no reason that I can determine.

I haven't completed the first mission either.

On top of that, there's no incentive to even do any jobs. Fuel is unlimited and free. Trucks are simply unlocked by driving around the map. 

While it's nice to have free options when getting started, there is NO currency in this game whatsoever. (I haven't completed the first mission but it should be clear if money plays a role or not). THere are no trucks to buy, no garages to purchase, no business to expand. The gameplay is dull.

THe driving also leaves alot to be desired. All the trucks feel the same and the terrain hardly affects how the trucks handle. Driving on asphalt feels exactly the same as driving on dirt.

The interiors have the same dashboard copied and pasted. The vehicles in this game are licensed by real manufacturers so I'm surprised that no effort was spared into designing the vehicles or the handling charateristics.

There are the challenges which honestly, is what I expected from the missions in the campaign.

I thought this game would be interesting but honestly, it just feels like a chore. There are no sounds or music during the game play. There's no traffic. there's hardly any content here. This feels like a basic indie game with no replayability. (Although, for what it's worth, the challenges are somewhat fun imo).

The big let down for me is it feels over-exaggerated when it comes to the effects of the environment on the vehicles. Sure, if all of the muddy roads in the world had the consistency of oatmeal, you'd be getting stuck every 5 minutes.  But even driving on asphalt, even wet asphalt is dicey, or should I say icy. If all of the vehicles in the world reacted like this game, nobody would get anywhere or get anything done. I do see where they are going with the game, but it's more frustration than fun.  First attempt to drive an unloaded semi truck from a short relatively level muddy road to get out on the asphalt and you get stuck. Can that happen in real life? Sure, if you let the roads become a swamp! I get it, that's the challenge, but it just doesn't feel realistic enough for me.  Otherwise I do like the dynamic nature of the road changing, and mud and rocks moving, and the overall concept of the game, but it just feels ridiculously overexaggerated.",1674410960,1674410960,False,0,0,0.464135020971298218,0,True,False,False

Now I got why I couldn't make myself fully enjoy Snowrunner. Mudrunner is so much fun in contrast to its sequel. Arguably, it even looks better with moody, dark style - so different than what Snowrunner serves. But importantly, in Mudrunner you can fully use a steering wheel with a clutch and H-shifter and it is awesome! While in Snowrunner it seems to be a pointless struggle to set up your steering wheel, in Mudrunner I actually can do more and much faster (I have set up reverse where usually I have 1st gear and 1st gear is in place of usual 2nd - that makes getting out of mud so much easier than shifting the virtual gearbox with use of gamepad). I recommend setting up racing wheel buttons to resemble default controller setup - this way it is fluent for seasoned gamepad player to start using steering wheel with this game. And to finally put Snowrunner in its place, I have to say that in this game I really feel that my controller (regardless if it is gamepad or steering wheel) is connected to vehicle I drive. I feel immediate throttle response, I need to be careful with clutch and gears - otherwise I will damage the vehicle.

I probly have the worst time doing the missions. for I like to explore ever inch of the map. and even when my mission is almost done. I go and run all my trucks that I found on the map. and play with them up hills. or in the deepest water. and when I lose them I like to see if I can go get them. 50-50 the water will push me or my truck to a point were I can get them. other 50 % of the time my truck sinks. and looks cool as hell waching it trurn. and down deep in the water. I will then walk in to the game form a diffrent point of veiw and I ask my self how dose a truck get all the way out here whats its storry..  this possble the most fun game I have ever played in my life. I had this game a few years before I realy got into it.  all u do is go get wood. but the maps and the missions you can change to hard core and deer god. its on dark soul elve of asss pain. and when I got so epicly skilled and good. I jump on a new mapl and I am scared terfied to crose water or go thew deep mud. not knowing if I lose my sweet baby big engen truck. I often wot take the risk in free of loseing a truck that you will be stuck to work with weak trusk the the rest of the game..  super fun I so far have played about 4 days with 12-18 hours. also had to quit my job.  so I could have more time to explore the map still have like 6 more maps,1670134031,1670134031,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Steam has clocked me well below my in-game time, I completed about 1 hour or so.

Additionally in all my years of trying new genres of games I have been reluctant to try These types of Sims, I have no experience with trying similar titles to this.

So, let's have a look at the reasons for me not recommending this game, first off.. its pretty ugly looking, the in cab view looks PS2 and the general camera angles are annoying, furthermore i have a truck, I have driven a skidsteer and have experience driving a old 1980s large logging truck before, right through the woods at my cousins sawmill / farm property, we occasionally drove in swampier parts with little ease, big mudders just ripped on through with ease.

No my biggest complaint is the controls, everything feels floaty, punishing you for going to fast... even though the 80s f150 I used can easily knockout some of the dirt trails at 70 or 80kms an hour... anything above walking speed and you fishtail like crazy, you get stuck in knee high water easily and takes forever to get anywhere... have the devs never gone mudding before?

The missions seem repetitive and boring overall, the goals make you go back and fourth... honestly not very fun and kinda puts me to sleep. The missions also give little help, you must figure stuff out on your own which I am ok with.

Good trucking music would have helped quite a bit as well.

I know I only completed an hour and I am sure it will get better but I am not going to spin my tires and wait to find out.

Not recommended, not true to the simulation it is trying to portray.

Only for small gaps of time did I only own a car, but even then I would somehow found myself on a dirty/muddy trail, acting as though it were a lifted up pickup truck. That being said...I know the limitations of a road legal pickup, hence why you see so many obscure old school trucks and giant semi truck looking dinosaurs of vehicles. That's because these are the actual off-road units that could achieve what they do in this game. A ford f150 or 250/350 or a chevy 1500-3500, would be so stuck and buried almost instantaneously on these levels it would blow your mind. Thank you creators for making such an incredible and realistic sandbox style game for me to re-live my earlier years, and feel the nostalgia of getting so hung up in mud :P The only realism point you seemed to not include (thankfully) was the on foot transit between truck and winch-point, then back...lol that was always hell especially in places this game takes you, I think about it every  time I have to winch...Gawd I'm glad this is a video game lmfao.",1661529249,1661529249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a sandbox, where your main task is to deliver logs to lumber mill. It might sound easy at first, but believe me, on the way to the lumber mill, your truck will run out of fuel, flip and might even get so damaged, that you would need to repair it! The base game is based in Russia, but if you buy the ""American Wilds"" expansion for a few bucks more, you'll get the pleasure to ride on American roads.

Russian vehicles have modified front grills and made up names due to copyright reasons, but all of the American vehicles have the real appearance.

The grapchics are quite unique, but and awesome. The mud physics are really good too.

This game has an amazing community, with tons of modders, so if you get bored of the base game, you will find a ton of mods to make it intresting. Also, there is multiplayer.

So, I recommend you to try this game out, if you like cars, trucks or offroading, I think you'll find this game pleasent. 10/10.",1659817541,1659817782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MudRunner is an off-road simulation game that mostly focuses around exploring. There is different maps and locations to explore. With the game's realistic physics engine, you can maneuver a vehicle through mud and raging rivers that realistically react to your weight and movement in an immersive sandbox environment. You get stuck much easier when you carry heavier cargo. The mud and train behave just as you would expect them to behave in real life. You must plan your route based on your cargo. 
MudRunner requires you to carry logs to a destination without damaging the car and without wasting fuel because that could leave you out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. In that case, your friend might be able to help you, since this game is playable in solo and cooperative multiplayer with up to 4 players. You need to complete your objective and deliverables in extreme weather conditions within wild, untamed landscapes in dynamic day-night cycles, driving powerful vehicles each with their own features and accessories.
As I said, your task is to deliver logs, and you do that only using a compass and a map that is yet to be discoverable at the beginning. As you drive around on the map, it will be discovered. On the map are small watchtowers. If you drive to one of the watchtowers, a large section of the map becomes visible for you. You will need to get the logs at the log station and also visit the fuel station after you have driven some distance.
In order to complete the map, you need to deliver a total of 8 log points. Your vehicle's attachments will have to be modified according to the size of the cargo you will be picking up. As an example, if you take a particular attachment you can only take 4 log points, and if you are playing alone you must deliver twice. You might not be able to take a large attachment on your vehicle because that would make it too heavy.
You must be picky about the vehicles you take. On some maps, you can drive on roads, while on others, you'll only find mud trails and challenging trains. 
Getting a high vehicle is important when crossing rivers so your engine doesn't stall. If you are not sure if you can cross a river, you can change vehicles in game. They are vehicles that you need to discover in order to be able to change into them in the game. The vehicles you discover can then be used on other maps too.
In the case where you or a friend gets stuck there is a winch that can be used to help, whereas if you aren't playing with a friend you can use your own winch. 
If you like variety, you can also find some good DLCs in the game.

[hr][/hr][h2] üí≠Final Thoughts: [/h2][hr][/hr]
The game MudRunner is one of the most frustrating I have ever played, designed to be frustrating. It's designed to thwart your progress and frustrate you, but there is some satisfaction in overcoming these challenges. The game is very good at burning time, so I would recommend it to a person who likes to take things easy and want some challenge at the same time.

Pros: Love that you can customize the vehicles hardware setup and even run tandem loads! (Not two trailers, 1 trailer and the log carriage attached to the half ton)
Very good selection of vehicles (Tractors/ 1995 F150/ Western Star transports, Ford half tonnes, weird soviet era 
offroading trucks that DO NOT get stuck, jeeps etc)
Beautiful graphics/ scenery layouts 
Good variation between maps
Very realistic tip-over physics (I've lost my load MANY times lol)
Atmosphere is quite nice and relaxing after studying or having a hectic day
Cool music plays when you get an achievement (never seen that before!)

Cons: There was a small learning curve at first but ultimately I found the UI to be quite intuitive and easy to navigate. 
No aesthetic vehicle customization/ horsepower upgrades (Solved with mods)
Could have been more variations for vehicle attachments
Steering can be somewhat clunky even with my razer controller. Keyboard is not very effective on this game at all. 
No traffic....? I mean IK it's a backwoods logging town but it feels kind of like you're the last person on earth XD
Four wheeler would be a nice edition to an offroading game with everything else but!
More incentive to level up would be nice
Shorter mission times would be nice

I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

+ Realistic mud physics, tires physics, water physics, driver reaction to off-road driving, truck horn pushing the surrounding area, etc.
+ System requirements are pretty small so old PC can play this game (I guess).
+ Maps are pretty big you can almost go anywhere.
+ Lots of mods in Steam Workshop (some of them are kinda unrealistic & cheating, if you want to play the easy way).
+ Price is very cheap when on sale.
- Objectives are might be too repetitive, you just need to deliver logs.
- The mud makes you drive very slow, or maybe you'll get stuck in the mud forever, which is kinda annoying.

I take that as 55% of people got bored with this game on the first mission and never came back.

That's because this game gets real old, real fast.  Constantly fighting the terrain to deliver the same stuff over the same roads in the same vehicle very quickly becomes a chore and stops being fun.  Your vehicle constantly yeeting itself in random directions, even on smooth paved surfaces, demands your full attention on every inch of a delivery.   There's no zen or relaxation you might in x Truck Simulator or other sim games that let you mentally check out and do tasks repeatedly.  And there's no real payoff or gratifying progression you'd expect from giving such attention and effort to a game.  It's like pouring your effort into a void that doesn't know you exist.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
- The game gives off the post soviet vibes really well
- The game looks really good and the physics of the environment are insanely good
- Driving feels great, but it takes a little getting use to
- Up to 4 player coop
- Challenge gamemode
- 9 Maps
- Steam trading cards, achievements etc.

[b][u]Neutral:[/u][/b]
- Not a huge variety in vehicles, and most of them aren't even that useful

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- You only deliver logs, nothing else
- The hand of your truck driver goes through the wheel which irritates me in first person view
- In multiplayer, you cannot see the other player's truck light nor see a driver in their trucks which ruins immersion

Wasn't a fan of the unrealistic way things handle. I have never seen a car scrape the side of a guardrail and have it's engine completely shot. It's a hard game, and I don't mind that, just save yourself the hassle of really wonky controls if you get upset easy. Thought this would suit my car needs but I guess not.


UPDATED REVIEW:

I have revisited the game. I saw it was on sale and decided to pick it up again. I misjudged the game a lot. There are still a lot of issues but those issues are what make the game somewhat charming now.

My largest issues are the unrealistic damage and inability for vehicles to drive correctly on smooth terrain. Driving a truck across pavement is about like controlling a car on ice. It's clunky and feels awful (this is more prominent in the American Wilds DLC).

However, the game has a strategy, and when I originally bought this, I was not looking to play a strategy sandbox. This game requires careful learning and strategic driving to make things work. It's quite cathartic when you get the hang of it.

Overall, the game is a good game for strategic driving sim fans. Still avoid if you get angry super easily.",1577673608,1653972278,True,0,0,0.499793499708175659,0,True,False,False

It's just one of those kinds of games.  Just a little history from my understanding of this game.  I played the original Spintires when it came out and it was great too.  However, I think the developer had issues with the publisher and things couldn't get done correctly.  Such as updates and additions to the game in timely matters, etc.  So the quality of the game in the developer's and the eyes of the fans suffered, at no fault of the developer.  So think of Mudrunners as not a remaster of Spintires but what the developer wanted Spintires to be, to begin with.  It is Spintires Complete if you will.  This game is simple yet complex in its own limitations.  It is a simulation game.  You log to some extent.  It is mainly an off-road get stuck in the mud game.  It is depicted to be set in the Russian woods in various remote areas.  Which is really cool and kind of creepy. 
 Real-world physics applies to what it would be like to try and do this.  This game is addicting and fun to play in long segments and you keep wanting to come back to it.  I would like to see the addition of wildlife added to the game.  Things like Deer, bears, Alligators, and Rabbits.  Having them roaming around and being startled by your vehicles would be added to the environments of the game I think.

Shifting gears is way more satisfying in MudRunner. Off-roading more real. Graphics are grittier.

There isn't a ton of content that comes with MudRunner (especially compared to SnowRunner). But that's OK. The best maps are actually fan created. And there are a lot of them. Start with anything by dmitriy1815 on the Steam workshop.

[h1]Gameplay Overview[/h1]

Since MudrRunner operates in an off-roading genre of its own, you might not know what to expect from the game.

There aren't really any rules other than the stated objective (deliver logs to the logmill), but each mission usually involves 3 distinct phases:

[olist]
[*]Exploration - using a scouting vehicle to find most/all the watchtowers in order to reveal the map, to help with the next phase...
[*]Logistics - there are various unlockables around the map (vehicles, garages) that will help you logistically with the next phase; also putting vehicles like fully-fueled tankers at strategic points so you can refuel
[*]Delivery - you need to retrieve logs from one of the sources around the map and bring them to each of the log mills on the map (usually easier said than done)
[/olist]

The challenge comes from the unpredictable terrain. It's going to get your vehicle stuck, burn through your fuel, and provide plenty of opportunities to roll your vehicle or get swept away in the the currents.

What you should know is that you're going to face most of these challenges at 3MPH. Like you could walk across the map faster than you'll be able to drive, if that was an option (it isn't). This is going to turn off many people. But if you can get past it, you'll find a meditative, zen-like experience. There's a reason people put 100s of hours into playing this game.",1650590179,1650591461,True,8,0,0.618448555469512939,0,True,False,False

The thing you use to attach everything in-game, such as to select logs, to select the equipment, even the damn map seems fine for that 5 hours fun, but it started acting up after 10/15+ hours, mismatching the agility it is required for the late game. This is terrible and damages the sweet spot it has to offer. It is one of the things you use the most, only intensifying in hardcore mode on late game. I have a theory in the end of why.

„ÄêÔªøÔº°„ÄÄÔº¶Ôº•Ôº∑„ÄÄÔºßÔºØÔºØÔº§„ÄÄÔº•Ôº∏Ôº°Ôº≠Ôº∞Ôº¨Ôº•Ôº≥„Äë

When you park the truck next to the logging and go work your way with the crane - both the truck menu and the logging's gets above one another and of everything else, all while the crane mixes it up - you eventually get crazy trying to organize everything because the information overloads, not even the mouse cursor can help you, not really and it is just chaotic. Fine to endure for an hour, but not to complete the game. Not sure if the GUI is only faulty in that situation, as the crazy camera won't cooperate when you need either.

„ÄêÔªøÔº¥Ôº®Ôº•„ÄÄÔº£Ôº°Ôº≠Ôº•Ôº≤Ôº°„Äë

Not intuitive as it should - at all. It has gotten really tiresome to work around, because it never memorizes the zoom you previously left it over - it does memorize the position but the zoom is irritating, it never gets right which is a shame for a game like this, functionalities of it does not fully attend the game. The orbiting is so clumsy and blocky, so insufficient you can barely aim to exactly where you need. The winch starts to get on the nerves as well because it depends of that camera to be reliable, it only the adds frustration.


„ÄêÔªøÔº¥Ôº®Ôº•„ÄÄÔº¥Ôº®Ôº•ÔºØÔº≤Ôºπ„Äë

In the end of the day, these things won't really act against the majority of players because they don't seem to go hardcore as the game demands... and that's convenient for the game. If you go take a look, a lot of us already owns and plays the game and that's really cool. But simple challenges such as towing a truck out of water, barely hits half of the total MudRunner gamer population. Some challenges such ""Caravan"", driving two trucks with logs barely hits 8% of us, which is absurd, given it is literally the first real tactical objective in the game.

[h1]Pros - the reason I give this a positive score[/h1]

[list][*]Incredible attention to outside detail, both audible and visual, its aging really well.

[*]Impressive realistic physics. I even think they had to downplay it to some extent.

[*]Hardcore mode and its challenges can make you sweat for real, like a real damn job.

[*]Playing with friends you know for team work is fun, an excellent time killer.[/list]

[h1]Cons - Sorry to disappoint but hat's the reality[/h1]

[list][*]The map has a parasitic prompt that only exists to be irritating.[/list]

Once you click the path you want on the map and connect the gps web, a small box written ""ok"" shows up with the distance you just clicked. But when you need to click again somewhere near, the damn prompt remains above it and you can't work the details. Unless you rotate or orbit the camera around the map, so the prompt gets out of the way.

[list][*]Hardcore mode lacks realistic approach on the winch, because the tool is just too easy to use and to connect to everything.

[*]There is no side mirrors to reflect things from 1st person, say like Euro Truck Sim has, forcing you to frequently swap into third person since the window won't always work.

[*]Camera needs more freedom and does not memorize previous zoom. [/list]

Even with the option off, it stills autocenter when using 1st person. Anchoring third person camera to specific heights or sides is very primitive for such high-quality game. It is like trying to fit a Bettle's engine into a Ferrari. Imagine the sound of that.

[list][*]Menu navigation is confusing and can super impose other things. It can get nasty in late game chaos. It is easier to tolerate it than the camera.

[*]Truck's cockpit needs the same attention to detail than the rest of the graphics. You don't see real controls in the panels, it is simulated with the interface itself (speedometer etc.)[/list]

When water is everywhere, nothing gets through inside. There is no way to wipe the windshields as I'm aware of and it takes some time for mud and water to disappear. In ancient times, it was mandatory for every vehicle simulator to be accurate with the cockipit camera. Speedometer, buttons, valves, gears, alert leds etc but there is none visible. Only the rarest simulators keep with that natural tradition nowadays.

I was really excited about this game because, on paper, it checks a lot of my boxes. In practice, however, it was a really bad experience. This is mostly due to unintuitive controls and mechanics.


With a steering wheel and pedals:

It typically feels best to use this setup with cockpit view, but in this game mirrors don't work, so you have no way of seeing your trailer or anything behind you on the right side(you can stick your head out the driver's side window to at least see the left side) unless you switch to an aerial view, but the game specifically gives you challenges to stay in cockpit view while you have a trailer attached, so by going into third person you fail those challenges. 

Furthermore, as with any driving game on wheel and pedals, the experience just kinda sucks without VR, because even if the mirrors DID work, it's really not fun to have to reach up to the mouse, unlock freeview and mouse around just to see the whole road in front of you. Needs VR to be a fun driving sim. Would also need a total rework of the controls for hitching trailers and using the winch and stuff since that's all done in this weird advanced mode menu that feels very poop. Also, force feedback is so weak that a lot of people are reporting that it doesn't work. It does work, but it's so faint that you have to close your eyes and become one with the force to feel it's existence. 


With a gamepad:

A little bit better since you can at least use the right joystick to more conveniently look around, but the steering is so very not good. This is mostly just an inherent drawback of steering a big truck with a joystick, but it takes forever for the wheels to turn, and by the time they get pointed in the right direction you're facing the wrong way. There's another ""je ne sais quoi"" to the steering that makes it feel insanely disconnected. I don't know what it is or how to describe it. The obvious solution to this is to use a steering wheel so that you're directly linked to the orientation of the tires, but as stated above it's a bad time. 

Not sure what everybody else sees in this game, but as a driving sim enthusiast, I really found it to be quite poop. Unfortunately not even worth the 4 euros I paid for it on sale. Hence the refund.

TL;DR: poop


Edit: Also I have no idea why but the first time I started up the engine, without moving an inch, I got an achievement for driving 200 meters with the parking brake engaged and another achievement for driving a total of 100 kilometers. I'm mainly sharing this so that you(yes you) don't look at my achievements, see the handbrake achievement, and think ""well this guy's a dumb nutsack so who cares what he thinks.""",1648653499,1648921468,False,3,1,0.507223904132843018,0,True,False,False

The two games are arguably quite similar with Snowrunner being much more user-friendly w/much more surface level features and Mudrunner being the more difficult, more simulator-driven game.

For the time that it was released, Mudrunner was an awesome title that built upon the success of the original Spintires game. The reality is that now in 2022, Snowrunner has completely superseded Mudrunner and this game is much less of a good buy. If you can catch it on sale, by all means it is a solid game with decent driving mechanics, bland but passable graphics, and unmemorable sound design.

Still good, but no major improvements. Especially the camera controls are still BAD.  Probably no major improvements upcoming since the successor is out for MUCH more money and Tencent Store exclusive.  Which also means no workshop mods, which are a major thing for this one. And Spintires!

Get it in a sale. Or get Spintires. Don't get both, it's the same game. Except for the mudstickyness‚Ñ¢

[h3]Update:[/h3] Spintires upped it's mud-game. So i guess the only adavantage Mud Runner had,  is gone. 
As is the sympathy for the dev, he got from the alleged publisher abuse. It made a lot of people buy an identical game (this one) again to support him. Only to then drop it like a hot potato for a few Yuan from epic for a (surprise!) very similar successor and ""deliver"" the LONG demanded fix for the horrendous camera  in that Tencent exclusive version.

It's rivalling Skyrim by now in near identical releases.
  
Frankly, i don't know the details of the publisher troubles. Which ripoff is worse? The alleged Publisher vs. Dev or the real Dev vs. customers one?

Honestly its a tad slow, but the challanges are unique to this game .the fun of trying to use a smaller truck to get a fully loaded 6x6 rig out of a pond is suprisinlgy entertaining. the game looks great, while the graphics are seemingly inteneded for 2015 gaming rigs it still looks new. I080p all settings maxed without any screen tearing or jitters, maintains nearly 60 fps on gtx 1050 and other machine... 970.

I actually feel guilty due to all the free content, the dlc free?!?! and free mods? ok... I cant complain, I just wonser what thier buisness plan is at this point...

note to devs: can you do earth moving road construction with this sim? I would love to take a bull dozers and fix some of these roads :).... and can the camera controls be switched to hold right click for camera pan? the first game and this one I find the camera controls a little to different to get use to... and maybe some more active loading from the lumber jacks?

The physics in driving the trucks is simulated very well. When you're driving through a big patch of mud, it really feels realistic to what driving the truck through that would feel. The landscapes are simulated very well, every little bit has massive attention to detail, and the graphics are pretty good, especially considering this game came out several years ago. I also like it because it can run on most any PC, it is not a very demanding game. 

CONS: 
I think many of the missions get too repetitive. This is my biggest complaint about the game. Some missions are interesting for the first half hour while you're driving around trying to get to the watch points, but then once you get to the delivery stages of the missions, they make you deliver an unreasonable amount of logs back and forth, miles at a time over the same terrain, which sometimes is even over a boring road. This just feels like the developer trying to get a few more hours out of the game, which they don't need to do since the game already has a lot of content.

Very good game, some great simulation, beautiful, muddy landscapes, just a little repetitive at times.",1646137507,1646137507,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Select other vehicles, load options and sometimes rotate the camera by mouse
* Crane usage is keyboard (WASD-QE-Rspace-5) only
* Disconnecting the winch is sometimes faster using the mouse rather than ""L2-down-down-X"" because if you have a car attached its ""L2-down-down-right-X"" and it gets messed up

In the game you spend a lot of time stuck or struggling to make progress or thwarted in achieving goals, but there is some satisfaction in overcoming these challenges. After the first job where you have to drive an articulated lorry to a parking place through a city, the second job has you driving completely off-road through a boggy, flooded forest to collect logs and deliver them to a lumber mill. What makes this difficult is the fact that apart from the mud, there are lots of obstacles like rocks, trees (obviously) and flooded ravines. The wilderness would be quite relaxing if it weren't for how stressful it is to navigate. I frequently ran out of fuel just short of my destination or rolled a truck in the middle of nowhere, so I spent far more time retrieving abandoned trailers or winching trucks back upright than actually delivering logs.

However, what I dislike the most is the camera. It's incredibly ""twitchy"" or ""jumpy"" for lack of a better word, especially when driving from the cabin. The POV resets or changes abruptly, and it always feels like I'm fighting the camera whether playing from 1st or 3rd person views. I also find the controls quite clunky overall, especially when playing with a gamepad, for which the game declares full support. For example, you have to go to the advanced menu every time you want to detach a winch, which is something you do like every 10 seconds. Some other actions are either very difficult (like setting map path markers) or straight up impossible (attaching a caravan) to do with the gamepad, making it feel like quite an afterthought.",1641652893,1641652893,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MudRunner is a open world experience, where plays can select their starting vehicle/s and explore a map where they may discover watchpoints, opening up a large area on the map, there for surveying at a birds eye view. The ultimate goal of the game is to either recover or collect different loads of logs and take them to lumber mills, often off the standard road and in the most inaccessible places possible. It is important to note that, while off-road driving is the huge selling point of this game, and it is the means to complete the objective, the game itself is, first and foremost, a logging simulator, or to concise it even more, being a delivery boy in one of the most difficult environments to drive in, swamps, bogs and mud.

Is the game fun and engaging? Well, yes and no. If you follow the objective, of which there are usually different ways of going about it, the game can be a variety of experiences, from fun and relaxing to tedious and stressful. If you are just in it to drive around, there are a vast variety of mods, most of which of high quality, all there to aid your efforts in creating the most botched drive you could ever imagine. Of course, this can get boring quickly, as is to be expected, so playing with friends is a must if you plan to only four wheel drive in this game.

Most current review (No3):
Gud gamu. big machines, much mud, many gud

Review No2: ""So first things first: I orginally gave this game a positive review but since I learned about what went down between SPINTIRES and MUDRUNNER I had to change it.
The bottom line is: Unless you want to support thiefs: Go ahead and buy Spintires the Original Game instead of MUDRUNNER since it's basically the same game. (plus with the upcoming FREE Updates I reckon it will be much cooler than Mudrunner.)
Why thief you ask? Well I'll just paste a message of Zane Saxton in here which should clarify a lot of things:

""A message from Spintires Visionary, Zane Saxton

Dear Spintires Community,

I know how frustrating it‚Äôs been for you not hearing from me or receiving any updates for Spintires, and I‚Äôm sorry there‚Äôs been such a long delay.

I‚Äôm pleased to announce that we‚Äôre working on an update to Spintires, reinstating previously removed features, and adding new features and content. The first update is coming in April and will be followed by further regular updates, along with continued community support. 

Some of you have asked about the defamatory statements that appeared online after the extremely successful release of Spintires in June 2014 which led to false rumours, speculation and outright lies about Oovee Game Studios.

I‚Äôm not going to enter into a public mudslinging contest over this, but I do want to address some of the fallacies behind the original Spintires indie hit. 
  
#1 Pavel was underpaid / not paid by Oovee Game Studios
FALSE. Pavel was paid multimillion dollars by Oovee Game Studios for the work he did on Spintires per his contractual entitlement.

#2 Spintires is Pavel‚Äôs game
FALSE. Pavel assigned his rights in all his work to Oovee Game Studios. Pavel was the lead programmer and worked for Oovee Game Studios on the development of Spintires. 

#3 Pavel was the sole developer of Spintires
FALSE. Pavel was one of many people who contributed and worked on Spintires over the years to bring the ultimate off-road simulation experience to fans. 

#4 Oovee Game Studios was just the publisher
FALSE. Oovee Game Studios are the development studio and co-creators of Spintires. Our publisher was IMGN (although we did self-publish on Steam like you can publish your own book on Amazon).

#5 Oovee Game Studios abandoned the original Spintires game
FALSE. In June 2015 Saber Interactive approached Oovee Game Studios. This resulted in Oovee Game Studios granting certain rights in the game to Saber under a licence agreement. All rights in the game remained with Oovee. Pavel left Oovee Game Studios and went to work for Saber. 

Oovee Game Studios is currently working on updates to Spintires which it will release in the near future.

#6 Spintires is owned by Saber Interactive / Focus Home Interactive
FALSE. Oovee Game Studios are the sole owner of Spintires, including all code, visual aspects and assets, and the trademark.   

#7 Mudrunner / Mudrunner 2 are a different / separate games
FALSE. Spintires: Mudrunner, Spintires Mudrunner American Wilds, and Mudrunner 2 are all derivatives of the original Spintires game, as acknowledged by the community, who associate these games with the original Spintires game. 

What‚Äôs next for the Original Spintires game?

All this drama risks overshadowing a simple truth about the original Spintires game: it‚Äôs THE ultimate off-roading game. Putting all the drama to one side, the only real problem with the original Spintires game was its finishing touches. Starting with the update in April, and with many more to follow, this will be addressed, making Spintires a much more refined product than the first release, and as we continue to refine and develop Spintires moving forward we‚Äôll also be adding new content and features to bring you MASSIVE value. 

We have some exciting announcements to follow, and if you‚Äôd like the inside scoop on the latest developments of Spintires, then join our official Spintires Facebook Group 


Sincerely, 

Zane Saxton - Spintires Visionary

P.S. Let‚Äôs move forward and make the original Spintires game great again, just let me know in the comments below how you‚Äôd like to see the original Spintires game grow and evolve.""

Edit: You cant invite steam players if cross platform is enabled. So we are forced all to play trough steam. So its like Cherno, 3.6 :) '

Wish for future development if it ever happens:

- Multiple winch options (2 ropes at a time) to create a convoy.
- Modded maps to get licenced and be playable witouth risk of crash.
- Option to continue after leaving the game with same friends.

If you've played Spintires you've already seen A LOT of what is included here, from copied vehicles to several barely modified ""new"" maps...but it is fun to run through and unlock a bunch more achievements so there's that. If you've never played Spintires definitely get this, it has the spirit of the original minus all the legal drama but with added features like in-cab view.

Visually this looks nice, although the weird sepia tones on some maps are really overdone early in the morning. Controls are fine except for the crane operations, but they weren't that fluid on the original title either. Audio on MudRunner is hit and miss, the newer vehicles have suitable audio while the old stock ones are somewhat lackluster.

For you achievement hunters out there, the American Wilds DLC is indeed required to hit 100% on this title. You might have a bit of a time finding people for the multiplayer achievements as MudRunner never has been popular online compared to its namesake. You're looking at around 60 hours for completion provided you find other competent players.

Despite not looking like one, and being third person view focused, I'd definitely classify this as a SIM, just because of the depth of the physics simulation. Terrain with varying degrees of softness, AWD/diff lock operation, great rigid body physics, like tire distortion, twisting chassis rails etc., simply every object interacts with every other object in the space as it would in real life.
The end result is it looks incredibly realistic, as you chug through twisty, cambered dirt and mud roads, over deep puddles and crests, hauling lumber, and your truck swings all sorts of directions.

A controller is highly recommended for the analog throttle! Layout is well-thought out.

To sum it up, pros:
- graphics 4/5
- physics 4/5
- detailed truck mechanics, including attachments
cons:
- bit repetitive, you either explore watchpoints, unlock garages, or haul lumber, just on a different map once one is complete
- no real replayablity",1631004685,1631004685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its spintires in all its cool offroad glory and in its all the weird complex and hard but not realistic physics issues too, like, damn. Im pretty sure dirt gets quite hard after it gets used as a road several times, but as far as the game is concerned anything that isn't asphalt is playdoh, except sand. Sand its harder than asphalt. Oh and it seems vehicles dont have suspension, at least some small ones dont, because a small bump makes some wheels get airtime and then you find +90 damage taken to your vehicle. Yes, i do know that 6 wheeling soviet trucks carrying giant logs of wood across muddy hills are a real thing, but in the game nearly EVERYTHING is permanently covered in mud and the vehicles are ridiculously slow both off and on road. I thought that Sabre would have this changed slightly for this release since hard isn't always realistic but no dice here. I hope to try the american wilds expansion soon since ive heard that they adress this.

I picked it up on a recent Steam sale for $3-4 and I'm glad that I did because, whilst there is no story to speak of, you effectively drive (or TRY to!) around a boggy marsh looking for logging camps where you can either chop the logs yourself (if you have the correct apparatus) or you can choose which type of load you want to carry (where different loads equal different vehicle behaviours.

As of writing this review, I tipped over and lost two loads (yes, that's a thing in this game!) and drove off a bridge without thinking.

No respawn in this, though if you are in SP, you can respawn the vehicle at the start, but if like me you tip over and lose your logs, you lose any progress you had with that delivery and have to start from scratch. So you NEED to be patient with this game!

The controls are standard WSAD with a few extra keys around those four to further improve/worsen your driving experience. I can't comment on if this can be used with a wheel, though if so you will be doing a lot and I mean a looooot of course correction.

I call this one more of a slow burner because driving in a bog on the first map is slow and tedious work, but if you don't want all your action in swoop after swoop of dramatic setpieces, then this might just be the game you're looking for!

Give it a shot, wait for a sale, or pick up it's successor Snow Runner. I haven't quite got the machine to handle that yet, hence why I bought this one.",1629936327,1629936327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its a bit of an odd game. a truck sim where for some reason your always going through mud and getting stuck in it.
I suppose that's in the name.
The  issue I have is you can't do much to the truck to make you better at it.
There is no upgrades and customises. No real vehicle specs at all. I can't see how fast i'm going. I can't understand the weight ratio.... Its all a bit of a guess and.... hmm that looks heavy....
The quests seem pretty odd as well. so far the single player seems encompassed with logging.... just logging. and random exploring. Theirs no real story line in any way. no npcs to interact with. no radio to make it sound interesting at least.
The game can very quickly get quite boring. 
I'll keep playing to see how it might develop. But i'm not really seeing how i could recommend this to anyone.
I suppose I got this with the vision of driving the road of bones in Siberia. But it seems like endless logging and mud at the moment. With no gain or even economical factor.

Edit Update.
Played the game a little longer. The logging has become a little less tedious with the feature of being able to create road trains (two trucks chained together) so I don't feel like i'm doing the same route loads of times. Also it makes for an interesting challenge. But still with the constant logging. They need to change the challenge, maybe different type of cargo or more interesting main missions. 
Additional Update
I carried on playing. Its not bad when you read the online tech manual. You shouldn't need to for this sort of game especially just to find out the vehicle spec. 
the simulation parts of the game is only thing that kept me playing to be honest. I slowly figured out which vehicles to choose and how to drive. A strategy on how to use the vehicles. 
But the single player mode still seems to be centred around logging for some reason. Gets a bit tedious. 
I might play a bit more but i've finished most the game now. Wasn't overly satisfied but as said the simulation parts are fun. trudging through the mud and landscape and hill climbing.",1625801509,1628472538,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From exploring and planning the route, choosing and positioning the right trucks, down to passing a compligated road with the help of the winge - you keep solving puzzles to get to the destination as efficient as possible.
Finishing a complicated tour will feel very satisfying.
The downside is that once you solved the puzzle, rerunning the same tour 2-3 times to finish a map can feel quite dull, especially when moving slowly through the mud for half an hour.
The different maps, challenges and achievements present you with enough ""puzzles"" to enjoy dozens of hours. So in regard to the price, it's well worth it. (It took me relaxed 65 hours to ""finish"" the game - all maps on highest difficulty, all challenges, all single player achievements).
There is replay value in trying to solve the maps on different trucks, making it even more complicated.

It's a VERY slow-paced game so if you're looking for a wild, balls-to-the-wall action off-roading game, you're definitely not going to get that here. This is more akin to off-roading or mudding where you're just trying not to get completely stuck or stranded somewhere and it's actually surprisingly relaxing and even meditative. There's also a surprising amount of tactics involved that makes the whole experience feel very rewarding and satisfying (""Okay, there's a big tree there so the ground right next to it should be pretty firm"" ""Alright, gravity pulls moisture downward so I'm gonna go as high up on this curved bank as I can.""

But its clear that Snowrunner is what will be regularly updated and improved upon.  

It may be unfair to give Mudrunner this negative review based simply on comparing it to Snowrunner.  I don't normally do this with any other game franchise because the older games still hold their appeal and nostalgia even after sequels are released.

[b]Spintires: Mudrunner[/b] is a simulation-esque game of deep woods logging in Russia. (There is an American expansion where the pacing is a little different.) I say ‚Äú-esque‚Äù because there are a lot of things that'll suspend your disbelief. [list]
For instance:

[*] You can't leave any truck or vehicle. It'd have been nice to get out and walk around.

[*] The winches instantly attach to trees and other assorted things. I realize this is for convenience but I think it'd have been cool to be able to get out of the vehicle and attach the winch. Get back in the truck and and un-wedge yourself. 

[*] The attachments to the trucks appear out of thin air at garages. (Not on all maps, some maps don't even start you in a garage and just have garage trailers at the ready to unlock another garage located elsewhere.)

[*] The logs will instantly appear loaded in your truck at a log station. (This is only on casual mode. However, even in hardcore mode you can spawn any type of log in a kiosk. This requires loading but still remains removed from a ‚Äúsim‚Äù designation.)

[*] Unlocking garages is a weird game mechanic, I like that it extends the life of a single map but how did they build those buildings without equipment to fix and operate the vehicles that they were presumably put there to fix in the first place!?[/list]

[h1]I know I'm being nit-picky but that's because I love the game![/h1]
The game is pretty straightforward. You drive trucks. You grab lumber and then deliver it to lumber mills. Rinse and repeat. 

The game has a pretty nice difficulty curve. Casual mode has almost no consequence for any action. Any vehicle can be auto transported ie. teleported to a garage and repaired regardless of damaged incurred beforehand. Fuel consumption is lower and log stations remove the need for additional equipment like cranes and loaders. You'll learn the limits and benefits slowly through the progression of the maps and vehicles provided. Each map is essentially a sandbox anyways. But, you'll need to complete delivering 8 load points to however many lumber mills there are on the map to complete it and earn a ‚Äúprogression point‚Äù to unlock new maps and trucks. 

There are three types of logs, Short, medium and long. Worth 3, 4, 6 load points respectively. You'll notice that if you do the math, there is no way to actually deliver enough load points (without winching your truck to another one that's carrying a load) in one trip to a lumber mill regardless of what type of logs you bring. Making early maps seem to discourage carrying long logs. Which doesn't make a ton of sense seeing as to how they are the most difficult to actually pack and deliver creating an obvious difficulty increase. However, this all changes when you discover that the later maps have scavenge points. No stations or kiosks available. You'll have to deliver what the map gives you. Of course, there are ways to ‚Äúgame‚Äù the system. You can simply remove the logs from the spawn point and new logs of a potentially different length and new location will spawn. It's just supposed to be more fun and provide a bit more challenge. Try not to think about it too much despite my pedantic diatribe above. 

That being said, hardcore mode isn't terribly difficult either. (With the exception of the Deluge map, fuck that map. :D ) 

There are also challenges to do outside the sandbox maps. As well as multiplayer, you and your friends can take turns [strike]capsizing each other off of mountains[/strike] taking lumber to the mill or loading up at scavenge points. 

In addition to all of this, the game features steam workshop support filled with other trucks and new maps extending the game's life even further.

MudRunner is a game that absolutely deserves more gamers, because it's absolutely excellent in its discipline! Unfortunately, it's anything but beginner-friendly, and that's regardless of the inherently difficult setting.

The game is not hectic, but some situations require attention and sensitivity. It's also great for chatting with a friend while pulling each other out of the mud or rumbling through the botany together with steel colossi! It's basically a sandbox in which you can try out a lot. However, you should give yourself some 'training time' - and you will be rewarded with many pleasant hours of fun!

The so-called tutorial does far too little to familiarize you with the core functions of the game, the menus and mod support are unwieldy, and this despite the fact that this game in particular thrives on it! Fortunately, MudRunner can rely on the Steam infrastructure - which is why this platform is actually a requirement for this game - yet it is anything but self-explanatory.

Even though the initial difficulties, I can warmly recommend the game and especially in cooperative mode it unfolds its true potential! I have already had so much fun with the game that it was important to me not to push other people in front of the many same problems I had to struggle with and thereby lose motivation - for this reason I have written a guide that should give some [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2374687991]start assistance[/url] as well.",1622492223,1622492305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

sure, there are positive points to this game like the genius shifting mechanic ( using controller ) and the very seemingly realistic simulation of differential lock and all wheel drive.

but in the end, i had to stop playing and delete the game because of these two reasons:
1. the engines of most trucks sound very strange and often sound like they are working very hard ( high RPM ) even though there is almost nothing happening, which adds to the frustration
2. most trucks feel extremely weak and slow. combine that with my previous complaint, and there you have very frustrating gameplay that becomes extremely irritating and tedious VERY quickly.
3. overall, it feels like the developers tried to make the game as hard as possible, but because of that they ruined the feel, in my opinion.

obviously, the above is subjective. but still an indication of what this game could be like for other players.

in short, the trucks feel completely weak, incapable of doing logging work. it does depend on which addons are installed, but all of the addons that actually get the level complete, make the trucks weak. and i was not even playing on hardcore mode.

the fuel usage is absolutely insane and it seems out of balance, especially on the really large C-class vehicle where the fuel usage is extreme even though the power is extremely low.

i would rather be forced to use less power and less throttle to make it through a level, rather than going extremely slow on full throttle, in 1+ gear and through light mud with differential lockers on and all-wheel-drive enabled.....",1532951877,1619707461,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-----------------


Maybe it's the best off-road driving game in Steam.
But, as the previous one, it has many flaws

MudRunner improved a lot compared to Spintires 1, but also inherited many of his problems that still have no solution today.
My review was originally negative but I thought about it and I'm going to give it a chance. 
I hope it doesn't suffer the same fate as its predecessor. If you don't know what I'm talking about, Spintires 1 died due to conflicts between the publisher and developer, to know more you can see my other [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/263280/discussions/0/622954023416537887]review[/url]
Now in the hands of another company I hope it will continue to improve.

Although the game has a lot of good features, I'm going to focus on the negative ones, because some of them may be decisive whether to buy it or not for some people.


[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Amazing mud physics
    [*]Good graphics (*see Cons)
    [*]You really feel it better than the old Spintires.
    [*]Vehicles are beautiful
    [*]Awesome community of modders
    [*]Vehicle Workshop
    [*]Map Workshop
    [*]I really enjoy multiplayer with friends
    [*]You can save your progress in multiplayer
    [*]Camera control has improved a lot (*see Cons)
    [*]We have cockpit view! Although it needs refinement, its functional*
    [*]They add ""challenges"" like a tutorial, a little easy but I liked them.
[/list]


[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]The crane camera is horrible, worse than the previous one.
    [*]Gameplay is the same as before (carrying logs from one point to another). It can be repetitive for some players.
    [*]For me MudRunner is a lot easier than its predecessor
    [*]Some vehicles were removed and new ones added
    [*]Many addons of vehicles disappeared (chains for wheels, extra lights, spare wheel, etc)
    [*]Reverse lights do not work in some cases
    [*]You can't change the wheel types like in Spintires 1
    [*]Haven't played it with a steering wheel so I can't say much. With a controller, accessing the menu can be annoying
    [*]In the cockpit view it would be nice to actually see some reflexion on the mirrors.
    [*]Some achievements are bugged
[/list]

I know I said good graphics above but strangely enough MudRunner is awfully ""gray"", this was the biggest disappointment for me. The old Spintires wasn't very colorful but the saturation was a lot more acceptable. Here are some captures to compare:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301005166

Fortunately we can use ReShade to make it look better than ever, but that's not the point. The game should look good without doing anything. Here are some pictures to compare the vanilla game and with ReShade

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301009114

With Reshade looks beautiful
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1319768985

[h1]Some suggestions for the developers:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Fix the color for the love of god
    [*]I want snow
    [*]Tracked vehicles
    [*]Since the game takes place in forests, it would be nice to see some wildlife or even other trucks like NPCs.
    [*]I'd like to be able to load logs from a pile and not have to spawn one or two at a time.
    [*]Be able to change the color of vehicles
    [*]Realistic damage mode, both aesthetic and operational (broken lights/mirrors/glass, scratches, flat tires, oil/water leaks, temperature level, etc)
[/list]

To conclude, despite everything above, this Spintires and the previous one are part of my favorite games and I hope to see it improve and with more content in the future.


***UPDATE*** 04.20.2019

Spintires 1 is back under development and they release a new update after 2 years.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ESPA√ëOL


Quizas es el mejor juego de conduccion offroad en Steam. Pero, como el anterior tiene varios defectos.
MudRunner mejoro bastante respecto de Spintires 1, pero heredo tambien algunos de sus problemas de base y que todavia no tienen solucion. 
Mi review originalmente era negativa pero lo pense y le voy a dar una oportunidad, espero que no sufra el mismo destino de su predecesor. Si no saben de lo que hablo, Spintires 1 murio por las peleas entre el editor y el desarrollador, para saber mas pueden ver mi otro [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/263280/discussions/0/622954023416537887]analisis[/url]
Ahora en manos de otra compa√±ia espero que siga mejorando.

A pesar de que el juego tiene muchisimos puntos a favor, me voy a centrar en los negativos por que algunos tal vez sean determinantes para decidir si comprarlo o no.

[h1] A favor: [/h1]

[list]
    [*]Excelentes fisicas
    [*]Buenos graficos* (leer mas abajo)
    [*]Realmente se siente una mejoria respecto del viejo Spintires*
    [*]Los vehiculos son hermosos
    [*]Excelente comunidad de modders
    [*]Workshop de Vehiculos
    [*]Workshop de Mapas
    [*]Se puede guardar el progreso en multijugador
    [*]Multijugador muy divertido con amigos
    [*]El control de la camara mejoro bastante
    [*]Tenemos vista de cabina! Aunque necesita refinamiento es funcional*
    [*]Pusieron ""desafios"", algo faciles pero me gustaron
[/list]  

[h1] En contra:[/h1]

[list]
    [*]La camara de la grua es horrible, peor que en el anterior
    [*]El gameplay es el mismo que antes, llevar troncos de un punto a otro. Puede ser repetitivo para algunos.
    [*]Para mi MudRunner es mucho mas facil que su predecesor
    [*]Se quitaron vehiculos y se a√±adieron otros
    [*]Desaparecieron muchos addons de vehiculos (cadenas para ruedas, luces extra, rueda de auxilio, etc)
    [*]Las luces de reversa no funcionan en algunos casos
    [*]Antes se podia cambiar los tipos de ruedas a usar
    [*]No lo he jugado con volante asi que no puedo hablar mucho pero he visto que tiene algunos problemas. Con control,     acceder al menu puede ser engorroso.
    [*]Algunos logros estan bugeados
    [*]En la vista de cabina seria bueno poder ver algo en los espejos
[/list]

Se que dije buenos graficos arriba pero curiosamente MudRunner es horriblemente ""gris"", esto es lo que mas me desiluciono. El viejo Spintires no era de lo mas colorido pero la saturacion del color era por mucho mas aceptable. Les dejo imagenes para comparar:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301005166

Afortunadamente podemos usar el programa ReShade para que se vea mejor que nunca, pero ese no es el punto. El juego deberia verse bien sin necesidad de esto. Les dejo imagenes para comparar el juego vainilla y con ReShade:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301008806

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301009114

Con ReShade
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1319768985

[h1] Algunas sugerencias para los desarrolladores:[/h1]

[list]
    [*]Arreglen el color por el amor de dios
    [*]Queremos nieve
    [*]Vehiculos a oruga
    [*]Ya que el juego transcurre en bosques, seria bueno ver algo de vida salvaje o incluso otros camiones como NPCs
    [*]Me gustaria que se pueda cargar troncos de una pila y no tenerlos que hacerlos aparecer de a uno o dos
    [*]Poder cambiar el color de los vehiculos
    [*]Da√±o mas realistico, tanto estetico como de funcionamiento (luces/espejos/vidrios rotos, rayaduras, pinchaduras, perdidas de agua/aceite, nivel de temperatura)
[/list]


Para finalizar quiero decir que a pesar de todo, este Spintires y el anterior forman parte de mis juegos favoritos y espero verlo mejorar y con mas contenido en el futuro.

Overall the vehicle simulation is very nice, and for the most parts it really works quite well.
Unfortunately the simulation epicness starts with the mud and stops with the tires for the most part as the simulation for rest of the drivetrain is quite horrible, to be frank.
This is probably due the ""casual""-aspect of the game, as a realistic, manually handled, simulation would be very difficult to control without dedicated controllers. Alas, this results in (at least sound-wise) clutch constantly slipping, etc.
Thankfully that is not that much of a problem, given that most of the action happens in mud.

Definitely an entertaining simulation, and definitely sets itself apart on terrain / mud handling!

It's a weird phenomenon, these sims. But if your idea of fun is driving around for hours through mud and delivering wood to saw mills, then go grab it. The base game with the addon is okay price-wise, the expansion alone imho is not worth it though.

That is mainly, because some of the new vehicles make no sense on most other maps as they require roads to actually use ... and most maps simply do not have a big road network like the American Wilds maps. The 2 maps are also pretty boring comparatively...and even super easy. The saw mills are next to each other and connected by roads, and in one map you literally just have to drive from point A to point B via road.

Every map in the game follows the same procedure: get in your scout vehicle, drive to watch towers to make the map area visible, find some vehicles lying around, then find the for you easiest and quickest (or hardest and longest if you want) way to deliver wood from A to B or C to D and so on. The maps each have 2 saw mills that require 8 wood in total. There are also log stations, log posts and scavenge sites where you get the wood from. Log posts are self-filling, but usually the farthest away. For log posts you need a vehicle with a crane to load the logs yourself. Scavenge sites are the same but are exhausted after 1 use (but can respawn when another scavenge site gets exhausted), so these are the most tricky, but they only appear on DLC maps. Logs can be loaded in 2s, 3s, 4s or 6s, each requiring different truck addons, meaning trailers.

You can customize the vehicle loadout for each map if you want, but I just went with the base settings to keep the intended challenge. The mud is evil. Usually you have some tar roads somewhere, but mostly you'll be dealing with dirt roads of varying degrees of firmness as well as grass, hills and swamp areas. You will have to manage your fuel consumption and refuel trucks regularly, you will have to use the winch extensively and sooner or later one of your trucks will get stuck or fall over, and then you need to start a rescue mission.

My go to was usually to go to log stations with 2 big trucks in tow (you can do that via the winch in single player) ... or tow one of my less offroad savvy trucks with a proper offroad vehicle to the station, etc. You get the idea.

That's really all there is to it. Night time sucks, as is intended, and the physics are at times very wonky. Especially on actual roads the vehicles react like absolute crap. Nobody would be driving anymore if that were realistic. Damage is also weirdly calculated. Sometimes you take massive damage for prodding a tree at 1 mph, and at other times nothing happens. Small trees can even be driven over, while fucking BRANCHES on the road almost seem like an insurmountable object... even for bigger vehicles. 

There's also a few challenge missions which you can (and maybe even SHOULD do before attempting the actual game after the tutorial...they prepare you for all eventualities and are quite fun.)

But all in all it's still fun, but gets a bit drab after a while. There is only 1 real tileset and that is dreary green/brown, mixed with some sand and some rivers. Even in the American Wilds expansion. The sequel is supposed to have snow, but it's not on steam as to this day, sadly. But there's room for improvements and even some ""fantastical"" elements, like alien planets, lava, deserts, icy mountains. This game, however, is dead.
The ""original"" SpinTires is still being updated though, but apparently there was some sort of controversy, which I didn't exactly follow. Feature-wise this seems to be the better game though.",1611164017,1611164263,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It can give you a lot of joy but so far everything came with a big BUT:
The tutorialisation of many mechanics is lackluster, no FOV slider, the view distance is abysmal (Unless you tweak it yourself in the config files and through Reshade.me), Many mechanics just don't make ANY sense such that you just end your game session with a big SIGH. Examples:
- Loading more than 3 middle long logs in a carrier doesn't seem possible. Learned the hard way that after an hour of loading up a carrier with 18 middle logs only 3 actually loaded up & the rest was lost.
- The skidder cannot ""load"" middle length logs even though you can pull the carrier for it.
- Upon falling over you magically loose a log of 3 (Because rolling over isn't already frustrating enough)
- Fueling and repairing only works if you switch to external camera instead of cockpit.

That's just some of the mechanics that really aren't self explanatory and made me put away the controller in frustration a few times now. And that's a shame because otherwise this game provides a challenging playground that leaves a lot of room for adventures. But bad tutorialisation and boneheaded mechanics that just outright delete some of your work and effort drag down the experience.
Additionally many of the trucks aren't really distinct but rather modified versions sometimes literally just the color. So take the vehicle diversity with a grain of salt.
And on a side note: There is only one type of mission. Hauling logs from point A to point B. That's it. No repairing things, or building bridges nothing.

Now that this company has switched over to Epic it seems you also need an EPIC account to play multiplayer. Thanks Epic Games the embodiment of gaming industry cancer.

So if you are looking for a game just like this, you are willing to learn things the hard way and don't mind manually tweaking config files etc. this game is for you. Everyone else: Keep the money and buy something else.",1610391026,1610821544,False,1,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

All kidding aside, the trucks handle pretty decent with a controller. The graphics are pretty decent. There is a helpful tutorial to get you started. Once you perfect the regular mode there is a hardcore mode to try. Seems to be purely a driving simulator. You can see your guy in the driver seat, but he can't get out. Not even for a beer.

I mean, getting logs out of the forrest, how cool does that sound, right ? But as someone who has played racing games for practically as long as I own any kind of computer I wanted to try something else. 
The game looks really good. I don't own a high end machine but had no issues at all getting at least 60 fps which is totally ok for a game like this. The vehicles are looking even better than the world around them and the physic animation is crazy. The way the suspension moves is really great. What I didn't like is the dirt build-up on the tires, that looks not good at all. And I was dissapointed by the interior view. As I said, I come from racing sims and always play cockpit as it gives the most immersion. However, in this game you soon find out that the exterior view is the much better way to play as you have a much better understanding of where the tires of your truck are. And that can be very important. In the end I enjoyed driving around on the map in different trucks and getting to the various points more then actually delivering the wood.
I got about 70 hours out of this game playing all the original and DLC content in simulation mode. I did start a couple of levels more than once. But with the amount of mods you can get there are many more hours to be had. Plus you have a multiplayer modus where you can play with others and that sounds like fun, too. I played with a wheel but I don't think it is nessessary and a gamepad will suffice. My son even plays on the keyboard and says he has no problems.

I played the first Spintires game and greatly enjoyed the play style. It is a great change of pace compared to all the arcade racers and sims out there. Something that provides a technical challenge and makes you apply a different method of thinking to be successful. For the concept, I would award high marks. If only features in this version worked as well as it's predecessor.

This type of game is great for coop play, and that is why I bought it. With great expectations we launched the game only to not be able to connect. We are both Steam users, but found out we had to enable Epic crossplay to be able to join a lobby with each other regardless. Even then, it was about a 50/50 shot, as many times the game would show the player joining as ready/not ready, but did not display their name. When the game launched, they would be stuck in the lobby but would not join the game session. Several times the host could not even see their own ID in the lobby. How can you fail to join your own game? Ask Focus...

On the chance we were able to connect, the game ran well. Right up to the moment it didn't. A hard crash (usually from client but occasionally from server) would cause maps to be impossible to complete. Nothing like fighting for 15 minutes to winch a fully loaded truck through an obstacle and feeling accomplished only to crash 60 seconds later making that progress wasted. The worst part is you cannot resume the game in multiplayer as advertised. The host can continue, but we were unable to have anyone join that session. This renders multiplayer games solo after the inevitable crash.

Neither of us are low skill PC users. We investigated everything from disabling VPNs, port issues, stress testing hardware, and the only thing that was constantly not working was Mudrunner. I have 585 titles in my Steam library, and this is the first time I have pushed for a refund. It is that garbage... 

If you want a game for a solo experience, I am sure this will work just fine. If you want something to play with friends, I would recommend pretty much anything else.",1609627705,1609627705,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

so over all i do like this game but with those 2 problems with it i can not recommend it to any one else unless these problems are addressed and there for i will be uninstalling the game

People on the community hub say that the game crashes consantly and that the multiplayer doesnt work. Which is false. The game crashes only when cross-play is enabled(cross-play is needed for playing with Epic games not Xbox and Ps4). I had the same issue, dissabled cross-play and boom my game is no longer crashing. 
Basically if you want to play with a friend that has the game in epic games that will be impossible. Because the game not only crashes but it doesnt let you join the lobby again. So you have to start again and it crashes again. That makes it pointless in playing because you cant finish a map. But when you dissable cross-play everything works as intended. You can invite a friend and you can finish a map without problems. That is all the game works but the update with Epic Games kinda messed up stuff. 

If you are wondering if you should buy the game, or is it worth it. YES IT IS. There are tons of mods. Both good and not soo good. You can spend a lot of hours driving in the russian wilderness. It took me and my friend about 30 hours to complete the game without mods. WIth mods... its a different story. We ve been playing for hours and as you can see curently i have 156 hours and Im still not bored at all. The game has a good potential. Now imma try and rate some aspect os the game.

Rates:

Singleplayer: 8/10
Easy to explain. The maps you get for free are fun and all but its not worht playing alone. If you want i suggest brining some underpowerd mods and see how much u struggle. Its peacefull to play SP, but i personally don't recomed it. Also i dont recomed easy or casual mode it aint fun that way. Since there is no campaign or story its just driving and the main goal is to bring some logs to the lubmer mill thats all. But the roads and the mud that all over the map is what this makes this game MUDRUNNER.

Multiplayer: 9/10
As i said in SP always play on hard. Its funneir i will explain later.
Im giving it a 9 for a dumb reason. But first lets start with the goods and then with the bads. Its like SP, but on steroids. You have friends, or randomds. Up to 4 people(including you). That way everyone can do certain tasks. For example when me and my friends unlock the map. We have a person for everything. I usually load the trucks with the logs. Someone is driving the logs. Someone always brings fuel, and the last guy is always repair points. When the guys with fuel and repair are not needed they stay around the people who carry logs and escort them incase one of us messes up something like getting flipped over. It always fun. We try to race on the narrow roads we push each other and flip over. Then we try rescuing someone. The good things is that you can never run out of maps. There are A LOT of community maps and most of them are pretty well made and pretty creative. 
Everything is cool and all but the only down sides i can find are: You can't see other's headlights, and cant hear their engiens. Sometimes it just kills the immersion. The other bad thing is that you can't add more than 8 mods. But you always figure a way out. It just messes up with mod combos sometimes.

Graphics: 9/10
They are good enought not the best but still good. Only downside is that it aint as colorfull as Spintires. This one is a bit more grey-ish

Gameplay: 9/10
You have two main modes.
Singleplayer and Multiplayer.
I talked about them above. There is one more gamemode and its challanges. Its basically small maps where you have to do something they want you to do. For example: Load the truck with medium logs or unlock every watch point on the map. They aslo give achievments so if you want the game 100% completed yeah go for them other than that they are pointless in my opinion.

Controlls: 9/10
I've played the game with a keyboard, controller and a 180 degree wheel. And i never had problems. It works flawlessly. Only issue is when u change input mid game you have to restart.

DLC: 9/10
You have a much of DLC that are free and one expansion - American Wilds. I was never interested in so i never bought it. 

Fun: 10/10 
its awsome just buy it and play with friends. 

Price: 9/10 
Not to pricy, but i recom you to buy it on a discount. 

Overall: 9/10

+1 somehow really fast FPS on a shoddy system while having good graphics.
+1 easy to learn
+1 controller compatible which just makes the game so more

Who should play this?
If you like american/euro truck sim then this game is perfect, you need to be patient.

I have not played this game fully, as oyu see I only have 1.5hrs at the time of this review but I will def play more and most likely refine my review

3 years in and no patch to fix it and if you have it running (I confirmed it on my end to be the issue) it will crash. Strange a game from 2007 (lost planet) has no issues with MSI yet this one does.

Without a doubt, MSI afterburner causes the crash on my system.

Playing with un-certified mods: crashes.
Playing with only certified mods: crashes.
Playing with no mods at all: crashes.

Try to resume the game that just crashed so you can continue your progress? Oh, sorry. Crashes.

Try to rejoin one of your friends after you crashed out of their game? Nope, sorry, not possible.

The best you can possibly hope for with multiplayer in this game is 30 minutes before the game crashes and you lose all of your progress and have to start over. Not to mention that the interface to invite friends is awful (un-ordered and offline/online are intermixed, friends who don't own the game show up), selecting mods is the same where nothing is alphabetized and no preset saving is possible.

Most of my own and my friends' play time in this game was spent troubleshooting and crashing.

PS - If you play on Steam and try to play COOP with friends ON STEAM- NEVER CHOOSE CROSSPLAY OPTION. I dont know what that does but it always screws up our co-op sessions. We end up reinstalling and it fixes that but only until the next time you try cross play again- so dont do it if you only want to play with Steam friends.

Risk vs reward plays an interesting role. Do you load up with a longer, heavier trailer for more points, but risk getting stuck? Or do you play it safe and make multiple runs with a smaller loadout?

You'll be better off installing mods as they actually handle more accurately than the 'sponges with wheels' that the developers have included.  

Makes me wonder if any of the developers actually have sat behind the wheel and and followed the big black line in front of them?  By the 'mechanics and physics' of the vehicles I would say they have not and have 'smashed' something together that they think is real.

And before you get on your soap box, 20 years in the Army with not only did I hold a truck license but also Tank (Leopard AS1) and Personnel Carrier (M113a1) and it's variants licenses/certificates also.  Coupled with being a Driving and Servicing Instructor I think I know what I'm talking about when I say that the 'inbuilt' vehicles are sheit in the on and offroad handling capabilities.  And to put the icing on the cake, I now hold a HC (Heavy Combination [Semi]) licence.

I have no idea what happened to the physics or why they got changed, but now I am finding that I am having to winch myself every 5 feet which wasn't happening prior.  I even went back an played easy levels that I know I sailed right though and still find myself having to winch a ton.  The constant winching really makes this game no fun.  I understand that a level of difficulty makes this game fun and satisfying when you accomplish something after a few hours of work, but an easy level taking 4+ hours to complete is ridiculous.

This game is immensely fun, but among its numerous design flaws, it has this one massive, crippling problem: very little content.

There are only a dozen-ish stock maps (if you got all the DLCs) to play, and after that, you have to either rely on community-created mod maps, or replay the few stock maps (which is not fun). Unfortunately, there isn't much for decent mods for this game(at least not that I've found so far). There are thousands of mod maps(across steam workshop and other mod websites), but very few of them are enjoyable enough to play, and I haven't found any enjoyable enough to finish. More then half of them are simply broken and can't be played because the creator never put in one or more of the basic, essential, necessary features that every map must have. I applaud the awesome players who have at least tried to contribute something to this game's fan community, but it hasn't come to any meaningful use.

I had to wait three years to get it on sale, and I guess I'm happy with my purchase (considering I got it 80% off, and it's intense fun at first), but the enjoyability of this game completely dies once you've done the few maps it is sold with.

The multiplayer feature is a mess that seems totally broken, and the forums are littered with angered players complaining that multiplayer is useless and needs to get fixed. To make matters worse, if you install a mod, the multiplayer screen just gives you an error saying 'mutiplayer and multiplayer achievements are disabled'. So, you can only play multiplayer with the stock content, which isn't worth the trouble because everyone has already done those few maps a million times.

The creators need to release a whole new maps pack, and add more capability and stability to their mod editor tool. And it needs to be a free expansion to make up for how tiny the stock content has been so far, not some purchasable DLC. I have all the DLCs and if they weren't so cheap in the big sale, I'd feel ripped off right now. If there was just more quality content, this would be a 9.5/10 game. With the content as it is... score is irrelevant, the game just doesn't count.

I wanted to like this, and do enjoy the used-looking trucks (great) and the wild terrain. But ... the driving control implementation makes it virtually unplayable for me. 

I'm using a Logitech wheel and pedals and a Thrustmaster shifter, which the game sort-of recognises ... but only up to a point. If I try to allocate a wheel button to a control, it tells me I'm trying to reallocate the throttle control, which is of course a pedal ...??? Etc etc with trying to map the other controls.

The force feedback is either on - way too solid, very little feel - or off, with VERY light steering resulting.

The whole steering operation seems off - as though it's made for a gamepad, and operates in distinct digital steps, even when being run through an analogue wheel ... with what seems like a built-in delay as well, I spend the whole time heaving side to side on the wheel just trying to take a light jeep style vehicle down a straight section of tarmac road ... not enjoyable. A bit like trying to steer an ocean liner rather than a car ...

Add to that the seemingly VERY tight parking requirements, and it just became tedious for me. I tried the first (?) challenge, and quickly got the trailer to the desired location with all bonuses intact ... it then took me AGES to reverse park the trailer in the highlighted slot over a muddy (well, it is MudRunner!) swamp which played even more havoc with the steering. It stopped being an enjoyable challenge, and just became very tedious.

I couldn't believe that it was meant to work like this! I'd appreciate any help for setting up the controls better, if there is something different I can do.

I did want to try SnowRunner, but that's not yet on Steam. If / when it is I may try it, hoping that the controls implementation is better and more like 2020 than 1980 ... but I'll definitely keep my trial under two hours, and so leave open the option for a refund.",1607626495,1607626495,False,0,0,0.475999981164932251,0,True,False,False

NB. I am only a Single-player person, no intest in playing this as multiplayer.

The game needs you to think, plan and be patient and when you achieve the tasks it is very rewarding.

I had been watching this for a while but was put off by no native headtracking support, it is possible apparently by using naturalpoint's mouse tracking software, but so far I've actually been ok just using the other stick on an xbox controller to look around.

Could do with a bit of colour vibrancy adding, might see if re-shade works for this, but this is a small complaint and it is just so strangely relaxing to play this, even as you cry out in anguish as you slide over a cliff.",1606577950,1606577950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After the tutorial, I skipped to the Challenges to learn more about the game. The first two were fine, basically slow paced fetch quests with interesting or silly and optional mini-achievements, such as scaring off 10 birds with your horn. The third challenge was, somehow even more simply, to climb a hill. Easy enough, right? No. You will slip. You will get stuck. You will watch, terrified, as your rear tire begins to droop over the edge of a cliff. You will turn on all wheel drive and pray to unknown gods. And you will plummet in a ball of fire to the game over screen, presented with the option of trying again. In my final attempt it took me four minutes to climb that hill, but they were some of the most information dense and engaging four minutes I've felt in a video game since... I don't know, ever. If you're afraid of driving on roads with unguarded cliffs to either side in real life, and looking for an easygoing thrill, you may have found it in an unexpected place with this game. Totally recommend it if you're looking for a different kind of fun.

Note - I got it on sale for five bucks, so my expectations weren't high. Now I can say I'd buy it at full price, too. I'm probably going to end up checking out their 2020 game, SnowRunner.

Workshop got all sorts of terrains, from rocky trail road to muddy trial course, and trucks, from small Suzuki Samurai trail truck to 8x8 trial trucks.

This beautiful, full terrain-deformation trucking physics game was the first of its kind. Unfortunately, the publisher for Spintires thought it fit to release as basically an alpha version of the game, stopped payments and locked the original creator from ever updating the game again. Luckily, the game engine was so unique the original creator actually maintained copyrights for it and was thus able to find another publisher to give this beautiful game the proper release it deserved. Boy, does it deliver!

The improvements:
- I'm a huge fan of playing by controller, in the original there were quite a few things that were either way easier, or simply impossible to do without a mouse. Since then, the interface has been drastically updated to become fully accessible with controller input, and has never been easier to navigate!
- The vehicles. Some vehicles were either missing functionality or downright nonexistent in the previous game. It's nice to see more than just postwar Russian vehicles!
- The challenges. Sure, the mechanics here are fundamentally the same as Spintires, but there you basically had to learn everything on your own. The launch tutorial and the unique challenges ensure newcomers get a grip on the game before sending them out into the giant open-world playground that is MudRunner. And the additional objectives provide a lot of fun for returning players like myself!

If you haven't heard of this game until now, and driving through the wilderness, getting yourself stuck (and hopefully unstuck!) in the mud for countless hours while listening to a nice podcast in the background, this game or SnowRunner are just for you. If you own Spintires and wish it had a little more, or simply want a better, overall more stable and user-friendly experience that actually benefits the CREATOR for all their hard work they put into this gorgeous game, you should definitely check this one out!",1601333739,1601333739,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Legendary soviet era vehicles (and some from USA if you own the DLC)
+ Challenging maps
+ The graphics are amazing
+ The sound design is cool too
+ American Wilds DLC is really good
+ Steam Workshop

Cons: 
- Bugs
- Multiplayer feels unfinished in some aspects",1601235536,1601235536,True,6,0,0.58655250072479248,0,True,False,False

1. Minimizing a window or switching to another window leads to the kick off all players connected to you

2. Already many years have passed, but still not visible headlights, stop lights of other players, even sounds! This is not early access is not it? .... it feel like playing on silent movie. Mud, ditches, broken trees, not syncing at all!
I did not expect this from such a high-quality game ...

3. Was not the ""transparent machine system"" a temporary solution before normal co-op game mechanics will existed?
You cannot even attach a trailer to another player, and you can also drive through another player, all other player cars become transparent for you if there are no players in them at the moment.

4. Only one trailer can be attached, why not two or more?

5. Ability to install modules in the garage that do not make sense in the current configuration. For example, fire-safe exhaust in a configuration where it is not possible to install a fuel tank. and many others.

I really hope that MudRunner will develop further.
This is a very good job, no need to leave it half way!

You haven't even finished the most important part - coop play.

Me, and like many other players, will definitely change the ratings to positive if this great game abandoned by the developers continues on its great way to normal release.",1601198795,1601198795,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is like more than 90% of the time you spend in this game you would have to constantly battling with trying to free the truck from stuck situation even from road surface that doesn't look muddy at all. 

So it's either the dirt road surface in this game doesn't looked like it should be or the trucks weigh ten times of the real world counterpart so the moment you step of the accelerator pedal the tire would sunk right away into the dirt. I have seen a lot of real world trucks driven through the surface that looks a lot more wet and muddy than the map I played in this game but they didn't struggle as much as I struggle trying to move even in a very small sized map of this game.

It would be more enjoyable if there is an option in the game that allow users to adjust the level of the mud physics. I was about to ask for refund when I play about 80 minutes but I thought to give this game another try before I ask for refund hence the 2 hours playtime. It's sad that I have to ask for refund because I actually like the idea of the game and enjoy off-road driving games. But MudRunner's mud physics and lack of an adjustable options for the mud physics in the game makes it way too hard for me to enjoy MudRunner.

If you like off-road driving games and enjoy spending few hours of your time in the mud trying to travel just for about 1 Km in the game then this game might be what you've been looking for.

But for me personally I would not recommending this game if you are looking for games that allows you to enjoy exploring the off-road world without the frustration of getting stuck at one point for few hours. Get SnowRunner instead. Too bad at the time I write this review Steam doesn't have SnowRunner yet, it will be great if I can purchase it in Steam too.",1600933699,1600936658,False,0,2,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

Yeah, if you enjoy simulation driving games (not a racing sim but more utility-work driving sim) and enjoy the slow precise driving with the chance of getting stuck in mud, or the possibility of being swept away by river currents, then this is a game for you. 

Mudrunner is very similar to the previous game Spintires (not made by the same developer), however having briefly played Spintires. I can agree that this game is better looking and slightly better simulation wise. One slight disappointment was Mudrunner not having the ability to deflate wheels for traction (Spintires had this option on a few trucks). 

A couple features that Mudrunner has over Spintires is a first person camera and IMO a much better and quite frankly less painful to work with, third person camera system. The mud in Mudrunner is far easier to drive through than Spintires, maybe that's in the titles and I've just not noticed? :/

Mudrunners is certainly enjoyable with different maps to play and on different difficulties, and many trucks and cars to unlock too. Each map introduces new challenges and the chance to find new vehicles which you might have not unlocked. There is also a challenges page to attempt up to 9 challenges, each rated up to 3 stars. There is somewhat ~60 achievements to unlock, I have been grinding through most of them (some of which challenging) which adds to the things to do in this game.

One great thing about this game is its free DLC. As I write this there are 3 free DLCs and one half price (during a sale for Focus). I am yet to play the maps however I have used the vehicles from the free DLCs and think they are cool to have. In most cases these vehicles may not be an upgrade to the base game vehicles but they are nice to have.",1600012572,1600012572,True,19,2,0.72550654411315918,0,True,False,False

My only complaint is that it recycles the maps from Spintires (they're a little different but ultimately the same.) Highly recommended.

It does have some bugs which I hope Snowrunner has corrected (mostly, headlights for other trucks do not show in multiplayer and there is no common terrain deformation), but nothing that prevents this from being an enjoyable game, also in multiplayer.

The series is, unfortunately, the only real off-road simulator with trucks that I have found. However, I adore it. The driving (with a wheel) feels about as you would hope when compared to the real thing (IIRC, it was a while ago). Not perfect, mind you, but it mostly has the weight it should. It does have occasional immersion-breaking physics, but mostly the package stays together well enough that it does not matter.
I would not mind if it would be even more unforgiving than it is, but it is a game and it might prevent normal people from enjoying it.

When playing alone it starts to lose it's appeal over time (i.e. when you have finished all the maps), but the challenges are a fun (albeit short) way to pass the time. 

With friends, at the other hand, it is always fun when you get a few friend together. It's also very easy to beat if everybody takes an OP machine, but forget those and do this instead:
- Take a shitty truck with no all-wheel-drive (B-130 is fine, albeit it lacks a crane so you need something for support)
- Restrain yourself from teleporting to garage (if not playing hardcore) and help other when you get stuck
- Use your favorite VOIP to talk with each other
- Take a sip of vodka
- Deliver the logs
- If it feels too easy, there is always a worse route to take
Remember, it's a Russian truck simulator. Losing is fun.",1595972143,1595972143,True,1,1,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,False

I know about the controversies and several problems with the development etc., but behind that it is logical evolution of the original Spintires game and all it needs to offer is 100% there. So if you like russian and american trucks and if you like delivering lumber and complete great challenges then play the heck out of this game.

While this game does have quite a learning curve, a good place to start is with the Challenge mode, which allows the player to learn about different aspects of the game (e.g. learning to drive through water and thick mud, loading logs with a crane, night driving, etc.) while doing missions - all with bonus objectives that make for even more of a challenge, and give the missions some replay value if these objectives haven't been achieved. The main way to play is single-player sandbox mode, where the player can play at their own pace, and drive freely around the map (though there are roadblocks for trucks in certain places when loaded full of timber, which can be inconvenient).

For the most part, this is a slow paced game (very slow, at times) that definitely requires patience (such as all the times you will get bogged, or while trying to reverse through the mud with a large trailer that just wants to jackknife), but the experience is gritty and adventurous, especially when going off-road in a largely untamed natural landscape.
Multiplayer is also available online, up to 4 players, though there's no guarantee that there will be other players ready to join you, unless you organize a few friends yourself.

No violence or themes, despite the game's rough appearance. Naturally vehicles can be crashed or flipped over (the driver never seems to get hurt, though). There is multiplayer chat as well, which parents will want to be aware of.

While this game is not for everybody, I'm happy to include it in the list.

Game breaking bugs were never fixed. New content was never added. That seems to be the M.O. with the developer 'Pavel' you might hear about. In the meantime, the game you want to buy is the original Spintires, which is being maintained and updated with new content all the time now.


Initial impressions are that this is worth getting whether you're new to the game or coming from the original Spintires. Other reviews have already summed up what's good and bad with the game, so I'll focus on what's different from the original. Mudrunner doesn't offer much more than some tweaks, a new internal camera option, and a promise of future content, but while the original Spintires was plagued with an inexperienced and stubborn publisher, this version has more going for it. I'll update this review as things go on.

Hopefully we'll get new maps and vehicles with updates, and hopefully better mod tools will come out. The problem with the old Spintires is that there was no official way to make modded maps, which is something that I think would add hundreds of hours to the game's enjoyment since having only six is very limiting.

One important thing to note is that unlike the original Spintires, this one has a progression system. You have to unlock things by playing the maps, which means you have to experience the new content first before you get to use the old goodies. I kind of like that, but I can see that rubbing people the wrong way. The problem with the vehicle options is that there's about eight trucks that're all identical to one another except for their tires or having differential lock or not. The old game just let you swap out tires on trucks, this one doesn't seem to let you do that. I prefer the old system, because I'd rather have three trucks on a map with options for them rather than nine trucks that're mostly useless and two that I can do things with because of their tires not being garbage. That's really my biggest complaint so far, unless I wanted to complain about spending $12. I'll complain about the money if I don't see any updates in the next couple of months.",1509479844,1594286804,False,0,0,0.494435787200927734,0,True,False,False

Nice and Dirty

A weirdly cathartic simulation game where you are a logger in [the muddiest area ever of] Eastern Europe.  

Gameplay loop revolves around driving trucks in a unexplored map, uncovering new areas, using a wench to pull out of being stuck, picking up logs and delivering them to the mill. The trick though is dealing with the terrain,  the mud,  fuel, and rivers.  Much of the game is switching from regular drive to 4 wheel drive and turning on and off diff lock as to conserve fuel but not get stuck. 

Pros:
- Weirdly relaxing. A really good ""podcast"" game.
- Multiple maps
- Steam workshop 
- Optional hardcore mode
- Challenges (like only drive in FPS, no damage, etc) are options
- Leave the game to play later? It picks up literally EXACTLY where you left off.

Cons
- Textures and texture pop-in are bad. You can mod textures.
- If you don't like these kinds of games this isn't going to change your mind

A great game for low key late nights and podcasts.",1531077856,1592624773,True,15,1,0.644620060920715332,0,True,False,False

[b]Now, to everyone reading this[/b]
Don't trash talk SnowRunner before you even play it. Don't come to MudRunner's Forums expecting a welcome committee just because you don't like the fact that SnowRunner is EGS exclusive.
Believe me when i tell you, not even the people who bought it, like that.
I'm waiting for the Steam release, like any normal fan would, i've played around 40-50hrs of SnowRunner without even buying it. I've released a very famous mod for SR (that adds some tweaks fans from MR and ST are used to, making it more of a hardcore game) and will continue to improve on it as soon as i get my hands on the SR Steam release.

Just hang on, and it'll soon be here!!

Robbaz got it right when he said the sequel (SnowRunners) is the ultimate Dad Simulator, this is the prototype Dad Simultor, in a good way.

The basic idea of the game is to ""Scout"" the map by driving through Fog of War to reach viewpoints, then using the biggest, baddest, dirtiest trucks you'll ever imagine, drag logs from the logging area to the log mill. This might not sounds like fun but let me tell you... it isn't. You'll get stuck in mud, drowned in rivers and fall down ravines. It's a game about patience and determination, zoning out until that sense of achievement when you finally deliver 10 tons of logs, then cry as you realise that you have to do it all again as the log mill wants more.

The graphics are good as well, and the physics engine when it first came out had never been seen before. The mud reacts in realistic ways (I'm guessing) and when you hit that tree driving 35km (this isn't a racing game) with a full log rack... you feel the impact.

I've been playing this game for years and even enjoyed the expansion (American Wilds) on Switch. It's my go to game when I need an hour away from the world, watching the sticky mud fly off my tires, as I drive a vehicle I'll probably never own, around a beautifully made up world.

I decided, against my better judgement, to try it out anyway, and I'm really glad I did.
It's a nice change of pace from high octane FPS games and I ended up finding it surprisingly relaxing.

It's just the right amount of challenging, where it can feel like you won't be able to get out of a particular situation, but with enough work, you almost always can. 

I get a surprisingly high level of satisfaction from getting unstuck from a muddy bog and reloading a lost load of logs manually.

Its simple in theory: just drive around and take wood to where its supposed to go. But the environment is really unforgiving when it comes to getting there.

As you'd expect, you'd be driving trucks through the mud. And this game has a deep physics engine that a.) models the traction, power, and speed of your truck and b.) models the slippery terrain you'll be going through.

Personally, I think the slippery terrain physics are exaggerated, but only because the maps are only about 2 kilometers x 2 kilometers large (about 1.2 miles x 1.2 miles) so instead of making larger maps they make you move slower through the mud.

But since the traction is low, it may take you at least half an hour or more to drive a kilometer. Which isn't so bad gameplay-wise, since it emulates driving a long period of time through a much larger map.

Anyway, game itself has some wicked awesome looking graphics, real-time ground deformation, trees being pushed around, tires deforming, etc. So its quite entertaining to watch because there's almost no other game like this. Once you see your truck sluggishly trying to push through a waterlogged road, with all the ground and water graphics on you'll see how unique the game graphics and physics are. You'll also be using cranes (optional on casual difficulty) to load the logs onto trucks and that is a minigame onto itself with pretty accurate log physics so you need to carefully adjust your crane etc.

All in all, Mudrunner is a graphically impressive game that does admittedly look a little too gray so I suggest you install ReShade to up the saturation and improve contrast.

But it is like I said, graphically impressive. To drive through unforgiving terrain with trucks and environments modelled with amazing detail is visually pleasing, but also rewarding if you execute it properly. You need a lot of patience or you'll literally drop your load or flip your truck, so its not meant for people with really short attention spans.

What I suggest you do is have some music going, or a podcast, or personally I watch documentaries while driving. Of course, DON'T WATCH TV WHILE DRIVING IN REAL LIFE, but in a game you can do whatever.

What you get in return is a fun, challenging game of driving trucks through harsh terrain.",1590199552,1590200701,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The fact that this is just an upgraded version of the original Spintires is a little ok by me as a lot of the time that's what games do, get better, and you can't exactly just make that into a DLC.

HOWEVER the fact that the developers have in my own words ""sold out"" to being an exclusive on epic games store with [b]Snowrunner[/b] and not even showing plans of it being on Steam. I can understand that they would get much better cuts on profits and whatnot but this does not help consumers one bit. I also realize that we don't really want Steam to have a monopoly on games, but with the other many launchers such as Bethesda, Blizzard, EA, Epic Games ETC... I am having to deal with the many accounts and services many of which are much less friendly to use than Steam. Some of the launchers I can understand having a good few of their own games released such as Blizzard's Battlenet but am still not too happy with so many of them existing right now.

Definitely one of the best offroading simulators out there. It's more about logging and heavy trucks though.

The tutorials are very comprehensive and even without a steering wheel etc., playing with a keyboard wasn't a problem at all.

The ONLY reason I would NOT recommend this game at the moment is because the first of the ""challenges"" asks you to reverse a truck with a trailer. While reversing shouldn't be a problem at all, reversing with a TRAILER really can make one sweat unless you're really experienced with these sort of games.

1) The catchment area of the trailer AFTER reversing is 'absolute'. No room for errors. I believe some relief should be granted to newbies at least.

2) If there was an option like ATS or ETS where AI parking is available and you get lesser XP or lesser points, this game would have been awesome.

I hope they add it in a future patch or something.

I'm not changing my review to negative because I'm butthurt, or out of principle, but because I genuinely cannot recommend this game to someone getting into the series. I don't recommend paying full price for this game, only to have to pay full price for what is basically just another expansion on another platform.

On the topic of Snowrunner, I feel that the developers are making a grave mistake in having the game being ran off the Epic Games launcher, as Epic is 40%(+-) owned by China. Epic also has a rather poorly secured way of placing money into one's account, where you either use paypal, or your personal bank account number, which I'd say nobody is comfortable using.
Snowrunner looks amazing, but I, among many, many others, shall not purchase it until it is put onto Steam.

I think you should buy this before you buy snowrunner. It's cheaper and has a community. Epic , which is 40% china owned does not give 2 giant mouse turds about you and your community. Steam, at least, pretends to with workshop and discussion boards. Devs... you really screwed up and just like Blands 3 did, and metro... YOU'LL be back. or you wont have much of a customer base.

MudRunner is where you need to be for now and for those of you curious here is my opinion on snowrunner.

Here are some things, not all of them, I've noticed and DO NOT LIKE:

1. You cannot short cut the game by prestaging trucks and trailers.
2. winching stops the driving of the truck you are trying to winch. Why can't i pull and have the truck reverse or drive fwd at the same time??
3. the auto center of the steering is REALLY annoying to me. i love the hard core mode on mudrunner because you feel the fight of the terrain. snowrunner is one difficulty and doesn't allow you to turn off auto center.
4. you can skip time with no cost to fuel (as far as i can tell)
5. this is probably the most insignificant dislike: i want that legacy camera. its default to a new ""better"" camera for people you can handle the way the OG players like it. thankfully there is an option for the legacy camera to be on. and it's better than the original on because it allows for more field of view.
6. cannot track multiple missions at once.. this is HUGE to me because, working in logistics for my career, we need to be able to multitask otherwise the military stuff i work on won't be able to support and defend the people of the country and constitution. It's weird that it's a offroad logistics game but you cannot, in single player, multitask. Obviously multiple players allow for multiple material movement. but i'm not sure they can track other missions to benefit the group. none of the people i know and play with own the game yet.
7. the road still feels like ice... the lighter the vehicle the more you slide.. why cant the road be grippy?? we waited for how long and we get no texture or feeling for the handling of the truck on the road...
8.quick winching.. its just easier sure but there is no telling what i'm going to attach too. it can be good in a muddy scramble but still.. Oh and the other benefit is if you spam the quick winch while trying to pull a stuck truck out you can use it like a snatch strap. which is the best use for quick winching i've found.
9. Minor things here. Regarding cab view: get the hands out of my face... lol or give me the option. and why is the horn so friggin delayed??? like you hit the button and 4 parsecs later your horn goes off?
10. mod.io support / epic store only.. seriously? epic is trash and none of my friends will buy the game because steam is actually WAY better. I know there are some bennies for devs not going with steam but honestly... you'll reach a bigger market and already have a workshop function for the community.. Mod.io looks great but it's just one more 3rd party thingy to sort of slow down people who like mods but don't know how to make them and don't want to spend the time to learn how to integrate an external website.

Now for ten things I DO LIKE:

1. Non-pavement surfaces have been significantly improved visually and feeling wise.
2. winching to weaker trees can break the tree and the winch point is gone. I love the realism feel of this.
3. truck customization out the bat. this is good because it will lessen the immediate want for mods even though i've already dug through the first few that are available.
4. the missions. there are a ton.
5. the landscapes are huge and driving takes a scaled amount of time that feel right.
6. discoverable upgrades and equipment
7. the length of the day and night cycle
8. i like that if you have a road truck you can build it into a more off-road type truck.
9 the variety of cargo and missions is pretty good.
10. you can buy vehicles and build your fleet.

This isn't all of the things I like or dislike but this is some of my list... One extra thing i didn't like for the realism guys and modders that do a killer job with lifted truck mods.. The ""lift upgrade"" just hurts my soul... those control arms are literally vertical on the 1500 chevy... ugh... i can't wait til we let the modders get there hands on this game. You modding pros and amatures made the game waaaay better. I'm thankful for the platform the devs created... but dang.. they've never been in a trail rig or lifted truck in their lift from the looks of it..

Thanks for your time.. feel free to add to these likes and dislikes. it's all a matter of opinion.. don't bash mine.",1588341014,1588341014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is basic game crap, and it literally breaks the game when it happens. I watched a streamer roll completely down a mountain because he was going to use a cliff rock to drive on and it turns out, there was no collision, so the 20 minutes it took him to climb up there was squashed as he rolls down the mountain face to the bottom.

The game is fine, there is a big modding community and it's fun to play for a bit every once in a while. But what's happening in the background is a mystery. Originally Spintires was the original game, and after the original publisher went AWOL on the devs, they decided to reboot the game with this title, MudRunner, Focus Home as the publisher.

Now suddenly development on the original has started again, together with a new DLC and nobody knows what's up.

Now Snowrunner was announced with all the features and improvements that were already promised for Mudrunner. And as a cherry on top it only will be released in a gamestore that should not be named. 

The game is good. As was Spintires.

There is always that feeling when you finish a map or you just deliver the cargo you were assigned to, that satisfiying feeling that, you worked actually hard for that to accomplish.

""Perfect game for everyone who likes old russian horses such as KrAZ, URAL and MAZ. Not recommended for Greenpeace members - tons of burnt fuel just for the forest exploitation. Anyway, finding your way through the forest and tugging logs can be pretty relaxing. Great graphics, ingame physics and truck handling. Pleasant performance, no fatal bugs or crashes.
After some time you will find out that some objectives are kinda easy, I would probably appreciate more challenging difficulty.""

+ There was a nice update of American trucks and maps but since that time the game seems to be idle. I guess the devs of original Spintires took the concept back and started to work on it again, so I would probably recommend to see the original game. To conclude the review, it was a nice attempt to save the concept of the original game.

Graphics: 8/10 ; Not gonna lie, may look abit dated but the world and physics are quite amazing. If youre playing this just for the graphics then it will get boring fast.
Story: 5/10 ; No story at all. It is basically what you (or/and friends) make up as you play the bottomless list of maps to download and play from workshop.
Gameplay: 5/10 ; Quite satisfying controls. It is not too sim or too arcady, quite in the middle and the gameplay itself is satisfying. But the gameplay loop is not for everyone. Again will be better if play with friends as the challenges will be more fun with help.

- The game is relatively short and repetitive. A few different loads, and other kinds of vehicles, could have been nice.

Now the pros:
- Graphically good, intuitive UI, pleasant to play.
- Extremely well optimised, can run 720p on a potato, 1080p with high settings on any 2018+ GPU and iGPU - for the latter you might want 8 GB RAM to avoid lag though.
- Good sound engine.
- Excellent difficulty level : casual is easy and stiil slightly challenging. hardcore is really challenging yet perfectly feasible.

This is a great game that offers tons of diverse gameplay.

The base game is centered around Russia. You start off and are tasked with delivering logs across the map to a Lumber Mill.

There are plenty of trucks to use. Plenty of 6x6 trucks, plenty of 4x4's and a few 8x8's.

Pros:

Wide range of vehicles, from a UAZ Jeep to a MAZ 7410 missile hauler.

Great maps, they are designed very interesting and are very fun to offroad in.

Mod support. There are maps, trucks, trailers, anything you want mods support it.

Cons:

Abandoned. They have moved to ""Snowrunner"" on the Epic Games store which means no mod support, customer support there is awful, and you dont have all your steam achievments etc.

Modding is pretty dead on the workshop. Theres a few who keep going but its basically dead. If you want new mods go to mudrunnermods or something online.

Not enough official content. Honestly.


Other then that, a great game. I rate it a 7/10 and would recommend getting it on sale. Just dont get Snowrunner as you will get yourself screwed over HEAVILY. You can also go to Spintires the Original Game if you want a game not abandoned.",1515949107,1583780064,True,3,0,0.491370558738708496,2,True,False,False

Lovely, atmospheric visuals that really give the feel that you're somewhere bleak - beautiful V8 and V12 diesel engine grunts and turbo whines - you've run out of diesel?! Go get some!
Tricky maps that require scouting for watchpoints in smaller 4x4's, then working out your routes and finding hidden, heavy duty Ukranian/Russian vehicles to get your timber moving to the sawmills have got me hooked.
Took me a bit of time to get used to using my Steam controller, but now I've mastered that I find myself taking on harder challenges - not starting with big vehicles, but making do with what I find in the wilderness.
Then there's the amount of mods out there, a lot of which that are done very, very well!
I just wish the hud in cockpit mode was done better, but some mods have done just that. Overall, I flippin' love Mudrunner!

Let's take this game as it is now - a separate title (for whatever reason). It offers hours of ... well, fun, if you enjoy driving through muddy roads and cooperating while trying to come through the obsticles every map is full with.

While it perhaps isn't a game one would play alone, it is really enjoyable to challenge yourself with one of the challenges the devs prepared. What might draw more people's attention is the multiplayer mode, which offers loads of fun while remaining a chill-out game. Even though it may get boring from time to time, I always end up playing it when I just don't want any action coming, lay back and relax with the music and a few friends in the background.

With the base game, you get some free DLCs containing new maps and vehicles, which were (and probably still will be) released throughout the years. The physics are stunning and although the difficulty is maybe sometimes exaggerated, there's nothing more satisfying than completing any of the maps. The price maybe isn't that friendly to everyone, but every now and then, there's a sale and it's definitely worth getting at lower cost.",1509467811,1581002560,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False
