The combat is super fun and the progression of abilities feels right. You start off feeling very under powered and while you get better and stronger, I never felt over-powered against higher level enemies and died plenty in the end-game. The abilities are interesting and useful. I used them all, although I definitely had a few favourites.

The atmosphere, story-telling and voice acting in this game is top notch. Every actor did such an amazing job - I loved the live action scenes too. The actor playing Dr. Darling was just so good that I looked forward to every video I found of him. The story is weird and confusing but I always found it compelling, and wanted to know more.

Performance was not great. It would run smoothly for hours and then suddenly, the game had long freezes and lots of stutter. Nothing to do but wait it out. It ruined one of the most fun combat missions in the game :(

I can't really recommend the DLC too much. The one was fairly boring with long samey corridors and the other was related to Alan Wake, a game I have never played and don't intend to so I abandoned it halfway through. That being said, I also really spent a lot of time exploring and fighting in the main game and was kind of tired by the end (loved it but had had enough and I didn't have much energy for more of the same but with a story that was incomprehensible to me).

I appreciated the assistance settings allowing for extra help if you need it - there were two bosses that I tried many, many, many times, including leaving and coming back after several hours of new upgrades and I still couldn't beat them so I liked that I could tune the difficulty just a bit (there are sliders allowing you to customise in case you need a tiny helping hand or if you want to become invincible, but also everywhere in between - I liked that you didn't have to become God-like to get a bit of help for the harder fights).

Overall, this game is excellent and I enjoyed my time with it.",1709071420,1709071420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Even with a high mid pc running on recommended settings I ran into some performance issues that at times got bad enough to stutter the game.
-There are 5 different types of lore dump in this game and by golly can it get oppressive with how much you have to talk, listen, and read. I'm not kidding that about 1/3 or more of the game is interacting with a lore dump.

And oh boy, I am glad I did!

I am not a huge Remedy fan even though I played (but never finished) Alan Wake on the X360 and Max Payne 1 on PC, but I can certainly feel the studio DNA there.
The story is quite crazy and a bit hard to follow and understand, I will take a look at some videos and posts to gather more info, but the pace and delivery are top notch. The direction, dialogs and camera cuts are really impressive and entertaining, with amazing performance from the VAs, also very good facial animations for a 2019 game.

Visually the game is just stunning, with or without RT. The interaction with the environments and the physics, sparks, destruction while in battle are a sight to see. After some time as you progress and getting near the end game the combat gets a bit repetitive, but not ever boring.

I got that the art direction is a bit grim, however the colours could be a bit more saturated and less gray - it improved a lot with the HDR mod.

Gameplay wise, the controls (hah) are snappy and fluid, the downside is being limited to just two forms of the gun. The special powers are fun with special attention to Launch.

I came to the game with somewhat low expectations as my main knowledge about the game was related to its tech and being one of the first big RTX games out there.

I strongly recommend to the game. I intend to get back to it to finish the DLCs. If I were to give it a score, I would give it a 9 out of 10.",1708403391,1708403391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
I have to say right off the bat that the gameplay had an excellent feel to it – especially the movement was just as snappy as you'd hope it to be. The powers were all fun to use, while I didn't wholly like some of the weapons. A pet peeve of mine is that I got some of the power/weapon modifications that I had been looking for/that were the most fun to use during the second DLC, when I was practically done with the game already. Other small complaints are that occasionally enemies would just feel like big bags of HP, while on the other hand the player has very limited options regarding healing, so every now and then you just find yourself standing around a corner somewhere with 1 HP left, just hoping to somehow recover. Other than combat, the exploration was exciting and I enjoyed reading the hundreds of notes to be found – though sometimes there was almost too many of them in a big cluster, e.g. first half of the AWE DLC.

[h3]Story, characters and atmosphere[/h3]
The story was good and solid enough. It kept me interested throughout the game, although the ending could have felt a bit more satisfactory, and there was quite a bit of set-up for the sequel. The characters – dialogue, acting, voice acting – were all excellent, and one of my favorite aspects of the whole game. As a Finn, the interactions with Ahti always brought a small to my face, and he deservedly won a BAFTA for his performance! The general atmosphere and mystery of the setting was intriguing, along with the worldbuilding. It made me want to dive into Alan Wake as well – which I encourage you to do before playing Control, as it tied very heavily into the second DLC.

Overall, I had a good time with Control, and there was even more content than I had expected from a really pretty looking game that was one of the first ones to integrate raytracing into the experience (though I didn't get to test it out myself, as I've sadly got an older GPU).

As you can imagine, this was not a game that hooked me up right from the start. It's a very pedestrian third person action game with some very, [b]very[/b] annoying quirks to it and a few gimmicks that the game banks on to try and carry the rest trough, and if you swap ""Control"" up there, there's a very good chance this will pass as a handy universal short review for any Remedy game.

The game follows the steps of protagonist Jesse Faden, who arrives at the premises of the Federal Bureau of Control, a government agency dealing with... let's call it [i]weird stuff[/i]. Elephant on the room first, this game is very transparently inspired on the collective internet work of fiction ""The SCP Foundation"", and while, to my knowledge, there's nothing specific that has been directly copied from it, the game certainly takes a lot of general pointers for its setting and plot, which revolves around seemingly mundane objects with paranormal properties. 

On the surface, as an SCP fan I should be ecstatic to see a close take on this concept for a fully fledged videogame, but the truth is that when comparing the two, Control rarely comes out on top, but I guess it's not super fair to compare a fully fledged videogame made within a budget, and a legion of sweaty internet weirdos intricately crafting a 10 page wiki article about the lore and properties of a magical cigarette lighter that destroys the universe if exposed to a child's voice or whatever. Regardless, and while I commend the efforts of trying to copy this universe with less than unlimited time and money, it will always feel like an off-brand copy of SCP. And this is Control's major pitfall: in trying to punch so high, everything falls [i]just a little short[/i].

Word of advice, if you ever see this game installed in one of your friend's computer, they might or might not enjoy the game. But if your friend is an architect, then it is PORN. It's FILTHY, DIRTY architectural PORN and you must assume that your friend has whacked off to it at least once a day since they installed it. The graphics and the level design come together for truly jaw-dropping moments of shifting rooms, massive open areas, twisting hallways and striking light shows. And while your friend is a FREAK and should be ashamed of themselves, the graphics in general are great, but performance is iffy, with super chuggy texture streaming while running in DX12, and even while running in DX11 certain light effects and rooms can seriously hammer down on performance. The worst part of the graphics and presentation overall is probably that all important characters are mocapped, giving them this intensely uncanny valley, LA-Noire-ish vibe. Some might say this works with the feeling of unease that the game tries to constantly create, but I think that, just like the story, this is the developers overextending their budget and limitations.

Look, I think this is enough of a recurring theme that I'll just lay out the rest of grievances that I personally blame on this, so we can just get it out of the way: 

- The game includes a very straightforward upgrade system where you can improve your abilities or ""craft"" and upgrade your gear as you progress through the game, but there's very few upgrades, very few of those are anything other than an increase to power for whatever ability you want to specialize on, and you can very mindlessly just slap new upgrades in as you go through the game.

- Jesse will get access to extra abilities as she advances through the game, and they all feel janky in one way or the other. The telekinetic throw will often grab the wrong thing or throw it to the wrong enemy, the shield has got me killed more times than it has helped me, and while I get that the developers had to try and balance out incredibly powerful abilities and the game still being somewhat challenging, the very strict limitations on both your powers and your weapon means a lot of your deaths will not feel like entirely your fault, a product of a ""oh shit how the hell do we balance this without reworking the entire system"" process.

- The level design is great, but reaching certain areas can become needlessly frustrating until you basically learn how to navigate the levels. Which you'll need to do, because you will keep receiving ""alerts"", time-limited missions that will make you screech to a halt on whatever you were doing and go somewhere else you had already visited to do it. Enemies you have killed previously respawn, so you'll have to fight your way to the side-mission, do it, fight your way back to the save point, and then fight your way back to whatever you were doing in the first place in a VERY transparent attempt to just stretch out and utilize the (mind you, pretty huge) map up to a 20 hour runtime.

I don't hate Control. I think it's a very solid experience with an interesting premise that is very fun to explore, with great characters, great performances, a great physics engine and gameplay that, while being mediocre enough as to have driven me away twice, is serviceable enough so as to carry you through the story. It's a game about ""moments"" strung together by serviceable but samey and uninspired gameplay that was never the focus of the product. Still, I believe it will definitely be able to keep your attention for long enough to justify its price point, as long as you can keep your attention on it.

As inspiration to actually beat the full campaign or main missions of the numerous games that live untouched in my library, I decide to start recording and uploading gameplay (surprised no one else has thought of this before me.....ha).  I am also going to play without any help from the internet (or as very little as possible but sometimes I am just not that intelligent).

Review:
After playing the Control main missions and a bit of one of the DLCs, I would give this game a 9/10.  Only a point off for some graphical glitches that happened in late game.  There are great unexpected abilities, items, and ways to progress the missions (puzzle solving, brute force, a bit of cheese, etc).  I found the game tough, but not overly punishing (like SOFTWARE that is FROM an different developer). I am taking a small break to try out a different game for the channel, but will no doubt revisit this one soon to begin playing and recording my progress through the DLC content.

The graphical updates that have been made since release take advantage of all my RTX 3080 had to offer.  If you want to see what this game looks like maxed out with DLSS and Ray Tracing, check out some gameplay.

Although the story itself is one of those too weird to follow in it's entirety, but just weird enough to follow in it's context type-of-story, I had a great time playing with Jesse as she kinda meta-talks to you.

The COMBAT game-play loop was fun for me, all the different abilities (especially in the Foundation) and the VARIETY of mods there were (basically character buffs) was insane and I really enjoyed leveling up and trying to go for different builds with different mods, especially since you can stack mods.
A few of the missions were VERY fun, especially any that had you taken to another level or solving some puzzle followed by awesome items or a boss, but Overview Hotel had a few, fun challenging puzzles but most were just click all the buttons in a room, so sometimes it felt repetitive, as did some of the missions that just had you run around and find a single enemy in three rooms around the map or shooting certain things around the map, while some missions had you go through different puzzles or fight some serious enemies, it felt like not all missions had the same love in it.

 The DLC were both also very fun! The Alan Wake DLC was pretty cool, since I got to see Alan Wake but the gameplay loop is reminscent of old console games where to beat the boss you gotta do something a few times over, but then fighting the boss was definitely more fun since it was an actual enemy.
The Foundation DLC was a lot more fun with the terrain and map setups, it's a DLC that's particularly fun for people who like to speed through linear combat zones and the base enemies there are actually kinda fun to fight.
The Arcade Games, which are really just game-modes and boss reruns were also really fun since I wanted to challenge myself from events before and I got to relive some of the boss fights.

Overall. solid game that will occupy a good amount of time, granted you have the DLC and do the side missions and try some Arcade games.",1707747999,1707747999,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 Cons: navigation can be a bit of a nightmare; the chase for Hartman I think it was, was awful - couldn't see a darned thing anywhere. The constant popping up of extra side missions is getting boring, I'm just done with main mission 8 and I've done what's popped up, but I'm getting sick of them. This is not an intuitive game, for the most part you have no idea where to go and what to do when you get there; how to use your mods or even fast travel, having to look it up online ruins the immersion. Bad that you can't reload back to a save point, I got stuck somewhere not being able to find a way out and once I got caught falling down the side of a machine and couldn't get back up for yonks - dislike their save system, it works for the most part but you often have to re-fight the same enemies over and over - oh and you are penalised upgrade materials for dying
Pros: fast travel is excellent  combat is fun, once you get extra gun slots especially, liked the way their ammo refills. The expeditions were fun to a point. By about mission 4 I was picking up good mods, no need to worry about there not being any. Game plays well and loads seamlessly. 
I'm not really invested in the characters, the exploration (apart from the ""so dark you can't see areas"") is great; I will finish it, wouldn't pay full price for it. 
**Have now finished the game and DLC Foundation - that was far better than the other one; got an extra mission or two and tried another expedition only to find they are exactly the same except higher time penalties. Since there is no ng+ that I can find, relatively pointless picking up outfits and max mods at that stage. The story was kinda ok, no real depth to it or the characters, overall I guess 7/10.

I've heard a ton of praise towards this game like it's the second coming of Christ.
I was scared to be disappointed, scared it may be overhyped.
Due to that, it took me ages to give it a go.

This game surprised me a lot.
I expected it to be okay or maybe rather good but nothing outstanding.

I can't say a lot about the story in order not to spoil it.
This is a game to experience blind by yourself.
I f***ing loved the story and no sidequest was boring; useless or repetitive.
It truly is a great story. The only thing i am disappointed in is that i want more of this.

Gameplay it really good. You have to balance gunplay with abilities in a very satisfying way.
There's a traversal ability that felt a bit clunky and lacks precision. At times, it feels like AI knows exactly where you aim and strafe pretty fast. Sometimes, you'll hit but still miss because f*** you. The game also provides cheats which is not a good thing.

Graphics and world design are on point BUT there are huge artifact using the dx12 launcher.
It also happens in dx11 too but far less.

Performance is not good. It's playable but not up to standard. There is a bug that'll make everything fade to black while keeping ui and letting you play. The only solution is to close the game and launch it again.

It reminds me of Mass Effect 2 and 3, where it's basically a third-person shooter, but you also get sweet bionic powers. Love a lot of the abilities and how smooth they are to use (most of the time). If I could just play through levels or missions, DOOM style or Mass Effect style, I would have a great time!

Unfortunately, this game does way too much of AAA gaming sins: tons of filler, needlessly making the game ""connected"", forcing you to retread already completed areas, adding dialogue trees in a game that absolutely needs none, and probably worst of all, adding a crafting mechanic for no reason at all.

1. Filler missions. You'll get notifications to tell you to go back to an area you already cleared to kill some baddies. Needless padding of the game.
2. Guns and mods. Why the mods are random drops I'll never know. Maybe a leftover of a previous iteration? I find so many copies of the same mod that have slightly different numbers. So every mod you find with a lower number is completely useless and just takes up space in your inventory until you manually deconstruct it. Tedious and boring. Guns are stupid too. They are unlocked when you find the necessary ingredients which are nonsense named materials you find randomly. This game desperately needed to just follow a Metroidvania/Zelda approach where you simply find the new weapons in certain areas of the map. The weapon mods could be found in more secret areas or off the beaten path. Just one drop for each mod, with maybe enhanced versions found later in the game. This would make a ton more sense than Jesse crafting shit like she's Lara Croft.
3. The dialogue is mostly unneeded -- this game would be fine with Dark Souls or Chrono Trigger style dialogue. Maybe a few options, but adding whole dialogue trees is needless. I think this was added to make the player more involved with role-playing as Jesse, but it doesn't work because you can't really make any meaningful choices. You're following orders the entire time. It's a game on rails. Don't bother pretending it's not.
4. The enemies get very samey. Their silhouettes blend together easily. There are a few that stand out, like the flying guys, and the big dudes in heavy armor. There are still a bunch of enemies that are just normal humanoids, and you cannot really tell them apart at a glance. I kept getting owned by the rocket launcher guys because they look just like normal riflemen, and for some reason the rocket launcher they carry is held just like a normal assault rifle (instead of being shoulder mounted -- which would make their silhouette stand out from the rest).
5. This game really tried to be an ""open-world"" game where you could visit any part of the Bureau when you pleased. But it doesn't really work for this. The story is encouraging you to push ahead, the quests you receive are urgent, and it doesn't make sense for Jesse to be fvcking around with side-quests. This game needed to just be fully on rails like a Half-Life game. It would have enhanced the best parts of the game and made for a much better experience, rather than forcing the player to lose momentum all the time by making them do other tasks instead of pushing ahead with the main story (which the developers clearly cared about!)",1707250947,1707250947,False,2,0,0.44592660665512085,0,True,False,False

This game, its mechanics, the gameplay, the story (mostly) was amazing. The Ashtray Maze, amazing. The ""Not Moria"" place, very nice. The secrets given to us and revealed were amazing to watch unfold... until they weren't anymore... However, there was no ending. Not just no ending, but no conclusion. I felt like I was dangled a carrot for 50+ hours only to find out, there was no carrot. 

I don't care if there is plans for a squeal, I'm playing this game now, not in 2027. I wasn't even fully upgraded by the end of the game either, having never got the chance to put any points into melee, shield or levitation slam; if they thought I was gonna grind that out or New Game Plus this, they must be joking. 

Also Direct 12 on this game sucks. I even went and downloaded the mod for it. Not even that would help. Blurry visuals and my brand new computer isn't even a year old yet. Had to resort to D11 on Ultra just so I can get textures near the end of the game. Ridiculous. 

SPOILERS BELOW

So...

Polaris: Polaris is... nothing? Invisible? With you all along? The Player? There are theories, none of them satisfying. Spent the game hoping to find her and who/what she was. Only to get a entire chamber full of nothing. ""Nothing behind the poster"" and vague riddles was a garbage decision. Feels like it was rushed, edgy and/or just plain stupid. With all that red sand in the chamber I was hoping we would be able to go to her realm through the projector, before or after the conclusion. Nope. Very disappointed that such a great game with a amazing story went with such a nonsense anti-climatic ending.

The Board: We never get to learn who or what the board actually is. Aside from Polaris, this was the other great mystery.  Felt like the Black City in Dragon Age. Forever at a distance, never to touch. But I thought this was going to end with us meeting them there at the end with Dylan, nope. Instead we get a lackluster run to the pyramid to save Dylan, not even a real boss fight. And The Board? The game just shrugs them off. Congrats on another stupid decision. 

Dylan: So much could have been used with Dylan. I thought Dylan was gonna be used as a boss to save him. Nope. I thought he was gonna make it into the pyramid and infect the board, nope. Maybe he would make it into the boards realm, and we have to save the board from Dylan while learning who they are in the process, nope. Perhaps we would save Dylan and he becomes like us, and he fights by our side to fight the boss, or The Board itself after becoming infected, nope. Nope. Nope. Nope... what do we get? Dylan in a comma. Stupid.

Dr. Darling: We get a last video from the Doctor. Spent all game learning about this man, reading his reports, enduring his videos and so on, only for him to end up like everything else in this game, shrugged off and forgotten about.

DLC: Can tell this was rushed because they didn't even finish the story. Marshal went down into the foundation, to do something, something the game thought we forgot about. I don't know because I got to that point and not even assist mode could make me want to endure whatever disappointment was waiting at the end of that DLC. Did the Alan Wake DLC fully when it popped up before the end of the main story. It was nice, but the rewards were lacking at the end. Barely got any upgrade points out of it and the mods were nice but not enough to justify that whole side trip.

Conclusion: Great game, marred by a terrible ending. Ripping away any form of accomplishment or satisfaction in the mysteries of the game was overall a terrible decision. Had the gameplay, physics and visuals not been so fun, I would have completely regretted buying this game. Ultimately this is like watching movie that you didn't know had squeals to it, and you end up sitting there wondering why you even watched it because you're not totally sure the squeals will even be made or that you'll live to see it.

I say  this with some trepidation because I did also find what Control's offering to be incredibly infuriating at times, but after a bit of reflection I've determined that the main reason that I'm capable of getting so annoyed at the game is because when it works it absolutely sings. 

Right there I'm talking about the gameplay in particular. Just moving and attacking can feel incredibly fluid when you're locked in and doing what the game wants you to be doing (constantly moving, constantly swapping between weapons & telekinetic attacks, constantly on the offensive). However, when you can't get into this rhythm, the game absolutely hitches, and stutters, and drags. It punishes you pretty severely. A death is varying degrees of unfriendly, since you're forced to respawn at the latest control point you resonated with, and that means a death translates to a walk of shame back to the terminal encounter. This sucks, it feels bad, and I don't like it.

That being said, when you're moving, and going, and resonating with the game it sorta feels like nothing else out there. I touched earlier on the simple things that the game wants you to do: shoot v. telekinetic powers, all while constantly moving. This seems to be an evolution from the simple combat cycle present in the Alan Wake games. In Alan Wake, you're shining light and following up with some blasts from your arsenal. Two types of attack, both doing separate types of damage, and you need to alternately engage each and every enemy with both. 

In Control, you're once again swapping between two separate means of attack, but the manner in which you're influenced to do so isn't quite so cut and dry. In AW, you need to dispel the shadow before doing ANY damage whatsoever with your conventional armaments. In Control, you can feasibly do real damage to any enemy with either approach, but depending on the type of enemy and whether or not they're enveloped in aural shielding the optimal form of attack will vary. It's more complicated & ambitious, but that's Control as a whole: in all respects, it pushes further than anything seen in Remedy's more junior efforts.

Another example of this heightened ambition: mobility. I mentioned already how combat has an additional layer of complexity and nuance, but this also extends to how you move about the environment. In AW, you could dodge, and you could sprint for an obnoxiously brief period of time. Jesse can not only sprint for as long as you need her to, she's also able to levitate up off the ground, thereby taking advantage of an additional dimension entirely when evading foes. This is good, since those foes that you face are far more aggressive and offensive than anything seen in AW.

All of this complements what Remedy attempts in the narrative, as the story itself takes everything seen in AW, and contextualizes it in a larger world. Events such as those Alan encountered in Bright Falls, WA are happening all the time (or at least often enough for a federal bureau to exist for monitoring and regulating). All of the recordings and documentation scattered throughout the bureau do an excellent job of committing to this world and really instilling a beating pulse that convincingly infuses the environment with all manner of paranormal chicanery.

Particularly haunting are all of the live action video recordings that you'll find throughout the experience. Threshold Kids: haunting; Casper Darling: eccentric, charming, and disturbing; Zachariah Trench: oozing melodrama & noire-infused angst. It's all delivered with authenticity and conviction in a way that gets inside your brain and demands that you accept this madness and treat these apocalyptic stakes with the gravity that they deserve. It's nuts, but it's got style, and it totally pulls it off.

Oh, one little technical gripe that I really didn't enjoy: SHUM! These are fun little arcade games that let you partake in tertiary combat challenges (just for fun). As such, (since it's just for fun) you don't get any of the Brain Points (""source"" I think?) for killing enemies in the cabinets. Fine. However, when you die, you lose the normal amount of Brain Points (which is markedly less fun). I didn't realize this when I was poking around with these at first, and I ended up losing like 60k Brain Points? Didn't need to be like that... felt like Control really abused my trust there.

By and large though, deaths in Control typically feel like they're avoidable, and the challenge is normally pretty fair. That being said, Jesse is like THE embodiment of a glass canon, and it does not take more than a single poorly laid plan to get your butt absolutely handed to you. So I died a lot. But the flip side is that you do feel super strong when you plan & play well... I'll take that trade-off any day of the week.

I've already rambled for ages, so the last thing I'll touch on are the fun set-pieces that this game throws at you. Getting through the ashtray maze is one of the coolest things I've ever experienced. Seriously. The entire game is kind of worth it for that moment alone. I know once I'm done done (still wrapping up Foundation post-game stuff now) I'm gonna go back and replay that sequence. Less impressive -- but still pretty neat -- was the film camera Altered Item cleansing. Had some cool vibes & was a neat little sequence.

All in all, I'd definitely recommend, and I'm looking forward to stepping back into Remedy's fungible world in Alan Wake 2. I can't wait to see how they continue to build off of the world that all started back in Bright Falls, 2010.",1707100960,1707100960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But if action combat doesn't get you excited this won't either. I do love force pushing everything. Its much more fun than gun play.
Anyway the game loves killing you but there is just way way way to much time spent backtracking through areas. My tolerance to dying early in a long fight and having to do it again is lower than average but not anything crazy--but this game saps any patience you have for redoing *anything*, it is constantly making you slog through something again.  Especially travel. I love exploration and these environments are fabulous but my god I have to go through this sub area *AGAIN*? I can only get back there through this route?  Its big but not open, so its painful to navigate. Even with the additional warp points added later on, its still not good enough. Places rarely if ever become relevant again they way you want, it does happen but it could have been more. 
Honestly the story and collectibles and exploration are by far the best part and you should play for that alone. The combat is the least interesting but the game is much more keyed into that. You can adjust the difficulty and it is really granular so you can 're balance' the game, and that does respond to my criticisms and many others and the fact that such a great game was probably just a tad too niche. but it becomes weird quickly, like, it does change the game!  There is so much combat, there is no way (very understandably) to reduce it so if you make it easier...its almost worse? because now its a mindless slog.
If you make a well designed game that is hard and tedious, you wont really be able to back out of that with difficulty levels slapped on at the end. There is nothing wrong with a game like that bu, you run the risk of a smaller audience, which doesnt have just financial concerns They made this great story and great environment to explore, kind a shame it would be cut off from so many people. 
Also inventory management is a chore to boot, a real pet peeve.
And what I thought was going to happen storywise was more interesting than what actually happened. What did happen was still interesting though.
Finally, the game is TERRIFYING  in a very particular way. I mean that is a massive success on their part, but if you have a wild imagination like I do you will turn some lights on when you go to bed after playing this game!! For all my critiques I have never endured so much disturbing **** because the exploration and discovery and little things are stellar and you should give it a shot.",1686933491,1707092780,True,1,0,0.522218465805053711,0,True,False,False

Combat gets very repetitive and becomes a slog, the enemy numbers are too great, and their health/armor is too high, drawing the fights out unnecessarily... 
The levitation mechanic having multiple actions bound to the same key causes many situations in which you end up doing something different than you meant to do (at least in my case), losing progress and having to do a section all over again... 
You'd think interaction with objects would be a minor thing, but it becomes a huge issue if it's something you do in the game all the time.. and the way you have to nearly hug the item for the prompt to show up, and *only then* start holding down the interact button, because if you press it down too early, you'll just sit there wondering why your character is not doing anything. I could not at all get used to that, and it made an action that should be quick and intuitive a slow, conscious effort instead.

I came back to play this game after absolutely loving Alan Wake 2. Playing this felt like going back a few pages in your science text book. AW2 is the full human body diagram, flesh, vitals, skeleton, respiratory system, you get it. Control felt like looking at just the diagram of the skeleton with the nervous system. It is all there the ground work, you feel AW2 brewing playing this. 

Controls set up of the Remedy Universe, setting, characters, MUSIC, animations nearly make it an ALL TIMER. There is a huge but though, for later. 

Jesse is one of my favourite protagonists in a long time. Stoic, sheltered, quiet and most importantly speaks only when necessary. I love and cannot commend enough, the decision, to have Jesse not talk 24/7. It is so tiring when the main playable character doesn't let the player think. The actress is so pretty and nails exactly what Remedy embodies. The animations are beautiful too, i enjoyed controlling Jesse, the way she moves with the levitation ability is so dope. Every ability Jesse uses explodes and dismantles everything around her it really emphasises her power and the way these abilities alter reality. Sound design is on drugs shit sounds so good everything punches and swooshes with such power its intoxicating. 

The story is great, alot to unpack and layered. The less you know going in the better. Had this weird bug where the game referred to Dilf Darling as Dr. Darling, strange. 

Now for the but.

This games combat is not good. All parts relating to it. Enemy design, numbers, attack patterns and damage scaling is by far the worst, nearly made me drop the game. Jesse moves great outta combat but in, damn, what a struggle. The gun play is bad, accuracy doesn't matter, damage scales weird, shots are not consistent. The incremental levelling from mods, upgrades and perks really suck too no real power growth. 

This game coulda been an all timer sadly it just falls short. Still, absolutely loved the experience. 

I will check out DLC and very keen for what Remedy is cooking next.

I picked it up during a discount, thinking it sounded like something I'd enjoy, especially since I'm a huge fan of Prey. The game's concept immediately drew me in, but it was the captivating story that truly hooked me.

Let's talk about navigation: Control doesn't hold your hand, and that's a good thing. It's one of the few games that made me actively search for where to go next. When I received objectives without clear markers, I found myself running around, relying on dialogue and way signs to figure out where I have to go. This game only shows you the area you have to go to and sometimes not even that. The game encourages exploration which leads to finding hidden locations all over the Bureau.

What sets Control apart is its dialogue. I didn't skip a single line throughout the game because every word felt purposeful and important. I even read every document I came across which I have never done before! The in-game documents felt important to the story, making me want to dive deeper into the loreeee (*Matpat's voice activates*).

I usually stop playing after completing the main story in single-player games. But Control's ending seamlessly urged me to keep going, since there was so much more to uncover. I'm still playing, even after finishing the main storyline, thanks to the seamless ending and the genuinely interesting quests I still have to finish.

For those considering Control, I highly recommend it, and don't miss out on the DLC and the Alan Wake story. This game surprised me beyond my expectations, so please, if you like scifi and aliens, treat yourself to this gem.",1706532092,1706532092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Save points can work if you either place them well enough or alternatively have an autosave kick in if the player can traverse too far in a direction where you didn't put in enough manual save points. This game apparently happily does neither, resetting you back multiple battle arenas, long traversals, multiple times. And after the 5th time or so of losing a huge amount of progress including already won(!) battles and being placed half the map multiple encounters away from the battle I actually wanted to retry, I just quit and uninstalled it.

With a battle design where it clearly wants you to retry fights in a tighter loop to practice, but the larger map layout is sometimes completely at odds with that and even worse, in wildly unpredictable ways, this doesn't work for me at all.

The  Control's story may be confusing, it works with Remedy's typical storytelling style. The game has various forms of media available to help understand the story, such as reading documents, watching TVs/projectors, and listening to audio logs.
 If there is one thing that Remedy excels at, it's creating a captivating atmosphere.
Fun gameplay, nothing complex. The physics are great, the destructible environments are some of the best I've ever seen. With some RPG elements and a character progression system, it will eventually get repetitive but not boring. The game is easy and there is no way to change the difficulty

The story is best left to be discovered on your own, but the gameplay is solid enough. My only gameplay complaint is that, on controller, there doesn't seem to be any aim assist that lessen aiming frustration of most shooters on controller.

One thing I cannot praise enough is how this game handles difficulty. The devs intended the base experience to be somewhat challenging, yet rewarding, but give you the tools to cater the game to your own tastes, or even to help out with disabilities that might hinder your experience. I didn't see anything for colorblind settings, but I also wasn't looking for it. But you can adjust things like an instant-kill-mode on your weapons, how fast your ammo regenerates, and how fast your ability energy regenerates.

One weird thing I noticed when tweaking the difficulty settings like ammo and energy regen, was that setting them to 9/10 was more beneficial than 10/10. At 9/10 they would regen instantly after my last shot or ability use, but if they were set to 10/10 they would pause for a second or two and then regen.

I only ran into 2 bugs during my playthrough of the main story, and I have yet to finish some side quests and any of the DLC content on both Xbox or Steam, so I can't speak to them yet. But the two bugs were as follows.

When trying to progress the main story after getting to the location called the ""Panopticon"" and getting to a room I was supposed to be in, the room was empty when it wasn't supposed to be, and the looking the way you came in had some game geometry missing and you could fall through the world in a way you aren't meant to. This bug is pretty well documented online and the solution that I saw and worked for me was to leave the sector, by any means, including fast travel, and then go back to that place on foot without using the Control Points as fast travel, and taking the sector elevator if need be. I went back to central executive, took the sector elevator, and finished the rest on foot. After that, everything was working as intended. Including a moment where you see friendly soldiers fighting enemies, and a flying enemy moving past a window on an elevator.

The other bug was very late in the game when you have to find the Janitor right after the game tells you to go to a maze. You take a long cable-car right past a huge chasm and a cutscene plays. But what's supposed to happen is a Control Point for fast traveling out of this zone, which is the only way out, didn't seem to spawn. (Or I missed it, but others have reported it not spawning at first.) Having forgotten about it, I took the cable car back over the chasm, which is annoyingly slow, I fought some enemies and realized like others have, that there wasn't a way to exit the area. I googled it and saw others say the workaround was to do what I had done and take the cable car away from the chasm, back to where you first entered the area, then ride it all the way back to the exit again, and then then Control Point was visible to me, and I was able to leave the area.

I don't have much hope the devs will come back to fix these bugs, but those are the solutions that worked for me. The first one in the panopticon wasn't fix by restarting the game, and I didn't even try to restart during the second bug. Hopefully that helps anyone else who picks up this game and gets stuck in the same bugs.

Other than that, the game is absolutely fantastic. You can even turn the game into a pure power fantasy if you'd like. No one will stop you.",1706255710,1706255710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My Review   =  5 / 10

In my personal opinion, this game was not at the required level, as it lacked the story, music, multiple maps, and characters, but the only beautiful thing in the game Control is the fighting style and the skills were wonderful.

My first playthrough of the game was back in 2019, when I had to buy it through the Epic Game Store due to its one-year exclusivity, but I loved it at the time, and now that I've finished Alan Wake 2 a few weeks ago, I've gone back to replay the story.

Still a blast. I love the story, I love the characters, I love the gameplay. 

What they have done with the gameplay is outstanding, they could easily make a Star Wars game where you play a character who uses the force, or a superhero game and I am pretty sure they would not mess it up ;)
Jesse's abilities are so well implemented and super fun to use and play around with. 

The intro sequence pretty much sums up the story of the game when you hear Jesse say ""This is gonna be weirder than usual"". 

The graphics and level of environmental destruction are still amazing. 

BUT the best thing about this game is that it brought back Alan Wake and created the first part of Remedy's Connected Universe!

+ Jessi Faden <3 

I hope they release Alan Wake 2 on Steam too, and I hope this developer gets more attention and more sales, because I think if anyone deserves it, it's definitely these outstanding developers from Finland :)

There is A LOT of notes you can pick up which can either supplement your current mission with extra info, or expand on the lore of the FBC (Federal Bureau of Control). Personally, I find that I get sucked into these little info dumps, almost to a fault. There are so many, that players like me wind up spending a decent chunk of play time reading through them.

I would binge, if it was a real show, Address Unknown. Control has some of that to give. It's a great kind of weird. Lore items you can pick up in games rarely catches my interest, but Control made me want to collect most of the scraps, read them, and think. When the climax started however I wanted to see how it ended so they became something I ignored. In the end I on a couple points unclear. The voice acting, dialog, facial expressions, etc. are nevertheless fantastic, and almost nothing killed my immersion. 

Graphically the game's a feast. I have an excellent GPU, but my RAM and CPU are outdated. I could turn up most of the graphics, but not everything. In the end, I let the game decide what's best for my computer, and I was still entertained. Every area I went to made me stop and appreciate the design, lighting, and textures.

Like Max Payne, this is a weirdo game that happens to have excellent combat. The gameplay is responsive, and your telekinetic abilities are intuitive. Plus, when you yank something before throwing it at an enemy, the sound it makes is perfect. Once you get the hang of the combat, you really feel like some kind of X-Files bad ass. My favorite ability is being able to levitate. As soon as I got it, I dumped all my upgrade points into it so I could hover around the battlefield and pick my targets strategically.

Fundamentally the gameplay is a pleasure, but there are a few aspects of it that can be frustrating. The main issue seems to be in order to recover health you need to be near the health pickups dropped by enemies. Maybe they're doing what Doom 2016 does and encourage aggressive gameplay because in order to get the health, you need to push forward. However, in this game pushing forward can be a mistake because you'll end up in the midst of things that have no problem killing you, plus you'll be disoriented, partially thanks to the chrome gas effect enemies leave behind. I'll give the ""gas"" a pass because it looks cool, but it seems to obscure your vision more than it should. Another frustrating thing is enemy placement. There were 2-3 areas where enemy placement created these ""What the fuck is happening?"" moments. Fortunately, I didn't need to reload many times because if something was too hard, I'd just turn on immortality in the options. Yep, the game has a built-in cheat menu.

Some of the enemies seem like damage sponges. Enemies I needed to eliminate quickest just wouldn't die. In retrospect it seems like this is because I didn't do many side quests because I wanted to see how the story played out.

In terms of navigating the world it may surprise you how open it is. Generally, you can get from one objective to the next without any issues, but I went in the wrong direction a few times. The map didn't help. Every time I got lost it was because there was a door in front of me but it didn't make sense to go through that door. Some of the connective traversal doesn't make sense to me. 

I only heard of this game because I caught it online somewhere unintentionally. I think this will end up a cult classic because it's not like they put in extreme efforts to advertise it, plus I think normal people will find it too weird to get into. In an era of AAA puke, this game practically caters to my specific interests.

Update: Computer upgrades of the significant variety blessed me with the ability to re-enter Control and make a mess. I'm still using my GeForce RTX 3060 (12gb of vram), but I wasn't able to make full use of it thanks to a motherboard that got old. A grannyboard. Chip shortages are such that it sounds painful to upgrade to a GPU that's truly cutting edge. Maximum settings are nevertheless now an option. It seems my bottleneck was the CPU, so look to that if your computer struggles.

Health upgrades were something I initially passed up. A mistake. Invest early because endgame enemies will destroy you.",1675046546,1705526843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like gunplay isn't bad, clicking heads while juggling forklifts is inarguably fun, but the lite looter shooter element and level-scaled enemy was utterly retarded and unnecessary.

It goes same for the non-gameplay aspect too, atmosphere, theme and visual of Control is extremely good and unique, but the writing felt like it was written by a pretentious chimpanzee, and it was so bad to a point it completely ruined what it was going for with its unique setting. What's worse is that they try to get you invested in its story by making everything seemingly meaningful and vague at the start, yet as the game slowly unravels itself you'd realize that the plot is paper thin, and the game is plastered with unbearable amount of cringe dialogues.

I rated it as positive but I would rate it as mixed if I could, I think I would've enjoyed the game more if I just turned off my brain and just play the game for its combat and ignored all the dialogues, I mean the game is kind of unique in a way that it does some things extremely well and other things extremely bad, but despite this the game still ended up feeling like a mediocre forgettable AAA schlock for me due to bad part being so bad that it completely fucked over the good part, I'd probably forget I played this game in few weeks.

Overall the game is fun to play and has a very enriching story. It slightly parodies SCP, and in that I think this could be considered one of the first big budget SCP games. Now here are a few problems I personally had with the game. I would say I have a good understanding of this game considering I beat all 10 main missions but also all 18 side missions while I haven't gotten every achievement I have played all the story the game has to offer.

Here are a few critiques I had while playing
- Easy to get lost
It's a very big map, and the objectives are mere vague approximations of where you're supposed to go
- Too Punishing
When you die you will re-spawn at a checkpoint rather than just re-spawning you back in the room where you just were, dying became such an inevitability for me that I eventually turned on the immortality mode during the last few missions in the story just to get through it
- Buggy
I encountered about 6 bugs throughout my play-through one prevented me from entering the room I died in, because of the before mentioned checkpoint system, this did not deter me but it was very frustrating",1705430365,1705430365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good times), but none of that can redeem the game from the sin of an ultra-fragile protagonist and a complete lack of an effective cover system. I've seen 16-bit protagonists that had more durability than this girl.

Furthermore, the in-game challenges are so specific (e.g. Kill ONE enemy type, in only ONE area of the world map, in ONE specific manner (headshot, their own projectiles, etc), with ONE specific weapon, ten times) that you'd sooner find an example of honest journalism before you found consecutive opportunities to notch up a tally. And, when you finally manage to complete the challenge, you're rewarded with a common-tier weapon or armour mod that is surely eclipsed by other drops you've managed to acquire in the meantime just doing the main story missions.

I'm not finished the game yet. I DO intend to finish it. I just hope that by the time I DO finish it, I find it worth the time and energy I put in to it. The moments of aggravation so far outnumber the moments of fun.

Update: January 12, 2024.

After playing through Alan Wake 1 and Alan Wake's American Nightmare, I wanted to give this game another try because it is part of the Remedy Connected Universe. Unfortunately, every criticism I had of the game earlier still holds true today, particularly the problem of the player character, even with fully upgraded HP and stat modifiers increasing it further, is as durable as a wet piece of paper. 

The game includes something called an ""assist mode,"" which is disabled by default. Before enabling it, a message pops up that says something along the lines of ""the game was designed to be both challenging, and rewarding."" Challenging it certainly is, but rewarding? No. Not in the slightest. I don't feel rewarded at all for having overcome a difficult challenge. Rather, I feel relieved that I never have to do it again. Remedy completely, utterly failed to deliver on their intention of a rewarding experience.

This game is fucking awful. Remedy should be ashamed of themselves. If you feel that you must play the game for the sake of the Remedy Connected Universe, as I do, do not buy this game unless it is on a 75% discount or higher, because it is absolutely not worth more than that.",1650953560,1705323173,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- still pretty demanding if you want to play with everything maxed out and ray tracing. With a 7900 XTX on 1440p I usually got between 70 and 80 fps. Some areas, at least at the beginning, gave me huge frame drops down to the 40s.
- maximum ray tracing crashed my game several times.
- though the story is good, I felt a little bit disappointed after the ending. Somehow I hoped for a bit more but maybe the DLC deliver on that. Or maybe it's just the sadness of the main game already being over after 32 hours (including the ""Mold DLC"" and all side quests).

2/10






Control was a sad experience for me. I was very excited to play it, which quickly turned to disappointment. The game attempts so many different interesting ideas and fails to follow through on any of them. 

It attempts horror and its aesthetics are rooted in the psychological horror genre but it fails to ever be scary for more than a second.

It attempts to be a third person shooter but the gun-play is so simplistic and boring that i hardly ever want to use the gun.

It attempts to be cinematic but nearly all of the in game performances are horrible with the exception of the live action sections, the same actors will flip between an Oscar winning performance and an unbearable cringe-fest when moving from live action to in-game. Although the writing is more to blame for that than anything. On top of that nearly all the set pieces in the game are indistinguishable gray rooms that offer nothing to the player in the way of exploration. It doesn't matter if it fits your game's concept when it completely destroys any potential the game's environment had to be interesting. 

The story; albeit interesting in places, becomes incredibly boring when you don't introduce or develop any of the characters properly. Jesse Faden is a non-character, she is never introduced in an interesting way and as a result her character arc and by extension the entirety of the main story is thoroughly uninteresting. The only parts of the story that had any life to them were the appearances of Dr.Darling and Trench, but goddamn those get stale after a while, you can't hold the weight of an entire game on the back of random expositional cutscenes.

The only joy i consistently got from this experience was the combat, which is simultaneously the worst part of the entire game. There are probably around 8-12 types of enemy, none of which are ever used in an interesting way or really add anything to the experience. They have an intro section and will then be spawned in with the rest of the fodder. The designs barely vary at all and you can hardly tell them apart. 

The power's are fun to use but the entirety of the enjoyment i felt from this game was hinged on exposition dump cutscenes and the E button. I personally would've said this game shouldn't have been a shooter at all, the experience would've greatly benefited from committing to a horror game angle with all the creepy potential its concept has.

Don't buy this game, There's better games even for the $10 it's usually on sale for.

This is by far, by FAR, one of the best games I have played, and I’ve been playing for 35 years. The environment evokes menace, the unknown, and you feel every second of trepidation as you walk through an aria to Brutalist Monolithic Government from 1946 to the present. The fact that the Bureau of Control is hamstrung by its own alien power, stuck in the late 70s, early 80s window of technology only adds to the perfect ambience. You are alone here, your mission private even as you happen to enter in a crisis and are suddenly catapulted into a potential apocalypse. The offices are empty, files discarded, lights blinking restlessly in the gloom. 
Until the game gives you exactly what anyone would want in the face of utter disaster. Pure power. If you haven’t seen any trailers or gameplay, I won’t spoil the mechanics themselves, but the PhysiX engine is genius. Enemies racing at you across the marble floors? Sure, you can shoot them. But why not rip concrete from its mooring and hurl it at high speeds instead? 
I rarely encounter a game where I want that delirious Completionist tag, but this one begs to be savored, replayed, every door opened and every chest looted.
A colleague of mine wrote in his review that the story was the weakest link in this gorgeous and technically pleasurable adventure, but I disagree. The story has amplitude and depth, it asks you to examine the humanity as well as the cruelty of Power, and the actress they chose for Jesse brings ambivalence, mistrust, and honesty in her performance of the protagonist. I love her, I identify with her, her peculiarities and her commonalities both. Instead of spending too much time in her past or the evolution of the Bureau or allowing a reckless amount of sandbox dithering with side quests, Control gives you a taut mission with clear urgency. The plot develops as you are pushed into moments of decision, even if you as a player would like to RPG her more, I found it refreshing that she isn’t that mutable. She is herself. Control is self-contained, and the pacing is excellent.

The combat is fast and fun. The puzzles never became annoyingly obtuse. The only criticism I have is the timed side missions that pop up periodically. For me, this always happened in no clear proximity to the fast travel points. It was a slog to redirect my energy to somewhere else in the building and often I was overwhelmed on arrival or personnel walked directly into the path of explosive enemies, terminating the mission early.

They can be cool and well-written, but they are usually secondary to the gameplay. This is a game that really sucked me in and made me want to explore and learn more about everything I could. I found the story to be very compelling, and while virtually every collectible has redacted text, it fits the theme perfectly. I definitely walked away wanting to know more, both about what happens next and how things got to be the way they are. I've never played Alan Wake, but the crossover between this game and that one was really interesting, and has made me add those games to my list as well. 

The combat is generally very good. I've read some complaints that your weapons don't do very much damage and that the throw power is overpowered, but I found that I had the most success when I used them together. Certain enemies have certain patterns and weaknesses, and once you learn those, you can feel very strong. I will say, however, that the shotgun weapon always felt weak to me and was easily the weapon I used the least. There were a few times where I felt frustrated by the combat, but after 60 hours, those times were pretty few and far between.

What stands out is a fantastic, fast-paced yet smooth and manageable action. It picks up slowly, but with every new power Jessie gets, it becomes more interesting, but still intuitive. Controls are easy to grasp but difficult to master all at the same time. You can launch all the office equipment at enemies with incredible speed, but then summon them from afar and hit enemies in the back on the way and kill them. Stop their rockets mid air and launch them back at foes, then use their dead bodies as projectiles as well. Finally, some enemy bodies explode after death. Then, fly up and take some headhsots while looking for a new cover.
The only way to heal is to pick  up drops from enemies, which encourages rushing into close combat rather than camping from afar. It's always risky, but this makes the combat very quick and dynamic.

But, the combat is not everything. What Control offers but many reviews omit are the puzzles. While the main story is short, there are many optional missions which often involve creative thinking. Player is left with little clues on how to proceed and needs to figure it out on their own. The puzzles show great variety and often require thinking out of the box.

Control is a semi-open world game, as you progress through a few large maps and unlock new areas with main and side missions. There are also timed missions and endgame challenge accessible by unassuming Jukebox, which grants extra rewards. Revisiting previously cleared places is interesting, as new hidden spots open up with extra abilities and keycards. Certainly it does have replay value and it's rewarding for completionists.

Also, graphics. Environment destruction is spectacular and Control makes great use of raytracing. Throwing running movie projector through the dark room full of enemies is just something you need to see. I already recommend to install mods that tweak the engine to show the best of what game has to offer. By default it is somewhat gray and blurred. I get that was the design choice to create this dreamy and liminal atmosphere, but going full ray tracing is just better. That is, if you have the powerful gear to handle it. With my RTX 4080 I still get less than 50 frames with max settings and native 4K. But, if you read this review sometime in the future, Control will surely make a good use of a rig that does not exist at the time of writing.

A troubled young woman in search of her brother fails upwards, becoming the highest ranking official of a secretive government agency with a devious past.

Bugs:

Overall, it's a well-polished game at this point, so you shouldn't have any issues playing it (so long as you have a system that can handle it). However, I do remember a time when it was fairly buggy and had some pretty serious issues with enemies being invulnerable for no reason or getting stuck inside the environment, which often forced players to exit the game and restart it just to progress. That's all in the past, though, and it isn't present at all in the game's present, finished state.

You shouldn't have any significant issues, aside from the rare game crashing because you didn't let it fully load before trying to play.

Narrative:

This is one of those rare narrative-heavy third-person shooters where the game-play itself is also highly addictive. Granted, I'm not a big fan of the TPS in general, so it takes a lot to really impress me. Still, for some reason, I find myself giving them a shot anyways. And I think that's almost exclusively thanks to Remedy's tendency of always scratching that itch in just the right way.

They are masters of world-building, with their attention to detail and their masterful character writing. None of the characters you meet are ever just one thing: good or bad, hero or villain, friend or foe. They practically all exist in the shades of grey where reality meets fiction, and it's wonderful. Even the characters who, at first glance, seem to only have one character trait, always show some sort of depth as you get to know them. And the world around them might be crazy and nonsensical, but there's also a sense of unseen order to the chaos, if you know to look for the little synchronicities. 

Each document and audio log you pick up has implications that reach beyond itself, which fills the world with even more intrigue. Where most games have a simple bestiary or logbook for the things the character encounters, this game has fairly detailed (if sometimes somewhat redacted) records of just about everything you encounter in the world. In fact, if you're willing to take the time to read everything you pick up, you'll find yourself understanding the origins of almost every strange occurrence that Jesse encounters.

All of that may not be your cup of tea, but personally, I'm a sucker for this flavor of world-building. If a game is interesting enough to make me sit in the menus, reading text documents for hours on end, I consider it an excellently written game.

Combat / Game-play:

Now, if you're the type of person who doesn't care about the lore, or if you're too impatient to read hundreds of documents, that's okay too! That's far from all this game has to offer.

The combat is also fun, and the customizatability is pretty intuitive. You've got personal mods and weapon mods, all of which have 6 tiers of rarity (aside from the unique mods, which I'd highly recommend searching for because they are indispensable when the difficulty curve takes a sharp turn upwards). These mods allow the player to finely tune their abilities, health, stamina, etc. to their own needs/play-style. It's easily the most intricate upgrading system I've seen in a game of this type. And if all you're after is a power fantasy, well, it'll take some work on your part, but you'll get there. By the end, it's really only the bosses that pose any threat to you, if you've put a little time into optimizing your mods.

Again, I'm not big on third-person games, so my opinion as far as the shooting isn't the most reliable. Still, I'd say the gun fights in this game are more competent than average for this genre. Not only do you have a myriad of god-like powers, allowing you to dominate the battle, but you also have a fair arsenal of weapons, all of which have a good degree of customization. The weapons may feel a little weaker than they reasonably should, considering they aren't ordinary kinetic firearms, but they definitely aren't the worst I've seen. My only real complaint with the combat is that the player can only carry two weapons ( [i]modes[i] or [i]forms[i] ) at any given time. I get that that's become sort of a trademark for the modern shooter, but it doesn't make much sense in this instance. Each weapon type is just a different mode of the same weapon. No, not an attachment or augment. It's literally just a different form that the weapon is capable of switching to. So, logically, it should be capable of switching between all of them at any time. A weapon wheel seems fitting here, but there's no such luck. And sure, you can switch out the forms at any time, even during combat, but it's not as intuitive as it could be. Aside from that, though, the combat flows well and is reasonably entertaining, if not a bit repetitive. 

Overall:

I can't recommend this game enough. It was my GOTY the year it released, and it's still one of my favorites. Whether you like story-rich games or your average power fantasy game, this should appeal to you in some way. I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to fly, brainwash people, and throw enemies around like they're ragdolls?",1704978983,1704978983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything in this game just kinda exists. Everything is aggressively mid. Very few high points and quite a few low points. Here are my biggest issues:


1) 
 This game is about other worldly powers and items that can bend and warp reality it's self. And yet the game does so little with this. Almost everything is normal looking. A couple of noticeable moments will make you say ""Wow, that's a cool effect!"". Sadly in the same breath you will also say ""I wish more of the game did that kind of stuff"".  

2)
 I find the combat to be very loose and unbalanced. 

The gun feels so bad to shoot. It's dmg compared to the throw ability is a joke; and why cant I reload? Cool down reloading is much less engaging than actively reloading. Combined with the gun damage being so low you regularly empty your magazine and have to sit around just doing nothing and waiting.
At the same time the throw ability is way over-tuned. Its nearly one shots everything. Two shots everything except heavies. But then they have enemies that doge your throws. Trying to get you to use the gun. But the gun is so bad that its still usually better to use throw and just hope you get a lucky hit.

Meanwhile your HP will randomly disappear. Sometimes you feel invincible then all of your heath is just gone. Leaving you saying ""What even hit me!?""

3)
  You will get lost at some point and you will have no idea how to get to where you trying to go. It's not fun. First off putting every floor of an area on one map makes the map nearly unusable. Annoyingly the map issue goes hand in hand with the lack of direction. Smarter games hint you in the right direction without full on holding your hand. This is not a smarter game. Many story progression paths are easily missable and will cause you to run around in circles until you happen to see it.  
To be fair the DLC addresses this, it marks those easily missable paths with yellow tarps. Good on the devs for seeing and addressing it. Sadly this issue remains in the base game.  

On a positive note I do want to shout out the 2nd to final mission. Its super cool. Everything finally comes together. Your at the top of your game combat wise. The game finally utilizes some interesting and unique visuals. And to top it off an uncharacteristically awesome song plays during this segment. Its awesome! It must have been the vertical slice that sold the game internally. Sadly that section is three times better than the rest of the game. 

Again, 7/10 game overall, just really frustrating sticking points and not enough high points to balance it out.",1704921368,1704938434,False,1,2,0.495436757802963257,0,True,False,False

While other games like this encourage exploration, Control is filled with some very frustrating combat difficulty, and wave after wave after wave after wave after wave after wave of enemies that constantly spawn, usually the most inappropriate times, eg like right after a boss, or interesting discovery. 

I know quite alot people who simply got frustrated and never bothered to finish the game, so forget the average sales, im sure alot of people never get to fully experience and explore the amazing environments plus story that is on show here.

Even with the added difficulty options that came ages after launch, it is still hard to fine tune as the only option to change enemy damage is 1 shot kills all rather than something more progressive.

For one, there is A LOT of reading. A bit too much in my opinion. Not only that, it is mostly written in bureaucratic language with redactions. I mean it makes sense because it takes place in a Federal setting. For someone like me who strives to get all reading material and collectibles, it became exhausting. Many of those readables could've been audio recordings from the NPCs in-game, which would've also helped their character development. Let me hear the story through recordings as I navigate. Even the audio recordings in this game make you just stand there until they finish. They break the immersion of organically learning the lore and plot as you navigate.

2nd, the navigation. I can tell they wanted you to play this game by looking at signs in a building and navigating organically, but it still needed a map and the map is absolute dog crap. Seriously, I have not seen a worse map for a game, let alone a modern game.

The story and plot is exactly what I love. It felt like I was playing an SCP Foundation game, but it felt similar to what I felt with Alan Wake 10 years ago, even though I did finish that as well. Something just felt off. I'm excited to play Alan Wake 2 when I can, but I feel Remedy doesn't know how to properly balance their narrative with the actual gaming experience.

The combat was the final nail in the coffin for me. The skill trees are generic, the enemies just randomly pop out of nowhere, and the controller aiming is HORRIBLE. I have NO idea how that got past QA. It feels like an early 2000s game when no Aim Assist existed (most of the time). This game claims to have it, but it DOES NOT feel like it. Also, you pick up the same mods over and over and you constantly have to go into your inventory and dismantle duplicates and lower ranks. There was no auto-dismantle feature. It is like that throughout the whole game even into the expansions.

Progression and Combat System:
The combat system is interesting with many abilities or weapons allowing you a diverse array of options on how to approach combat. Each ability can be used aggressively or defensively or however you want to meet your play style. Nothing in the game felt like a carbon copy of another game which feels common in many games. The combat felt unique and truly enjoyable. As you progress through the game, you add more abilities and weapons to your arsenal. Yet, no matter how powerful you become, the stakes still feel high. At no point in the game did it feel like it was necessary to grind for resources or to level up my character. I felt I could handle any stage of the game purely through natural progression and with skill alone. This is a mark of a good progression system in my opinion.

Story:
The developers have constructed a compelling story which pulls you in and keeps you guessing. I find it rare that I cannot predict what will happen next as so many games are predictable now-a-days. I was on the edge of my seat the entire play through. I found the world building so fascinating, I read every bit of lore hidden among the files and little secrets scattered throughout the maps.

In the vast landscape of gaming, ""Control"" emerges as a diamond in the rough, deserving far more attention for its ambitious graphical endeavors and a narrative that harks back to the golden days of horror action games like ""F.E.A.R"" or ""Silent Hill."" This is not just a game; it's an immersive journey, where otherworldly psychic abilities meet environmental destruction in a gripping storyline, making it an absolute must-grab for its price.

Graphically, ""Control"" stands as a testament to what is possible in the gaming realm. The visual design is a meticulous blend of surreal architecture and mind-bending environments that draw players into a world that defies traditional norms. The attention to detail, from the smallest ambient lighting to the grandiosity of shifting reality, elevates the game to a level where every frame feels like a carefully crafted piece of digital art.

The narrative of ""Control"" serves as a nostalgic nod to the heydays of psychological horror action games. The echoes of ""F.E.A.R"" and ""Silent Hill"" are unmistakable, creating an atmosphere thick with tension, mystery, and a constant sense of foreboding. The storyline weaves an intricate web that not only captures the imagination but also propels players through a series of twists and turns that keep them on the edge of their seats.

The protagonist's possession of otherworldly psychic abilities adds an exhilarating layer to the gameplay. The environmental destruction, fueled by these powers, is not just a visual spectacle but an integral part of the player's toolkit. The seamless integration of supernatural abilities with a meticulously crafted game world ensures that every encounter becomes an opportunity for creative and dynamic engagement.

For the price it commands, ""Control"" is an absolute steal. The depth of its narrative, the innovation in gameplay mechanics, and the sheer beauty of its graphical presentation make it a must-have for any gaming enthusiast. This isn't just a game to be played; it's an experience to be savored, an odyssey through the unknown that lingers long after the credits roll. ""Control"" demands recognition, not just for what it attempts graphically, but for the immersive and unforgettable journey it offers to those who dare to explore its twisted corridors.",1704662082,1704662082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I found the difficulty in this game too high. I lost enjoyment finishing the main game as I was grinding away to repeat the final section multiple times, which had no real upside. I then explored the DLC. This is the first time in years I had to enable cheats to get through. At one point I effectively had almost infinite health on and was still struggling to see things through, which is a bit bonkers. Perhaps if I had gotten 100% on all the unlockable things before attempting the DLC this wouldn't be an issue. I would actually recommend playing the game using some of the damage and health modifiers (in the game play menu) from more or less the outset so you can enjoy it more, and follow an online guide on which side missions to do to unlock abilities, as they are really required.

As far as the open world, genre adventure game goes, this sits comfortably at the top so I'd call it a must play for fans of that type of game. It finds this unique combination of unsettling vibes, and pure action. It gives a fun vibe, and somehow doesn't break the feeling of horror. To elaborate without spoilers, this is like a superhero game, set in a world that is thrilling & scary when you're learning mechanics, and then beautiful, dark, and engaging when you know the mechanics. I was with the story all the way through.

Story and lore are actually interesting. Usually when a game has very very good action, I gravitate towards that aspect and skip tedious story parts to get back to the action or whatever. This game provides a really immersive sci fi, supernatural setting that won't feel like it's a speed bump between all the pew pew. I would have a hard time coming up with a game that strikes such a balance. I would be doing one thing, like absorbing story information, and be both excited to continue onto the action, but also excited to keep listening. Perhaps it's up to personal preference though. I will say, I've seen the X files comparison and while I'd agree, I was bored by the show as a kid. This game provides similar mysteries, but then also attempts to explain the logic behind them. Some people prefer mysteries to stay mysteries but I think most people would enjoy the shit out of the lore in this game.

Action is great, I try to tell my friends that this is a really fast paced action game and gameplay is smooth, but I can't figure out a way to word exactly how enjoyable it is to play. All I can say here is it's very enjoyable. Mechanics make sense, bugs feel non existent, and when you fail it never feels like the game's fault.

Conclusion - I loved it. I want other people to play it. It falls in the same category for me as Horizon and TLOU, where I wanna spread it like the gospel. It's great game development practice, and the love shows.",1641075850,1704258409,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I mostly played through Control to say that I did as this was the only Remedy game that I hadn't finished, and so I could go through the main story and the included AWE DLC to catch the missing Alan Wake 2 details before my second play through of that. The main story progresses pretty slow and it didn't really make any sense to me, maybe I just wasn't high enough or something. It really didn't hook me at all, and I found it really hard to keep playing in the later chapters. I blasted through the main story line and the one AWE DLC only, and couldn't be bothered to finish the rest of the side missions. That along with the difficulty, the re-spawning 20 minutes back from where you died, the confusing map and the way that it forces you take the long way around every time to get to anywhere, and the very repetitive nature of the combat all were big reasons for my dislike. The cool-guy levitating and throwing mechanics that make up a huge part of combat were interesting and fun for the first couple hours, but quickly became really stale.. The game is very pretty, especially with the settings cranked and ray-tracing on, but somewhat enjoyable combat (at first), and good graphics aren't enough of a reason to play the game. I suppose that I can kind of get why this game might be enjoyable for some people, but I really don't see why it gets the crazy amount of hype that it does. So overall, if you're in it to get missing details to complete the Alan Wake story like I was, honestly just look up a play through or a compilation of the specific cut scenes on Youtube.

Control is a great game. I can recommend it at full price. The world-building, setting, and gameplay are wholly unique and engrossing.

However the game doesn’t quite stick the landing. The ending chapters tidy up the plot way too fast. Despite the fact that these final sequences overflow with style, ultimately very little happens.

There is a fake out ending that was mildly amusing. The actual ending is less so, and it only happens minutes later (if ur good at the game lol) 

Basically, the plot resolves in a cutscene.

While post game content is plentiful and helps expand just enough to not leave you with a bad impression of the game, I really wish the story remained interesting all the way through.

Every complex is different and spooky and many times the awkward places will make you feel uncomfortable and yet so mysterious and interesting you want to go deeper inside and see what happens next. Shaders are crazy, effects blow you away and the ingame graph cutscenes look so realistic in many times that it often feels like you're sitting in a cinema with a controller in your hands. WIth or without rtx it's gorgeous. Dls keeps your frame nice if you don't own a rtx 3080 or 90 so you still can fully enjoy the rtx effects.

Gameplay feels like... later in game when you get the power to jump really high... I'm an adult and I played lots of games in my life since long time... I never ducked when guys shot at me and I never moved to left and right in racing titles.. but here. You almost feel the impact when you hit the ground again! And when I jumped I often moved my body up instinctively. Just want to tell you fellaz: gameplay is and feels damn good. I played it with m&k btw and it worked fine for me. Some bosses will kick your ass hehe...

The story is dope! It's tight and kinda scary.. reminds me on the akte x series.. You always expect something bad to happen. And theres mostly no reason to do something else. You start with 0.. absolutely no clue whats happening. It's like being a trainee in a company you never heard off and the more you stay there and uncover the more ridiculous it gets. I won't spoiler and I recommend you to not check out to much stuff about it. It's different, well written and you'll have several encounters with characters and thats pouring lots of life into this title.

Mfw I have to clear another group of enemies and my inventory gets clogged with shitty mods I'll never use.

Paying anymore then the 10 bucks at sales is criminal. The gameplay is alright, the camera and abilities are clunky at some points but the powers are still fun despite how they work sometimes. 

Story and the hiss is like a worse written antimemetics division. And the textures have just not been working at all for me. They're always blurry, raytracing doesn't do much apart from drop your frames, sings like an average 3rd person shooter we've had for years in every sense other then the powers. This game came out in a year with many many weak samey games and strong ones. It just has that 2019 not next gen next gen stink to it. I can't describe it.

The old house is cool but the map feels kinda small and cramped for an endless labyrinth that stretches time. 

Also red = scary 

5.5/10 just average. I'd play Control 2 if they could improve in its weak aspects.

If you got this game through Humble Bundle, **YOU DO NOT HAVE THE DLC.** Currently the only way to get the game up to date, with the DLC included, is to permanently remove the game from your account and re-purchase the game on Steam. It's not ideal, but it works, even if you've already played through the base game.
**END OF PSA**

With all of that out of the way, this game is solid. It fully commits to everything it does, and it has a truly unmatched aesthetic. The world established here is fascinating and anyone who enjoys X-Files, SCP, Fringe, etc. will feel right at home.

Gameplay feels crunchy and tactile, though by the end (especially if you try to do all the things) it does start to feel a little samey with the enemy types on offer (again, without the DLC). With the graphics and raytracing cranked, it's pretty mesmerizing to look at. I really appreciate how many UI tweaks there are in the settings; for a while I didn't even play with a reticle, but chose to turn it on once the difficulty started ramping.

+ ExtraOrdinary (pun intended) visual design and brutalism architecture, which really gives you the urge to discover new sectors. It looks truly beautiful and realistic, especially with ray tracing. The Bureau is incredibly large and full of contents and details, with Metroidvania style gating: areas are unlocked by progressing missions and getting new abilities (dashing and levitation, which make exploring and traversing areas particularly fun).
+ Collectibles which offer a large amount of fascinating lore in the form of SCP-like reports, correspondences, and audio/video logs, providing even more reasons to explore every nook and cranny of the Bureau and to leave no document unfound.
+ Unlike usual 3A titles, there are very few paddings. Most game elements contribute to the narrative, naturally told by a suitable mix of environmental storytelling, NPC dialogues, main and side missions, and collectibles.
+ Stylish and fluidly animated combat using various weapons and paranatural abilities ([spoiler]telekinesis, mind control, energy shield, etc[/spoiler]) in procedurally destructible environments. Launching various ordinary objects lying around the Bureau to smash enemies never gets old for me.

Inevitably, there are some negative sides, most easily remediable but still worth mentioning for potential players:
- There is no marker for backtracking to places unlocked by your new ability or clearance level, which makes finding those hundreds of lore-rich collectibles even more difficult. A guide such as [url=https://www.neoseeker.com/control/walkthrough]this one[/url] is strongly recommended in order not to miss any hidden locations or collectibles.
- The 2D map can be quite unhelpful to navigating in a 3D space. It even shows secret paths you cannot unlock yet, which causes many confusions.
- Missions have no hand-holding or whatsoever: they just point you to a section of an area, without telling you exactly where or what to look for. In general, this fits extremely well the weird and mysterious atmosphere, which prompts you to sniff around everywhere and to stumble upon the right place. However, sometimes you run into obstacles you do not know that you cannot pass yet; a few object-finding side missions can be difficult due to the lack of explicit guidance. Again, a guide can be your best friend in those situations.
- Finally, the combat system loses its appeal quickly for many reasons: The crafting system with materials from loot-boxes and enemies droppings is cumbersome and adds little to the experience; Restricting number of mods or fast switching only to between two weapons is meaningless since at any moment (even in-combat), you can change your weapon layouts with the in-game menu; Boss fights have huge difficult spikes; Dying costs you 10% of resources and respawns you after a looooooong loading screen to the last visited fast-travel point which could be a distance away from where you die. On the other hand, the game considerately offers an assist mode, which has options such as ammo/energy refill speed-up, damage reduction, aiming assist or even auto-locking, one-shot kill, invincibility, etc. In other words, you can adjust the gameplay difficulty to whatever suits your play style. In particular, those who are not particularly into third-person shooting in the first place can now fully focus on the story and world of the game.

Tl;dr: In terms of visual art, architecture, details, and lore, Control has the most well-crafted and curiosity-inducing world I have ever seen in a video game, even surpassing those in the Bioshock series. You could see this [url=https://noescapevg.com/review-control-is-a-stylish-horror-action-game-that-preys-on-our-fears-and-fascinations-with-the-unknown/]review[/url] for more details on this aspect. I believe you would not regret visiting this world consisting of a surreal blend of both mundane and paranatural objects and events. Just do not expect everything to be neatly wrapped up and explained.

Control, released in 2019, is a gaming masterpiece that engulfs players in a unique and atmospheric experience. From the captivating narrative to the stellar graphics enhanced by delightful ray tracing, it's a journey that sticks with you.

While the gameplay takes a bit of time to unlock its full potential, the investment pays off as skills unfold, making the overall experience incredibly smooth. Personally, I found the game even more immersive when played with a controller rather than the a mouse and keyboard setup.

Having completed Control to 100% on both PS4 and PS5, it's safe to say the game's magic translates seamlessly across platforms. The DLC, seamlessly integrated into the Steam version, adds depth and excitement to an already stellar narrative, providing a continuation that feels just as compelling.

In terms of visuals, Control is a visual treat, especially with the addition of ray tracing. The subtle details and lighting effects contribute to the game's overall allure, creating an environment that feels both surreal and tangible.

In summary, Control is a must-play for those who appreciate a rich narrative, stunning visuals, and a gameplay experience that evolves into something truly exceptional. Whether you're a fan of the original release or exploring the game's expanded universe through DLC, Control offers an unforgettable journey into the unseen.",1704107421,1704107421,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False
870780,154944232,76561198012958199,0,97,662,0,662,1704075262,"Just now played through this game, so thoughts are a bit late but I have a lot of them. TL;DR: Buy on sale.

Control is a mixed bag. It tries to blend some new ideas with an otherwise safe gameplay experience. The little ""shimmers"" it has of doing something new are either done too much, or far too little.

The story goes into being as weird as possible early in the intro. There's a spectrum between, ""Weird because the game story requires it"" and ""Weird just to be weird"". When there's no player involvement and no ramp up to how strange the game wants to portray itself, it falls far more to the latter. Sure it's weird, but why do I care? 

Lighting/environment effects are overkill. I played on max settings & raytracing at 1440p, and I assure you that there are no government building in the entire world who's lights function on Dolby Vision's characteristics. The lighting is cool but wears off at some point. Same with visual projections. Cool tech demo, not very effective in gameplay.

The ""Place power core on pad to power thing A"" puzzle being repeated as often as it is should have almost disqualified this game from awards. Lazy, boring, and horribly uninteresting puzzles that devolve into, ""Find glowy box, throw at glowy pad."" The equivalence of puzzles I solved in preschool fitting shapes into their sized holes.

In fact, most puzzles in this game are very similar to Bioshock Infinite's ""Wait a minute, that card"" scene in the intro. Where you have a puzzle in front of you, but also the solution to the puzzle. When you don't, the narrator or a nearby NPC will start telling you hints every few minutes.

Combat is fun, but feels like they're just scratching the surface of what it could have been. And there's no variety once you get settled in with your powers. Almost all side missions and interact-able objects [spoiler] Jukebox, Arcade Machine [/spoiler] are just more combat.

Dialogue is a disaster, especially for a Remedy game. Narration is overdone and often with either absolute hand-holding or Marvel-level writing (I have a feeling he'll be back). The main character shouldn't have to explain how she feels at every conversation. The player is supposed to put themselves in her shoes. Most side characters are either complete doofuses (Ahish, Langdon) or needlessly rude to their boss?

And the vast majority of the story/backstory is on so many written notes that you would probably be better off reading a book that just collects them all instead of holding F 5000 times to collect only 10% of what the game has.

So what's good?

There are moments of genius in either the gameplay or story that really don't come across often enough to bring the full value to the game. Most notable, the [spoiler] Ashtray Maze[/spoiler]. Everyone says it's their favorite part of the game, and sure, but it's like a 5 minute segment?

The combat, although repetitive and gets stale, is fun for a good while. Once you collect your powers and upgrade them a bit, combat is unique.

The difficulty is pretty well balanced, and ability to mod your weapons and yourself really helps emphasize your playstyle to optimize to what you'd like.

As long as you don't pay full price for the game, it's worth it. You can find it on holiday deals for like 75% off, so just hold off a good bit.

It's an amazing game, but it's held back by horrible game engine performance and an anticlimactic ending

You can also read on if you want to
No spoilers

Control takes a few notes from the extensive SCP lore and creates something wonderful, refined and very 
entertaining
The story starts off with the main character entering the Federal Bureau of Control to find her brother, guided by some friendly interdimensional entity
After a brief intro cutscene, you get right to the gameplay and the story
Sometimes you'll collect videos made by scientists that explain some of the weird stuff going on, but mostly you will pick up confidential documents that are absolutely everywhere
I read more in Control than I've done in any game, but I really liked it and the writing is very good
You get lots of fun telekinetic powers, a gun the can transform and a destructible game environment that never stops being fun to interact with
You can obtain different forms for the gun as you progress through the game
Each gun form is something that you would be familiar with from any other game, ""Pierce"" is like a sniper rifle, ""Grip"" is like a starting pistol
The forms can be modified and you can customize each form to behave in any way you like
Do not purchase the ""Spin"" form. It's kinda useless
You can also modify yourself with different upgrades and you have a skill tree that allows you to choose how powerful each unique ability will become as you progress further into the campaign

My 3 cons to Control are the games file size, performance of the game engine and the anticlimactic ending
I know that this is a current trend with modern games, but there is absolutely no excuse for the 40+ Gig file size 
If your'e going to put this much love into creating a great game, then put some work into optimization
Speaking of optimization
I think that this game engine could be great
But in it's current state
It sucks
It's 100% roided up on unnecessary tech
Games don't need some bleeding edge texture streaming tech that barely works, or RTX, or the many other things shoved into Control that make it a pain to get working
All this extravagance kneecaps the games performance and makes it a weird, blurry Frankenstein's monster to behold
The performance is so bad that one of the developers released an unofficial patch to help players get the game working
It took hours of research to achieve an experience that looked decent
With all the tech shoved in there it should look more than decent, but I was happy with what I got
Whatever they are juicing the game engine up with needs to stop

Story gripes
Without going into spoilers, the ending is very anticlimactic
There are some intense emotional stakes going on and then it all just kinda ends
It starts going for the heart and pulls the punch

It is very noticeable on posters or signs. On floors. Going into the menu and twitching things makes the textures load...for a few moments.

Remedy hits it out of the park when it comes making masterful storytelling games. Control has some of the best story, gameplay mechanics, and everything you can think of. The expansions even are worth the play, as it continues pretty well with the main story and through the Remedy Universe. 10/10",1703756988,1703757450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You get to be Jesse Faden, this awesome character exploring the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) and dealing with all sorts of crazy supernatural stuff.

Let me tell you, the BEST thing about ""Control"" is how everything breaks and smashes! Seriously, it's like being in a world made of Lego - you can destroy everything! Shoot at walls, throw stuff around, and watch everything crumble and fly in the air. And guess what? You can use all that broken stuff to hide from bad guys or throw it back at them!

The way this game lets you wreck things is just mind-blowing. When you use Jesse's powers or shoot your cool weapons, everything reacts so realistically! It's like being in an action movie where you're the hero making all the things explode and break!

What's even cooler is how this destructible stuff matches the story. The Bureau's headquarters, the Oldest House, is this wild, shifting place that's full of spooky surprises. And guess what? The way things break and change around you totally fits the whole mysterious vibe of the game!

In a nutshell, ""Control"" is like stepping into a game where you're the boss of breaking things! It's not just about fighting bad guys; it's about having a blast while wrecking stuff and feeling super powerful. Seriously, if you love action, mysteries, and breaking stuff in games, ""Control"" is a MUST-play! Trust me, it's crazy fun!",1703756176,1703756176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

REVIEW


Hello, I am going to start of this review by explaining what i didn't like first, if you want to know the good stuff, please refer to my ""The Good"" section.

The ""Bad""

Let me start by explain the flaws I have with this game. first off, I don't think i really care for the main character and her story overall. I found it very hard to connect with her personally as she comes off really stoic and making a lot of ""That just happened."" Quips that i found kind of annoying.

The combat is hit and miss and i will go more into this but for now i want to say that the main problem with the combat is that there isn't really any creativity when it comes to the guns of the game. you can upgrade one or two guns with really good mods and be set for the game. For example, i used the shotgun version of the weapon given to you for the whole game and found little reason to change guns. The enemy aren't really that impressive either. the flying enemies in this game will annoy you and make combat feel like a chore rather than something enjoyable in the later stages of the game.

I also found some of the level design in boss battles poorly thought out. Its a shame that you can die because you accidentally feel into a hole or a side of a cliff you didn't know about because you cant keep up with how much goes on around you. (The game likes to throw mobs at  you a lot as well)


THE GOOD

Now i will explain why i think this game despite my criticisms is worth playing. If you are a fan of world building and settings for your games then i think this game has that. The sci-fi and paranormal setting fits really well with the theme the game is presenting to the player. Learning about the Object of power and what those things can do were really what made me continue playing the game. Even trying to uncover the secrets the game holds will leave you wanting to know more about it. I found the story and characters more interesting seeing them deal with the bizarre world they're in rather than interpersonal struggles that our main character, Jesse Faden, Goes through.

 The world of Control Take you inside a World where even the characters cant make total sense of what exactly going on. there is alot of interesting concepts in this game that i think made me want to play the game more. 

While i previously Knocked on the game combat, the telekinesis that you will use in the game leaves you feeling strong and this is where i feel the combat of the game truly shines. i found myself having more fun beating enemies and forming strategies this way than that of your gun. btw while the gun-play isn't the best, The Gun itself is really cool. i only wish it was as interesting as playing a telepath.

The music is also really good. There is one section of the game where i was really impressed as it use for tying into the game.


OVERALL

Control may have issues in its combat, level design and Characters, but the World building, Telepathy and Presentation made me stay around. I Recommend this game if you want a nice 20 hour game to play and not have to feel too committed to the story in order to enjoy the experience.

It does a lot of things right and can hit some incredible high points, but one must tolerate long stretches of incredibly uninspired and repetitive game-play to experience them. Whether that cost is worth it to you will be very subjective. In this review, I will talk about both the plot and game-play. This is a spoiler-free review, so my review of the plot will be high level and abstract.

[h3]Story Review[/h3]

The plot is heavily inspired by the SCP Foundation. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it so shamelessly borrows ideas from it that it almost becomes a fault. Control absolutely showers you in documents to read. Most of them are Remedy's SCP ideas or letters from other Bureau members. You receive so many of them with such frequency that it actually ends up harming the main narrative. It's hard to get invested in the story when I get a memo every five minutes asking for more department funding or a document about a lamp that someone thinks is spooky but needs more testing to verify if it actually is spooky. Yes, I understand that some of it is world building, but it's the lamest kind of world building. Most of the SCP knockoffs are incredibly boring. Only a few are thought provoking or foreshadow future events. The rest were unnecessary.

The main plot begins with a strong introduction. It's interesting, engaging, and leaves many open questions that you want to find the answers to. It's an incredibly good hook that gives you a strong incentive to continue playing.

Unfortunately, it's not long after that things fall apart. The plot slams on the breaks and stays that way until you're near the end of the game. The ending rapidly advances the plot, but then just stops unexpectedly. It leaves far too many threads unfinished. There is actually a segment that begins to answer one of the big mysteries, only for it to do a rug pull and strongly imply that the cut-scene you just witnessed maybe didn't happen. That's not just my interpretation, even the fan wiki states that it's unclear.

There is nothing wrong with leaving elements of a story open to interpretation or fan theory. The problem in Control is the extremely sharp contrast between the tedious and verbose detail in the uninteresting and unoriginal world building elements they copied from SCP compared to the vast chasm of emptiness they relegated their original ideas to. So many minor elements are elaborated on in painfully boring detail, yet numerous creative and inspiring story threads get the treatment of ""yadda-yadda, stuff happened, the end"". Control makes sure you learn the full backstory of extremely minor characters and gleefully ignores the plot holes surrounding the major ones.

[h3]Gameplay Review[/h3]

Remedy has created a fun and exciting foundation to build from. You start off with a transforming gun known as the service weapon which mimics pistols, shotguns, or sniper rifles from other games depending on the mode you use. You can launch objects with telekinesis. You can shield yourself with rubble. You can levitate to reach new locations or avoid enemies.

Sadly, there are too many minor faults that manage to interrupt the fun. The launch ability that lets you throw objects can be unpredictable. Most of the time, Jesse will grab a nearby object or even pull rubble from the floor if nothing is available to throw at enemies. However, it's not uncommon for the ability to glitch. At random moments, Jesse will inexplicably grab an object all the way across the room and wait for it to be pulled in and arrive at her side before throwing it. These objects can even get stuck on random geometry. I died more than once because Jesse decided that the desk located a mile away was the only suitable object to throw and she would wait for it to arrive while under heavy fire. That's assuming it arrives at all and doesn't get stuck along its path.

There are no difficulty levels in Control. Instead, it seems that Remedy has opted to use RNG to decide enemy difficulty. It doesn't work very well. Enemies have two modes. Sometimes enemies will stand around and offer absolutely no resistance. Other times they are incredibly clever, hiding behind cover, managing to sneak up on you, and are able to deal incredible amounts of damage in a short time. There isn't much in-between. They simply alternate between painfully easy and borderline unfair.

As you play through the game, you will be able to upgrade your abilities with weapon mods and personal mods to get stat bonuses. The problem is that you have a limited inventory to carry mods, even unequipped ones. Control floods your inventory with useless mods. You are constantly having to pause the game to clear out the worthless ones so you don't miss the opportunity to pick up the rare goods ones.

Between all of the document dumps and mod management, you would think the constant interruptions couldn't get any worse, right? Remedy finds a way. After a certain point in the story, you'll unlock these random events that ask you to go to another part of the building to fight enemies. You don't have to do them and can ignore them. However, you are constantly alerted to these random missions during critical story moments. Control seems absolutely determined to do everything in its power to keep you from completing the main campaign. It's borderline parody with the frequency Control throws interruptions at you. They seem absolutely desperate to try to keep the player away from anything fun and exciting.

Navigation is dreadful. The game does provide a map, but it's not very useful. The Bureau has multiple levels, typically three, but sometimes more, in the different sectors. The map layers all the floors on top of each other. The levels aren't usually the same shape, so layering them all on top of each other can sort of work. The first level might extend further west. The second level extends further south. The third level extends further east. However, there will be a large middle section where all three floors intersect, but the map will only display the top floor. Going from A to B on the the top floor might be a straight line, but is actually a winding maze on the first or second floors which are obscured on the map.

Puzzles aren't a big part of the game. They do have a few, simple puzzles that you'll need to solve. They aren't too complex, and can be a bit fun. Unfortunately, Control likes to ruin some them for you. On one of the puzzles, an NPC accompanies you to the room where it take places. As soon as you start, the NPC immediately gives away the solution. I'm left wondering why the developers would go to all the trouble of creating this puzzle, only to have the NPC immediately blurt out the solution. It seems like an incredible waste of their time and mine.

The quality of the side missions varies dramatically. Some are excellent and worthy of being main story missions. Some are just okay. Most are awful. Control is filled with tedious fetch quests. One such mission was given by an NPC who is almost sarcastic in emphasizing how boring and mundane the mission would be. I thought it was a setup; that Remedy was playing mind games to create a boring fetch quest that actually had a surprise twist. I was wrong. It really was just a boring fetch quest.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

Control is a game that I want to like. Underneath it all, I see a game with huge potential. There are fascinating story threads and a fun third person shooter. There are some really excellent moments in side missions like Fridge Duty and mainline missions like the Ash Maze. I feel bad that I can't recommend it though. All of the shining triumphs are buried beneath far too much mediocrity and plots that fizzle out. Many will enjoy Control enough to give it a good review anyway and I can understand why. There were just too many low points for me to feel the same way and it's an absolute shame.",1703616655,1703616752,False,53,0,0.608379125595092773,0,True,False,False

Totally recommend for the exploration and combat/destruction. 

The level design in this game is incredibly brilliant, with so much attention to detail and hidden things everywhere, there was not one boring moment for me exploring this crazy skyscraper. Even if the map system was bad and wish it was in paper format at least like that there is an excuse for why it was mostly useless but, Hey, who needs a map anyway,  

The Combat was quite addictive throwing stuff at enemies with all the incredible destruction (so much well designed destruction) and it even has this time trial combat mode thing for late game you get to unlock. 

And the OST was perfectly fitting this ominous building.

Oh and the included DLC is really good and expands the game nicely. 

But...

I guess shit happens when you recruit teams that aren't of equal competents because it is incredibly brilliant in some areas and oddly questionable in others. 

For instance the general premise of the game is great but executed poorly via mediocre story telling and pointless dialogue writing for the main protagonist especially in the beginning of the game. It's like they forgot that they had no beginning and had to come up with something quick. It really feels like some parts where written by different witters. Some dialogue is really, really good and then there are moments where it's just ""Why? Who wrote this crap?"". I'm not complaining about the monologue'ing part at all I didn't think that part was bad really. 

And the last annoying bit was the Sound FX for the gun and item collision ... What happened there? Every item I colided with sounded like this: Clakung-clakang! Clakung-clakang! Clakung-clakang! 
And the Gun sounded incredibly generic.

Its not an RPG, more of a third person shooter with seriously creepy atmosphere similar to older games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil. Not too shabby. But the game is on rails, and there's little exploration to do. Playthrough estimates I see hover around 20-25 hours, hopefully longer with the expansions. I do very much like the destructible environments , and some cool physics as well. Replayability seems rather nil.  But It also boasts some portal-like elements and plenty of puzzles. Overall I've had a good experience, with a few caveats. 

As far as the tale goes, it kinda reminds me of the first Jason Bourne movie. There's some cool stuff that happens almost immediately, but you're not sure why and you don't know how you got here...because you're an amnesiac doofus? Anyway not much preamble except the main character is pissed and it has something to do with her brother...umm but it turns out it is more about her anyway.It is a well above average horror film plot and intriguing character development. Also plenty for conspiracy theorists to gobble down. Yum.

And the game is beautiful. I'm running a Ryzen 7 5800 X3D, an RX 5700 XT w/ 8gbVRAM and 16 Gigs of RAM on an SSD and its like butter most settings on high. Definitely a nice little Christmas gift for myself,

And there's some bad stuff too. The gameplay is difficult out of the box, which of course nobody bothers to say BEFORE the purchase. I like challenging gameplay, and I don't mind dying often especially with a new title. BUT because of the ridiculous auto-save and complete;lack of any other save feature, there's a lot of ""OK, lets just go back 10 or 15 minutes and make you do all that  boring crap all over again as a punishment for dying. And again, and again. Mmkay?""

Also completely unforgivable is a well documented bug that completely nukes the dialog for 10 minutes or so. Then the really unforgivable part, the subtitles display white text on light background so one can only see about 50% of the dialog. That's seriously messed up, especially for a 4 year old game that has at least 2 DLC's for the ""ultimate"" edition. More than enough opportunities to fix their screw-ups; they just don't care enough about the end user to bother. 

But like I said, there's more than enough to like here to grab on a sale. Especially since in the settings there is an ""easy mode"" one can enable to help with the more punishing rouge-like insta-death do-over bullcrap.

Seriously, an 8 team ninja death squad with automatic weapons and grenades and I get a little pea shooter and no cover options?? That's not challenging, that;s just stupid. There's fricken crates and boxes everywhere but I can not hide behind ANYTHING?!?

Rolling/Dodge, there doesnt seem to be a good dodging mechanic. It says that the same button to sprint is to dodge, but theres no actual dodge.
And Id prefer gameplay/Controls were a bit more tightened up. Something about them just seem loose. Aiming feels odd and uncontrolled. In fact when shooting, dont try to aim. Thats my tip. Its almost like its encouraged. Its easier to get kills just running and shooting towards all targets.

Don't get me wrong - Remedy presents a polished take on the surreal SCP-like atmosphere.

But, y'know, could this game have been made if the SCP Foundation wiki was a privately-protected IP? I doubt it, and it's hard to shake that feeling. Like a little gnat hovering around your ear.

The story is so catchy at the beginning!

Such a shame it gets that boring after the first 4 hours, 
I had to set up the game to Easy mode with immortality and 1 shot - 1 kill mode, 
not to mention the 100% aim assist, just to be able to catch up with the story line.

The game is all grey or light green. It doesn't really matter if you have an rtx 4080 or a gtx1060.
The story would be great if the could deliver it in more complex, shorter time.

I wish I could have the mood to start it again from the bottom with mouse and keyboard, but it was so sweaty and time stretching with the controller (even with the above mentioned unlimited HP and maximum aim mode.) that I dont even want to understand the story anymore.

It is an experience that you have to have, but I wouldnt pay for it if it wasnt on a 90% discount.

Pros: Voice acting is great. I love the environmental design. The setting recalls X-Files, SCP, Fargo, and even a bit of Bioshock.

The graphics are fantastic, and the character models make the world feel alive and your actions impactful. 

I played through Control (ultimate edition) and feel as though it is a great game, and that the majority of players will enjoy it throughly. However, for me personally, I did not enjoy this game as much as I anticipated. 

My first complaint surrounds the actual navigation of the oldest house. The map is misguiding, and does not take into account different stories very well. How are these multiple stories to the same floor, anyways? Not relying upon a map and fast travel can certainly be a good thing. As Bethesda has demonstrated, fast travel can really take away from exploration aspects of the video games. But the oldest house is just outright confusing at times, and without a clear sense of direction. This wouldn't be too bad, except that the exact same enemies often re-spawn in the same locations. Thus, as you attempt to transverse locations in trying to continue the story, you're faced with repetitive enemies that you cannot ignore.

My second complaint emphasizes that of the lackluster, repetitive combat. You will fight all enemies in virtually the same style, throwing objects and shooting bullets at enemies of similar texture models. I did not find the combat to be a rewarding or engaging experience, but rather a repetitive and sometimes downright annoying chore.

Finally, the pacing of the story leads the player to times of frustration and confusion. Many questions are introduced, with far too few answers until the very end. And even the ""end"" (which isn't even clear, as the game continues beyond the standard ending) doesn't satisfy the players thirst for knowledge. 

These are, of course, my personal complaints with the game. This game simply didn't feel rewarding enough to me, in combat, exploration, and story. Nonetheless,  you're looking for a slower-paced video game in a truly fascinating world and don't mind battling the exact same enemies numerous times, Control offers a truly unique and compelling experience.",1703000501,1703000501,False,25,5,0.549812436103820801,0,True,False,False

For someone familiar with the foundation in the SCP world, the premise of this game is clearly a spin on that organisation. And this game does well to make me feel like I've stumbled into the middle of the foundation during a crisis. The atmosphere at the start captivated me into wanting to explore the mysteries of this confusing and scary facility.

I believe the creators of this game genuinely cared about the world they were creating and the way the player would view this world and story. I felt the same kind of immersion from this game as I would from a tv series or film. For the vast majority of this game I was reading every collectable (in the form of short pieces of readable text) because I genuinely found them well written and intriguing. Normally I would not read 'lore' in most games as I find it dumps a lot of words at you, however in this game I think the creators cared enough to create pieces of text that I found fun to read.
There was even a mechanic that allows you to enter certain hidden areas, one which I did not become aware of until 25 hours into this game. And then I realised it had been there since the start of the game waiting for me to figure it out. Little (or maybe big) things like that really won me over with this game.

Certain mechanics in the game created situations where I felt parallel to character. You experience certain areas or dialogues in a way that will make you feel uneasy or confused, which I believe is to simulate the feelings in the main character in those moments and made me feel more in touch with the story.
The use of live action recordings are used throughout the game, sometimes to create a much more immersive characters and scenarios but also to create some cool visual effects.

Combat follows certain rules that I think are common in most 3rd person action games, however I found the combat systems fun and paced well to keep me entertained, through the addition of new enemies and abilities. The map design really allows you to use the telekinesis ability to the fullest, always giving you something to throw, and when there isn't you can create things to lesser effect. It did truly feel seamless. 

Now my one big annoyance throughout the game. The constant back tracking for optional areas. When playing the game you are constantly passing areas which you will not be able to access until later. Which to start with is okay, however once you put a few hours in (and if you're like me) you will forget where everything is. Resulting in you going back to the start of the game, and walking through the entire map looking for numbered doors. I could have fixed this by noting down all the optional areas, but still, it left a sour taste in my mouth.

Anyway, I've just finished the base game and am looking forward to the DLC. This is in no way a indepth review, but honestly after completing the game I enjoyed it that much that I felt I needed to write something long to recommend it... I really enjoyed this game :)

I've seen a lot of people talk about how the looting and leveling system is kinda dumb but in this one specific case I find it addicting. Really gives you an excuse to hunt down items and encounters in The Oldest House. But for real- this game isn't the most complex mechanics-wise, but plays like a well-oiled machine. fantastic weapon feedback, pretty destruction mechanics, etc.
Not even gonna mention how cool the story is because it's already been said. 
I got this one for$10 but it's still a fair price at full for what you're getting.",1702838680,1702838680,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The protagonist sucks debris from the surrounding with supernatural force and hurls them back at high velocity. The incorporation of realistic debris-physics within the gameplay is truly remarkable.

As I progressed further into the game, it becomes way beyond simply being a ""use force to throw objects"" type of game. The recoil from the gunshots is exceptionally well-designed. Each type of firearm feels meticulously crafted, with careful consideration and love from the developers.

The game's world draws heavily from the SCP universe. In fact, I would go as far as to say it serves as an exceptional SCP simulator, perhaps even the best one available on the market.

If you have an interest in SCP settings or simply enjoy the experience of throwing stuff, this game is an absolute must-play.

Servings: 4
Prep: 10 mins
Cook: 20 mins

INGREDIENTS

Cajun Seasoning:
2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp thyme
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp salt

Chicken Pasta:
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp butter
1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast
1 yellow onion, diced
1/2 lb. penne pasta (uncooked)
15 oz. fire roasted diced tomatoes
2 cups chicken broth
2 oz. cream cheese
3 green onions, sliced

INSTRUCTIONS

1: Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.

2: Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point.

3: Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to sauté for about 2 minutes more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.

4: Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.

5: Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy.

6: Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks, then stir until it has melted into the sauce. Top the pasta with sliced green onions and serve.

NOTES
- The deep skillet I use is a 4-quart capacity.
- Depending on your cookware, you may need to adjust the heat up or down to maintain a simmer in the broth. Be sure to stir often to prevent the pasta from sticking.",1702495414,1702495414,True,2,0,0.449673205614089966,0,True,False,False

I liked it a lot so I decided to buy it on Steam and do a full completion run for the Ultimate Edition. The game is decent, it has an interesting and confusing story, a lovely protagonist with good voice lines, the aestetichs help to create a unique world comparable with SCP, the exploration is rewarding, the abilities are very cool: you have Launch, Evade, Shield, Levitate, Seize and some upgrades for each individual skill tree such as Ground Slam, Shield Barrier, Shield Dash, making the character feel very similar to a Jedi from Star Wars. The 2 DLCs are nice additions to the main campaign, one with Alan Wake for those fans who waited so long for the second title and one with The Foundation that continues the story and gives more insight about what is going on in bureau.
However, the guns are quite bad, they don't scale well and you can only have 2 weapons equipped at the same time that share the same ammo capacity, 3 augments that have random values predetermined by RNG and even with the best in slot upgrades, they feel very weak in end game. There is room for improvement in terms of quality of life, most of the side quests are poorly explained and boring, weapons balance, a passive health regeneration, automatic looting for flying enemies etc. The game is not hard and doesn't have a difficulty choice (except from the assist mode), but adding enemies like the sphere that can regenerate the health of every other enemy and also teleports after a few seconds feels like a bad design choice to me. I also need to give minus points for the optimization, for some reason Steam crashed several times during my playthrough and it was also unfriendly to my second screen, causing freezing.

Really bad. In a bit of a broaded term in CONTROL the combat basics are perfect. The general concept, perfect. However, the one and only thing that Remedy never knew how to do is balance things out or at least make steady rise in difficulty. Thank god for that assist mode they add. I think its there because even the devs at some point realised that they f***ed it up in that department...again.

OK so what is CONTROL? 

It is a excellent take on SCP Foundation, Lovercaftian cosmic horror, and all kind of weird shit and paranormal phenomena.
The style of narraration is more in cinematic style and sometimes a bit too slow paced but all in all. Its not a bad design.
The worldbuilding shines best with its enviromental storytelling as well a tons of the collectibles ""classified"" documentation to read throu. It is truly a cosmic horror story at it best. Well, best when it comes to the video games itterations.

Combat is easy to learn basic concept of engagement. However, when it comes to the application of the combat it is a freaking nighmare. The enemies are usually either way too OP or total pushovers. There is no middle. You are gonna get rekt by lowliest of the low or you will be ploughing through almost everything. And, that will be the case until like 50% of the main story. The other 50% of the main story or the game in general will completly different story.

At some point in game you will ALWAYS be totally underpowered. You can have great mods all upgrades etc. and still get killed in one to two shots by...pretty much everything. There are also tedious random enemies spawning in previously cleared areas and that may rusult quite often in you getting killed by suckerpunching from behind. Something that Remedy is very fond of doing in all of its games. Later in game the combat will be absolute drag and tedious. The service weapon wont do shit regardless of the upgrade and you will find out that the game actually have no liberties when it comes to the style of combat. If you are not fast moving type of player that has great hunch when to shift cover and when to stay in one...you are not gonna have a good time. You want to play slow but powerful TANK build. Nope, no can do. You wanna go  STEALTH playstyle. Too bad, no can do. You either play the way the developers had in mind or you do not progress AT ALL. Nedless to say, i am not fond of this design.

This is a beautiful game that is totally brought down by overly numerous and tedios combat encounters that can be done only with one type of playstyle. 

When it comes to the boss battles i dont know how they could make all bosses so visually intreguing and absolute nighmare in term of difficulty. In short, boss battles are unfair, like, Dark Souls level of unfair. You will almost certanly get killed numerous times to the every single boss in this game until you figure out a strategy. Only to come to realise that not even that strategy is only 50% and that a level of luck is involved just as hard as strategy is.

This game is defenetly not for everyones taste. I can say that if you are here for the story exclusevly....play with cheats (assist mode) or you will be losing your shit way too frequently.",1702328773,1702328773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In terms of its narrative, it starts as strong as it can be. Control’s first two to three hours are some of the best work Remedy has ever developed. It’s also a game that struggles with pacing. The overall structure has some extremely high highs and some rather meandering in-betweens. Every great element of this game also has a rather dull attachment weighing the experience down.

The last couple of hours are simply spectacular as well. As I rolled credits on Control, I wished that Remedy had attempted a more focused, slightly more linear, approach to the game’s structure and narrative. Something more akin to their previous output would solve 90% of the issues I have with the game.

The games' second act, though continuing to introduce fascinating spaces to explore and weird documents to read, tends to blend together in memory as an amalgamation of fetch-quests that don’t really add up to much in terms of the main plot thread, character or world building. This feeling is only amplified by the gradual ramp up of side quests that distract from this main story path. Some are pretty stellar and memorable, specially the ones that grant Jesse new powers to fight with or dive head-on into the sheer fun absurdity of the supernatural world that Control presents, but most of them are even more forgettable fetch-quests and an endless barrage of procedurally generated time sensitive combat encounters that pop up in random areas of the map every set amount of minutes, flashing the screen in big bold letters, attempting to entice you into dropping whatever more interesting thing you are doing to go there and kill some repetitive waves of enemies for some truly lackluster rewards.

The game has some slight metroidvania influences in its approach to the world design, in a Jedi: Fallen Order kind of way. As you advance in the story, you’ll start unlocking abilities that will grant access to new sections of areas you’ve already explored, pushing the player into going back to those places in order to find new stuff. There are a couple of issues with this approach in Control. In particular, the Oldest House, the supernatural, ever shifting, setting for the game, is a very weird and labyrinthian place, and a pretty hard one to traverse at that. Exploring every nook and cranny for the first time is really fun but going back to places and trying to remember how to get back to somewhere, even with the use of fast travel points, is a real pain in the ass. This and the enemy waves that spawn pretty much anywhere large enough to be a combat arena every time you go through there, makes simple fetch side-quests even more bothersome than they should be in the first place. 

Combat is the other aspect of the game I’m quite conflicted about. The gameplay experience is amazing, powers and abilities are really fun to play around with. Remedy really nailed the superhero shooter style. My main issue is with the combat encounters. They are simply not engaging nor fun enough to sustain how many of them you can be involved in. It’s near constant, there’s pretty much just one approach that works consistently and enemy variety isn’t enough to keep them fresh for long. Quantum Break had very few opportunities for combat, Control might have too many for what It’s offering to the player. Midway through the game I was quite over these encounters, even though the gameplay experience itself never stopped being fun.

There’s also a whole upgrades system with stat modifiers for weapons and powers that should have been cut altogether. These XP points and mods are not engaging as exploration rewards, builds don´t feel different from each other when playing, the interface itself is a pain to interact with, it just doesn’t work, and it wasn’t necessary to include here. You cannot engage with this at all and still have the same experience as everyone else playing, because I’m sure most people even forget that the system exists at all. 

I have my complaints about the game, and I’m rather passionate about them, but that’s because I love the overall experience so damn much. It works so well for me. This blend of weird sci fi and horror, played straight but with some sense of humor, is very much specifically my thing. I absolutely adore all of the world building, finding these documents, letters and videos. Just the look of the game and its spaces was enough to win me over instantly. The presentation is amazing, the way it uses cutscenes and video like no other game does, the wonderful music and sound design, I could go on for a long time praising every little detail I loved. Remedy, as always, created something even more ambitious and fascinating, and I hope they keep doing just that with their next games for a long while. Just maybe keep it tighter next time, trim the fat a bit.

Great DLCs too, AWE is a must play for any self-respecting Alan Wake fan.

By the end of the game, the gameplay had me completely hooked and I was having tons of fun. I still didn't understand what the hell was going on. But at the same time, it's kinda cool how abstract it is. I managed to piece together a lot of concepts by myself. And even if I got confused, the utter fun I had throwing stuff around in combat carried my experience forward. 

Unfortunately, a chunk of the concepts escaped me by the utter amount of TEXT there is to read. I love reading. Some of the writing is great. But by the 30th hour, it got in the way of the pacing too much. I have the same issue with some of the sidequests. I found them uninteresting and disconnected from the rhythm the game had.

Visually, I dare to say it's one of the best games I've played. The presentation is top notch. Elements like Dr. Darling's tapes made me much more involved in what was happening. The Old House as a setting is pretty much unique, which allowed Remedy to play with certain visual elements much more.

In regards to the DLCs, AWE felt like a breath of fresh air, mixing up the gameplay and pacing in a very interesting way. On the other hand, The Foundation felt very relevant plot-wise, but the regular gameplay had gotten very old by then.

Overall, I enjoyed the game the most when I was 60/70% in. Maybe cutting some of the filler would've been beneficial. This game didn't need things like so many sidequests or a crafting system. But I still loved it. It's so special in a way only Remedy can do.

TL/DR Great game with a great story, and hardcore shooter gamers may not like it. Not perfect, but very enjoyable.

Me being me...

I really love this game. I'm also a fan of Alan Wake, and Quantum Break. I've recently played the Max Payne games as well. I love Remedy's connected universe, and all the Easter eggs/crossovers they drop. I really love the in-depth lore they create in this universe, and found myself reading everything I could on the walls (there's a good amount of reused assets here,) in the memos, etc. Having the Alan Wake crossover in the AWE expansion was great! The FBC videos you find in this game are great. Some are weird. Some are interesting. Some are funny...but they catch you. The radios have some cool music, and shows on them as well. It seems to be a Remedy thing, and I'm a fan. The collectibles really bring you into the world, without being too over done and boring (just played CP2077, and found theirs to be too much, too mundane.) I enjoyed the collectibles in this game. The world begs to be explored, and there's plenty of space for that.

Speaking of music...The Poets Of The Fall/Old Gods Of Asgard have become the first band in years whose music has impressed me. The listening room for My Dark Disquiet really caught me as a great moment in games...I found it so refreshing as a reward for exploration (I'm a professional musician.) The Ashtray Maze set to Take Control was probably the coolest thing I've seen in a video game in years. The music pushed me through it at a breakneck pace (most Youtube vids of this don't follow the pace, and are slow compared to how I took it,) the dynamic of how the music matches the mood/rooms, and the Nolanesque shifting of the walls were all feeding in to the perfect storm.

The combat is fun, and at times can be easy or hard. Remedy likes to keep you moving in games, and this is the same. Taking cover will end up in your cover being destroyed. The AWE expansion had the hardest combat, but it was linked to poor grab mechanics in the Dr. Hartman fight. I could never lock on to what I wanted to. Some people hate this combat, and that's fair. It's not the focus of the game. The world it creates is.

Facial animations are good, with the lip syncing. The character models look good as well. The graphics are great, even though some of their chosen mood isn't my favorite. The reflections are amazing. When you walk in front of a projector, your shadow follows you beautifully. The way the building shifts is great, as well. I was more impressed with their overall graphics than CP2077. I played both at max settings.

The weapon/personal mods you pick up have a few that are useful, but a lot of them are wasted. I found I used a three specific ones for personal/each weapon, but the majority of them I ignored. The same with the gun modes. I appreciate them, but I used the basic mode most of the time (my struggles with Hartman in AWE could've been easier with the DLC gun mode, but it's general use turned me off from it....so, my bad.) The mod crafting system...well I never used it. I found no need for it.

The Bureau Alerts and Board Countermeasures are useful in the beginning, but I found them tedious after a while. The countermeasures were far too specific to yield any worthwhile returns. The Alerts were fun, but as I leveled up I found I didn't need them, and they came at the most inopportune times.

I loved how quiet this game can be at times, with nothing but the quiet droning of the Hiss chanting. I really love how they nailed the mood of this game. It can be frantic, disturbingly quiet, and anywhere in between. I hear a lot of people speculate on Remedy's influence, but I never hear Fringe mentioned. I think this game has drawn a lot of influence from the series, especially with the alternate universes existing side by side with subtle differences.

The fact that the scenery doesn't change can wear on some people. You're in the Oldest House, and there's a subtle monotony to it. Remedy's other games jump locations more. 

The fact that you can only change outfits at a singular Control Point is a WTF moment. The fact that you need the AWE DLC to replay certain moments of the game is also in this category.

Overall, I enjoyed this game. It's well worth the play through. I won't pay $60 for any video game, but I'd easily pay $40 for this. Remedy had been the one developer that hasn't broken my heart yet. YET...",1633794741,1702061534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Deep direct story, with a lot of extra to uncover if you want.
Lots of metroidvania play, but with options to follow the main path and be completely satisfied by it.
If you were to choose to ignore side missions and exploration which honestly these side story are often have pretty decent gameplay and awesome story and worldbuilding.

Weirdly the weakest portion of the game is the third person combat platforming, but it isn't as bad as most third person platforming, and it isn't bad. Once you get into a grove it can be really fun. There is an incredibly amount of varied combat options based on your preferences of using the <Gun/Sword/Service Weapon> and your paracausual...oh I mean para-natural abilities which are gained in satisfying ways.

Oh man and the Ash Tray maze? One of the best moments in gaming. Like legit emotions, and not my taste in music but so fitting for the scenario that I was almost in tears with just how much the moment rocked.

I cannot express how much this game is worth playing if you like rich story and worldbuilding.
I need to replay Alan Wake. Too bad Alan Wake 2 is only on Epic which means. No Buy.

Edit:
Oh and characters. The characters IMO are really good. They are fun and believable reacting in humans ways to stress. ...other than Ahti that is.

Especially the focuses of Darling, The former Director, and Ahti.

Don't ask what happened to the former former director though.

The weapons upgrade system is useless and uninteresting, you end up with overloaded weapons upgrades in your weapons layout, loads of small increased items (most of them the same) to the point when your notified there's an upgrade item you won't even bother to check what it is as you will know it's pointless.

The UI for the weapon layout is also not very pleasing (not nice to look at and confusing) to navigate.

I was amazed to see how this game was allowed to be released with the bugs and bad programming it has, one in part you meet a guard (optional mission) he opens a door with key level 9 for you and follows you around, all is well until you come to another door for level 9 key (I found out later) which he is also supposed to open, but instead he does nothing but follow you or just stand there, I only found out the next day after loading the game again and going to the same point he decided he would open the door this time, and you would think this was the only bug, no........................ you are supposed to lead him back to help a fallen fellow, which I did and again he stood there and did nothing while I was right beside the injured guard, I had to go around the level a different way to the same point to get an icon appear on the guy following you which you have to press X to talk to him, very simple right? wrong he was running away from me, I had to chase him all over the level to press the X button icon which appears on him, I manged to jam him into a wall and then press the X button, at this point he then leads you to the fallen guard and the game plays the way it is suppose to, and that's the end of the bugs/bad programming right? wrong again, after I had a chat with him after doing what needs to be done (he was meant to head back to a certain point, as in we split up) he continues to follow me, but only this time both of his legs are stuck and proceeds to float around after me like a doll being held by an invisible hand, it was at this point I put this game down.

Most points where you are mean't to go have a highlighted gold title on a map and you have to figure out a way to get there, however to add insult to injury (just before above mentioned incident) that no longer happened and I was left wondering were the place was I was meant to go, the levels can be confusing at the best of times so the vague highlighted area is a must.

Another annoying thing is you are put back quite a bit after defeat (control points can be a bit away of were you need to go) you cannot save anywhere we only have control points and some random rare autosaves.

The good points of the game are not strong enough to save it from the rest, which are the graphics and the physics, some of the voice acting is good, and the atmosphere is decent.

This could have been a great game but it just feels unfinished at best, if you want to experience a much better telekinesis game with a much better storyline and gameplay check out Second Sight on gog (gog version has widescreen fix) or any of the consoles.

It's really shocking to see such a soulless dead inside project from creators of masterpieces like Max Payne, Quantum Break, Alan Wake, Alan Wake's American Nightmare had recognisable style, atmosphere, charisma and passion in them which is why they are beloved by most. Meanwhile Control even though has a promising concept, as you start playing, you'll notice that it's a completely empty shell...

+ Environmental destruction is neat. It's quite fun to destroy stuff, but I'm still disappointed that you can't demolish any walls with the exception of the few specific walls hiding secret areas.
+ Some of the songs are awesome.

- Gameplay is extremely repetitive, shoot a horde of enemies, read a document, find a loot crate, repeat. Once in a while a boss battle happens or you encounter an NPC with dialogues. And that's the whole game.
- Way too many readable collectables. Most of them aren't interesting in the slightest. In total I have found 397 collectable readables/audiologs... That's insane amount.
- Why are many of the readables sanitized? In real life, in order to keep the sensitive information secure documents are to be sanitized if they are provided to the public or foreign parties. But here, none of the documents are leaving the place, who are they censored for? The people who are supposed to read them - The Bureau employees themselves? It doesn't make any sense.
- Checkpoints (Control points) are very poorly placed, often forces backtracking quite a lot.
- A lot of songs have awful usage of them.
- Awful maps. The drawing is off, you sometimes walk outside the map. Some of the important areas aren't even on the maps. Also, All floors are overlapping each other making it a complete mess to follow in multifloor sectors.
- Awful camera. Keeps changing position when running/walking, in small/big rooms. It's very disorienting.
- Bland level design. Same office environments over and over and over again. A lot of the rooms are copy pasted. It's very lazy and repetitive. You get 2 more types (+1 more with expansion) of environments later on, but that's not enough. Game is seriously lacking in environmental variety.
- Absolutely unrewarding exploration. There are tons of secret rooms and even more non-secret crates of loot laying around waiting to be found. But vast majority of the loot you get is absolute trash. Pure useless garbage. Even the highest tier Mods are completely unusable. For example, you easily get thousands of Source (in-game currency) by regularly fighting enemies just for a few minutes. And some top tier mod is ""get 5 source per melee attack"", do I even need to explain why it's useless? And almost all of the loot is abomination.
- The game is completely unbalanced. Some boss battles are definitely difficulty spikes. The hardest is the middle of the game, especially the side missions. It gets so hard and unfair and there is no way to upgrade because all the loot sucks. But the worst of all is that the late game is much easier, but not because you become stronger, but because game doesn't spawn as many of the strong enemies at once as well as the bosses aren't as unforgiving... It's seriously unbalanced difficulty progression.
- Death has penalty... Yea, in the game full of difficulty spikes, they still dare to remove 10% of your current Source...
- There are many areas in which after clearing the area all enemies respawn after as little as 5 seconds after leaving and reentering the area... And that happens every single time...
- The idea of Objects of Power having needs is heavily underused. It was the best idea in the whole game, they should've based the entire game around it.
- You'd think that the Director would have the maximum clearance. But nope... Even after beating the game, you don't get the maximum clearance of the building. This is merely a nitpick for lack of logic.
- Bureau missions pop up at random times and way too often. They always pop up at worst timings ruining stuff and disorienting me, as well as blocking part of the screen for a few seconds.
- Teammate A.I. is the worst I have ever seen. They run from spot to spot constantly getting themselves exposed, they don't use cover from direct attacks, they leave their backs open for enemies to shoot at them. They can barely hit an enemy, their accuracy is awful. They shoot directly at enemy, so if the enemy is in a different room, they shoot at the wall... I have done tests and no joke, but a single enemy with a critical health has 80% of beating your full health teammate... Good luck getting that 'Supportive Staff' achievement, it's painful...
- Ending is so disappointing. Left me completely empty-handed.
- Game is full of little glitches that affect gameplay. Annoying one being that sometimes you can't evade through class or object that you usually can. There were also at least 3 game breaking glitches for which I had to quit and restart the game in order to fix. Like the door wouldn't open, the enemy wouldn't spawn and something else. Lighting is completely broken in a few rooms and unfixable for me. I tried out all graphical settings, but nothing worked. Basically a few (maybe 6-8) rooms in the entire game were present with extremely bright rainbow colours and I could see nothing in them but lights glitching.

Control may not be completely unplayable due to its crappy difficulty and technical issues, but even in its core, game is so uninspired and boring. It doesn't have any character to it. Epic fail. One of the worst games I have ever beaten.

Teaboy's Basic(ish) Reviews....I read a lot of reviews when looking at games on Steam, and it quickly gets tiring – those who write involved, down to the micron scale reviews, although helpful, end up like looking at War & Peace when you’ve only got time for a quick 5 minute dump!  This is middle of the road and to the point – not easy for me as I tend towards sesquipedalian loquaciousness!  Vociferously Verbose?  Alright, verbal diarrhoea.  (Although I hate panning a developer’s work and all the time, effort and love they put into designing these – it is their life after all – this is my honest, personal opinion of my level of enjoyment.  Sorry devs!).  

A note on time played:  My Steam clock does not seem to work properly, indeed, it even minuses time on occasion!  Plus, I have a tendency to wander off and leave games running at times, so time played may not be entirely accurate!  


Teaboy’s Tonsil Titillators or Toenail Titbits!  (Rating)  

Tonsil Tickler (Totally Tops):  The frenchy of which you always dreamt!  To quote a master, “She’s got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a Man’s tonsils!”.  An absolute masterpiece and joy to play.  

The Tits (Terrific):  Everyone loves playing with these!  Not THE best bit, but such fun on their own you can be lost for hours....mmmm.  What most games you really like score – perfection is so rare after all.   

Torso Teaser (Taker of your Time):  It’s a flat stomach....sure it’s nice to look at, run your fingers over, slobber on a bit, sometimes that bellybutton gets your motor running....but it's just basically the corridor between the two ‘gaming rooms’.  The definitive ‘Meh’ - the middle ‘sideways thumb’ option for which everyone on Steam cries.  

Todger/Tadger & (scroTum) Taters (Tedious):  Is it an ‘a’ or is it an ‘o’?  Who cares!  The meat can be fun to play with for about 5 minutes of your entire day, the rest it just hangs there and generally gets in the way of doing something else.  The main problem of course, is the two veg sticking to your inside thigh.  This is what this game feels like – the occasional/rare bouts of fun, the rest bobbing like a 19th century British Policeman (now you know why!).  

Toenail Tornado (Total Toss):  A playthrough so appalling it’s like being trapped in a Turkish sauna with the ugliest, hairiest, fattest, sweatiest beast of a neolithic hominid who’s trimming his toenails using pliers and the splinters are reminiscent of a scene from the Normandy Landings.  My god how did this get released!?  


Teaboy Touts (Score):  TONSIL TICKLER!!!!


The Review:  

One of the rare few that hit the top score!  And surprisingly, when I first started it I was getting a bit bored!  Then you get your first powers....oh the fun!  

The guns are limited, but I reckon this is a specific counterpoint to the powers, to be used in conjunction with each other as they each have to recharge - so blast with this, then blast with that!  You get five different types of gun, but as you progress even the 'cannon' will only drain half of a baddies' health, plus it is a charge-up before firing weapon, so it is superduper difficult to run around whilst jumping and juking and diving etc whilst trying to keep the reticule on the guy (no auto-lock) until it finally fires!  The powers are much more effective.  

There are power-up pick-ups dropped throughout the game, but I only ever found two 100% boosts for guns and as mentioned, even this is not enough!  As you progress these boosts change (3 different types) - you'll find out - and I just ignored them (as there are so many and it detracts too much from getting on with it for me), sticking with the originals as I thought they were on the whole more efficacious.  

Now this is one of those games where you will never be able to upgrade Every power - I never even touched the shield power sadly.  So bear this in mind and choose your favourite style instead of getting low power on all.  

A truly wondrous bonus of this game really sticks it to those '20+ dlc' type games - it is all in one package for one price and no more!  And wow....it has a truly great length.  When I thought I had reached a natural end to the game and was sad because I wanted to play more, I got MORE!  And when that 2nd life to the game came to its logical end, it gave me a 3rd!  Extending the game Twice was just excellent.  I was truly sorry when it finally did end, but I could not ask for more than they gave - they gave more....TWICE!  It was like 2 dlc's added for free - 3 in 1!  

I never bothered with the full 100% completion cos it meant using the 'arcade machine' to re-fight ALL boss battles one after another - die and start again.  These battles are tough and every time you die you lose 10% of your 'currency' - although the currency in this game was not really all that necessary except for opening up a new gun as the other stuff can just be picked up on the field of battle, so you will have loadsa money in endgame^^  

Only gripes are sometimes it is very hard to find your target - finding the escaped artefacts is a case in point.  It is a very large world with multiple levels in multiple sectors - you get 'emergency' missions about every 20 minutes and you have to drop what you are doing and find a travel point to jump to this other area, and frankly they are just a distraction as you often fail them in your haste.  They are not needed for your progression - the rewards the 'others' give you are rather pants to be fair^^  

The game was a joy.  A good level of challenge whilst not punishing you and driving you into a joypad smashing frenzy like other games.  Boss battles are tough and take a while to work out the key to winning, but the whole experience is rewarding in and of itself.  It links with Alan Wake, though a different take, continuing its storyline.  I liked both games, but this is more fun with the fights cos superpowers are orsum!",1701700785,1701701063,True,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False

-All the characters are downright ugly which is weird for such a beautiful game.  The mocap they used leave many characters with slack jawed expressions and weird facial movements as they talk.  They all (the MC included) look like they got punched in the jaw before they started talking and can no longer move their mouths correctly.  It is extremely jarring to watch.

-Faden's reaction to events in this game is underwhelming.  I don't need a character to act surprised at every single turn.  But she is just an emotionally dead character.  She literally gains the ability of flight and you'd think it was just another Monday morning.  The building is shifting constantly on her and she is just not impressed by anything.

-The story is unbelievably predictable.  WHO would of guessed this was why she was here?  Who would have guessed her brother was who he was?  Who would have guessed her friend was who it was?

If u like remedy u will probably like this. I love Darling, he is the best. I have to tho mention a few things that holds the game back for me personally. While i found the concept and the world super fascinating, i did find the combat imo quite uneccacary. I have to say tho i dont really like action games so maybe im not the best at judging that but i just felt it held it back from being more immersive. Control shines when it fully engages with its story, atleast for me. But it is held back by the difficult combat and fast paced gameplay. I would have preffer a slower based game where u navigate the oldest house and try to piece all of the stories and its world and concepts together. The story was intuiging but i wish it more fully delved into it, it felt almost like i was disconnected from it a bit. And while i found the concept of the oldest house very good, its execution was a bit dissapointing. This will be a bit spoilery so be warned. The Oldest House is described as an endless building that shifts constantly. Yet none of this happens in the game. U often travel to the same locations a lot. I understand its cause Remedy wanted to make a sort of ""open world game"" with the oldest house being the hub area kinda. Yet the consequense of this takes away the things a more liniar design could acomplish, like always exploring a new ""level"" so every bit feels distingt, and it could have given u more of the feeling that the place shifts and that it is in fact endless. Yet that is hard to accomplish when the map is fixed in place. But all in all i recommend this game cause i love remedy and i feel atleast on first playthrough that the pros outweight most of my cons :3",1699539934,1701634376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Control Ultimate Edition stands as a testament to Remedy Entertainment's prowess in crafting exceptional gaming experiences. From the moment you step into the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control as Jesse Faden, it's evident that you're in for a thrilling ride.

The narrative is a mind-bending odyssey, seamlessly blending supernatural elements with a government conspiracy storyline. The mysteries surrounding the Bureau, Jesse's past, and the otherworldly ""Objects of Power"" keep you hooked, constantly craving more answers. The narrative is complemented by outstanding performances, especially from the protagonist, adding emotional depth to the already engaging plot.

The game's environment is a character in itself, with the brutalist architecture of the Bureau and the shifting, otherworldly spaces creating a visually stunning and atmospheric experience. Control's use of the ""Brutalist meets Paranormal"" aesthetic is nothing short of genius, contributing to the game's unique identity.

The combat system is a highlight, offering a perfect blend of telekinetic powers and gunplay. The sense of empowerment as Jesse gains new abilities is exhilarating, and the dynamic, physics-based combat keeps encounters fresh and exciting. The variety of enemies, each with its own set of challenges, adds depth to the gameplay.

With the Ultimate Edition, players not only get the base game but also all the additional expansions, including the fantastic AWE DLC. This complete package ensures that you have hours of content to delve into, further enriching the already robust experience.

Control Ultimate Edition is not just a game; it's an immersive journey into the unknown, a psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. With its gripping narrative, stellar visuals, and satisfying gameplay, Control Ultimate Edition is an absolute must-play for any fan of action-adventure games. It's not just awesome; it's a masterpiece.

Has several moments that are just ""wow, this is so amazing but I can't start thinking about that because I don't want to miss how amazing this is."" The game also does a great job telling the story through the environment with lots of wonderful details. The artists behind the game really capture strange vibes of an office that somehow is much more than an office and now also has something new and weird going on excellently. Alongside this, the story and the environment tend to leave a lot of room for the player to figure out what's going on before it becomes clear. I really enjoyed the messages left behind by certain characters as well, and the actors do a nice job with them. Those, and several of the environments like the motel left me constantly wanting to know more as I moved through the story.

The main game exhibits all the above very well and is 100% worth playing. If you enjoyed it, the Foundations DLC is also good since it digs a bit more into the lore. I ultimately found it to be slightly less polished than the base game (the attempt to add new mechanics ends up being too rigid and not as useful/interesting as it could have been). Though to its credit, Foudations actually has some of the coolest environments overall and another one of those ""wow"" sequences in it. Haven't finished the AWE DLC yet, but it seems so far to be similarly less polished and lacking in the lore factor of the other DLC. Still, it's probably better if you know something about the story of the Alan Wake games. 

As for cons? Well for me the biggest con is that the game actually had the potential to be even better if they had invested a bit more time into the gameplay and some of the small stuff. My basic complaints:
-the combat is pretty samey due to limited enemy types that don't require much strategic variance and there is pretty much just one way to play since none of the upgrades quite create enough variety to get you to mix it up.
-the mechanics of the game, including the combat, don't seem to emphasize the story or the core ideas of the game. It's pretty much like they took generic game mechanics and just pasted them onto their otherwise wonderful game: unimpactful dialogue options, shooting things when you have paranormal abilities, random loot boxes, etc. It's frustratingly like none of the mechanics they give you to use have any reality in the game or connection to the story. Like you're traveling through this wonderful story as Standard Shooter Character #37 and they just sprinkled generic enemies in your path to justify their generic gameplay elements. Just a lot of wasted potential when they could have designed interesting and thematically appropriate mechanics with variety to them instead. But damn it you can see the thematic potential in the seize mechanic, it feels good to throw objects around.... Or if ""controlling"" a ""control point"" actually gave you control of the area and stopped enemies spawning........ I digress. 
-everything has 0 weight and starts floating if you poke it with your little toe
-Strange and semi-pointless opportunities to grind, pick up loot, and ""upgrade"" your weapons to make them do more of what they already do are abundant. Do they make it more gamelike? maybe. Do they seem to have any reality within the story or impact things in any way? nope. Are they kinda optional? Thankfully, YES.

Main game 8.5/10

AWE DLC? Only part way through but so far 6/10

They created Death Rally, Max Payne... they're creative people who do their best to build interesting gameplay experiences and when they feel it makes sense to deviate from the norm to stand out and explore new territory, they do. I love them for that.

That said? Fuck Remedy for making this piece of shit game. This utter garbage wherein you run around a stupid concrete SCP maze with some really lovely lighting... albeit a bit too heavily leaning on 'clinical white' vs. 'sinister red'. A stylistic choice, of course, symbolism no doubt, but it still gets a bit boring, especially when you're in a really red room being spammed with really, REALLY screen-filling red VFX by enemies on all sides.

Why garbage? The combat. Oh, the damned combat. You play a woman called Jesse (cool), who comes into possession of a magic McGuffin gun that can turn into several other guns. Some of which almost work a little, against really, really basic enemy types. By and large, however, the guns are utterly worthless. They run out of ammo-charge way too quickly, deal shit damage even with damage-specific mods filling all available slots, have STALKER accuracy (i.e. the enemy's guns are magically accurate, while yours are just the opposite) and will do nothing at all to the shielded enemies who make up about half of all enemies.

Did you play Bioshock Infinite? Remember that fun bit where you're being shot by fifteen different guys you can't see, from every direction, above, behind, to both sides, all around? And the suggested approach is ""ha ha move out of the way"" ...How exactly do you dodge in every direction at once? Simple answer, you can't. Control has not learned this lesson. Sure, it has levitation, eventually. You can technically dodge up and down a little, if you time it perfectly. But the enemy? They have homing missiles. They also have telekinetic rock projectiles, the only thing in your own arsenal that almost works on the tougher enemies, when it's not running out of energy (which it always is, regardless of TK throw discount mods equipped) or targeting the tiny pebble next to the humongous rock you actually wanted to pick up, or not registering a throw or pick up command, or just generally screwing you around. But hey, you can sometimes take out an enemy just by pulling a rock out of the wall behind them, or bopping them with something large, or a few large things in the case of the big lads who are essentially immune to anything else. Put all your skill points in TK throw if you play this game; that'll get you through some of it, at least.

Then you get to the Formation. This... fun little TIMED mission-hub-arena-fight bullshit marathon kind of thing. No no, it's really fun, see, 'cause you go in, right? No idea what the objectives are, so chalk up one entire run to just figuring those out. Then you maybe figure out where they all are, or how to locate them. 

You figure out that fighting the enemies is a sucker's game because they're too damn strong for your current power level (with tier 4/6 mods, and this is the EASY version of the Formation), so you just run around and complete the objectives while keeping enemies at a distance where possible. Running around, dodging, maybe smacking down a few easy targets for healing. Did I mention there's nowhere near enough healing in this game? There isn't, no. The enemies, oh, they heal continuously whenever one of their friendly and way-too-high-health healspheres spawns in. It teleports around, avoiding destruction while all the rest fill you with bullet and rocket and rock holes. Ouch. But you get a tiny speck of healing every now and then from damaging an enemy, so it's totally fair. Except when they cheap-shot you, which is all of the time. You do get a little one-second survive-with-one-HP save when hit with fatal damage, but this is remarkably useless in a game with no non-murder-related healing and swarms of enemies spamming five kinds of death from all around you. Take cover? Good fucking luck. Look forward to a hovering douchebag in an office chair calling down a meteor shower on your crouching figure, from behind his cozy damage shield of course. Because having way too much health on basically all of the enemies past the midway point isn't enough! They need regenerating shields too! Do they need a healsphere to keep restoring those constantly? No! Of course not.

Oh but you get a shield power too! Some hovery rocks that sometimes, when they feel like it, prevent damage from the front. Oh and you can't do anything from behind them. Unlike Mr. Floaty Chair! Don't you just love it when every single entity in your power fantasy is objectively more powerful than you?

But then you get really in the zone, you focus, knock off objectives one after another, and make it to the last part of that Formation run that's going surprisingly well so far. Clock is ticking. You start the ""defeat enemy waves"" objective. Get to the last wave. Asshole with too much health, suicide bomber enemies all around, no surprise. You plink away at them with the biggest rocks you can convince your janky targeting to grab and toss. And, just as you're desperately scraping up some health granules so you don't die and doom your entire run, the timer runs out anyway.

I wanted to enjoy this game. I wanted to go ""I wonder why I stopped last time?"" I wanted to hear more of Ahti, the awesome kooky Finnish janitor.

Instead I found myself saying ""I remember why I stopped last time! It's because the game is not at all enjoyable to play!"" And you know what? That's not my fault. I've played shooters all my life. Finished Turbo Overkill on Hard, which you may recognize as ""non-trivial"" to say the least. I've played hard games, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Elden Ring, enjoyed them all. But what I don't find enjoying is a hard game that isn't fun. A game that leans more and more on unfair difficulty, on ""challenges"" related to ticking clocks and enemies you can't even SEE and spawning things in right underneath you or on top of you, all while splattering your whole screen red with its VERY stylistic VFX. Form must follow function - the art comes AFTER playability, and this is something that Control ignores completely.

870780,94831558,76561198082660436,0,45,4081,0,2573,1697908733,"Stylish action game with tense and creepy atmosphere, character development, abstract cerebral story that revolves around unanswered questions.

Presentation (5/5) - Character designs are very detailed and lifelike. There is not a lot of variety in the setting (the building, the astral plane) you play in, but it still does not matter given how well it is all designed and how much it adds to the atmosphere. The lighting effects look great with RTX and the action is stylish and colorful. The exploration phases can be creepy with the often present floating bodies and the fear you may be attacked. Battles are very stylish as should be expected from this developer, especially that paranormal weapons and abilities are part of it. The story doesn't make a lot of sense but its mystery and neo-noir vibe is captivating.

Story/Dialogue (4/5) - Most effective as a tool to enhance the atmosphere of the game and the human element of the two siblings is a bit grounding, but not with a great resolution. Dialogue is often cryptic and a lot of the story is written in the form of letters, audio logs, and particularly those unnerving hotline calls. The narrative is puzzling at times, the dialogue and writing a bit pretentious at times, and not being fully sure of what's going on all the way through the end can be a frustrating to the point you wonder why you are spending hours reading redacted notes, listening to tapes, and hotline calls with the previous director droning on and on for 2 minutes at a time. The story is probably too smart for its own good, but it tries to keep you interested in how it blends in with the gameplay.

Accessibility (good)- Game is reasonably challenging with the default setting, but players of varying skill sets can use difficulty sliders and aiming assistance tools to enjoy the game with the preferred amount of challenge. 

Gameplay (4.5/5) - The gameplay has many [minor] flaws, but the amazing execution of playing a character with all these paranormal powers and weapons compensate for these issues. Object manipulation, telekinesis, warping reality are not a new concepts in videogaming, but it works so well thanks to the exceptional physics in-game and how these paranormal abilities are essential to moving forward and winning battles. The gunplay is also very good and combined with these paranormal powers that assist you, combat never seems to overstay its welcome and certain boss fights are challenging in a good way. If I have to think of flaws, the most significant involves balancing issues. Enemies and bosses vary greatly in difficulty and cause the game to have severe fluctuations in difficulty and involve unfair battles where you could be killed in 1-2 hits. The weapons vary in usefulness, telekinesis gets buffed too much, and the personal and weapon mods you find are extremely unbalanced in terms of usefulness. That brings me to the other main issue - inventory management of 'mods' - you have a limited inventory for no apparent reason and come across hundreds of these mods, many of them too similar to each other. They try to help measure their usefulness in tiers 1-5, but the reality is that even some tier-5s are worse than some tier 3s or even 2s.",1625166464,1701133807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A perfect example is trying to understand the story and how to make sense of it. It's purposefully confusing, but complete. The connection between the other Remedy games and several references to other things made me excited to look a little more about the game after doing 100%.

The gameplay is introduced in a simple way. Shoot to kill, a few steps later you are flying around the room throwing objects and dominating enemies to fight for you in a war in the middle of an office. It's definitely something I didn't expect. Especially when the Dlcs introduced a ""SHUM"" Arcade mode and ""Jukebox"" expeditions.

The game's collectibles are separated in the most organized way I've ever seen. Obviously, in a game with a narrative at this level, a menu is necessary only for the collectibles you find.

The aesthetics from beginning to end maintain its atmosphere. The live action scenes make the experience much more immersive.

Looking at the simplest locations in the game makes you realize how much this is worked on in these games. The way you can make a bullet interact with any object is impressive. Everything is destructible and very real. Basically Control makes you see and do the surreal in a realistic way.

When I took the initiative to play on PC I already imagined that some type of error I would encounter. Fortunately I only found two bugs in a period of 40 hours in game. When an enemy didn't appear at all, forcing me to start over from the checkpoint.

 A common problem in AAA games, but unlikely to happen in a game nowadays. Most current games come with disastrous bugs. The dedication and refinement of the final product is everything, and that's exactly what control delivered to me.

One thing that almost made me spend a few hours researching to resolve it was a DX12 error where textures didn't load properly. Switching to DX11 I didn't encounter any problems, but I lost the newer graphics mechanics like DLSS and RT.

In the end, my experience was fantastic. The art direction is brilliant, the story is distorted but simple to understand in the end and the gameplay is addictive enough for me to want to spend hours in arcade mode.

A player character with powerful abilities that make you feel amazing but enemies are still a threat. The lore is so well-written that I feel like I have to find ALL the collectibles just to read everything.

It simply refuses to be exceptional in any way. Poor enemy variety and inconsistent spawn mechanics mean that combat feels simplistic and janky. Constant text and audio logs means that exploration is regularly interrupted. Unbelievably, catastrophically boring upgrade systems (+7% accuracy, really?) mean that player progress is dull beyond belief. Stutters and even a crash means that the technical experience is flawed.

But these aren't even the worst part of Control. The worst part of Control is how it squanders an interesting premise through hackneyed, uninspired storytelling. The writers have evidently never heard the phrase ""show, don't tell"", because every character in the game is CONSTANTLY spouting off exposition with zero regard for nuance. There's no room for intrigue or discovery because every character --ESPECIALLY the player character-- never stops yapping. Any sense of mystery is snuffed out by dialogue telling you exactly what's happening, or, even worse, an eye-roll attempt at quippy humor from the protagonist. This amateurish execution means that Control comes off more like Men In Black than a genuine paranormal thriller, and that's a shame.

I played for about 90 minutes and had a feeling that this game wasn't going to be that good, but I pressed onward because I wanted to give it a chance. I regret that now -- I should've followed my gut and refunded this when I could. I've now wasted both my time and my money. If you are dead set in trying out Control, get it during a steep sale like I did; it periodically drops from $40 to $10, which makes the purchase sting less. However, do not, I repeat DO NOT, buy Control at full price. Mediocrity pervades too many aspects of this game for it to be worth 40 of your dollars.

Control is a game by Remedy. Remedy have a pretty good reputation. They've made Max payne 1 and 2, which are easily in my top twenty games of all time. MAx Payne would be along the first ten and max payne two would be in the teens. One game that wouldn't show up on that list though is Quantum Break, which just lacked all of that Remedy Magic in favor of big actors and ''inter media ambitions''. Which really meant there were multiple 30 minute long, live action cutscenes that often had literally nothing to do with the main plot.

Control, on the other hand remembers to be weird, to have fun with its cast and visuals in a way that only remedy could pull off. Yet, I can't help not to be set ablaze by Control. Something about its level desing, something about the combat, something about the plot just bores me. I'm sad to say that Control might have the weakest story in a Remedy game. It doesn't have the brilliant, mysterious, perfectly structured tale of Alan Wake 1 and 2. Even Quantum Break had more going on.

But, I haven't even explained the who or what of everything, so let's back up. You play as Jesse? I don't remember her name, I think it's Jesse... Jesse is a lady with a secret imaginary friend who stumbles into the federal bureau of control. A place where everything paranormal is kept and where the building itself is a paranormal entity. So you go in and quickly you'll find the place deserted, except for Ahti the Janitor and the director who spends most of his waking moments filling paperwork and shooting himself in the brain.

But then you pick up his gun, everything goes white and you're taken into the tutorial-verse where tutorials happen. From these tutorials, you'll learn to fly, trow rocks, shield yourself like a pussy and dodge. You know I keep starting these reviews, I have like five scripts that I've begun, and none of this shit goes anywhere. I just want to play control, but instead I'm forcing myself into writing this crap.

I convince myself that I have stuff to say about a game, just because I happen to have strange feelings for it. But, when it comes time to communicate those feelings I can't bring myself to swear enough to get my message accross. I find control to be a bit underwhelming story wise. It definitely has more interesting lore than it does a main plot. For example, I'm replaying the game right now and, let me describe what's going on in the story. Jesse has to reactivate the big generator to get the elevator running... That's it. That's the plot of an entire level of Control.

Compare that with Alan Wake or even Quantum Break where the ongoing plot is always mostly interesting and intricate. Control just has a lot of nothing going on and hopes to fill the void with memos and funny recordings of stuff. In other Remedy games, the side stuff like the tv shows and various bits of lore building would be the cherry on top. But control is just a whole pile of cherries. Where's the ice cream remedy? I WANT MY ICE CREAM REMEDY! What I mean is that, story wise, there's little in therms of an ongoing mystery or constant drama.

Every twist and turn is far more digestible. There's no real ha-ah moments narratively, in Control. Which, I guess is fine, not every story by remedy has to be structured like Alan Wake. Sometimes sitting back, enjoying a bit of good lore and shooting weird abominations in the face is all you need. Which would normally segwey into how much I love the combat, but for some reason, I don't.

I find its monsters unappealing and its movement to lack weight or flow. I'm also not a fan of the mist effect when you kill an enemy. It has a tendency to obstruct your view and, while impressive, it ends up being more of an annoyance. aNOTHER WOULD BE COOL THING IS THE FACT THAT... Sorry I had caps lock on. Is the fact that the game gets rid of reloading... Sort of. You can't just fire to your heart's contempt, like the doom slayer. Instead, much like the original mass effect. Reloading works on a cooldown system.

You can fire your whole clip right away and suffer a long reload. Or you can wait a second or so and the bullet bar will refill on it's own. This halfway measure to reloading just isn't as satisfying as pressing a button. There's a reason why Mass Effect violently retconned the idea after one game.

Another thing I don't like is the lack of variety. None of the enemies stand out as introducing a clever twist on gameplay. The fanciest thing I saw was a black hole that healed the surrounding ennemies. And the environments, as beautiful as they may be, in their brutalist desing and their nearly perfect ray traced lighting. Running at a rock solid 60fps on a PC that struggled to maintain 20 fps in Alan Wake 2. In some way's it's impressive. But, it's all set in the same building and, as such, doesn't offer much variety. There's mines and more industrial environments. But all the desks and cubicles just blend togheter after a while.

Not to say that you'll get lost. Level desing does manage to make every room look unique enough to give a proper sense of distinction going from around one corner to the next. Since I'm not sure that sentence made sense; What I mean is the opposite of what I previously said. The game is varied enough in its level desing to, at the very least, get a sense of where you are and where you need to go. So the basics are there. But, on a greater sense, it does all visually blends togheter a lot.
Honestly, I don't know why I'm so harsh on Control. By comparison to other games like... You know, I tried coming up with a game analogous to Control that isn't made by remedy, and I can't. It's really unique. It's closest parallels would be super hero games. But, even then those don't tend to be shooters. I guess the closest comparison would be Doom. Against which the combat in almost every game doesn't stand a chance. One thing I can say is that I enjoy it a lot more than most games. So, in short, the combat is great. It's really fun and unique, the visuals are mindblowind and all that jazz.

I guess my problem is I expected more out of remedy. Which is insane because control is such a huge package. It has fat loads of content sprayed over everything. The facial animations are great, and the writing is on point. It's just that the structure of the story is lacking and the environments aren't that interesting. I can see why people would like Control. The game is quite the spectacle after-all.

But, when you're in it for the story and the main plot is a whole lot of nothing. Control can get pretty tiresome.
I feel like I'm starting to repeat myself a lot. So I'll cut this review short. If you like video games, you'll really like control. If you like remedy, you'll like control and if you're me, you'll also like control. Loving Control is less likely. I can't bring myself to love this game. 

Previously, I gave Alan Wake 2 an 8 out of 10 for technical issues and for it running the way it did. But, after replaying it the other day, it seems a lot of those issues might have been adressed. Because I struggled to get a framerate bellow 60. Whereas, before, the same encounters would barely reach above 40 fps, and that's with frame generation. So, if issues on the game are gonna be fixed that quickly, I feel like I have to update my score to a 9.

Control though, I'm not sure. My gut tells me it's an 8 out of 10 experience. But my gut doesn't have neurons. So I shouldn't listen to it. Let's put it on a scale. Let's do some math. For starters, I'd put control bellow Max Payne 2, which I would give an honest 87 out of 100. But, then I'd put it above Quantum Break, which I would give an 81%. So, let's say Control gets a 66 out of 77. Which is a pretty good score. 85.71% is nothing to scoff at.",1700625411,1700625411,True,0,0,0.466392308473587036,0,True,False,False

After playing it for a short while I can say that this game is fantastic. Control has a stylized form to it's narrative telling it through a mix David Lynch-esque atmosphere, and a blend of multimedia content. The story is about a lady named Jessie who is in search of her brother and finds herself inside of a secret governmental research facility known as the FCB (It's basically the SCP foundation, I mean it literally is, there's weird anomalous objects and shit with procedures on how to contain them, pretty cool stuff.). The gameplay is an RPG blended together with 3rd person shooting, well, shooting and some badass telekinesis powers, but I won't say anymore on that front. There is a good deal of mystery to the items that give you powers, and the story of the facility itself. The facility is fun to explore and pretty eerie at times. 

My one main gripe, and it's kind of a big one. my 1 main gripe... They have a graphical texture problem I really suggest looking into before purchasing it. Everything looks low poly. I am talking straight up PS1 graphics... THERE ARE PUZZLES I CAN'T EVEN SEE BECAUSE THE GAME IS RENDERING THE PUZZLES AT ONE 120 X 344 POTATOES! For whatever reason, the developers had the game render so there is only like 1gb of information on your screen at any given time, so Jessie ends up looking like a roblox character... DEVS, FIX THIS GAME! 

TLDR: Great game with an interesting story and fast paced telekinetic 3rd person shooting, but a major graphical glitch holds it back for me from giving it a recommendation to other people.

Now that we got official out of the way let me explain my reasoning. 

This game is could've would've should've. 

Coming from Quantum Break I had high expectations for this one, which made me really invested, however after the initial hook that game gives you, in a way that decent book gives you, nothing is there. And combine that with horrible difficulty and this is why I gave up couple of years ago. More than lack of duck, cover and some basic shooter maneuvers your weapons are horrible, so much that you wont get any semblance to any shooter game you ever played, and coming from people that made Max Payne this was really disappointing. Since then, I went back couple of weeks ago and I said, okay, we will just turn on assists and I wanna hear the story. However, that is when other problems began. Now I havent changed my 3070 since this game came out, and I remember I could have played this game on most setting with stable framerate, but the dips in fps are horrible now. It is one thing when you experience them in mid cutscene, but when you fps goes from 60 to 20 in high pace shooting area, you can understand why I got frustrated.

Other than technical issues, game severely lacks in story cohesion. I understand the theme is that you learn more the more you discover and are interested, but I was reading docs, watching videos, Dr Darling and everything, and you know what I got? I got that someone had a nice idea, but then he threw a bunch of concepts in just as a filler, and it stuck like crap on the wall. Not very good, not very polished.

If anything I love that Courtney had fun doing this. I really liked her in Quantum Break and I wanted to see more of the same in this game. However devs thought it would be good enough that she is in promos and voice materials, and didnt do a single cutscene with her in live action. 

Which brings me to next and final point. This game was taste of things to come. And if you played this one, you knew that Alan Wake 2 would not be good. Somehow in 70s setting you get a female protagonist, female sidekick (Pope), female kickass (Marshall). All men are bumbling idiots if they are friendly and creeps and evil if they are hostile. Even Jesses brother is displayed as someone who has 0 remorse toward what his sister survived and gave himself willingly to Hiss. I mean, come on. That is not how humans behave.

All in all, I'll stop rambling. Good idea, good concept, maybe good story somewhere but flaws make it... meh.",1700444924,1700444924,False,1,0,0.440618932247161865,0,True,False,False

In short, I would greatly recommend this game if you are to accept the following:
1. That you do not mind repetitive combat;
2. That you accept that this game sets up the world for a sequel than be its self-contained story and;
3. That this isn't a character-driven story and more so event-driven where you go from place to place with no breather (i.e if there is any meaningful development of side characters that isn't just Jesse at the end)
Overall, I would rate this atleast an 8/10 for its gameplay, world-building and performance.

In terms of performance, I played this on a MSI Sword 15 A11UD with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti with Intel Core i7, I fiddled with the settings before ultimately just leaving on the default GeForce Experience settings for the DX12 version, and I have hit a consistent 40-60 FPS even with RTX on
While I didn't stop to stare at the reflections, I still deeply admire the level of detail and PhysX at play that gives this game it's RTX standard label.

I hope Remedy and Microsoft get along and bring all these games back into one crazy story.  Bright Falls connection from Alan Wake in Control is fantastic. They were setting the ground work for Alan Wake 2 in Control. These games carry many references to each other. I'm not saying everyone of them are connected but dang there tons of small and big pieces of information reference through these games. These are Remedy connected universe of games??  I think it is.

[b]Positives:[/b]

- [b]Physics[/b]. The best part of this game. Almost everything can be destroyed. And it's fun.

- [b]UI[/b]. I like it, although some parts of it suck. Like the mod's description text size is so small it's hard to quickly see what your current mod and the new one do.

[b]Negatives: [/b]

- [b]Save system[/b]. It's just awful. The game would make saves every goddamn second whenever you do something, but if you die it teleports you to the nearest control point. There's no way to easily load any saves manually (like in many other games). Maybe console folks are used to it but as a PC enjoyer that just sucks.

- [b]Discouraging exploration[/b]. Usually, before jumping into the main story, I like to do some side quests or fck around to immerse myself into the world of a game. But this game makes it almost impossible to enjoy any exploration. First of all, this game is quite hard at times and there's no option to choose difficulty level. That would've been okay if not for the spawn system. Every fcking time you go anywhere the game would spawn enemies there. It doesn't matter if you cleansed it or not. The further you are the stronger the enemies (and their quantity). It's just so frustrating. If the game had an option to adjust the difficulty level, I could lower it for the exploration and raise it back once I'm done. 

- [b]Upgrades[/b]. It's just numbers. Weapon upgrades as well as your personal mods. Rare item has 19% of whatever and your existing uncommon one has 15%. You swap it and there's almost no difference because you will just get more enemies to shoot at. And for me, there's no point in creating those mods because you just find them everywhere.

- [b]Shooting all the time[/b]. This point follows from the previous ones. I get it, this game is all about shooting things. But OMG there's so much shooting. It becomes tedious. You trying to do some side quests and it's even more shooting. In the end, you're not even that excited about it.

- [b]Atmosphere[/b]. This one is subjective. I saw many people liked the atmosphere in this game, but for me, it just feels empty. I can't really immerse myself in it.

- [b]Story[/b]. For me, there's nothing catchy about it. The whole reason why Jesse comes to the Bureau is to find her brother. But apart from Jesse thinking ""Oh I really need to find my brother"", ""Finally, I can go find my brother"" and ""I hope my bother is ok"" there's nothing else. At least show me some god damn flashbacks so I can be more invested in this whole situation. Instead, I'm playing as a robot who's always mumbling about how important her brother is. Show, don't tell.

Try it yourself, maybe this game is for you. It didn't work for me, which is sad because I wanted to enjoy it. But I couldn't.

the combat and gameplay is so creative and satisfying. the telekinesis might be one of the best gameplay mechanics ever period. my only slight complaint with the gameplay (skill issue tbh) is that since there is so many different controls, things can get overwhelming and your fingers will hurt lol. so u should get a gaming mouse with buttons all over or get ready for finger cramps. 

the atmosphere & story is fantastic. the lore is so rich, its such a shame this game doesnt get enough recognition and have like 100 theory videos. there are so many secrets to explore and the atmospheric storytelling is amazing. it really does feel like you're in a government building, i constantly felt like i found things i shouldn't have. there was so much care put into every aspect of the world and i could spend a whole day wandering around. 

i really recommend this game if you like parkour games & nightmarish liminal aesthetics (like SCP, analog horror, backrooms, etc). it isn't really scary but there is a constant uncanny valley feeling, like you're lucid dreaming. but regardless i think everyone will enjoy it because it is really good. hope this game gets more attention someday",1700296211,1700296211,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Anyway Control bears no continuity to Alan Wake from what I can tell just that it is set within the world Alan Wake is set in. 
Control feels like a modern 3rd person shooter with a unique way of battling adversaries using a service gun that shapeshifts to become one of the (5) weapons: Pistol, Shotgun, Machine Gun, Sniper and Grenade Launcher.
The combat is smooth as a button, you tell Jesse to go she goes you tell her to stop and she does just that, none of that tanky movement where the player will come to a slow stop, it's instant, it's perfect!
The enemy types I think there's quite a few varieties tbf and you come across a couple different orders quite often to throw a wrench in the works to make the fights a tad more difficult.
Speaking of Difficult I haven't found a difficulty setting throughout my playthrough which can be a bit frustrating at times given you don't regen health overtime and enemies have ofc perfect aims almost all the time and fuck me the damage they can do. A swarm of maybe 3 enemies can overrun you in this game easily if you are not careful, the AI are very clever and they use everything to kill you. 
The physics are also a welcome addition in Control, almost like i'm playing a battlefield game when you hide behind cover the enemies will make sure to blow it up, you hide behind a pillar, you can be sure the enemies are going to blow it up and if not them using the launch ability to pick up rocks and boulders and pretty much everything in this game you can pull them from the stone and tear away the cover to fuck the enemies over...so diverse I love it!
The health regen is a pretty sadistic feature within control having your only form of healing generate by harming enemy hiss to make them drop shards? or health and then having to run for your life to go collect it only to die and be sent back to the last checkpoint OR survive and run back to cover now with less health than you began with...I had to mod this out and put health regen into the game. It just made no sense that this isn't a permanent feature.
Weapon control was another feature I didn't understand, swapping between weapons should have been 1-5 on the keys but it wasn't the Devs decided to lock it to F so you swap between just the two guns that you choose within your loadout...this also made no sense given the gun is made of some dimensional shit and just becomes a gun so I modded in 1-5 weapon changes to enable free-switching to the gun I desired rather than pulling the loadout up all the time over and over.
Weapon upgrades are another strange one, like you can upgrade using rare resources and your shards but it's so fucking expensive and the results hardly seem worthy, I upped my pistol and G launcher to LV3 asap and the pistol is still garbage and the G launcher is amazing and does tons of AOE dmg aswell as armor break, can't say much for the other 3 weapons though.
Storyline objective and mission markers - these are absolutely useless and there is no way to fix it, has no one had this issue or is it just me...I couldn't find the Jukebox without a YT video.
Overall Control is a fantastic game, it makes literally no sense if you pay no attention but it's a good game none the less, everything about it feels modern and upto date besides the aforementioned mods for QoL changes. 
Came across one black screen throughout my playthrough down in the medical wing, apparently it's due to DirectX12 (I was using 11) and Ray Tracing ( I never have RT on as it's such a pointless feature) but alas it still gave me a black screen, this is the only bug I came across.

It's not just a game; it's a journey that pulls you into a world of dimension-shifting battles, captivating characters, and a gripping mystery that kept me hooked from start to finish.

I liked the new protagonist (Jesse Faden) and stepping into the Federal Bureau of Control, with its many (many) twists and turns are nothing short of mind-blowing. The game skillfully blends power like telekinesis and material manipulation into a combat system that's nothing short of phenomenal, which reminds me a bit of one of their previous games, Quantum Break.

Visually, Control is a feast for the eyes, especially if you're lucky enough to experience it on a mid-to-high-end system that can handle a bit of ray tracing. The decision to open up the Remedy Connected Universe is evident in the DLC (AWE) and the game pays homage to the studio's past while hinting at a broader narrative that left me eager for more. I keep coming back to just run around this open sandbox for the endless side missions, however repetitive they can sometimes be.

Control is the start of a new era the studio behind it. I 1000% recommend it to anyone who wants a game that's a little different, visually breath-taking, and mechanically interesting.

to put it simply, you can't figure out where to go for over half the games quests and side quests and it is incredibly game breaking. it takes out all the fun of the game.

Badly designed early game experience: the game is incredibly difficult at the beginning, just after the very first tutorials. I restarted it out of frustration with the amount of losses (each death costing resources), only to lose 20+ times in the first large fight.

After you get past the early part though, things do improve, as you get the launch ability (mainly) and you learn never to stay in the same spot for long, and you also learn that dying a few times is basically normal.

The physics are nice, and the powers are fun, I recommend this game if you can stand some initial (1 hour+) early frustration, then the game does get better.

The story is crazy but fine, it more or less holds up at least for a while, then it gets extremely crazy and just a bunch of disconnected ramblings, but it doesn't matter: complete the puzzles, complete the missions, be powerful, win.

Remedy knows how to blend great storytelling with addictive combat in a way that so few studios seem to get right anymore. With every other developer out there seemingly laser focused on building online, live service titles, Remedy flies in the face of that by creating some of the best moment to moment action games we've seen in years.

Control is a third-person shooter with a strong focus on action and the spectacle of combat. You learn about all the weird things going on in The Oldest House along with Jessie as she tries to save her brother and stop an extra-dimensional invasion.

When I started Control for the first time, I didn't really know what to expect. Within the first 5 minutes I realized that I was in for something weird and special. Just in that first encounter with Ahti, I could tell that Remedy was setting up something incredibly weird and fantastical. I was hooked.

Control is a wacky ride. It's really unlike anything that you've seen before. It's a clever mix of action and suspense, with a hint of horror for flavor. It's not a scary game per se, but it does carry some genuinely creepy moments at times. It doesn't reduce itself to relying on jump scares. It's more in the oppressive architecture of The Oldest House, the otherworldly behavior of some of the Hiss enemy types, as well as some of the characters you'll meet along the way. It's never horror, for horror's sake.

Remedy really hit their mark with Control's combat. The inclusion of the telekinetic powers added that extra bit of flavor that most shooters need in order to stand out from the heard. Not only does Control stand out, it's one of the smoothest and best feeling combat systems I've seen in quite a while. The chuckle I get every time I throw a forklift at someone or something never goes away. Floating while yanking a section of wall out to send careening towards an advancing squad of Hiss is just 100% joy inducing.

For fans of action games with high production values, this is a must play. If you're not a fan of the horror genre, go into this one with the understanding that more often that not you're the most dangerous thing in the room. You'll find that you despite the horrific theme of Control, you have the means to absolutely devastate enemies and crush anything that comes at you.

control just oozes style, the vibes are immaculate, and the action gameplay is super fun. guns are satisfying to shoot and i don't think i could ever get tired of hurling handcarts and tables at enemies.

my only negatives are that the map is not the best and i got pretty exhausted with all of the backtracking and constant spawning of enemies. hopefully these things can be improved upon in the sequel, though the respawning enemies is clearly a design decision so i'm not holding my breath on changes there.",1699724340,1699724340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Room by room, I cleared every corner of the Oldest House hoovering up as much lore as I could - and the art design and direction made every inch of exploration worth it, while the game mechanics from weapons to enemies made that journey worth it. Honestly, the biggest problem with this game is there's not enough DLC - I need MORE of this world to explore. I finished a pretty thorough play-through in about 40 hours,  and at the end the only thing I wanted to know was when Control 2 was coming out. 

I'd note, Control also uniquely shows how to write strong female leads - by weaving compelling & believable people naturally into a good story. This is not WHY you should play the game - play it because it's awesome - but this shows the quality of world crafting that went into the game.  The fact all three of the main characters were women didn't even occur to me until well after I'd played the game & I was lore spelunking. I just considered Jesse, Emily, and Marshall cool-ass characters I wanted to see more of. Nobody seemed jammed in afterwords or like a cringey ""girl boss"" marketing ploy.

[*]Basically if there is something in this game you cannot interact with its the floor you are currently standing.
[*]Massive amount of weapon combinations, starting with shotgun wannabe sniper rifle, ending with grenade launcher that can nuke the whole room including yourself. 
[*]Insanely well-built skill tree giving you options to play several builds by mixing up powers together. 
[*]Story is really thrilling and more transparent than Alan Wake that gives you some sort of clearance on future of the next game.
[*]Loved the touch with post-credits content where you can roam and just enjoy slaying stuff around, in a styhle any classic RPG game.

Story and characters were very weak to me. Except for Ahti and the Board. Like the interesting weirdness there. 

Gameplay had some cool points but it just did not have enough for me, which can be the case in other games, but gameplay is the focus in Control. Some cool elements in the gameplay like the Ash Tray Maze. The game needed more of that. Cool fun moments instead of corridor after corridor of through pieces of concrete at never ending re-spawning drones.

It is a beautiful game! Amazing destruction effects that I would have drooled over as a kid. I still kind of do.

I have been playing through the Remedy games so I can fully enjoy Alan Wake 2, and this one was such a surprise for me. If you are a fan of SCP, Metroidvania's, and third person shooters, this is the game for you. I have never been a fan of games that I would consider ""Experimental"" As usually they end up being so far up their own ass that I can't fully enjoy them. But this is certainly a bit of an experimental game, that still knows how to have fun, and not take itself too seriously like a lot of experimental games end up doing. 

If I had to say one issue I had with the game, it would be the main story, while the world building and the lore featured in the game in top notch, the story itself is pretty lackluster and ends on a bit of a wet fart. I have not finished the DLC yet, so maybe they wrap up some things in the DLC missions. Even if they do, this doesn't change the main story being pretty mid. But everything surrounding the main story is so interesting and cool, that I honestly forgot about it being so lame, since I was so invested in learning about the world and it's history.

Overall, if I had to put a number to it, I'd give it a 9/10.

Combat shines because of the destructible props in the environment and the sound design, the enemies are ok, there's not much variety to be found but the game isn't that long.
Graphically, the game is great and runs flawlessly too.
The game has more lore than actual plot, you find out about Ordinary and whatnot, but that's a small fraction of the focus of the game. Almost all text logs, audio logs and videos add to the lore of the universe the game takes place in, rather than being directly connected to the main plot.
The side quests you're given are good as long as they involve the (totally not) SCPs, while the rest are just ""go kill X dudes in Y area"".
The game could've done without that shitty crafting system based on random drops for both resources and crafted mods. You're better off using the save editor to skip the grinding for resources, since some are tied to the random events that show up around once an hour.
The acting is good in the live action videos, while ingame the voice acting does a good job, but the characters are pretty lifeless.
The game kind of ""just ends"", which makes sense since there's barely any plot to go off of, and gets a slight continuation in the 1st dlc, which unfortunately sucks.
In the ""Foundation"" DLC you get 2 very situational powers that aren't usable outside of the new area. Said new area is just a set of caverns, there's really not much going on. The ending of this DLC sets up a sequel, which I hope will have a proper plot since the basics of the universe were set in this game.
The second DLC is ""AWE"", which further ties Control to Alan Wake, and sets up Alan Wake 2 in its ending. You get a new weapon in this one, which you can actually use outside of the DLC, good job. The environment is a division of the Oldest House instead of a set of caves, meaning they took advantage of it by adding more Objects of Power and Altered Items as side content of the area. The side content is pretty short but at least it plays off the quirky nature of SCP inspired stuff.
If you're interested in learning more about the Remedy universe this game is great, but you'll have to read through all the text logs and listen to the audio logs and watch the videos, as not much gets explained in the actual plot. If you're in for an engaging story without needing to hunt for collectibles and read them, then you should play Alan Wake 2 instead, since Remedy seems to really have learned from the mistakes they made in this game, just don't give Epic any money if you do play it.
It's an 8.5/10 game, because I read through all the collectibles I found. It would be a 7 without them, the review would be ""good combat, shit story which at least doesn't last long"".
I look forward to Control 2, even if they copy this one, it won't be worse than an 8.",1651759984,1699282377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Control is a masterpiece of a game that captivated me from start to finish. Remedy Entertainment has outdone themselves with this paranormal thriller, delivering an experience that is both visually stunning and intellectually stimulating.

First and foremost, Control's narrative is an intricate tapestry of mystery, intrigue, and psychological exploration. You play as Jesse Faden, who finds herself in the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) while searching for her missing brother. The story unfolds in a non-linear fashion, leaving you constantly questioning the nature of reality and the true motives of the FBC. It's a narrative that will keep you guessing until the very end, and it's a testament to the game's unique storytelling.

The setting, the Oldest House, is a character in itself. This brutalist skyscraper is a labyrinthine masterpiece, constantly shifting and defying the laws of physics. It's a place where nothing is as it seems, and exploring its nooks and crannies is an adventure in itself. The attention to detail and world-building is extraordinary, immersing you in a world that feels both real and surreal simultaneously.

Control's gameplay is where it truly shines. Jesse's supernatural abilities are a joy to wield, and the combat is a perfect blend of telekinetic powers and gunplay. The flexibility in combat scenarios keeps things fresh, and the progression system allows for customization of abilities to suit your playstyle. It's a power trip like no other, and taking on the otherworldly enemies of the Hiss is immensely satisfying.

The audio and visual design of Control is nothing short of breathtaking. The brutalist architecture, the eerie lighting, and the ambient sounds create an atmosphere that is both haunting and beautiful. Jesse's internal monologues and the way the story is delivered through documents and recordings add depth to the experience. The game's use of brutalist architecture is a bold choice and adds a unique and unforgettable dimension to the gameplay.

Control is not just a game; it's a work of art. Its impeccable fusion of narrative, gameplay, and atmosphere makes it a standout title in the world of gaming. It's a journey that challenges your mind, immerses you in a captivating world, and leaves you pondering its mysteries long after the credits roll. If you're a fan of immersive, mind-bending experiences, Control is an absolute must-play. It's a testament to the creative potential of video games and a reminder of why we love this medium.",1699274131,1699274131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visually it's striking.  There is no denying this.  This is a showpiece of visual tech and it performs well too.  The gameplay’s core is based around your character’s telekinetic powers, which are great fun to use.  Hovering, throwing up a shield, picking up office equipment and launching it at enemies is a blast.  The problem is, you die in about three hits from anything, you’re constantly being swarmed by mobs attacking from all directions (including the air) and your weapon is practically useless compared to your other attacks. Boss fights are absurdly difficult too.   It’s ridiculous.  Another huge problem is navigation.  It is frustratingly difficult to navigate. I felt constantly lost and the in-game map is awful.  Using a walkthrough or looking up videos on how to get somewhere are regular things you’ll have to do.  Lastly, I couldn’t tell you what’s actually happening with the story. 

This is the first Remedy game I cannot recommend. I’ve loved their work before with Max Payne, Alan Wake, and Quantum Break.  The only feeling I have for this game is frustration, because simple changes could’ve made it so much more enjoyable.

All that being said, both expansions are much better than the base game since they're more focused and smaller scale experiences.  The Alan Wake story tie in is great.",1599941738,1699256056,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But on the other hand it kind of lost me a lot of times...

The graphics are phenomenal, no complaints there.
It ran quite smoothly even on my GTX 1060 - sometimes the environment would look muddy
and low detail, but I am pretty sure this is because of my old graphics-card.

The gameplay felt nice, moving around, shooting, using abilities.

The artistic value of some of the scenes in the game is incredible.

And maybe I went in with the wrong expectations, but this game, to me, felt way
too much like a very ""videogamey"" 3rd Person Action shooter.
I was honestly expecting a much more story intensive and lore-rich game.

I wanted to immerse myself in this world, see all the absurd things that might be going on in the ""oldest house"",
and learn about the bureau and the characters in it, but while all of it was there, kind of, none of it was really fleshed out.
Maybe it's because of the setting - that they just bit off more than they could chew - that all these characters and micro storys about powerful mysterious objects were too much for any of them to get enough detail... But I don't know honestly.

The graphics and sounddesign really pulled me in, but then I found myself opening lootbox-like upgrade containers everywhere, and applying 5% damage boosts to my gun... my inventory got full with these upgrades all the time, so i had to throw them out on a regular basis. That really dragged my immersion down.

The battles were quite epic in terms of setting, world destruction etc, but then the game just started throwing more and more enemies at me while i just wanted to explore, and the more upgrades i found, the higher the level of the enemies got, so in the end, I didn't really feel like I was getting stronger, I just got more options on how to approach a situation.
Whenever I backtracked to a location, to see if there was something I had missed, I was always worried that I would have to defeat a bunch of randomly spawning enemies until I could really take my time and look around.
They felt more like an artificial obstacle to occupy you for some minutes, and not like a truely fun experience.

While I thought this game would offer up a variety of different weird threats, it also just seemed to throw enemies of the same faction at you all the time, with a bunch of variations of it. In the end, the threat was basically red glowing corrupted humans, which works for a while - but I would have wished for some more variety. Abstract geometrical shapes are also not really my thing for enemy design... I am more of a creature horror guy.

Objects of power were also just regular props, a fridge, a clock, a party balloon, and while I know thats what its like in a lot of scp stories, that was honestly also a little bit disappointing. (except for the fridge maybe).
A lot of it is just you seeing these things through a glass pane in containment rooms, but they dont do anything, you can just read up short reports about them. And these reports really just represent one vague snippet of what an object does or did, and thats all the backstory you get for it. Many words in lore collectibles are also blacked out - on one hand this may be to let the player imagine what they actually say, on the other hand it just felt like they didn't have the time to think of the details and just left those passages blank.

The main story was also.. messy.. Jesse, the main character, was never really introduced and you had to piece her goals together over time, leading to me not having any clue on what she was really looking for and why. She also seemed to have an inner monologue 90% of the time, when she coud just say stuff out loud and actually communicate. The bureau employees just offer some exposition and thats basically it. The story wrapped up quite abruptly and with no real logical resolve.


All in all... beautiful looking game, fun abilities, interesting concepts.

But after a while, it can be a little dull, when the wow-effect of the graphics has faded,
and the redacted lore files feel more like short bits of something that doesn't really have much meaning.
In general, a lot of things didn't make sense to me at all - and while a good story always leaves blanks
to be filled with your own imagination, this story just had many holes in it.

Bonus points for the janitor and the music labyrinth sequence.

Maybe it was just the wrong time and mood for me to play this.

Story was disappointing as well. Much better narratives exist that are ""weird,"" albeit not normally in games. A lot of the game is told in the collectibles you find, which slaughters the pacing of the game. Showing, not telling, would have been appreciated. 

Also, the documents being redacted are obviously modeled after SCP Foundation online fiction, but this doesn't make sense.

[h1] The Game [/h1]
Third-person shooter/action game where you (Jesse) must prevent the Hiss from getting out into the world. 

[h1] The Achievements [/h1]
Most of the achievements are unlocked passively when playing through the main story + DLC:s. There are some that require some grind and collectibles but there is nothing that can be considered difficult. Be aware that some achievements may potentially bug out, which may result in resetting part of your progress. There are guides and tips available and the game completes in around 25 hours.

[h1] Recommendation [/h1]
A interesting story with intriguing gameplay and a very solid world/level design. With its supernatural setting and excellent narration, Control feels both like a movie and a game in itself. On top of that, the achievements feel quite enjoyable to complete and nothing stands out as being particularly tedious or difficult (even if there is a risk of some of them bugging out).

Perhaps an issue with facial capture or the lip syncing animation. I liked the spooky atmosphere, abstract environmental design clashing with the drab office setting, and the gameplay felt solid, with a few simple puzzles instead of straight combat all the time. The weapons felt good, though the equipment system is modern trash ""% increase to damage"" ""%extra energy when you punch something"". Only the unique mods that you get during the Alan Wake expansion that drastically change weapons are interesting at all beyond simply raising damage.

I'd recommend it on sale, it's a fairly solid experience, with good atmosphere, exploration, and gunplay with a bit of a fizzle on enemy variety and narrative impact at a couple of points.

Both the pure graphical quality, but especially the astonishing art direction, mostly inspired by brutalism with splashes of vibrant colors. The sound design here is also some of the best I have heard. Where I would have wanted more though is in the music. It is not bad, but a bit underwhelming, which is a feeling that persists through many aspects of this game.

The gameplay is very fun, but not that varied. I love launch alot, one of the most satisfying abilities in any game (especially the sound that plays when grabbing objects, superb). Super nice feedback and dynamic due to the physics system. But that was what I used throughout. That and two variants of the pistol through the whole game. Sure they are all satisfying, but it can get a bit repetitive. Same with the enemies. There are quite alot of different enemies, which I appreciate, but you dispatch them in the exact same ways, or at least I did. But the satisfying nature of your combat abilities managed to not get old at least. Also I am not that big of a fan of the different ""upgrade parts"" you get. It is just the same old +10% damage etc. stuff that I find a bit bland. At least the numbers get somewhat high so that you actually feel some sort of progression.  

I love exploring the oldest house as well. It is basically a metroidvania and takes some surprising inspirations from Dark Souls of all games. The different side quests and stuff you can find around are just super fun and varied. I reeeeally love interacting and reading about the different objects of power. I actually loved reading about anything I could find in the game, which is not something I usually do. Very few games have managed to make me want to search out collectible documents, and this is one of them.

The story is where I am most split. I really like what the narrative is about, beyond the main characters goals, but due to what it is about it feels like it will always be inherently unsatisfying. I found it super engaging throughout though, with great characters and a super cool setting. It just did not stick the landing for me. There are a lot of super cool and weird stuff in this game, mostly due to its inspiration SCP, but there are barely any answers for anything, or at least a satisfying amount of information about this stuff. I get that it is what they are going for, and I do like that, but I feel they could have given us just a little bit more sometimes. Or maybe I really just want a more satisfying story for the main character, as it ends super abruptly and I did not really care about her story unfortunately. 

I really love the vibe, style and so much about this game, but I do feel a bit unsatisfied in the end due to these different things I brought up. But wow does it do the good things well. Totally recommend!

This ""game"" is a long avante-garde, slow-paced film, with Lynchian storytelling mixed with Lovecraftian lore, encased in some of the most gorgeous, beautifully rendered brutalist interiors I've seen in a game or real life. Clearly inspired by American mid-century offices, the setting for the Bureau is cold, not lived in, but worked in. I can't think of another game that has a setting like this and for it to expand vertically, instead of laterally, is what makes this setting truly unique. Story-wise and setting wise, the idea of such a solid space being filled with secrets tucked away by concrete and keycards makes every new room more intriguing -- you really feel that you're not suppose to be there, but the entire premise boils down to ""well, its all your problem and jurisdiction now"", which is appropriately nonsense in-tandem with the nonsensical dialogue. But this game is dense in all directions; nothing is dense and unfounded, nonsense all becomes sense with time. Control does an amazing job with visually storytelling, but it's also filled to the brim with wittily written collectables that add so much. I think it does detract from he experience to not read them, as it provides context unfounded otherwise to a lot of mysteries, but it's intimidating. I mean, there has to be thousands of collectables, right? It's pretty thoughtful in it's rewarding of exploration, with both tangible items for gameplay and a little something else to flesh out the hollow hallways otherwise. This game is reminiscent of the Souls formula at times, with it's ""if you thinks theres something, there probably is"" approach to exploration, but thats not the only allegory. I mean, I assume the Bonfire-esque checkpoints and respawning enemies and losing of resources upon death(though theres no pickup) are at least tangentially related to the Souls influence of gaming. Control is very much its own game though, one that doesnt have to be so good for such an obscure story. With this being a very vague sequel to Alan Wake, to then something more direct in the DLC, you can just image this as a survival horror instead and I wouldnt be surprised if it started as one. Instead it's the jedi game you've always wanted -- why?? I dont know why they took it in this direction, but it's fantastic. The gameplay is great and inventive for no necessary reason other than to be fun and I'm assuming also for Jesse to continue to be a domineering force in this new Alan-connected universe they've created, as opposed to Alans inherent power being locked in this metaphysical body of his, which is still ripe to being killed. Alan wouldn't survive Control, that's for sure. So really, it enables this game to be a lot more grandiose, sometimes feeling limitless with your abilities and the setpieces it allows you to traverse. There's something truly unique about the perspective you can take on these realised locations and that goes down to the rendering of materials and their destructability. The material breaking in this game is unbelievable -- seriously,  how the hell does this even run with such insane rendering techniques already? These solid materials are confining, familiar and Jesse's ability to tear them apart with such ease is another great analogy for her tearing down the walls and getting answers for whats going on, and why it has to be her to do it. This is all wrapped together with some of the most interesting explanation for things, for questions that didnt even really need to be answered to. Back to the gameplay, my only real criticism is that even though it's so fun, this is ostensibly a long art film, where theres a point where I just wanna walk around, look at things and find out whats going on. The challenge also ranges significantly; the combat and puzzles really only becomes difficult in the fantastic DCLS's. I assuming Remedy didnt want to assume too much, but they learned in the DLC's where there's a couple pretty annoying combat encounters and at least one puzzle so absurdly obtuse I had to look up the answer to where I found out, yeah, nearly nobody was able to figure this out. The DLC also introduces some pretty incredible new powers, environment and a diversity between the two that are yet again vertical explorations, one focusing on the monolithic and the other the dark -- it's worth not looking more into it before playing.

I'm so happy this game exists and what's setup in it already, as well as the DLC's makes me even more excited for Control 2 and Alan wake 2, to see how this universe continues to evolve.

I'm late to the party with Control because I've been out of PC gaming for a while and didn't want a ""compromised"" experience on consoles.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] In short, I think this might be the smoothest movement Remedy has ever put into a 3rd person shooter. Jesse Faden moves incredibly fluidly from the get go, and within 5 minutes of playing this game, I was at home with moving around the battlefield. As the game progresses and you get more movement options as well as more weapons, it only gets better. I've long held a love for Max Payne and Max Payne 2, but this game is absolutely Remedy's top flight work in making a fluidly playing protagonist.

[b]Story:[/b] If you want to have a trippy experience filled with bureaucratic, government conspiracies: you've got a great option here. The story starts with you and Jesse both confused with what exactly in the blue-hell is going on, but the story slowly starts getting you in on the more supernatural (parautilitarian friendly) aspects of the happenings around you and you start to get sucked into the intrigue. If you care about a story that you have to learn a little bit of the game's language to appreciate: I think you will find a good bit to like here.

[b]Final Word:[/b] If you're looking for a 3rd person shooter with heart, a sense of humor, and more than a dash of X-Files style government allusions, I think you'll find plenty to love here.",1698730992,1698730992,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm 20 hours in and still have no idea why I'm here or what I'm doing. Just going to the next area cause that's what the map says to do. Combat is decent, a bit too hectic for my taste. I prefer a bit of strategy, this games very go, go, go. Don't bother with crouching to trying to get cover, you'll just get hit more. Just sprint around and kill everything asap. Max out the health upgrade first. Your character dies if someone sneezes near her. My biggest problem is navigating the game and maneuvering the character. You get a new mission and spend 25 to 30 mins trying to navigate a poorly designed map, running through previously cleared areas, clearing out previously defeated enemies, to dodge too far or not far enough, miss a landing, fall off a ledge, or whatever and die. Then respawn at the start of the mission and spend another 30 mins navigating back. Puzzles and navigation challenges have a game testing level of design. literally a big empty black room with no environment, just platforms and blocks you have to jump to. Pick up this block, put it in that hole kind of simple. They take 10% of your total upgrade points as a consequence for dying so upgrading becomes a grind fast. You lose hours of your life running and all level up points you got fighting everything in your way to get back to the obstacle to try and land a jump right. The last two or three times I've played I've spent half an hour navigating, died, then shut it down for another month. It's quick to remind me why I stopped playing in the first place. I don't have hours to waste running in circles. There's better games, with better stories, better combat, that stay exciting, and aren't a chore to progress.

Love it cause it's such a brilliant game but hate it cause I suck at scary games. 

While this isnt really a horror game inherently, that sense of claustrophobia mixed with flying solo doesnt help the case. And to add on top of that the enemies are rather creepy if not scary and the constant chanting/talking in the background always makes you feel like either someone if watching you or there are enemies lurking around the corner. 

No area is safe as in any combat zone there can/will spawn an endless waves of enemies as long as you are there.

On the plus side, the story is captivating, the weapons are solid and fun to use, the supernatural powers are fun to fiddle around with and the probably the best part is that the game doesnt hand hold you. It will tell you what to do next but will not tell you where and how to get there. You are on your own finding your way through the maze of a facility.

Control is a mind-bendingly bizarre game that lets you delve into a paranatural events and experience powers and abilities normal people couldn't even imagine. This game mixes strange and crazy ideas with a remarkably robust and vast arsenal, making it possible to enjoy this game in a variety of ways while enjoying every single paranatural ability you unlock. The visuals are stunning and the gameplay is amazing, yet the story is confusing and requires more than one playthrough.
The Visuals are remarkable. Control was one of the first major titles to utilise real-time ray tracing and dlss, but you would never know. It has been implemented perfectly. While you only really start noticing the lighting in the second expansion as light is a major player in that one, the graphics throughout the entire game are stunning. From a room swallowed by red to the open sky of a black quarry, it is very impressive and beautiful.
The Gameplay is insane. You start with just a gun that reloads itself, and throughout the game pick up other abilities such as force throw, dashing, converting enemies to fight for you, converting the ground into a floating shield and even flying. Mixing all of these in combat is so much fun and it feels so smooth, everything just works so well!
The Story is confusing but still very enjoyable. You play as Jesse Faden, who has been looking for her brother since she was a young child. While some of the revelations throughout the story are great, some require a lot of reading to make sense, and even then some points don't. Even after finishing the story you will still have questions about what you experienced. Unfortunately there are also some progression bugs where if an enemey wont spawn or has clipped through the wall you will have to restart from the last checkpoint which can be frustrating. Some areas are also really badly marked and you can easily get lost.
Overall, Control is a fun yet crazy experience that for some reason you will always enjoy when going to play it. The vast arsenal of ways you can fight your way through every level never gets old, and the expansions only make it more fun, expanding on the amount of action you can experience (and add to the confusion!).
Control gets a 7/10.

The graphics are phenomenal, especially the physics / destruction simulation and the ray-tracing. It runs REALLY well for how good it looks on my 3070 Ti + 5800X3D + 32GB RAM + installed to an NVME SSD, playing at 1080p high refresh rate (no DLSS), everything maxed including RT and MSAA etc. I get 60 FPS minimum but usually around 80 - 100+ FPS.

Story is kind of whacky / non-sensical, but it is ""fun""/quirky. Nothing wrong with that! It fits this game.

Gameplay is where this really shines though, when you have all the powers and some upgrades and variations to your gun the combat is a lot of fun.

Exploration is another area this game shines. Exploration is rewarded a lot, with lots of item pick-ups which allow you to upgrade your character, your abilities, and your gun in lots of ways. The facility is also beautiful with many varied locations but everything also fits together thematically / artistically. 

Keyboard and Mouse controls are really good especially with a little tweaking to key/mouse binds. Really good PC port, lots of options and good performance, no stuttering either (at least on my rig).

I definitely do recommend this game. It is apparently on the shorter side, but these days you should be able to get a really good deal on this game on sale, making it a no-doubter for players who enjoy Third Person Shooters with a really interesting setting to explore.",1697918166,1697918166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Remember that show? No? Oh come on! It was good! *sigh*

Jokes aside, ""Control"" is a REALLY good game. Remedy Entertainment, the developers, have an almost Gaiman-esque gift for writing high-level cosmic metaphysics in a way that compels a narrative. There is a STRONG supernatural element here, and I don't just mean pervasive. I mean everything in the setting and story revolve around its central conceit in a way that works together perfectly.

The action gameplay is enjoyable, though it does get a bit old after a while. Not for a lack of trying to add new tools to your kit. ""Control"" has a progression system... just not a terribly interesting one. Had they stripped out the upgrade mechanics entirely it wouldn't have mattered all that much. But for what it is the combat is fast-paced and handles beautifully. You'll still die to flying enemies that spawn behind you, though.

Exploration of the setting is extremely fun. There's secret areas scattered throughout and TONS of lore to uncover. If you don't like stopping to read or listen to stuff you're going to miss out in this game. ""Control"" rewards the patient with an incredible depth of history, philosophy, and paranatural metaphysics. This game's lore is so deep it's not even contained to this particular game! See report [spoiler]Alan Wake[/spoiler] for details.

Honestly, my biggest complaints about ""Control"" are that I don't feel like it sticks the landing with its endings. None of the three - main story, 'Foundation' DLC, an 'AWE' DLC - feel like they have really satisfying conclusions. For the main story, it kinda feels like it ends without a real decisive victory. With 'Foundation' there is a victory, but the boss battle actually feels bad to win. Probably by design. Finally 'AWE' feels like it'd work better in a different game (for reasons that'll be obvious once you've played it) and ends up not feeling right because it's a horror story told AFTER you're a completely overpowered parautilitarian force of nature who is rightfully no longer afraid of anything.

By contrast, the biggest praise I can heap onto ""Control"" is that it's a game full of great and profound ideas that'll stick with me LONG after I've put it down. There's not a lot of games that I can say that about.

Then imagine that you are summoned to their headquarters by mysterious forces and bond with these paranormal objects to get superpowers. It's hard to really convey how much I love this game.

The graphics, obviously are stunning, with ray tracing enabled (playing with RTX 3070 ti at 2k with DLSS averaging about 80-fps on max settings, so not a light load, by any standards), combining this with the mind-bending areas, this is a visual treat! The audio fits perfectly, nothing feels overwhelming, or out of place at all.

Story-wise, its not quite a straight line; you have a bunch of well made side missions, that open up other quests, all with their benefits, and the main quest just keeps on giving... I thought it had come to an end hours ago, but given how much of a brain-fuck this game can be, I should have seen it coming... The story itself can be a little confusing, but there are loads of little collectables lying around, that open up/explain various plots, or provide alternate insights, or are just simply hilarious. can take a while to read through them, but its normally only 2-3 small paragraphs at a time, on a subject that is relevant to the area of the building you are in, so everything sits in place perfectly. these normally take the form of either research documents, letters and such, or audio recordings, or video tapes, so it is not exactly a demanding task to have viewed all the bits lying around!

Game play is great, the controls took me a while to get used to, thinking about when I need to spend energy on a shield, and when to use it to rip something out of the wall and launch it into the enemies, or shield myself with debris... there are lots of different options for ways to engage enemies, and the is no benefit to sticking to one. the more you use, the more powerful you are; its a very well balanced system!

I have has so many moments where the has been plot twists in the story that have been far better than any film or TV show I have watched, or appendixes that I have read/listened to/watched that have made me laugh out loud, or creeped me out for days, combat encounters that have made me stop and plan out my every move after dying enough times to realise that ""gung-ho"" is not going to work this time around. Whoever wrote this was a creative genius, with a brilliant sense of humour, able to weave seemingly irrelevant details from one part of the story back into itself so far down the line it hits like a truck when you make the link.

I have only just made it into the investigations sector, so I cannot comment on the entirety of the game, but what I have seen so far makes me think I have many more hours to put into this before I can claim to be ""finished"" with it. So many areas that are clearly the way they are for a reason, I just need to explore deeper to be able to loop back and fully access/appreciate them! Not a game to spend 20 minutes at a time in!

Graphics: Easily 11/10 if your computer is butch! (IMO looks better with DLSS on, and it triples the FPS which doesn't hurt either!)
Story: 10/10. I would give it every creative writing award going.
Combat: 10/10 A good challenge, while being easily beatable to those willing to think about it, and approach creatively!
Progression: 9/10 Sometimes isn't perfectly clear where to go, as you are lead to the area you need to be in, but always have to figure out what to do by yourself! Doesn't take long to figure it out, but can leave you clueless in some hidden puzzles...
Bugs: 10/10 only encountered 1 so far, and being able to shoot in areas you cannot normally shoot in is hardly game-breaking!
Mind-Fuckness: YES/YES. probably what I love the most about this game, never 100% sure whats coming next. Or if what just happened ACTUALLY just happened, or if my new graphics card has melted yet, or if the level is actually sideways and the speech backwards or if you are still tripping from the last plot development, or which dimension of reality I will find myself in in 20 seconds time...

If you like games that are many layers deeper than if it moves: shoot it until it doesn't, give this a try! Intelligent sense of humour, witty writing, characters that actually seem like people, not NPCs! 90% positive on steam is disgraceful for this masterpiece.

Story is not good. It's a clever concept, but it leaves way too many loose ends (it doesn't even end!). Most important things aren't actually explained and those that are force you to read redacted collectibles.

You fight to protect the thing in your head, but you feel no attachment to it. When your allies (really can't call them friends) die, you don't care since you've spent no time at all by their side. The tie in Alan Wake DLC is great, though it makes no sense. The foundation DLC has some interesting gameplay changes, but it feels unfinished.

Honestly, had much more fun doing the small neatly closed side quests than the maze full of dead ends that is the main plot.

The design of the game is great. Be it sound, level, or graphics.

This game feels like a book self published by someone incredibly wealthy. It's not well writen, but boy did the author spend a lot of money to make it feel good to look, touch and read it.

-Voice Acting isn't the best

-The map is actually the worst fucking thing, like, this is the worst map I have ever seen in a video game. It's downright dogshit

The AWE dlc is alright. It's kind of just one big chase with a few interesting lore bits. I haven't played Alan Wake so maybe I didn't find it to be a fantastic experience like some others would? The entire area for this dlc was really well done. It was also scary (imo at least, maybe I'm a coward lol). I never wanted to be on the ground and was always sprinting towards the light
The Foundation dlc is the best one by far. It adds onto the game and acts kind of like an epilogue? It sets up some stuff for the sequel and gives you a lot to think about. I found it to be one of the best parts of the game. The lore is unreal with how many questions and theories it gives you. I don't mean that in a bad way either.

The story isn't the best but the lore and setting are what makes it worth playing. I would recommend getting it on sale. It's got a lot of content but I wouldn't advise dropping $40 on it.

Those complaining about the story are probably just upset that they had to actually use their brainpower to follow the characters story and how it fits into the world and the fact that there isn't someone directly telling you what to feel means ""uhhh story was meh"" apparently. No one looks at the shining and says ""Um okay? So what hes dead and they get away? How boring"" Stop being so dense about actually unique and interesting games people.

This game has touches of lovecraftian stuff, in the style of true detective, if it took place in an SCP-lite world.
And SCP-lite is not a negative statement, in fact i think more things should be SCP-lite. Modern SCP stuff is so self serious or completely fandomized that this is a humongous breath of fresh air. While unfair to compare this to all SCP articles ever writtin, i still believe this games worldbuilding clears a majority of more popular story collections. Characters in the SCP foundation could only be characterized in a few sentences or paragraphs and through cross-community writing only. This game allows for consistency throughout the characters and allows you to read the motion capture to get a clearer picture of who they are. The game gives you room to explain things for yourself and figure it out at your own pace. it is the Antithesis of those Ending Explained videos. For example, Ahti the janitor, is never properly explained (I havent done the cleaning quests). But this does not bother you, because you learn that he has a very specific connection to the oldest house and begs the question, is he a part of the board? Or another entity that can only be explained by his role as The Janitor, and whats the furnace? is the furnace the real Ahti? Is he the Astral Plane equivalent of a Vulture? It is far more interesting for it to be unexplained. 

Im going to retread here, i genuinely cannot understand the ""boring"" argument. Im certain the writers go out of their way to avoid rescue movie tropes and action adventure tropes and i think its unpredictability got to people in the wrong way.

Also if youre docking a solid 1 to 2 points because of the ending, you like to be fed slop and have a full belly of it and your mother does too. Think bigger.",1696871553,1696871553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Jesse Fadden--a young woman with a hidden voice in her head and a paranormal incident in her past--arrives at the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) and finds herself as the new director and the building on lockdown as it's invaded by an extra-dimensional force ... and the ghosts of her past come back to haunt her. 

At heart, Control is a limited open-world third-person shooter. Controls are pretty standard and familiar, with WASD movement, mouse guiding the camera, left/right clicks for weapon usage and aiming, and action buttons for powers which Jesse acquires at various points, which include launching objects at foes, levitating, and a lightning-fast dash to evade attacks.

Taking place in entirely in the ""Old House,"" the FBC's headquarters, Control shares a universe with the game Alan Wake, and the stories loosely tie together later in the game, which is kinda cool. The Old House is loaded with lore about altered objects, paranormal incidents, and mundane office goings on. All of it provides a great background and backdrop for the game. The game's story develops in ten mission chapters, with various side missions. The player can upgrade Jesse's abilities, health, and energy pools, with ability points or looted ability-enhancing upgrades that can be slotted (same for weapons). 

The FBC has been invaded by an enemy known as the Hiss, named for its whispering screams. The Hiss possesses FBC agents and soldiers and sends them after Jesse, sometimes warping them in as the player enters a room. I'll just say the combat here, for all its repetitive nature, can be intense and dangerous. Even fully upgraded, Jesse is something of a glass cannon. Bosses and powerful named enemies can do high damage or one-hit the player. Even grunt soldiers will do significant damage up close. Absolutely do not stand still. Use cover, sprint and evade to get out of the line of fire, and save a sliver of energy to throw up an emergency shield.

Fortunately, Jesse is no slouch. Picking up (with her mind) objects and launching at enemies is incredibly damaging. The player can easily clear a non-boss fight with that power alone, and upgraded, it's even more potent. Some enemies can do the same and their thrown objects hurt just as much as yours, so stay on your toes. Other enemies fire rockets or chuck grenades, which can be dangerous. Grabbing those with the launch ability and hurling them back at the one who threw it is very gratifying.

But you probably will die a lot. The game isn't easy and even minor mistakes can quickly snowball out of control. Death costs you a little resources and sends you back to the latest checkpoint save. The real downside to dying is my only major complaint with the game, which are the long, punishing load times. This only adds to the irritation of a difficult fight when you die several times in a row and have to wait to get back into it each time. Very annoying.

If you're finding things too tough, the Ultimate Edition features an ""assist mode,"" where the player can turn up/down the amount of damage received and dealt, activate the ability to one-shot enemies, or even make Jesse immortal. I was able to complete the game without activating Assist Mode but no shade if you do; the game is obnoxiously difficult in places and the whole point is to have fun, not get frustrated, so do what you need to.

This version of Control comes with two DLCs, AWE and The Foundation. The former has a distinct horror survival vibe and shows the FBC's involvement with the Alan Wake incident. It's creepy and tense. The Foundation delves into the roots of the Old House and the fates of certain characters. It has a 3D-platformer feel but is fun content as well. Both AWE and Foundation feature difficult damage-sponge boss fights, but up to those battles, I enjoyed both campaigns. 

The visuals and sounds are both pretty decent, and I didn't notice any clipping or stuttering. The voice actress for Jesse (who I believe also did the motion-capture for the character's animation) does a pretty good job. I did run into bugs with some of the Foundation DLC quests, such as key foes falling disappearing halfway through a fight, forcing me to restart the mission. Fortunately, this only happened twice.

All of the Steam achievements are reachable and none can be missed, as the player can continue rampaging through the Old House for as long as they want after finishing the stories and DLCs. Reaching one-hundred percent will take quite a bit of grinding and exploring.

Overall, I really enjoyed this one. It's challenging, interesting, and most of all, fun. Would recommend to any fans of third-person shooters or paranormal thrillers.

Pros
- Challenging combat
- Immersive lore and story
- Good DLC content

Cons

I always found the concept of SCP to be fascinating, but could never find myself getting into those games because they focused more on the horror and not so much the story or combat. With Control, however, I felt connected to the story and became very invested in learning more about the Objects of Power and the AWEs that often involve them. I even love how they tie the OoP's to Jesse gaining more abilities, which felt like a natural progression and not something that comes on suddenly (ie. suddenly she can do more powers!, but instead, she has to go through a trial to gain the skill, which often involved 'cleansing' the object from its corruption). 

My only gripe with the upgrades is that some are built into the story line (the TV as an example, the one that lets you levitate) while the other ones (the safe and the X-ray machine) are not. This can make it confusing for a player who isn't actively aware that cleansing those objects will grant upgrades, and without them, it can make it harder to progress in the game. 

I find myself still theorizing about certain aspects of the game even after completion of base game and the two DLCs. I admire the connection to Alan Wake (in base game too, not just the DLC), but I wish Quantum Break got some love within the game too, especially knowing that all three Remedy games are in the same universe. I'm excited to see where Control 2 will take us, specifically concerning Dylan's future as he is in a coma at the end of the game, and given that they've already demonstrated that they can add more areas to the Oldest House beyond just the standard floors. Perhaps we'll explore more of the astral plane and different thresholds? Jesse has demonstrated that she's a very 'hands on' Director, which I think makes her different than the rest. 

Even though I had some issues with some of the fights (and rage quitting a couple times off stream) and my desire for more Quantum Break content, this game is definitely a favorite of mine, I would put it on par with Watch Dogs or Hades with how much I enjoyed it and it leaving an impact on me as a gamer and person.",1696858768,1696858768,True,36,2,0.716737151145935059,0,True,False,False

Maybe if you enjoy SCP, it has a good plot for your taste, however I dislike the lore built around poorly faked supernatural reports with censored out words, and while presumably script for this game been written by professional writers, it isn't much better.
Now, gameplay mechanic resembles MMO in a way that there are constant pop-in ""daily quests"", which is, again, is a red flag for a singleplayer game and a sign that they wanted to stretch it. Bad sport. Don't forget that enemies can materialize out of thin air on already explored territories and contribute to repetitiveness and time spent inside the game. Core mechanics - movement, shooting, evading, levitating - are alright, that's where the ""share of fun"" comes from but again, it's tied together too poorly.

[h2] Controls [/h2]
I purchased this game quite a few years after it's release and the control feeling is, in my opinion, similar to Resident Evil 4 Remake. Character movement is portrayed very realistically but this is detrimental to the controls. I think it's more of an issue with Control as there is no difficulty selection. For some elaboration, the main character has ""momentum"" when they move so when you're running and then stop, you don't come to a dead stop, you slow down, then stop. Same with weapon handling; the weapon is raised and then fired. After some idle time, the character drops the weapon. What makes this frustrating is there's some weapons that do not fire repeatedly such as the rocket gun. For some reason, after firing a shot from the rocket gun, the character won't fire again until after the character goes into the idle weapon animation. The rocket gun shoots slow already but not being able to at least maintain the shooting animation for the gun is down right ridiculous. The same issue is present for the shotgun.

Unfortunately, with games like Control and RE4R, the realistic animations and character movements severely hinder the game to the point where it makes it down right frustrating. As I previously mentioned, it's not so much a problem on RE4R as there are different difficulty levels. With Control, it's a major issue as there is no difficulty selection. I'm at the part of the game where you use levitation to get to an area where you fight an anomaly that shoots clocks and this was honestly the part of the game where I'm losing interest. The weapon handling makes this fight extremely frustrating and the controls don't help, either. The previous boss fight with the security leader to get levitation was also frustrating due to the issues mentioned. It's really unfortunate because I've enjoyed the game (mostly) up to this point. 

[h2] Saving [/h2]
No checkpoints and no ability to manually save is a bad decision in this type of game. It kinda makes sense in Elden Ring but makes absolutely no sense in Control. The only way the game saves, as far as I can tell, is when you get to a marked location (game also mentions this is the way it saves). Terrible decision on the developer's part. I've lost 30 minute progress a couple times and it's not fun re-doing areas. What makes it worse is the marked locations are pretty far apart and not spaced very well.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
Unfortunately, Steam only gives you a recommend or no recommend. I'm leaning towards recommend, but barely. It's unfortunate that game developers go with realistic animations but fail to balance it with gameplay and controls. Same issue with RE4R...Control could be a great game, but it unfortunate how bad the controls and saving makes it a meh experience.",1696670040,1696670040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some scenes were terrific (the maze one especially), art style and atmosphere were perfect. As you can see, graphics were also good. However, there are a lot of things that I did not like. First of all, the story, it wasn’t great, it did not answer any of the questions and there were overwhelming about of collectibles which did not add much to the story. The characters weren’t really that strong, also, only Ahti was an interesting character. Still, the story isn’t that bad; if you like the SCP stories, it could be interesting for you but these kinds of stories give me a sour taste for the most part. The real problem was the gameplay. It was a bit unbalanced, you can only select two weapons at the same time, most of the weapon upgrades are useless and there are a lot that you can find, enemy variety wasn’t great, soul system and constant respawns were annoying while repeatable quests were unnecessary, at the end I had a lot of souls which I cannot even use, there were no chance for me to buy the materials (mold ones were near impossible, after the related quest). By the way, I am the director, why do I need to find a keycard to access some areas? Just get the highest one from an employee.
Foundations DLC was pretty much same with the main game. It adds a couple hours of playtime, a new area, it felt like a teaser for second game. It was a huge negative for me to not being able to use the new skills at other places, ally rangers’ AI and Jesse not even commenting about her fight with Former before. Other than that, new weapon upgrades were worse than the original ones and enemies felt like bullet sponges. The second expansion is similar to the first one for its features, except there is a boss which is a bit annoying at the end. Of course, except three certain upgrades, weapon upgrades are much worse and enemies have much more health. At least it adds one new enemy type and a new weapon mode.

For those of you familiar with it, this is basically SCP but with way more action and supernatural powers.

[h1]Good:[/h1]
+ Great graphics, stunning visuals. The environments the game puts you in are spectacular
+ Bass boosted sound design, powers and special effect sound crunchy as hell
+ Soundtrack is pretty good. It's a lot of atmospheric stuff, mixed with some rock/metal
+ Realistic facial expressions during cutscenes. Bethesda should take notes
+ Fleshed out lore. All the good parts of SCP and none of the cringe
+ Deep narrative, though admittedly thin on character development
+ Character customization in three forms, mods, weapon loadout, skill trees
+ Visual customization, outfits to unlock in-game
+ Puzzles littered throughout the quests and the exploration within the Bureau are challenging yet solvable
+ Fun boss fights, not too hard which is good for a general audience
+ Combat is engaging, and at times pretty challenging
+ Controls are very intuitive. Despite how many powers you have, it's pretty easy to remember all of them
+ Numerous build options to match your playstyle
+ Tons of secrets, collectibles and hidden locations to uncover
+ Decent amount of replayable content post-main story
+ No microtransactions

[h1]Nitpicks:[/h1]
- It's a little annoying that so much luck is involved in the gearing process, especially for a single-player game
- Enemies respawning in the Oldest House is a bit too random. It makes running countermeasures tedious at times
- There are quite a number of garbage mods in the loot table. Who on earth is gonna equip ""Gain energy when hit by Hiss Charged"" (ONE of the many enemy types), when you can just equip ""Energy regeneration +55%""
- Low diversity in enemies. There are indeed a number of enemies the game throws at you, but it reuses them in the most overt ways. Most minibosses are just regular enemies with higher stats, and no special moves
- Some things are just weirdly designed. For example, I've finished the game and can craft Tier 6 weapon mods (Infinite) as well as Tier 4 (Prime), but not Tier 5 (Absolute). Why? I can craft Tier 4-6 personal mods but for some reason Tier 5 weapon is missing no matter how many times I reroll the options. Forums seems to agree that this isn't a bug, so I'm lost here
- Build diversity is alright, but balance is kinda bad. Shatter/Surge are ridiculously weak compared to the alternatives, and for most of the game nothing beats Launch
- The map is oftentimes quite confusing. A lot of these environments are pretty vertical, and the map doesn't distinguish between floors very well
- It's very possible to run into a situation where you can't unlock level 3 of your chosen weapon, because the unlock is tied to gaining a specific crafting material at a specific time. This is a somewhat odd system, though I personally did not run into this problem myself

[h1]Overall: 9/10[/h1]
As always, my nitpicks don't carry much weight here. The game does so much well, that it's easy to overlook the stuff it does badly.

The graphics of the game is good, though I expected somewhat more. I played with all the ray-trace options turned on, and frankly those were not that impressive. Seeing your reflection on glasses didn’t add much to the game, and especially in the Alan Wake DLC light handling wasn’t that much superior compared to games before the ray-tracing era. While I wasn’t impressed by the ray-tracing, the morphing environment was clearly the highlight of the game for me. Few games do such things at this level, I can remember only DMC Devil May Cry having a similarly playful approach to reality distortion.

The voice acting of the game was top-notch. There will be a lot of spoken parts. Some will have only fragments played in the game environment, for the full media you will have to watch through the media files unlocked in parallel. Two-three segments will have their own action music, but quite a lot there will be instead a “chanting” in the background. During generic fights there will be a fight theme playing, with slower pace when you get more distant from the spawned enemies. When that theme stops, the fight waves are over, and you can explore the environment safely. However, random encounters might (re)spawn eventually even in cleared zones.

The map system is different from most games in the sense that the global map is there only to give some broad sense of direction, like based on your current location you should head broadly northward. To actually navigate the labyrinthine building, you will have to read the markings on the walls and follow them. At some more obscure cases the path to continue is marked with yellow carpets, and then usually flying will be required. Navigating the building would be a nightmare on foot, the fast travel between unlocked nodes will help a lot, like when you have to return from one extreme of the building to the executives (roughly the main base). Not just because the labyrinthine system, but because enemies are respawning randomly in already visited places too, and fighting through them was just an unnecessary time waste for me.

The enemy encounters are hard, mostly because of the huge number of enemies to deal with. It doesn’t help that even some common enemies can practically one-hit kill you. After experiencing the difficulty early on, I just switched on invulnerability, and played the whole game with it. Virtually any enemy engagement resulted in me “dying”, that is reaching 0 health and having a prominently red tinted window. Replaying those encounters again and again just to get through them would have been very annoying, as the base game has a heavy “git gud” attitude. Instead relying on invulnerability as a crutch, an easy mode with a noticeably reduced enemy count would have made the game more enjoyable for me, as the dragging on and on enemy encounters detracted a lot from enjoyment. With no incentive to figure out effective ways to deal with different enemies, I just ineptly brute forced my way through harder the fighting parts.

The inventory system is very bad. There are only a limited amount of storage for weapon and personal mods. If it gets full, you will have to erase an item before a new one can picked up. With the DLCs there will be easily more variety of weapon mods than storage available. I had to delete even tier V items to make room for the random new drops. This incessant micro management was a bad design, there should have been enough room for at least 2 for each mod types. Always able to preserve the two best of a type, with 2-3 spare slots would have been a nice addition.

There is an upgrade system for weapons and for personal mods. Don’t make the mistake I made, focusing on upgrading first the personal mods. That was meant for endgame grind content, and I think will use up rare materials, locking you out from the weapon unlocks/upgrades. I certainly missed out on some weapon upgrades. Just focus on unlocking all weapons, and upgrading them, since upgrading will increase their meager damage – a bit. The talent tree can be unlocked with skill points. As far as I have seen, only mission completion will grant skill points, so you should do as many main and side missions as possible. Not sure if the repeatable missions yield skill points, as I just tended to ignore those. Finishing the game with most side missions and both DLCs allowed me to fully unlock 4 branches out of 7 (roughly in the order of energy, launch, shield, health), with 0 investment in the rest.

During combat you can use paranormal skills and weapons. Fully upgraded launch was much more powerful than any of my weapons. Even fully upgraded those weapons will deal quite a low damage compared to weapons in other games. For a long time I ignored shatter (the shotgun one), but later found out that it is quite good even at mid-range, and great against nearby floating enemies.

The Alan Wake DLC will start automatically after mission 7. If you decide to enter it, a new section of the house will open up for exploration. This set has a new mechanism based on darkness, and fighting it off with light sources. The enemies will still be standard hiss entities, only the boss will be subject to this new mechanism. But several static corruption will have to be cleaned by shining light on them, in order to navigate through the zone. Also there will be several places mostly in darkness, where you can use lamps to navigate the environment.

The Foundation DLC will be unlocked after finishing the base game. Finishing the game will put you back in the Bureau, to grind freely the content. The Foundation starting mission will appear at that moment in your mission list. A choice will be eventually presented, to unlock a new ability for your weapon out of two possibilities. It will matter only inside the DLC. Neither one is explained, I chose the right side one, and was happy with the destruction approach. Eventually the other one is received too. Out of the two DLCs I enjoyed this much more than the Alan Wake one. It feels like a nice reward level after finishing the main game.

There are a few challenge mini-games to play. One is the jukebox, where 4 segments have to be finished in a given time. Another one is the Shum arcades. One is for a wave attack survival, the other one is for boss encounters. Speaking of boss encounters, I finished the game and still missed out on several encounters, clearly shown by my missing achievements for them. I have seen unexplored areas on the map, but no amount of exploring around them revealed the entrance to them. Eventually I just gave up on entering them.

The game mostly relies on autosaves. If you see a save icon in the lower right corner, you can assume that after exiting the game it will be continued from there. But I liked to rely more on the explicit save triggered by me. If you interact with a control point, the game will be saved there. If possible, I chose to exit after interacting with a save point. Sometimes when I progressed without reaching a control point, and with no intention/possibility for tracking back to a previous control point, I just exited hoping for the best.

The game can be played with keyboard & mouse or with a controller. Since there was aiming in this game, I chose to play it through with keyboard & mouse.

I played the game with 2 mods. One removed most of the intro movies, the other one replaced most LUTs with the neutral one. Only one comparison picture was available on nexusmods, but that convinced me to use the neutral LUTs.

I liked Alan Wake and Quantum break, but in the near future there is only Alan Wake 2 to look for from Remedy – if /when it will be available on Steam.

Actually, it's a good third-person action adventure game with a map that encourages you to explore as you gain new abilities and keys. If you're on board to really explore this game's world and take in the lore then this game might be for you.

[h2]The Game[/h2]
I held on to the hope that Control would introduce new mechanics, abilities, and enemies that would force me to learn how to mix psychic powers with fps gameplay. You get the ability early on to take any object in the room, levitate it with your mind, and launch it into an enemy with an auto-aim crosshair. This option is busted for the beginning hours of the game, but its power comes not only from pure damage but also from enemies being helpless to counter your launch projectiles. I'd normally let something like this slide for a few hours and give a game some time to build up toward offering a challenge.

I wasn't convinced that the game wasn't going to stop pulling its punches. The variety of enemy encounters in this game is weak, and the enemy AI is similar to setting a regular fps to easy or normal difficulty. Enemies will stare at you and occasionally let out an attack that might hit you if you're standing still. Some time needed to be spent re-examining the design of the combat in this game.

[h2]Everything else[/h2]
I'm making the game sound worse than how it feels to play. I have to commend the game for being slick and having excellent control. Everything is smooth, seamless, and paced very well. I'm not even going to get into how gorgeous the game is, but there's a lot to appreciate in all of the cutscenes and scenery. All in all- I'd have an awesome time with all of this fast-paced action if the combat just had more decision-making and strategy behind it.",1695578252,1695578252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[spoiler]I read all the files and watch media. So, I may be not as far in as one might think.[/spoiler]
Once again, trying to force relationships that don't sound organic as it happened with Quantum Break(QB). This time the protagonist outright telling herself, by extension you, how you should think in relation to a character or a situation.
[spoiler]To expand on the notes - aren't as goofy this time around and by enlarge a waste of time[/spoiler]
It doesn't stop at being relatable for the sake of being relatable. Design choices - just because popular: 
Control points for Bonfires; 
Losing a chunk of upgrade points on death; 
[i]Shapeshifting gun - only 2 shapes at a time. Why?[/i]
Limiting equipment options for the sake of limiting;
Choose 3 from a list of tasks typical to 'Dailies' in a live service game to supply with upgrades.
On top of elements that make it feel even more gamey. Ending up with a bunch of individual systems that don't synergize. 
Honestly felt as if playing Assassin's Creed confined inside corridors.
[spoiler]World building are things you'd expect in this setting without much of a twist.[/spoiler]
While the destructibility of the environment is more spectacular than that of QB coupled with a bigger arsenal of powers. 
You'll be hard pressed to see it behind the exaggerated dust particles and pretty mist-clouds splattering out of the enemies.
Also, more environment - doesn't necessarily mean better or varied environment. 
[spoiler]Seemingly more/Less you can do[/spoiler]
AI overall seems to have been downgraded to the kind that bunches up and stumbles towards you taking the shortest path.
[spoiler]🔻[/spoiler]
Movement is understandably clunkier as there's more elements to consider but that doesn't excuse things like gliding over the ground and stairs, and turning around so stiffly, when they nailed it in their previous game. 
Facial animations aren't as developed as QB either. Nor are animations of gunmen mobs.

I am giving 2 points for graphics and game play.
Nothing else is interesting.
No proper maps.
You do not know where to go to complete objective.
I believe there are multiple maps and only one map is accessible at a time, so how can we identify objective?
If this is like studying engineering or medicine then I would rather do those things than playing this game.
I am here to enjoy , not to go to google to find how to complete objectives.

I am updating my review and giving 0.50/ out of 10  to this game.
Salvador boss and other levels are like torture.
If you are working professional who wants to enjoy game after long working hours then stay away from this game.. I mean it. don't play it if someone gives it for free.
Yes you can gift this  game to your enemies as a method of torture.

When you strip away all the bad parts you are left with a cheaper FEAR clone.
The deeper you go the more bland, boring, generic, and downright insulting the game becomes.
If the game did not have an immortality feature you would not be able to handle most battles and exploration with the checkpoin system.

The protagonist keeps interrupting the plot. I could not care for the glass shards extradimensional thing or the crazy brother. We are not even told about the glass shards thing possesing the protagonist until 1/3 into the game.
The guns are generic.
The abilities are not very imaginative.
The upgrades are a mess of menus and locked off for most of the game. 
What the game has a ton of are bland sidequest and timed challenges. All rewards are worthless to what you can pick up at random in main story battles.
The enemy variation runs out fast. And they are very dumb and cheap.
The boss battles are just bigger health bar and swarm of generic grunts.
The level design is just a generic FPS old office building with painted on doors. You are supposed to be constantly backtracking between 5 giant levels, but there is little to no narative level design.
I stoped carring for lore 2/3rds into the game, because with so much black reducted text there is no lore.
There is no sequence breaking.
The maze mission is too late into the game.
You cant save the refrigerator guy, even though you can back track to the containment leader at any time.
Unskipable fakeout ending credits that drag on for minutes.
And then someone thought doing draggedout generic office duty two or more times is good level design. 

All this makes the whole experience more boring than midnight shift fast food indy horror games, because there paying attention is rewarding. In Control paying attention is insulted by the protagonist.",1695335242,1695335242,False,5,1,0.451347589492797852,1,True,False,False

Enjoyed the game quite a bit, gameplay abilities felt really nice and smooth but man the Service Gun felt weak
and the bosses were pretty disappointing in this game

Graphics are phenomenal to this day, love just lifting a slide projector and just seeing how Ray tracing works by bouncing and accounting objects

Voice acting is very well done! and sound track is.. well I did love the music.

Story at the beginning is a bit of a slog to go through but it picks up pace and gets me hooked, love the entire theme of it.

A lot of collectibles that provide world-building but honestly it's a lot to read and listen to, if you're into that sort of thing you'll love it.

+ Much of the environment is affected by Jesse's attacks

- First couple of hours are painfully slow
- Story can be complicated to follow

- Combat can get very repetitive until you finally unlock a new ablity/weapon (then after some time it gets repetitive again)

For these very reasons I really like it. It's very engaging in this regard, because you're constantly asking yourself ""what the fuck is going on?"".  Without spoiling, initially Control tells the story of Jesse Faden who apparently is looking for her brother. Inside the ""Oldest House"" (an Object of Power itself) she quickly gets involved in all kinds of paranormal and weird shit, the Hiss. She becomes in fact the new director of the FBC (the Federal Bureau of Control) in the ""Oldest House"" and as such is tasked with all kinds of requests of the people she meets inside the FBC. Some of these characters are pretty interesting, especially Emily, Langston (his quest Fridge Duty is pretty funny) and Darling (though the latter mostly through video's). Voice acting is great, although I found the voice of the character Underhill very poor. Sounded undelivered most of the time with a fake British accent (like those Americans who try to sound British in bad sitcoms). Gameplay is an huge improvement over a game like Alan Wake. Although the storytelling of Alan Wake is perhaps a bit more focused, gameplay in Alan Wake is very simplistic and grows very stale during the game. Gameplay in Control is much more engaging. In a sense it can be a bit traditional, you have weapons like a pistol, shotgun, sniper weapon etc., however you also have psychic powers like Levitate (which lets you hover and move in the air for a couple of seconds) or Launch (as the name suggests, lets you throw things). Not the most original gameplay, but combining these elements is very fun. The destruction physics in this game are also pretty impressive, mostly when throwing things around. The DLC (The Foundation and AWE) is pretty good, albeit short. Foundation lets you continue the story after finishing the main game, underneath the ""Oldest House"". It gives a very satisfactory, according to some people better, end to the story overall. AWE (which stands for Altered World Event) makes story wise a connection with Alan Wake. For fans of Alan Wake this DLC is a must. Length and quest wise however, I found AWE a bit lacking compared to The Foundation. Still good, but could have been so much more! 

I'm not quite finished with the game on this moment of writing, but I did finish the console version of the Ultimate Edition on the Xbox Series X earlier this year. Obviously performance wise the PC version is better, the game runs consistently well. If your hardware allows it, I highly recommend playing the game with Ray Tracing on. Especially in 4K on a big screen, the experience is a night and day difference with playing the game without RT. I almost go as far to say that RT makes a much bigger difference than playing with or without HDR. Although I played with HDR on the Xbox, this was not native HDR, but auto-HDR. Auto-HDR works great in most games, but admittedly the effect can be rather crude in comparison to native HDR. Luckily for the PC version someone from Remedy took the time to make a HDR mod. This mod is for a couple of reasons better than using auto-HDR in Windows 11. Not only makes it HDR native to Control, but it also improves the quality of DLSS (which for most people is still required when using RT) and improves upon the already existing RT. For me the latter two make the biggest improvement in enjoying Control on PC. Reading this article of DF is highly recommended (or watching the video on YT): [url]https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-a-stealth-upgrade-for-control-on-pc-dramatically-improves-its-graphics[/url].   

A couple of nitpicks, there is no new game plus. It would have been fun to replay the game with powers kept on a higher difficulty. Lack of a new game plus mode is even more annoying in my opinion, when considering the fact that some of the outfits you unlock during the game are unlocked nearing the end. Finishing the main story awards you with the outfit Director's Suit. What's the point? Although the DLC gives reason to continue playing (The Foundation can in fact only be started when the main story is finished), both expansions are not particularly long. It's of course nice to have expansions in the first place, but both dlc just add a couple of hours each.

A huge improvement over Quantum Break in terms of:

Atmosphere 
1. Subtler incidental music (mostly industrial noises) and VFX so, no more chaos and disorientation
2. Tasteful art direction without sacrificing overall mood
3. James McCaffrey's Max Payne-esque monologues (Hotlines)

Gameplay 
1. Pacing is much more laid back so you have time to explore or sight-see
2. Much more manageable special skills
3. Controls are much simpler and responsive (my biggest gripe with QB)
4. No more taking away controls of the player's movements (with unnecessary animations or sudden change of pace)
5. Timings between waves of enemies are well spaced-out to avoid feeling overwhelmed and rage quitting
6. Collectibles are much more succinct and enjoyable to read, and no longer break the pacing of the game should you decide to read them on the spot

Misc
1. Runs smoother on PC compared to QB
2. More replayability due to side missions, random (timed) Bureau Alerts, and DLCs
3. Download size is quite reasonable

Of course the ray tracing helps the visuals, though i only really played with RTX on very early in my playthrough. If you have a higher level RTX gpu (2080+ id say) then you can probably actually play through the game with rtx on at quality DLSS no problem.

Firstly the map system is atrocious, it is so bad that I didn't want to veer from the story mission to complete any side quest's due to not being sure if i could work out where i needed to go next to progress the story.
There are zero map markers which really is a bad design choice for a game like this as you are pretty much in one location the majority of the game and the environments are very similar in look and design.

I also had a really frustrating bug where my screen would go black from time to time, a reboot fixed it every time but it was quite annoying as it could halt progress.
i also had another graphical issue where Jesse would vanish expect an outline of her gun, not ideal in the slightest.

Lastly there were too many logs to read and many combat difficulty spikes were also present.

The good here does outweigh the bad though.
An interesting lead character and a very interesting concept made me want to persevere through the bad design choices.
The main draw though is the fantastic powers you obtain throughout the playthrough which makes this title very unique.
Combat really is alot of fun (Despite unwelcome difficulty spikes) and I never got bored of tossing things at enemies amongst other things i won't spoil.

The dialogue, voice acting and intriguing characters within the title is top notch and I personally very much liked Jesse as a lead protagonist.
I was very much invested in her reason for being in the oldest house and very much wanted to see the game through to its conclusion.

Remedy have returned with a great game that didn't outstay its welcome in regard to playtime and the concept made me want to play to the end despite its shortcomings.

You can fly through the air and throw huge objects at the oncoming enemies while evading their attacks with the dash.  There are plenty of different gun styles to choose from as well, allowing you to choose how you engage in a fight.  The enemies also have a lot of variety and are a lot of fun to fight.  The story is confusing at first, but learning about the Bureau and it's involvement in the supernatural is a ton of fun.  The main character, Jesse, is acted really well and has a lot of interesting moments.  The side characters you meet through the game also have a lot to add and don't under or over-perform.

Storywise, anyone who has read the SCP wiki will immediately see where they got the inspiration from. A lot of the concepts has a one-to-one correlation with concepts in the SCP universe: The Federal Bureau of Control is the SCP Foundation, Objects Of Power are SCPs, etc. The writers have put in a lot of effort to make the universe seem much wider than the claustrophobic corridors of the building you spend the entire game in. I found the game to be much more enjoyable if you read any notes you come across.

The game also takes a lot of inspiration from David Lynch's Twin Peaks series, though Alan Wake was the first game from Remedy to take influence from it. Themes of alternate dimensions, warped realities and enigmatic characters give credence to this fact. The game also ties the Alan Wake universe to itself with references to the events of Alan Wake in some notes in the base game plus one whole DLC dedicated to the events in Bright Falls.

Gameplaywise, the game has the usual, run and shoot mechanics, but also allows you to use various powers to aid in combat. You can lift and throw objects while waiting for your weapon to reload, or levitate high up in the air or dash to avoid attacks. However, this game is not quite as casual since some of the more challenging boss fights will test your skill in using all of your available powers.

The game is chock full of content with the base game taking upwards of 20 hours (if you also explore for notes and collectables) doing the main missions and side quests. Plus there are two story DLCs that take around 20 hours more to complete for a patient gamer.

Tech wise, I played with ray tracing on on a Radeon 6800xt and found that the framerate hovers between 50-70 FPS on average, with framerates dropping to the 30s in some areas. Using FSR (on Linux with Proton), I was able to get 60-100 FPS easily, though I never found the frame drops to be a hindrance at any point in the game.

Overall, the game was a pretty enjoyable experience.",1694339349,1694339349,True,3,0,0.512585818767547607,0,True,False,False

Control has an interesting story and characters, but the gameplay(mostly the action) is so repetitive and I can't understand why the guns are so weak compared to the telekinesis for an example. I bought the game for PS4 in 2019 and did not complete it. I bought this for PC in 2022, did not complete it. Now FINALLY I completed it and unfortunately won't play it again.

[h1] Sound design [/h1]

Simply beautiful, good sound design. The soundtrack is a bit lacking, but it can be good in certain parts of the game. Still, the sound design of Hiss will be the most memorable thing about this game.

[h1] Graphical and art design [/h1]

Even tho the game is a couple of years old, it still looks really good. The graphics themselves are really great even on minimal settings, and the game is optimized in such a great way that this game looks and plays really great even on a trash PC like mine. 
As for the art design, that is also really great, and it really makes you feel sort of unsettled, but also wondering about what's going to be around the corner.

[h1] Level design [/h1]

Level design is great, there are lots of nooks and crannies and secret hallways and places you can discover. The level design facilitates exploration, but also allows for a seamless indoors open world. Well, sort of.
The problem with the level design is that it is still, very linear, even for a semi-open world game. This is most noticeable in the Alan Wake expansion, where it's pretty much just three long hallways with a boss fight at the end of each one, followed by the final boss fight. SPEAKING OF WHICH-

[h1] Guns, fighting, enemies, bosses [/h1]

This is probably one of, if not the best weapon system I've ever had the pleasure to interact with. Your ""mag"" automatically recovers ammo if you stop shooting, however, you can ""run out of bullets"" if you don't take a break from shooting.
The fighting itself happens on two fronts- with your gun, and with your abilities. Which is good, you can mix and match to find out your personal favorite weapon modes and perks for different situations.
The enemies are sort of stereotypical, but most of them feel original. They are all fun to fight, BESIDES THE ONES THAT RUN UP TO YOU TO EXPLODE, THEY FUCKING SUCK DICK. 
As for the bossfights, this is the most fun I've had with bossfights in the last couple of years. Imaginative, comprehensible, little to no trial and error, straightforward, 

[h1] XP system, perks, weapon mods [/h1]

I'm gonna be straight to the point here- it fucking sucks. It's terrible. Yeah, you can mix and match, but you will constantly have to remove the mods and perks because the game is more than generous with them. The biggest problem is that they are literally fucking everywhere, and only a couple of them are really viable, so you're going to spend about an hour of your total gameplay by just deleting the items. And if you want the best perks, you will have to constantly go out of your way to delete the stuff you don't want.

[h1] Bonus content and DLCs [/h1]
I've mentioned AWE DLC already, but here I go again. AWE was a good piece of content. 
The Foundation was also really good, but it ended on a cliffhanger so massive that Mount Everest looks like a speedbump in comparison.
Too many documents with too much stuff that has little to no significance. Read only what's necessary or tied to the story, and move on. You're not missing out on much. Trust me, I've spent like three or four fucking hours just reading in this game.
Expeditions? Meh, I didn't care a single bit. Played it like twice, and never tried it again. For me, it's a boring horde mode.

[h1] Lore and story [/h1]

Let me be clear, this game just outright stole from SCP. Let's not pretend like it was an original idea- The Board is a direct copy of O5 Council, Darling is a copy of Dr. Gears, The Oldest House is a ripoff of Site-19, and so on. They made it sort of original, but, there were also other influences. Still, SCP was the most notable one, and we should thank God, because if SCP was copyrighted, this would be a part of a gigantic copyright lawsuit.

The story itself is short. Like, just about six hours short. I legit spent 50 hours on just the side content and DLCs, and just 6 hours on the base game. I guess that's the reason why you can only buy Ultimate Edition, because it really adds a lot.

My biggest gripe with the story is the inability of the writers to finish any storyline properly. Everything, AND I MEAN EVERYTHING, ends on a cliffhanger. Yeah, they were setting up for a sequel, BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CLIFFHANGER, A SETUP FOR ANOTHER GAME, AND STRAIGHT UP NOT FINISHING YOUR FUCKING STORY. Let's hope Alan Wake 2 and the next Control game solve these issues, as they take place in the same universe.

[h1] Navigation [/h1]

The level design might be great, but nothing will change the fact THAT THE MINIMAP IS NOT EVEN FUCKING FUNCTIONAL. HOLY FUCKING SHIT AND JESUS ON A FUCKING POGO STICK HOPPING ON TOP OF A GIMP'S BALLSACK, THEY NEVER FUCKING TESTED THAT SHIT. No hallway corresponds with the minimap, so sometimes when you get lost, YOU GET LOST BECAUSE THE MAP IS ABSOLUTE TRASH.

Another thing this game sucks at more than a pornstar during her oral exams in school is TELLING YOU WHERE THE FUCK YOU SHOULD GO, OR WHAT TO DO. The navigation in this game comes down to: ""Go to this sector and figure out how to do this by yourself, asshole."". IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I ACTUALLY HAD SOME FUCKING ENVIRONMENTAL LEADS, FOR FUCK'S SAKE. Half Life 2 and L4D2 excell in this area- you have lights and level design telegraph to you where you should go and what you should do. This game does neither. It's FUCKING TERRIBLE, and whoever approved or worked on any of this should be legally prohibited from talking to any game devs and from entering a game dev studio. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

The gameplay loop can get a bit annoying, you will be bombarded by notifications about invasions or raids or Hiss nodes or whatever the fuck, you will keep getting ambushed by Hiss behind every corner, and there will be a lot of stuff in your inventory you will never touch. There are too many documents to read, no environmental storytelling, and all stories end like premature ejaculation- it ends before it can start properly. The map is dogshit, and the game sucks at even giving you the slightest idea of where you should go next. The soundtrack is really non-existent, or really forgettable.
 
However, you WILL enjoy this game, even with it's many flaws. The exploration is the most rewarding thing about this game, and disregarding the mission objective is the best idea you can have in this game. The movement and the gunplay rocks, the fights are great, the game controls well, and the optimization is really good.

Never thought simple grey/wood-ish building interriors will make me go ""woah, it looks stunning and unique"". Add on top of that extraterrestrial locations and enemy designs and you get the game you will nerver forget at least in terms of visuals. 

Gameplay was good as well. You get 6 weapons forms (which are essentially are just weapon archetypes we all know just in one gun) and a few paranatural abilities. Arsenal may sounds low in quantity but it is plenty considering the run time of the game. Not gonna lie, closer to 50 hours mark I began to avoid fights as I was bored with repeating nature of them. Sure there are many different weapon and personal upgrade mods, but not all of them made sense, some were extremely situational and a few of them I used pretty much during whole my playthrough. Also just 3 slots for upgrade mods felt limited as at the same time you could only invest in empowering either in one (fully) or two (60/40) abilities. For example you either dump all 3 mods improving shield parameters thus build your gameplay purely around using shield as much as possible, or you invest in one HP related mod and sparing rest 2 for another paranatural ability and same schematic goes for weapon upgrades as well. Once I found combinations comfortable for me i pretty much didnt change my tactics during whole game and why would I? You face the same enemies over and over again + the first Foundation dlc introduces new enemy type but you don't fight these new enemies in other areas.

But the biggest gripe for me was story and EXTREMELY HUGE amount of readable notes and audiologs. For a game with around 30-40 hours of runtime (including both DLCs) Control has a density of collectable notes and audilogs per square inch I have never seen in any other game before. One note doesnt even fully tell whole story it begins with, almost every note ends with sentence like ""Refer to yadayada page number bla bla to learn more information"" and I honestly didn't like it. Like I get it, game takes place in a bureau and in typical bureau fashion there are tons of paperwork which have connections to each other but I don't think it was this necessary to transfer this fashion into the game. Another negative point of these notes and logs are you NEED them if you want to understand the main plot even better and expand your knowledge beyond that game tells you when completing main missions BUT at the same time even AFTER you read all notes and listen to all logs you will still many unanswered questions. After completing the game I went to net to do some research as I thought it was my dumb brain which didn't see whole story and guess what I saw? Theories, theories and again, theories. Game has many loose ends, dialogues that leave more shade that answer questions and so on and I HATE movies/games with open endings gosh darn it. I really hope Remedy will release Control 2 at some point and finish the plotlines that left open and give answers to majority of question players may have after completing the game.

Despite all of negative stuff I wrote, Control gets solid recommendation as main plot is interesting, makes you want more and you always can simply ignore ingame notes and read everything in right order in the net. Also a plus for me is that in the world where every second game must feature an open world structure with hundreads of required hours for full completion Control shines as a game that respects your time by not taking much of it and uses each minute it has to throw as much content as it can on you. Oh also, dont skip optional side content, you will miss a big chunk of awesome content.",1693854214,1693854214,True,40,0,0.76204293966293335,0,True,False,False

And yet, the weirdest thing in this game is Jesse's jaw...

I updated my review to a negative one due to bugs and freezes in the DLCs.
The final boss fight at the Foundation DLC is so bugged that either the boss is disappearing, making the battle unfinishable, or the game freezes every minute.
Both seem to be a prevalent problem for many gamers without responsibility from the developers.

The visuals are simply stunning even though the game is 3 years old at this point. The visuals definitely help with the atmosphere which is mysterious and even creepy at times. Somehow even with all the progression of the character (which by the way is pretty well made), you don't feel safe at all exploring the bureau. What adds up to this feeling is the sound effects which are truly amazing provided you have a good headset. As for OST, it's not bad, but aside from the ""maze"" song, there's nothing outstanding.

But the two best aspects of the game are the gameplay and the bureau itself. The gameplay is easy to understand, but at the same time is pretty deep and fun. As for exploring the bureau, instead of just telling you that it's something very mysterious it just shows you. Every location and item evokes questions and feels unique and intriguing. 

The only downside I see are DLCs. I can't say that they are bad, but they feel too long and if you play them right after the main game, you start to feel like you've seen it before and that the gameplay is actually quite repetitive (most of the mechanics are well-known at this point and the DLCs don't offer too much)",1693752835,1693752835,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Case and point.

CON's:
1.Like Remedy games before it, Control has a simplistic gameplay loop. Go to room, enemies spawn, throw everything including the kitchen sink at them. Alan Wake, Quantum Brake and Max Payne all have the same DNA. But not every game needs to be a Ultrakill/Doom Eternal experience to be fun so I don't really know what the argument here is. 
Granted, I can see how it can get boring to people who want have a faster pace shoot at stuff experience, and find out that the game doesn't offer anything of that nature, but instead a more slow and methodical burn. 
2. This being the first game in the Remedy-verse to use RPG mechanics and upgrades for your gun that are based on RNG and what the level of your Astral Constructs is for better mods to drop. I think resource management in a game like this doesn't fit very well. It gives somewhat a Rogue-like/lite feel without the actual ballache of having to redo a level again because high level enemies gatekeep a part of the map. If game too hard just use Telekinesis.
3. If you don't do the side missions and the DLC's its a short game even with all the backtracking. Totally not missing the beautifully crafted world and all the cool lore stuff.

1. THE STORY IS THE REAL MEAT HERE, I would recommend taking your time with it and enjoying the ride. 
Think SCP but more tame and all the SCP's are household appliances that need the devil beaten outta them.
2. Graphics are great, tho I don't really care much for them. I will admit that there is a certain itch being scratched when looking at beautifully ray traced liminal spaces.
3. The music is fantastic, they did this game right.
4. The gameplay ain't too bad even tho I went on about it getting boring and repetitive. its solid and there ain't any jank. 
Hope you like exploring, because there is a lot of that, every part of the map has something hiding in it. Sometimes good sometimes bad stuff but that's the charm of an adventure, be mindful of the vending machines tho... they do bite!

There is nothing worth upgrading other than telekinesis, except your energy pool (for more telekinesis). Every boss-and I mean EVERY boss-can be defeated by some combination of running/flying in circles, hiding behind cover until your everything finishes recharging and shooting/launching wildly in their general direction. Dealing with every boss-and again, I do mean EVERY boss-in melee is also tantamount to suicide,  as is the case with many enemies. Whether you want to focus on aerial slams,  shield charging or melee attacks-any time spent not constantly moving and making distance is time putting you at serious risk of being ganked by some random Hiss mook sneaking up on you. 

And frankly, telekinesis is just...better than all the other attack options.  I screwed up my gun upgrades and barely noticed for one simple reason: Telekinesis mogs shields (which many enemies have) and the gun doesn't. Telekinesis is also much, much easier to upgrade direct damage for whereas you need both the right materials plus a decent amount of luck to both find and equip damage for the gun (with a few high end exceptions, there is NOTHING that offers the gun more than direct damage boosts). Also, if you're looking for a test of pure combat reflexes prepare to be frustrated by a cavalcade of puzzles demanding abstract reasoning/looking up game guides. Guess what you'll be solving those puzzles with much of the time? TELEKINESIS!

The way the story is driven not only through direct narrative and dialogue, but through world building and atmosphere is just masterful. Graphically Control is a beautiful thing, effects and level design are strong.

The side missions do what good side missions should do; build upon the main story. Each side mission feels like it has a purpose either showing a side of character or exploring more of the lore. Combat is simple, fun and at times challenging but rewarding. This game does one of the rare things in most action oriented games in that you can build both defensive and offensive characters whereas most games make you have a lot of health or dodge.

Obviously, I don’t love it, so I’ll just go through the aspects of the game, sharing pros and cons as I see them. 

1. Gameplay. Overall it’s a third person shooter with very little platforming and a sprinkle of puzzles.
• Pros: It’s simple, flashy and doesn’t go dull. The DLC’s try to give you something new, they are inventive. Plenty of side-quests with good rewards.
• Cons: There’s not a lot of variety, and the balance is really poor. If you like to play effectively - you’ll be forced to used same two weapons and two skills. Those that want to juggle weapons and skills, will be forced to play handicapped. Puzzles are elementary, and side-quests, with the exception of those from DLC’s are boring and repetitive.

2. Story. Not much to say about it - there's a plot (which isn't really insteresting), and there's background lore, which is better, but kind of silly.
• Pros: Tons of lore, a lot of documents with detailed descriptions, with over 50 years of written history. If you’re into that. Secondary characters aren’t cardboard cutouts, there’s very few of them, but most have strong personalities, and one even has a lot of real-life videos about him. This character is very charismatic and was perfectly casted for the role, I really loved all the bits with him.
• Cons: Tons of lore and good support characters are usually the meat on the bones of a good story and charisma of protagonist and antagonist. A-a-and there’s nothing like that. The plot had a big reveal at the end that changes nothing, and both protagonist and antagonist are bland and underdeveloped. There’s a big mystery and the beginning, with payoff that isn’t worth it. 

3. Visuals. The game looks great overall, with a slightly repetitive level design.
• Pros: Plenty of destructible items, love the looks of protagonist, she was obviously 3D scanned from an actual actress, who has unique and beautiful face. Overall the game is very pleasant to look at as long as long as you have good PC.
• Cons: most levels are monotonous office levels that get old really fast. There are enough unique areas from time to time, some of which has awesome design, but everything in between is boring. 

4. Performance. On a powerful PC with a modern GPU, FPS isn’t a problem. I did, however, had a couple of crashes in Foundation DLC.
• Pros: Even with a lot of object physics being calculated real-time, my FPS was always ~60, which is great. The textures are high-rez, and a lot of items has detailed, multi-stage destruction models.
• Cons: I tried running it on powerful gaming laptop, and found that almost all textures take A LOT of time to fully load, making you play in a blurred ugly environment. Tweaking the settings did nothing.

Overall the game is alright. It’s a pretty mediocre and simple metroidvania, with a lot of polish and work put into it. Without this polish, I wouldn’t recommend this game, but there’s enough of it to leave a pleasant impression.",1692389096,1692797429,True,1,0,0.442028999328613281,0,True,False,False

Despite being a story heavy game, the gameplay loop is very fun and addictive. Although I can imagine the combat being repetitive to some, the level of destructiveness of the powers you get are such a visual spectacle that I personally didn't have an issue.

The story could be described as a lynchian X-Files with some amazing writing and mythology that reminisce of articles from the SCP Foundation wiki. The storytelling, though, is mostly done through docs and audio/video files that you collect. If you aren't willing to seek those out for yourself, it will probably feel very underwhelming and hard to follow. 

Now, If you are willing to read and puzzle out the cryptic lore the game ""hides"" from you, you'll get one of the best sci-fi fictions in gaming. Exploring themes of extra dimensions, consciousness, entropy and marries them with the theories of Carl Jung about archetypes, synchronicity, collective unconsciousness and how the subject reality can affect the material world.

Sounds too good to be fun? Think again, trapped inside an ever-shifting building you navigate through twisted corridors, tilted offices, upside down walls, all the while dodging super-powered enemy zombies as you slowly uncover the mysteries of the place you're trapped in.
The gameplay is fast paced and keeps you on your toes for most of the time and the level design allows for a fun experience with loads of movable objects that interact and react during combat. The hidden secrets are so well hidden that for once, it feels rewarding to find them on your own and unashamed to look up the ones that you couldn't get.
The graphics are great and ray tracing enhances the visuals greatly. that being said there are still a few bugs related to the graphics which fortunately are not game breaking. however, if your tectures won't load correctly, i definitely recommend switching up your in-game graphics settings till all the details are visible in-game. This is critical to the immersion of the game and can be important for certain missions as well.
The side quests do not feel out of place at all and instead provide a more immersive experience into the game's lore.

The atmosphere, the visuals, the plot, the gameplay and the level design are some of the best selling points for this game.
The character writing could have been better but I find it average at the moment. It isn't bad and some characters definitely do a better job at delivering the lines than others. 

The DLCs were also a fun experience with the Foundations DLC expanding on the base game lore a lot and the AWE DLC adding a new exploration and puzzle mechanic of sorts to the game. The DLCs are definitely worth trying out, especially for the fans of the Alan Wake game series.

Overall this game is not too long clocking in at around 50 hrs for the base game with all the unlockable stuff at max.

Firstly, I think the side quests are difficult to contend with. On one hand they're amazing and lead to some of the best moments in the game, but they also break up the momentum of the main story in a way that doesn't quite make sense. This goes double for the ultimate edition cause it has so much more of them. Secondly, you're in the same building the whole game.

I went in not expecting much as the whole spooky/supernatural zombie/survival genre is not my thing, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how solid the story and characters felt. The plot and lore are very well designed and the collectibles therefore feel worth exploring for. The gunplay, overall controls (hehe) and mechanics were super crisp and smooth. The base game as well as the dlcs have a TON of well hidden secrets and areas and what not that work well conceptually and feel satisfying to find. Do NOT skip the side missions, they are a delightful experience, and in some cases quite important for getting access to certain abilities. Visually this game is a treat for the eyes, and uses ray-tracing really well, while performing without issue, except for maybe a minor glitch or two. However, a couple things definitely could have been implemented better, such as the map and inventory space. Due to the verticality and intricate environments, it was difficult to navigate using the map as it gives you a flat top down image and does not account for the multiple floors and areas. Inventory space is perfectly sufficient for the base game, but the DLCs bombard you with new unique mods, which forced me to clean out my inventory after almost every battle or two to keep space. As for the DLCs themselves, I enjoyed Foundation a lot more than AWE, as it delves more into the lore of the game, whereas in AWE, the ""plot"" was pretty non-existent, although it would be a lot more interesting for Alan Wake fans probably.

I tried to adjust multiple settings and you can't see any better in many many locations. If you adjust the brightness, it just puts a white haze over the screen. It doesn't adjust the brightness in the actual surroundings. I have no flashlight for dark areas? Wow...My eyes don't adjust to dark areas as you enter them? 
Your aim is REALLY bad in this. I turned on the aim assist and then just used a wemod trainer for infinite health and better aiming because it was just no fun to play. Enemies hit you REALLY easily no matter how much you zig zag. 
No point in crouching down and sneaking. The enemies see you no matter what you do once you get anywhere near them (even if you're behind walls, desks etc). 
Most of the items it tells you to pick up using the ""F"" key are useless info like some stupid bill from a travel claim? What does that have to do with the plot? So every single time you pick ANYTHING up, you have to press 'G"" to go to the inventory and look at what you picked up. Did you know there are games that let you read things as soon as you pick them up (they appear on the screen) and you decide if you want to keep them in your inventory or in a journal? Those games let YOU decide if it's important and you can just drop it or leave it? No? Maybe the devs should try playing games that DO so you see how it's done. 
I was told to go to the communications dept to find that red phone. Guess what? It's not accessible. It's literally sealed off. As I approached, there was no dialogue like, ""Maybe I should go through this other area and find an alt route"". You have no map telling you that you can go around. You have to just look for the only open area and get led along that way. It's 100% guess work where to go. The protagonist is supposed to KNOW this building. There are pictures of her on office walls like she's a employee of the year or something. But she doesn't have a arrow pointing her where to go or a map (in her mind) to use? Example: She could have dialogue where she says, ""The dept I need is down this hallway and up the stairs"". Nothing like this happens. You have to literally find signs pointing the way like you've never been there before. 
I really don't have much nice to say about it. In the past, games that incorporate live actors to shoot cut scenes don't do that great. They have their own following but don't get liked by a larger audience. I want fantasy, not reality in a video game. I guess it's cheaper to hire a unknown actor to shoot a scene than to pay a voice actor to voice a computer generated character who is more charismatic and enjoyable. (shrugs)
I'll do an edited review after more playing. I don't foresee it getting better. 
It's supposed to be an Ultimate edition but there are REALLY pixilated graphics in areas and unclear logos on the floor, walls etc. Like they spent way too much detail on the main character and not on the surrounding environment.

When given these ""time limits"" of 20 minutes to complete certain objectives, you will spend the first 15 minutes just trying to find a way to get where you need to go, making the map completely pointless. I'm not here to memorise the EXACT route to take from one point to another to make it ""in time"". Certain sections have badly placed fast travel markers and some sections don't have enough at all - they call it Fast Travel.....more like fast travel from one pointless area to another pointless area. As for the dust when enemies throw the multitude of both rockets and grenades at the same time, makes it a game of dodge the clouds of smoke/dust. Might as well play in a tornado. Game has some interesting ideas for puzzles. Facial animations needs some tweaking (sometimes it was like watching Gollum (Lord of the Rings) and both his eyes ready to burst. Dialog felt constrained and forced (like it was being read from cue-cards). Music was lacking in allot of places.....almost like the developers remembered at the last second to include some music. Jump and Levitate are loaded on the same keyboard button. Really?,,,,,want to jump?......you'll probably end up levitating instead and visa versa. As for Launch, I don't understand the difference between launching huge chucks of rock versus NOT being able to launch a single small tossed grenade. I need to actually implement an upgrade to my character for this purpose? Seize is only being used for the sheer fact of an achievement - this is how much its going to be used.......somewhat useless for the groups of enemies you will face.

The highlight of my experience was the Ashtray Maze sequence.  Really well designed and fun to play.
The game mechanics are also commendable.  I loved the simplicity of only offering half a dozen highly effective hand guns combined with the heavy impact of telekinetic powers.  I would like to see these same mechanics and ballistics used with different themes. 

However, with most games I start at a middle difficulty and will replay on increasing difficulty ultimately working towards mastery.  With Control, it simply wasn't compelling enough to want to master combat techniques.  I found myself decreasing difficulty just to see what's next. The enemies were annoying and repetitive to the point that a 1-shot auto kill was all the effort I cared to put forth.  I simply don't like random spawning enemies.  They should come from a location.  In fact, there's no enemy tracking at all. This is an element that also enhances stealth play, something that Control lacks.  You won't need to use crouch.  

Much of the artistic design is lost in the shadows.  My setup is current and I play on an LG widescreen.  I don't mind getting lost in discovery, but partial blindness is not a fun gaming element. Overall, I felt claustrophobic through much of the game play. 

My biggest grievance is that the missions felt like 'go-fetch the moving goal post'. yawwn.

The DLC was an improvement by offering larger playing areas, a variety of puzzles and platforming, and a brighter array of color. I was able to finish all of the DLC, but passed on side jobs. 
Bored curiosity and being at home on injury are the only reasons I completed this game.

You can kind of call it a huge mish-mash of SCP/Backrooms Universes, Max Payne, Alan Wake, and a few other things kind of thrown into a blender. 

In regards to the story, there's a LOT of the story tucked into exposition of collectable in-game files and notes, videos, and whatever else. The other half is there in the actual game but it can be fairly confusing to follow and lot also draws from the Alan Wake series so honestly I kind of gave up trying to understand it. 

As far as gameplay goes, that's where a lot of fun comes from. You have this supernatural gun that shifts into different forms (shotgun, pistol, machine gun, etc) and can have only two forms equipped at a time. Where the real fun comes from is implementing these basic third person shooter mechanics with the supernatural powers you slowly gather. You can use telekinesis to throw things and form a shield, mind control, and even fly amongst other things. The way it all just flows together can make for an incredibly engaging experience.

Control really is something unique and I am ultimately glad I found it on sale at some point because I vaguely remember this game even coming out.

Overall i enjoyed this game quite allot however will say it took a second to grow on me, im really excited for the sequel however and think this games also worth playing just because if they improve the game in its follow up its gonna go down as an all time great and this game really sets the foundation for this universe quite well.

The only negative about the game is the combat, it starts fine but gets repetitive after a while. The way it scales leads to frustration, with enemies becoming bullet sponges, getting enough damage to two shot you, overwhelming numbers and spawning behind you which can lead to unexpected deaths.

My ONLY gripe with the game, is that when you're facing down a boss or an event, if you lose, it takes you back to a ""control point"" or a save point.

Story is mysterious and intriguing, combat is fluent but other mechanics are not impressive.

Combat feels good at first, but become a chore after some time when enemies are more or less the same. For unexplored area, the feeling of exploration can be fun but for established zones, there is simply no reason other than farming to fight these guys. Fighting feels kinda monotone after first part. 

Enemy spawn feels unpredictable. Sometime I would expect enemies in explored zone but no and other times they spawn constantly.

Telekinesis needs more control. Half of the times I die without knowing what hit me with a very sudden onset. Another half of the times it is because I drag an explosive with telekinesis and it either got hit or hit a wall and exploded. The object that are pulled are not anywhere near my aim if I am not really aiming down sight. Most of the time it is from behind me or somewhere I cannot see. It got even worse after I upgraded the ability where She would just pull stone from the ground ignoring the heavy object in front of her.

Gathering crafting material is not easy when there the enemies are the same but dropping various things on different location. Some essential gameplay experience like various version of the service weapon should be easier to obtain without the need of sacrificing the opportunity to craft other things like mods and upgrades.

Back tracking is annoying and somewhat unrewarding. Those clearance level locked rooms are a joke with no real rewards in there. Some can even get in without the clearance by breaking the glass make me wonder do the devs want to put rewards in them or not.

Same applies to the side notes and documents. There are an excessive amount of reading material and most of them are simply garbage. They are either trivial or made trivial by erasing the key content on it with black rectangle. I cannot image working in an agency where all internal documents, inside the controlled area, with no imminent security crisis, have certain keywords on the document erased. Literally all or most of them because I did not finish the game. Just show the whole damn content and lock those key or valuable reading material in those useless clearance locked rooms!!!

Ability points are not easy to get. As a casual player, I feels like it is only from the mission, which makes your progress tie to the story progression and it can be limiting.

Those sudden onset, time-limiting alert mission are a nuisance and it does not fit the game. This is a story-driven game, why the mmo-rpg type event? It often drags me back when I want to explore a new area or not near a control point. Even worse is death ends the mission immediately and now you have wasted your time, your progress and with zero rewards. This is bad.

All in all, not a bad game but need more polish. I would need to see another game in the series, a franchise even. The topic is interesting.

I’m barely marking as recommended with a very very heavy wait for sale warning and also you might despise it before it gets fun. Its not really that the game is mid, its more that its one of extremes. The good bits are extremely good, but it’s marred by bad bits that made me want to uninstall on multiple occasions.

[b]Art Style/Design:[/b]
This game looks incredible, both in graphics and brutalist art deco. Each area feels distinctly handcrafted, the world is vast, and it does a great job of hiding secrets within each of these spaces. If there’s an instance where you think “I wonder if I can fly up to that balcony 10 floors up”, chances are you can.

Which is a shame because you’ll be utterly lost. Despite how vertical the area is, they decided to go with a barebones top-down map that makes it impossible to distinguish which floor an exit is on and whether or not the route you’re taking is blocked off. This is exacerbated by some really bad fast travel placement. Just figuring out where to go became so infuriating that I had to Youtube directions to the next quest multiple times and would still wind up lost in the final hours of the game for areas I had been through multiple times. This game needed a layered 3D map in the menu.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
The combat loop starts out shaky until you start to get extra gun forms and especially the main abilities. Once you have these things improve enormously as you go from relying on cover to sheer agility and mixing up your abilities. Now, take this excellent baseline, then add some of the most nonsensical design adjustments imaginable.

Imagine you’re playing Half Life, you can carry all weapons and cycle through them. Control is like that, except you can only hotkey between 2 weapons. You have like 5, they could be mapped to the number keys to switch on the fly like Half Life, but instead you have to go into your inventory in combat and select which 2 you want to switch between. It’s such a stupid design choice, and I just found out there’s actually a mod that adds precisely this option into the game I wish I’d seen before.

Add to that an RPG style weapon & character mods system that is probably my least favourite part of the game. Almost every enemy drops a mod of some form. Most are useless, e.g. “+5% damage”, “get energy from being hit”, so on so forth scaling up over time but very rarely giving actual decent stuff. You will spend an absurd amount of time doing inventory management because you can only carry ~20 at once and will get ~5 per fight, when this stuff could have been a weapon tree upgrade at checkpoints.

Oh, also just to note, I’ve completed the entire game & DLC’s, and have not once used shield. It is the most useless ability in the whole game despite being one of the first few you get.

[b]Story/Lore:[/b]
The game starts out pretty ominous, but honestly, I feel like the lore and story gave way to aesthetic. The main quest is pretty dull for most of the game, there’s not much in the way of character engagement, and then when you get into the later stages of the main story things all of a sudden ramp up in quality, and just as you’re getting engaged for it to build to the final act it just suddenly ends in an anti-climax. Honestly thinking back on it very little actually happens the whole game.

Maybe I’m unfairly comparing to SCP, but the lore feels incredibly shallow by comparison. None of the items are as interesting as those of SCP, the overwhelming majority of them are just random object + random effect and that’s it. There's none like SCP-7122 that make you go “holy fuck that’s so well thought out but so messed up”, its all just kind of samey.

The DLC is equally as mid, nothing really outstanding about either of them. Oh, and side quests range from forgettable to utterly fucking awful, like seriously some of the worst I’ve ever played.

Don’t bother with Expeditions. You unlock them mid-game, but even the easiest one is borderline impossible without maxing out all stats, getting some of the rarest mods, and selecting really specific builds. Its probably great for people that like the gameplay but by the time I got to the point I could feasibly do these I was pretty much burned out with the other crap in this game.

[b]TL;DR:[/b]
Best art style and world space in a game for ages, core combat loop is insanely fun after early game, but both are undermined by terrible map directions and RPG mechanics. Story is mid, lore is inferior SCP universe.

If they make a sequel that trims out all the fat though, it will probably be excellent.

Firstly, it has a shit ton of production value. The engine is gorgeous and utilized greatly, graphics and physics both. The mystery, world building itself and the place you are in are fantastic. That is about it though.

They tried to copy the Dark Souls formula but then forgot important aspects of it. Like:

-Customization
-Resource Management
-Playstyles that aren't just the same all the way through
-Interesting boss and enemy patterns
-Locations that aren't just to pass or backtrack through
-Loot that is interesting

To elaborate on this:

The combat is neat for the first hour, then it very very quickly gets boring because you just go pewpew with your gun. Enemies start getting progressively more bullet spongey but you can't really help but fall behind. They even got level indicators. Yet you have no levels. What you get is a loot system from a game like Destiny or Warframe with marginal ""5% more damage in this situation"" increases. That wouldn't be so bad if you had more slots to put these in though, as they could stack a lot then. But no, you can unlock a MAXIMUM of 3 personal slots for slight general buffs (that you really are forced to take up for health too, since the enemies in this game can 100 to 0 you at points) and then 3 more per weapon. You are always going to use the same weapon, then the telekinesis blast, which does way more damage. Then use gun until energy recharged, repeat over and over.

As said, they tried to copy the Dark Souls formula of difficulty but with more superpowers but forgot almost all that made it good. They use a checkpoint system like bonfires here but NO HEALING ITEMS. I put special emphasis on this because it is endlessly frustrating to have an enemy 100 to 0 you (with maximum health upgrades mind you), then the only way you can heal yourself back up is scrounging for little health pickups that enemies dropped. In my run I had moments were I went from full health to near 0, meanwhile I had all my personal slots full with the highest tier ""increase health recovery in pick-up"" and one highest tier max health upgrade. I went to pick them up, got near full again. Then got near 0 again even while frantically dodging because that is just how this goes. Then scrounge for health pick-ups again. Whoever thought it was a good design decision to have enemies drop health and then you have to travel to that place in melee, then walk over it did not have an understanding of how difficult games work. Really, it is the most insulting thing here.

This game tries to be this superpowered fun ride with high difficulty but it gives you almost no options on how to play, and the little it gives are worthless. There is no consumables or damn healing items. That means no thinking on when to use what. You run into a room with the same enemies you thought the past 100 areas (they also respawn rather quickly). Then just dump ammo, launch objects at them, repeat until one resource refills while using the other. Such a waste of an awesome and unique premise. But there just is no agency in anything.

And just to quickly touch on it, the writing in this game can be interesting but often comes down to being very pretentious and screaming of a freshman artschool student (not that I have anything against artschool students, they do important work in their own way) who just has some raw ideas and spits them on the screen. That is neat and all but then you have a main character that is very unlikeable, not because of her actions but her ""I am the bossgirl, you are annoying me"" attitude in every conversation and during missions in her head.  The first and 10th time you get the ""cryptic dialogue during glitchy screens"" animations it's sort of fun. Then the 50th time they go on for like 3 minutes at once, with you basically only seeing a glitchy screen. This is not mystery, this is annoying and pretentious.

Overall it had massive potential and did almost nothing with it that wasn't purely graphical or physics based. And that is mostly thanks to the engines capabilities. All in all, this is a game I wouldn't even recommend on sale because you are better off with other games or in general spending your time doing something else.",1690626789,1690626789,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Its not scary but puts you in this spooky, humdrum government atmosphere where conspiracy theorist would have a field day. The story is mostly linear with side missions to fill the seemingly alive building that the protagonist Jesse Faden continues to unravel. After the story there are two story expanding DLCs that invite you back into the world of the Federal Bureau of Control along with challenge mode that allows you to put all the upgrades and skills you have to test  [/td]

	[td] Should you get it?[/td]
	[td] Yes (he said with a chuckle). I see why this game had so many nods back during its award season. Control tells a unique world building story that makes you want to see not only more from Jesse but the weird, alternate, paranormal world she inhabits. Remembering that this is a spawn from the mind of Sam Lake (creator of the Max Payne and Alan Wake series) we may get that in the future. If we do I, I’m instantly onboard [/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td] Overall Verdict [/td]
	[td] 9/10. After looking past the lackluster bosses (a majority I’d say) and weird enemy scaling (adjustable by a suite of accessibility options) Control builds a well fleshed out world paranormal entities right under our noses and the perceived dull government entity that keeps it in check…but you’ll be thrilled to know its far from dull. [/td]

[b] Setting & Writing: [/b]
In Control you play as Jesse Faden, a young woman looking for her brother years after an anomaly affected her hometown of Ordinary. The strange events resulted in the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) covering up what happened and taking Jesse’s brother Dylan. Jesse finds the FBC, which is a feat because one needs to be tuned in to even recognize the existence of its location. Once Jesse arrives at the FBC she is greeted by an odd janitor ordering her to go to the director’s office. What Jesse finds is that she just became the new director of the FBC and must clean up the mess the previous director left for her. Control has a captivating story, akin to watching shows like X-files and Twilight Zone. The writing builds a spooky, but not necessarily scary atmosphere. What comes off as just another day in the office is steeped in suspicious activity. The FBC deals with the paranormal. Their office building, also known as The Oldest House, feels like an infinitely large building. The building houses numerous divisions dedicated to the study of multiple paranormal entities. Jesse is tasked to cleanse the building of an entity known as “The Hiss”. The Hiss have been running amok within the Oldest House, but they’ve been plotting for quite some time. Throughout the story you learn of Jesse’s special quirk which makes her immune to the Hiss, their connection to the Oldest House and how this all involves her long-lost brother. 

[b] Gameplay system & Bosses: [/b]
Control is a technical powerhouse in destruction-based graphics. Jesse will gain new powers that allow her to combat the Hiss and upgrades to her “living” gun. The game is designed for you to keep moving. If you stop moving, you’re liable to get hit hard by the opposition. Combining Jesse’s powers between weapon reloads results in a constant dance of damage and office furniture being flung everywhere. Enemy design to me was bland BUT varied. Each section of the game introduces more enemy types that force you to think of different ways to quickly dispose of them. Flying enemies are good at evading telekinetically thrown objects, therefore you might want to snipe them before trying to hurl an object at them again. Similar challenges are presented throughout the game. Bosses were not much of a challenge though. Bosses felt like high health enemy types. I personally cannot remember any designs of the main story bosses. That is to say that there are some optional bosses that are neat but not tough.

[b] Quest, Mini-games & Challenges: [/b] 
The Oldest House is split up into floors. In the beginning each floor is essentially a new level/objective in the game. You’ll visit old locations later in the game once you have high level clearance to let you through. This makes Control almost a metroidvania-lite. There are plenty of side quests to do that not only reward you with upgrades and materials, but genuine good world building. There are side quests that go into the origin of some of the strange objects you read about in documents. The most interesting ones gave extra exposition on what the Oldest House truly is, or at least what the scientist think it is. Side missions in this game did a good job of further detailing the world these characters live in and the dangers that their job puts them through day in and day out. Later in the game DLC is introduced that offers horde-mode type challenges that reward you with extra cosmetic outfits for Jesse.  

[b] Miscellaneous (art, music, etc.): [/b]
Shades more than color liter the world of control. I believe this to be purposeful in conveying the atmosphere that it is trying to establish. The FBC is a government division that adheres strictly to their dress codes, rules and regulations, and rituals. This builds a bland but detailed building that purposely bores you as you walk its non-distorted halls. Soon into the game you learn about astral planes which are pockets outside our dimensions yet still bland in color. Its only purpose is to train the new director, Jesse, in her newly acquired positional powers. Again, I feel as though this is done on purpose to frame a juxtaposition of incredibly extraordinary things happening to ordinary people who treats the happenings in this situation like another day on the job. The art that truly shines is graphical fidelity (granted you have a rig that takes advantage of it). This game is beautifully optimized and takes full advantage of NVIDIAs DLSS technology. In the beginning I opted out of using it just to see how my rig fared (80-100FPS on high settings). Once I turned on DLSS not only was I able to take advantage of the ray tracing, but the sampling also improved the graphical fidelity of the game without making it all look too smooth. Control’s art direction may have been bland, but it was intentional to convey the story told and its beauty shines through on the technological front giving the user a fluid and pretty experience.",1690578647,1690578725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game play is satisfying and fun, but I can't help but feel there were a couple missed opportunities to really make it shine. The biggest probably being that the game could've benefited from a handful more enemy types, this wasn't a deal breaker but definitely would've freshened up the latter half of the game. Secondly, the weapon mods felt underutilized. Each weapon setup(except one) has at least one mod that is straight up the best option, and then there's a universal mod you can find that's a percentage damage boost, and those two end up taking 2/3 of all weapon mod slots, basically making them an afterthought.

But the content is at times very silly. Like how the Janitor is possibly one of the more powerful entities that you encounter or how one of the lines from this super creepy mantra you hear constantly simply says ""orange peel"" (Seriously, never imagined 'orange peel' was gonna creep me out some day but here we are). The world - despite being very dada-ist at times - is not afraid to take itself seriously and it lends to the overall fidelity excellently. Also, despite how whimsical it feels at times it's a very uneasy environment. The game definitely doesn't let you feel comfortable anywhere really.

The story itself is super-interesting. Pseudo-meta but not bad. I'll leave it at interesting to avoid spoiling anything. I spent more time reading and theory-crafting on this game than in Dead Space.

As for the difficulty, I see people calling it a souls-like. But really it's as close to Dark Souls as it is to Devil May Cry. You can do all kinds of wild stuff when you know the mechanics and have your build, but then you can also still die to silly mistakes. Not many damage sponge enemies. More like rock, paper, scissors. Combat is a lot of fun too. I don't know what game to compare it to, but it's definitely in the shoot 'em up category. It's not an easy game, but it's not hard either. Really good balance. Fun, smart AI (for the most part, can still be cheesed like any other).

Still, you have to know, straight off the bus, the game launches in ""hardcore"" mode by default. Meaning, you'd better tweak with the settings called ""assistance"" if you're the kind of adult who knows playing is about having fun, not constantly checking if your d*** did'nt fall off... 
Now, having played the whole game, I understand there's a method to this madness: to truly make the player feel the shift from ""scared and hepless"" to ""powerful and in control"". Smart and commandable considering the story, but the highway to Pandemonium was paved with good intentions...

Which brings us to storyteling concerns. 
After Action & Horror in ""Alan Wake"", Remedy decided to venture into Horror & Superhero territory. A bold move, considering both genres are spiritual opposites: horror thrives on helplessness, superheroes thrive on powerfulness. 
It could have worked! If the writers had not missed an important point: if Horror can take a jig-saw narrative (as ""Alan Wake"" brilliantly showed) because Horror thrives on making its audience feel uncomfortable, such is really not the case with superheroes. Superhero stories need to hit clear milestones in the right order to work properly. In this case:
- the ""ashtray maze"", the biggest ""hero moment"", happens too soon, in the second act, before the all-is-lost moment. 
- the mandatory comeback from the ""all-is-lost moment"" is downplayed too much
- the final confrontation feels meaningless in regard to the hero's growth
- there's no formal 'retrun to the initial world, changed'
This all contributes to making the ending of ""Control"" particularly unsatisfying. It feels rushed and dragged on a the same time, without delivering the proper ""epic vibe"" that all the previous build-up required by this point. Too bad.

That said, ""Control"" will still take you along a wonderful ride, full of suprises, clever ideas, mind-bending suggestions, unsettling discoveries, and bombastic moves. Plus, once you've completed the main story, the ""Alan Wake"" DLC is a real treat that unexpectedly manages to quench some of the 'superhero thirst' the main ending left you with!

So, no, ""Control"" isn't perfect, but it still so much better than a crushing majority of games that feel like carbon-copies of the same cash-cow. Thumbs up.",1690129239,1690129239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tl;dr this is an 8 hour game, with 5 hours of bloated combat and audio logs and 4-5 hours of okay DLC.

So, they smashed Infamous 2 and SCP together in an interesting world with tight gameplay, and still dogged the whole thing up. The art, audio, and gameplay mechanics all feel top notch. Who screwed up the rest of the game?

I always crank up difficulty in games. This is the first time I wanted to crank it down- simply because the combat is so incredibly boring. I hope you enjoyed the first hour of combat gameplay because that's what you get. There's like 4 enemies and half of the spawn are the self-destruct types, and there's always 2-3x the amount of enemies there needs to be. In Metroid, enemies serve a purpose and eventually you can avoid them. In Borderlands, enemies are abundant but go down fast and don't hamper gameplay. In this, they're clunky, obnoxious, and slow everything down.

The reload mechanic and inventory limits are pointless clutter. Reload slows combat for no reason, inventory means you have to empty junk constantly.

You can finish the game entirely missing 2 powers, and their presence in combat gameplay is so minimal that you won't even care if you ignore them.

The game can't decide if wants to be dark & serious or goofy and insane, but not in a charming way- in a completely disconnected way. The best part of the entire game was a butt-rock, live-playing-a-music-video section that lasted 2-3 minutes. The whole game should've just committed to that energy.

The MC would be great if they weren't inconsistent. The whole first couple hours they're insistent on being called by their first name then immediately disrespect someone who asked the same thing of her... What?

There's a whole weapon/body mods page that I basically ignored. Like 40% of the mechanics in the game don't serve much purpose. They should've just focused on a better game instead of half-hashed mechanics.

Oh but at least you get to PLAY AN ALAN WAKE ADVERTISEMENT. That's the future of gaming, kiddos. We play our advertisements now. 

Just go read some SCP articles and play a better game instead of playing this and wishing it lived up to its potential.",1689992994,1689992994,False,0,1,0.45446622371673584,0,True,False,False

Don’t fall for any of it. After roughly 5 hours of playtime I finally realized that Control is not anything special.

Trust me, you’ve played this game before. Especially if you have 20+ years of gaming under your belt. It borrows various bits from other AAA titles and tries to merge them together. The result is frankly, a kind of boring game to be in—one very large building. Endless variations of gray interior spaces inspired by 1960s Brutalist architecture.

The story seems impossible to keep up with and really doesn’t make any sense. It's not engaging and quite confusing. The more questions you ask, the more you find fault. Suspending YOUR reality to enjoy the reality of this game is not possible. I view it as an ‘accessible psychological thriller’ for a very general audience. Even this descriptor is pushing it. 

Combat is “okay”. Weapons can be crafted. You shoot, run, jump, squat, melee, dash, etc. Objects can be harnessed and later thrown. Environment is destructible. Remember, we’ve played this already.

This is yet another AAA game that requires a significant amount of time to complete. Players meet characters, get sent on quests, find keys, unlock doors, read letters, pick up upgrades, shoot bad guys, platform, die, re-spawn at checkpoints, wander around aimlessly, and then get lucky finding where you should be going. Level maps suck, and the game provides little direction or guidance. Descriptions for main quests and side missions are poorly written and provide zero enthusiasm to continue.

I quit and deleted my game save shortly after beginning the basement/maintenance “sewer” level. It had an overall green tint. Soooo original and groundbreaking.",1689813860,1689814089,False,0,1,0.468085110187530518,0,True,False,False

Control is set in a breathtaking mid-century office block which compels exploration and rewards the player with connections between areas and hidden secrets. Well-known Brutalist architecture is quoted and remixed throughout the design. 

Control is especially recommended for fans of Prey, Bioshock and antecedents, mixing guns and powers in a similar fashion. Gameplay is challenging up to and including the final missions, with a variety of strategies and approaches available. The expansions add literal arcade challenges but are worth playing for the additional narratives (note that though AWE is available before the last mission, it makes more sense to wait). 

Influences include Twin Peaks, seen so clearly in Alan Wake, along with X-Files and the Southern Reach trilogy (itself adapted into Annihilation 2018). The supporting documents and found objects are well-written and each contributes to the overall narrative. There’s little here to criticise -  perhaps the optional challenges found in the game are bit too difficult or obscure, but these are optional and help is available if the player is stuck.

Usually the mystery unravels and becomes more grounded as you are moving through it but here it never reaches that point so you slowly become I want to say exhausted but really bored is basically it. A game desperately trying not to be boring by doing too much becomes exactly that, boring.

And the ""conclusions"" that the story manages to find the time to get to are okay. The story is okay. 

It's also very bloated for absolutely no reason and I really do mean absolutely no reason.

Like the game itself, I went back and forth between trying to decide if it is good or not.

The graphics, in their purposefully bizarre manner, are very good. If you are looking for something that looks super realistic, wait, dreamlike, no, clearly not realistic, this game hits the spot. Ray tracing does a great job helping it achieve its goal... whatever that may be...

Gameplay fits into the game's mold of having absolutely no mold very well. CONTROL is well known for its NVIDIA physics, which do indeed work well. Otherwise, it's a very straightforward 3rd person shooter. Most missions are completely unnecessary (even the psychotic fridge that eats you if you don't stare at it). No way to adjust difficulty, and dying by stupidity can happen... a lot. A bit random, but it's a nice tiny feature to be able to switch your POV from right to left (gotta let you know here since the game sure won't). The few boss fights are decently fun, though it's rather disappointing that the game doesn't even have a final boss.

Story is, um - yeah, sure. There's a story. Is that enough on that? For me, a very forgettable 11hrs.

Last note for those dyslexic friends playing - the main character likes to not look at those shes talking to, or her eyes just decide to go cross-eyed for a little bit.

Game tries to be a platformer but there is not enough freedom of motion, can't understand where you will fall and it sucks when you think that you can grab that ledge but you can't, and fall to an endless pit and die. Game tries to be a third person shooter and sucks at it in many ways but most importantly there is NO AIM ASSIST FOR CONTROLLER. If you try to be a souls-like game you set yourself that it will be played with a controller, and there is no aim assist. Yes there is aim assist for controllers option but it does nothing, further aim assist options are gated behind ""assist mode"" which hurts my feelings. There is a game that does aim assist perfectly, Metal Gear Solid V which i played for hours. Lore seemed intruiging but i won't play it for lore.

Overall I strongly recommend anyone who likes sci-fi and a more story driven cinematic game to play Control. If I had to compare it to a game that I have played before I would choose cyberpunk. Many elements are similar however I would rank Control far above Cyberpunk as the level of polish is much higher. 

One of Control's strongest elements is the environment it places you in. I still have yet to explore every corner of the building where the story takes place. Each sector and the rooms within are artistically designed with strange architecture that complements the lore behind the building itself. When I initially realized I wouldn't leave the building I was disappointed, but in the end the whole experience was unique and memorable. 

In terms of combat. It is obvious that combat was not supposed to be the focus of the game. This would be like saying the story sucks while reviewing a competitive fps game. Despite this, I was pleasantly surprised. I do wish there was more depth to it, but looking at the product as a whole especially when I bought it on sale for $12 I was blown away. Don't get this game if you're looking for Doom combat. It is still satisfying and fun enough to do some repeatable fights, but it is not intended to be as captivating as the story elements. 

SPOILER WARNING... 

[spoiler]If you're going into this game with no prior knowledge like I did I suggest you do that and to not read on. If you want to know the story, then essentially Control is a spin on the SCP universe. You end up fighting with this inter-dimensional being that is taking over the main base of operations for the Federal Bureau of Control. Mixed in there is some stuff with your brother. Overall the story is good, but I think it has 2 major weak points. Without breaking down every major plot point between Jesse and Dylan, I think the story would be much stronger if Dylan was either removed entirely or presumed dead until he is revealed to still be alive later as a minor character. 

My second largest problem with the of the story is the motivations behind Jesse being the director. She clearly has no prior knowledge of the FBC and is even skeptical of them multiple times throughout the story. This brings into question why even help them in the first place. Jesse walks into the equivalent of The Matrix chosen one story and she has zero reservations on wtf is going on and where is her brother. What gets me is they do this whole thing of she doesn't trust the FBC and she wants to find her brother, but she is their lapdog the whole time doing everything and more that they ask with hardly anything in return for a long time. I think the story would be a lot stronger if they went along the lines of the gun choosing her and she is adamant about finding Dylan or happens to find him along the way of trying to escape and he is the one to convince her to be the hero.[/spoiler]

TLDR/CLOSING

I got this game for 70% off sale and it was more than worth it. For the price every small gripe is easily over looked. Biggest take away is the interesting lore and sci-fi elements. The level design was also a major positive. I probably couldn't name a single other game that such unique world design.

Now, let's get to the negatives:

Story: Sam Lake can't seriously write a good story anymore. After Max Payne he fell off pretty hard. Similar to Alan Wake, the story in this game is an incomprehensive pretentious nonsense. It's just dumb.

Gameplay: the gameplay loop is a carbon copy of Alan Wake. Go from point A to B, kill waves of enemies, get back from point B to A, kill more waves of enemies. At least in this game there is a good variety of weapons and abilities; In Alan Wake it was just soul-crushingly dull.

And they just added every cliché in the modern video games. Of course the map is metroidvania-esque, of course there are bonfires instead of normal checkpoints, of course you lose resources upon dying, of course the main character is a brain-dead (so the target audience can relate) schizophrenic that never shuts up throughout the game, of course there are a hundred mundane chores of a side quest in the game, of course there is a several hours long crossover with another unrelated game to get people nostalgic and hyped-up for remasters and sequels, and much more.

And something funny; Who are you in this game? The [b]""director""[/b] of a federal bureau of something. What do you do as a ""director"" there? Watering plants, delivering mails, talking to plants for whatever reason, cleaning toilets from mold or something, running errands for random prisoners, taking orders from every idiot in the building, ....

Mechanical the game is pretty flawless. 

Now why don’t I recommend this game? 
I’m having a really hard time finishing it and have completely lost momentum with it. A few hours in and I’m just bored at this point. There’s no variation in enemies nor are there any variation in how the enemies respond. Essentially you enter rooms and do the same type of combat over and over again. There’s just no motivation to keep on playing.

It's a shame because the combat is actually fun but after a few hours the repetitive nature of the combat will really start to wear on you.

This game is a seamless, PC optimized, gorgeously-crafted combination between Everything You Love about Tomb Raider, cuz who doesn't adore Lara, and the atmospheric wonder that is our beloved Half-Life: Alyx.

Remedy has already proved to me in ""Quantum Break"" that they can create cool, crazy third-person action, and they demonstrate this again in ""Control"".

As usual with Remedy, in the game ""Control"" you will find a rather confusing story, and perhaps the most confusing of all stories at the moment. In the role of Jesse Feiden, you find yourself in a secret American agency called the Federal Bureau of Control in search of your brother, who was abducted by this agency several decades ago. However, the agency is empty and infected with some kind of psychic force. You find the dead director of the agency and automatically become the new director, taking his mental service weapon. And now you are faced with the task of using psychic abilities to rid the supernatural agency of the psychic force that has invaded it, while continuing to search for your own brother.

This particular initial situation is, in fact, very funny and fascinating. First of all, it offers the basis for an unusual and cool gameplay. Gradually, you unlock new psychic abilities and weapon modes to, for example, levitate or throw objects through the air. The gameplay is excellent and gives a lot of fun. Gradually, you work your way through various departments of power, learn more about them and about the supernatural-esoteric reality that the authorities are trying to hide from the public, and move the plot forward.

The extravagant nature of the story and the extravagant levels that follow from it are the best entertainment. Of course, if you like mundane literature, you should give preference to Control, but if you like fiction and mystery at least a little, you will get a whole truck of fun here. It is a pity, however, that much remains mysterious and unclear until the very end. But this in itself can be experienced.

The plot is more problematic. Not only does it have several holes, but, unfortunately, it remains extremely flat. This is facilitated by the extremely weak performance of the actors, and a poorly written script. The great catastrophe, the huge danger emanating from an alien force, all the victims to which it leads, as well as the supposedly very emotional search for a sibling are shown incredibly emotionless. The main character remains ultra-pale and seems untouched by all this horror. Unfortunately, this deprives the game of a huge amount of atmosphere, which in fact should make up a large part of the game.

There remains only an unusual gameplay. It's solid, and the controls are mostly very intuitive. However, in the second half of the game it loses its appeal because over time it seems extremely repetitive. As a result, even the unusual abilities of the main character lose their appeal at some point. There could be a lot more of them with a lot of variety. I think of a wild train chase with a movie camera at the ready. The game could have used more of these special moments. (And whoever is thinking now: what the hell did he mean by that? Welcome to the crazy world of Control...).

On the other hand, what's great is the graphics and sound. Especially real fragments of films that are interspersed every now and then, very cool and appropriate.

𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭:

In general, this is a strong and fascinating third-person action game, with an interesting story and creative mechanics, which, however, has serious drawbacks in terms of plot and acting and becomes very repetitive towards the end. Therefore, this is not a masterpiece, but still a recommended game, especially for fans of strange mysterious stories.

Graphics just don't work properly, I can't read any inscriptions and textures are crappy. I played on RTX 3060 Laptop gpu, which is well above what's reccomended, but I guess the game just isn't adjusted for that gpu, idk. The story as I remember it is OK, I used to realy dig in details and stuff, but maybe this is what got me so confused and purposeless in life. But it was first such game that I played or maybe even the first game, so that is why it realy impacted me, but now after playing Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal, I see from a different angle. This game is a complete rip-off of the game Doom 2016 in terms of lockdows, buildings, demons etc. It seems that developers just didn't have enough budget to polish the game, as the graphics are completely not working properly.",1688760772,1688760772,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

But for those interested in the details, here are the key points I wish to mention: 

Pros:
- Good aesthetic: The Oldest House and the Bureau have a consistent theme that meshes with the lore. The feel of the world combines well with the sound design.
- Sound design: The atmosphere and music are all effective at creating a mood of an otherworldly place blended with the human influence of the Bureau. From the slight unease of exploring the offices and laboratories to the frenzied combat against the Hiss, you'll find yourself enjoying what's being presented.
- Story: The story is generally good and the lore of the world, especially when considering the Foundation and AWE DLCs' contributions tickles my personal fancy greatly. One of the better stories I've experienced.
- Doesn't Take Forever: Some games you return to for a number of different routes the story can take and the expansive world, but Control offers a solid alternative - It will give you a story and a world, then lets you proceed at them at your own pace, but also won't demand hundreds or thousands of hours of your commitment for you to get the most of Control.
- Good price: Doesn't bleed your pockets dry, especially if bought during a sale.

Neutrals:
- Gameplay: It can be a mixed bag depending on the control setup and how you handle it, but the difficulty is generally good, though certain fights against a few bosses (optional and compulsory) can be incredibly rough due to Control's particular health management style where you might not get a chance to heal from certain enemies' aggressive damage output. Otherwise the gunplay and freedom of fighting that expands as you gain new abilities is highly enjoyable. Maneuvering around the environment and solving the odd puzzles are all generally enjoyable, though some puzzles can be somewhat obscure.
- Random Documents and Audio Logs: The lore of Control is mainly presented via mix of documents and audio logs you pick up as you look around. Some are located in obscure locations and dark corners, but most are easy enough to find.

Cons:
- Difficulty inconsistency: This is the major complaint I personally have. Certain enemy encounters, boss fights and side-missions suddenly spike up the difficulty to the point of you having to retry some encounters to the point of frustration. While you can somewhat adapt, it is not by much.
- Resource management: The open-ish world structure of the Old House you explore over the game offers relative freedom, but also comes with the divisive presence of resources that you acquire randomly via defeating enemies and the odd resource cache that gives you 1-2 of a certain resource, which can make getting weapon upgrades somewhat tedious. Thankfully Control's resource grinding is far more lenient than some other games, but it might turn others off.
- RNG: The RNG-reliant drop rates for resources and modifications for health, energy, weapon damage etc. are not overly complicated and there's enough variety to suit different playstyles, but having to sink time to acquire the right mods can be quite jarring, as you might end up with a slightly better or inferior duplicate of an already-owned modification for your trouble with no real control of the outcome. 

Overall
Generally speaking, Control Ultimate Edition is a very solid experience that doesn't overstay its welcome, its only major problem being an inconsistent difficulty curve. The trappings of resource gathering and RNG drops can be more of a problem to some than others, but generally the game offers an interesting story and setting that you get to explore with relative abandon.

- If your cutscenes are stuttering with an nVidia GPU: (1) download nVidia profile inspector from his github repo, (2) find control in the list of games and go to the category ""common"", (3) change ""rBAR"" to ""disable. You will have to do this every time the nVidia driver updates (or until nVidia herelf disable it in the update).
- If your screen goes black with just the outline of the object showing, just exit the game (not just the menu) and go back in. If this happen too often and your GPU is overclocked, try removing the OC (some people said it helped). My GPU is not overclocked and happened to me 4 times in my playthrough.
- If your game keeps crashing in a particular level in the foundations DLC, disable e-cores in your bios. Re-enable them when you finish the game. I found out this too late and already uninstalled the game :( . Only one final boss missing, so not worth the time of installing again.

MODS:
-Better Character Illumination: because your character is 100% of the time in the middle of the screen and is very badly lighted. Just search for the mod on nexus, watch the screenshots and decide for yourself.
- No other mods needed, the game is good.

SHORT REVIEW (from someone with too little time for gaming)
My job allows me less then a couple of hours in the evening to play games, so keep that in mind.
Game is short but good: my playtime counts for the main game, with all the good (I hope) side-missions and both DLCs.
If you don't plan to grind for upgrades (like me), you will have just 2/3 weapon maxed out by the end of the game (not counting DLCs). As for abilities I had almost 3 full ones.
You can NOT save whenever you like, but savepoints are not too far away from one another (you can have small sessions).
The game is not scary, but can be disturbing.

Really sucked me in when I was following the main missions but I found I tired of the side missions where you mainly killed stuff pretty quickly. Took about 20 hours to go through, didn't feel like sticking around to do more once I was done.

Edit - I seemed to have the dlc included; I'm not a massive fan of expansions but gave them a go. Foundation was tedious - much more linear for sure, just jumping flying around as far as i got. AWE better but omg I couldn't see what I was doing. So dark. Maybe I was just done by the game at this point though.

While the story is one of the strongest aspects, I found the combat mechanics and enemies extremely fun as well. There are no difficulty settings, but I found the difficulty in the game just perfect with enough challenge.
I love that probably half or even more of the story is told by the files you can find shattered around the game. It truly feels like an exploration mission. A player can decide how much they want to find and read those files, I do recommend you to aim to find and read everything! There are so many interesting things going on.

The characters are lovable too, from the Finnish janitor to some intriguing, slightly mentioned side characters and of course, our lovely main cast. Playing as Jesse felt really natural: she is a realistic character with realistic goals and attitudes. I hope we get to see more of her in Control 2!

The Ultimate Edition DLC also blends in really well, I did not even notice that I was playing DLC missions at some point of the game. I really like that they combined them all to one experience.

I bought when I learned that it shared the same universe with Alan Wake but still was hesitant to start playing it.
When I did it felt kind of bland though the bureaucratic aesthetics left an impression. After a couple of first missions I somehow stopped playing, the game felt too slow and I didn't really want to get into reading all of the notes.

But after a month or two I gave it another try and oh boy let me tell you this game gripped me really tight. Don't know what happened but the story started to unfold, combat mechanics started to appear and the game presented itself in full colors. I was binge-playing it for a week till late night.

I really liked the mystery of the game. The kind of late night mystery shows of America, something from the 80s, offices of the FBC that are bland and dry in their own charismatic way.

It's like X-Files mixed with Mandy minus the gore/blood. 100% recommendation.

I never played Alan Wake so didn't know what I was getting into. The world building is something you need to get used to, I think having some kind of introduction into the Supernatural elements of the game, would have helped a lot.

Instead you get thrown into a (at first glance) completely normal office building and a couple of minutes later, things are floating, walls are shifting, Guns are binding contracts for the CEO position, and traffic lights are rigorously reminding you to not jaywalk.

Works best if you simply accept that things are weird in this game and play along.

Just three negative points:
- The cutscenes were really stuttery on my PC, definitely something with the Framerate. I tried it with VSync, without Vsync, no success. They remained stuttery. Tolerable issue.
- The FPS would drop significantly when you opened and closed the map, which you do a lot. Annoying but also not gamebreaking.
- The Level Design and Map were sometimes so frustrating that I left a handful of side quests unfinished after tying to find the way for 20 minutes. Some areas are super annoying mazes and I'm not talking about the actual maze that is in the game. Most frustrating issue I had with the game.

Do you enjoy weird horror mythos like the SCP Foundation wiki, the X-Files, or Twin Peaks? Do you enjoy games with a focus on theme and world-building over a character-driven storyline? Do you enjoy games that reward exploration with lore tidbits that help piece together what's going on in the world around your character?

If so, then [i]Control[/i] is absolutely a must-play game for you. Stop reading this review and go play it.

If, on the other hand, you prefer linear games that put story and characters first, or stories that leave no question unanswered, then you may want to skip this one. Read on for more details.

[i]Control[/i] is a game that does a few things phenomenally well. It maintains an atmosphere of mystery, a sense that every shadow hides some horrible monstrosity that strains the bounds of human comprehension, the entire way through the story, without ever breaking it even after the conclusion. As much as is revealed about the Oldest House, the various otherworldly items and beings that populate it, and the workings of both in the wider world, more is left unsaid. The game's conclusion won't leave you with all the answers, but it will leave you with enough implications to piece together some of them for yourself. And in a story like this one, that's a rare achievement that is deserving of emphasis.

While the environments in [i]Control[/i] may seem intimidatingly labyrinthine at first, the abilities that allow the player to fully explore the game's world are front-loaded into the first half or so of the game's story, and the areas are interconnected in such a way that you really only ever need to backtrack if you want to explore for more lore, items, or side quests. Backtracking is made easy via the liberal placement of Control Points, which fill your health bar, act as save points, and allow for fast travel. It's a simple, functional system that invites exploration and rewards the player for indulging in it, without the monotony that plagues many other exploration-focused games of this type.

Finally, the set pieces that Remedy is known for return here in spectacular fashion. If you're a fan of their previous titles, you'll get your fill of new music from Poets of the Fall, accompanying moments where everything clicks and you're fighting against the odds to overcome an exciting and memorable challenge. Nobody does these set pieces like Remedy, and they were some of my favorite parts of the entire game.

Which brings me to the parts of [i]Control[/i] that were a letdown. First and foremost, like many ""open-world"" titles of its time, this game is bloated. For some players, this won't be an issue, because the movement mechanics are solid and the environments are interesting and well-designed. But the sheer amount of areas to explore and hidden secrets to find works against the game in two major ways--its itemization and its main story.

First, itemization. The weapon variations and upgrade system in [i]Control[/i] are serviceable, but its system of randomized add-ons that provide percentage-based stat boosts are an entirely unnecessary addition to the game. Most of them either stack on top of upgrade bonuses or are so niche in their effects as to be useless unless you are spamming one very specific sequence of attacks over and over. On top of that, there is a limit to the number you can carry, meaning you'll have to pause what you're doing relatively frequently throughout the game to clear them out. And when you realize that about half the hidden areas in the game only contain a couple of random add-ons or crafting materials, it becomes immediately apparent that cutting out this system entirely along with some of the superfluous secret areas would have made the game flow [i]much[/i] better.

Now for the story and characters, which will be the final nail in the coffin for a large number of players who might be interested in [i]Control[/i]. While the premise, world-building, and atmosphere of this game are all top-notch, the main story is simply not very interesting apart from a couple of great set-pieces. The primary culprit here is the characters. A small handful of characters are simply fantastic, with incredible voice-acting and memorable personalities. The rest of them, including (unfortunately) the main protagonist Jesse Faden, are inexplicably void of all charisma, personality, or character flaws. Exacerbating this to a grating degree is the limited dialogue system, which punctuates boring infodumps with jarring and totally unnecessary glimpses into Jesse's internal monologue. And this is a shame, because anyone familiar with Remedy's previous games will know that character writing is absolutely one of their strong suits. I don't know what went wrong in the writing room here--maybe too much of a focus on the majority of female characters presenting a ""strong"", unfazed demeanor in spite of the weirdness around them?--but whatever it was, it hamstrung the main story of this game in a big way. This, more than anything else, is what will ruin the game for the majority of players that bounce off it.

So is [i]Control[/i] a game you should play? Let me give some context. Normally, I'm the type of person who enjoys a great story and smooth mechanics above all else in my games. I'm on the edge of being the type of player who would probably bounce off a game like [i]Control[/i]. But if there is one thing I can say for Remedy as developers, it is that they (usually) seem to have a very clear idea of what they want to create in their games, and once they have that idea, they go for it full-throttle. In this case, they went full-throttle towards creating their own take on a world of SCP-like extraplanar entities and shadowy government agencies, grounded by references to real-world events and conspiracy theories and tying their previous games together into a semi-cohesive world. And when it comes to that aspect of [i]Control[/i], they absolutely [i]nailed it[/i], and that's what won me over.

So if that aspect of the game sounds intriguing to you, or if you answered ""yes"" to the questions at the start of this review and for some reason didn't heed my suggestion to stop reading and go play the game, then yes, you should give [i]Control[/i] a shot. But if you feel that the flaws I've described are too much for you to look past, then I wouldn't recommend it for you.

[b] IMPORTANT CAVEAT (minor spoilers ahead)[/b]:

If you are looking forward to [i]Alan Wake II[/i], and you think you can look past the shortcomings of [i]Control[/i], it may be worth playing through the game and its DLC for story-related reasons. Additionally, if you haven't played the original [i]Alan Wake[/i], I [i]strongly[/i] suggest you do so before playing [i]Control[/i]. It is the better game in a number of ways, and you owe it to yourself not to spoil it.

[spoiler]The second DLC (AWE) ties [i]Control[/i] very strongly into the world of [i]Alan Wake[/i], and heavily implies that the Federal Bureau of Control and/or the Oldest House will have some role to play in the upcoming [i]Alan Wake II[/i]. This will likely be more than a couple of simple lore references, so while you probably won't [i]need[/i] to have played [i]Control[/i] to understand [i]Alan Wake II[/i], you will most likely miss some major story connections if you haven't played it.[/spoiler]",1687738053,1687738053,True,0,0,0.470852047204971313,0,True,False,False

- Great combat scenes, especially once you have gained more levels in some key abilities.

- Some of the side-quests are truly shiiiit, and although they can be mostly ignored, sticking to the main quest chains.. You'd quickly feel the effects of falling behind on mods, perks and so forth.
- Navigation can be a slog at times, mostly due to huge areas all maintaining a very similar look.

- Low quality, slow texture pop-in, weird on a more than sufficiently specced PC. No I can't be arsed installing mods and fucking about with config files. I expect the dev to do that for me. I'll just run it on the deck.

It gives me the feel of survival game, although there is no consumables in the game and the ammo is regened overtime.
There is a limit room for the backpack that is only for the mods on weapon or character.

For the combat the game encourages the player to be aggressive, agile, as healing can only be done by absorbing shards busted by hitting enemies, and enemies can throw many high damage projectiles to the player if they keep hiding under the cover. At the end of the main story there are several forced consecutive and intense battles, I have to admit that's my least favorite part, fortunately, even if you die and reload the progress is partially saved, and they are not really that difficult.

I saw many complains about the lack of navigation system or how confuse the 2D map is. For me that's a no issue, as when I played the game I quickly noticed there are signs are plates all over there. And after cleared the main story, I realized the map is very accurate, and there is really no magical rooms that used dimensional folding techniques, or anything such as an upward elevator leads to a lava poor, even though I wouldn't be surprised as they fits the theme well, and I was expecting something like a false map caused by the building shifts, but that didn't happened.

Most of the puzzles can find their hints in the surround environment, some of the puzzles has very important hints in the dialogue, so if you skipped it or missed it could be very hard. Some of the side quests can be very toxic.

What I like the most is the sound FX/music aspect of the game, the developers have definitely made lot of effort on the details, and they did too much on rendering the horrific emotion which effectively made the initial sequences of the game like a horror game to me. But once get the big gun it is just a matter of switching between crash them all with concretes and blast them with service weapon.",1687497588,1687497588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics on this game are insane. The lighting is beautiful. Definitly worth playing with ray tracing. The way they use lighting to fill the atmosphere is unlike anything I have seen in a game. The areas are surprisingly diverse for an office building setting.

Combat is pretty fun. Mostly using throwing powers and finishing with gun play. Dashes. This game has fun mechanics, but the main focus of the game seems to be story and mystery. The game isnt fight bad things in this room, then move to the next room and fight more. There are decent areas of exploration and story discovery mixed in. The pacing seems pretty good so far. I have hit a steep difficulty issue, where i might be under leveled. The difficulty spike was harsh and I am trying to do side quests to be more powerful. It is interesting that going back to other areas the mobs are easier now. The mobs are numbered with how hard they are and low number mobs are really easy now. After doing some side quests the difficulty corrected itself. By the time I beat the game and moved on to the expansion I was overpowered.

The story is very interesting. A mystery, similar to stranger things vibe. It goes deep, but also stays shallow. The lore is there if you want to dive into it, but you dont have to. It is a very mystery filled world. Even after beating the game, there are tons of questions left unanswered. I bet a lot of them would be answered if I read the lore. Overall very interesting story.

I beat the main story at 21 hours. The difficulty level was pretty good throughout accepting the one part where i was under leveled. I dont really understand the story, but it was very interesting. I will just go to youtube for explanations. After beating the game it goes right into expansions which is pretty cool. I was still interested in playing the expansion, but by the time I finished the foundation expansion, I was ready to be done with the game. Over all I thought this was a really well done game with an interesting story and insanely good graphics. The game play was fun and I think there are several ways to build your character, although I would imagine throwing abilities are the most powerful builds.

-A very fluid gameplay and mechanics. Love it
What I LOVED
-""Control"" really nails the ""huge paranormal foundation"" aesthetic that I know and love. The devs have said multiple times that the SCP Foundation universe was a huge source of inspiration for them, and it shows!

Conclusion: highly recommended. One of my new favourite games from now on.

The game has a few cool things about it. The destructive environments, interesting combat and some intriguing x-files type stuff. Lighting and environments were good. Facial animations were good. It started out great but 5 hours in, it stalled into a nosedive.

I hated shooting my weak gun for 2 second to do minor damage than waiting for it to recharge for 5 while I flee from waves of enemy spawns who are like tanks with recharging health who hit like trucks. Pure frustration. And if you die you are spawned at the last control point and are completely lost in the labyrinth.

The last quest that made me quit was a side quest that had me searching for 9 eggs in a very large sector. Pure tedium. You can do egg hunts only if the search area is limited, not a labyrinth.

Main character has the personality of a brick. Story characters were forgettable.

The 2D map is completely useless in a multilevel building. I spent to much time wandering around lost trying to find where I was supposed to go because they couldn't be bothered to have a compass.

At first glance it seems to be a gorgeous triple A title with smooth gameplay, then you look a little closer and realize that all those ray traced surfaces take 3 seconds to texture no matter what you try or hardware you use. Combat seems pretty interesting with a bunch of powers like telekinesis.. except.. it isn't. Psi-Ops did it better over a decade ago. The enemies are boring, repetitive, and either never a threat or ready to insta-kill you. You start to realize that CONTROL boasts something of an open world Metroid-vania, only to come to the conclusion that it's confusing as fuck and never really directs you where to go. This wouldn't be such an issue if everything didn't look like an office building no matter where you go. Finally you unlock flight so you can go back and get all those secrets you missed along the way.. except they don't matter because mods for your character and weapon are not subjective, they're either better or they're not, +10% damage or +20%, no trade off, and it isn't hard to get the best. Well at least I can unlock a cool skin for the player character to choose how I tackle the game visually.. except you can't. You only get an interesting skin once the campaign is over. One thing I will say for CONTROL is that the side quests are well thought out and interesting. Environmental destruction is top notch as well, pushing the limits of particles and physics in games.

Artifact Document: Game Disc - Control

Designation: AI97-PE

Summary:
AI97-PE, codenamed ""Control,"" is a game disc that induces a state of euphoria in players. It creates an immersive and pleasurable gaming experience, enhancing sensory perception, focus, and cognitive abilities. However, containment is crucial due to addictive qualities and potential memetic effects.
 
Reports that civilians who have played ""Control"" gain [spoiler][REDACTED][/spoiler] to the FBC Headquarters are being investigated.

Description:
AWE-3487, ""Control,"" is a black game disc that contains an image of an inverted pyramid, believed to be a representation of [spoiler][REDACTED][/spoiler].

Containment:
The ""Control"" disc requires secure containment within the Parapsychology Division. Access is restricted to Level 4 personnel. Strict monitoring of exposed individuals is necessary to prevent unauthorized dissemination and societal disruptions. Progress within the game beyond the personnel's Access Level is strictly forbidden.

Risks:
Prolonged exposure may lead to neglect of real-world responsibilities, isolation, and physical strain. ""Control"" also possesses memetic potential, increasing its spread through shared experiences.

Conclusion:
AI97-PE ""Control"" offers an immersive gaming experience, but stringent containment and ongoing research are necessary. Further investigation into its origin and purpose is recommended to develop appropriate countermeasures.

I fell in love with Remedy a couple years back, and i still think is one of the best game companies out there.

 I'm superficially knowledgeable of the SCP universe, and acquianted enough to find the inspiration Control took from them, and to be honest, it works. Finding the redacted files, the different effects that OoP and AI have, the hidden locations. Everything works. I found the story engaging enough, even when you play it a second time (this is my second run). The DLC's are pretty long and with added mechanics that makes the game not repetitive. I haven't played the Alan Wake games but i got the basis of the story enough to enjoy the AWE DLC. 

The achievements are not hard at all, in fact with just a bit attention to surroundings and exploration, you probably will get most of them naturally. My only recommendation is that you do the Board Countermeasures as you play, since if you left it all until the end like me, you are gonna have a bad time. After finishing the main missions, both in the main story and the DLC's, the amount of enemies drops to nearly 0, so it becomes a bit of a hassle to do this. Still, less than 40 hours for a very complete, interesting and engaging game, is not bad at all.

So, what's up with Control? What's the story like? Well, you play as Jesse Faden, a young woman who arrives in New York in search of her brother, believing he might be held in the Federal Bureau of Control. When they were kids, strange events happened in their hometown, and this is when Jesse's younger brother was captured by the FBC, while she managed to run away, helped by Polaris, a mysterious entity that accompanies our hero. Once inside the FBC, things seem to take a turn for the worse, as the entire facility is on lockdown, having been invaded by a mysterious entity, only known as ""the Hiss"", capable of controlling the minds of unprotected FBC employees. Honestly, I can't go into much more detail, as it'd both be spoiler heavy, and incredibly trippy for me to explain. Let me say this, though, if you enjoy stories about nebulous government organizations dealing with paranormal shit, this game might be right up your alley.

Now, following on with the story, or rather the writing, I think it's one of the strongest aspects of the game. Maybe not necessarily because of the main story, that might depend on you. However, I loved all the background details you could learn about through collectibles, as it really humanizes the FBC personnel. Usually, when there's stories about mysterious organizations like the FBC, their employees are all super serious all the time. Not here, here you can see how these people were just like any other common worker; while there were some weirder characters, most of them were just people with their jobs and their regular lives, with the exception that their job consisted in protecting the public, and maybe reality itself, from threats beyond our wildest imaginations.

Gameplay wise... Well, I'll admit that after I got to the first boss, I went to the options menu and activated the ""invincibility"" cheat. You can still die from fall damage, it's just enemies can't kill you, and while it's true that I might've deprived myself from the challenge of combat, I still had a lot of fun with the combat, despite the lack of risks. For combat, you get a single weapon, the Service Weapon. However, it is what the game calls an ""Object of Power"", and it's capable of changing between different forms, although you can only have two forms equipped at the same time. Even then, you also get some cool telekinetic powers, like a melee blast, and the ability to launch random objects towards your enemies. There's a rather extensive skill tree with a lot of upgrades, and you can also upgrade all the Service Weapon forms; not to mention the ""mods"" you can get both for your weapon, and your character itself.

Graphically, the game looks great, though I gotta say, by the time I got to the DLCs, after beating the main story, I started experiencing some semi-frequent crashes, which made finishing them rather annoying. Speaking of the DLCs, the game includes all of them. The Expeditions DLC is a relatively simple challenge mode of sorts, for getting extra resources and such. The story DLCs, on the other hand, are The Foundation, and AWE. The first one has you go to the depths of the Oldest House (the setting of the game), in order to deal with something that threatens not only the Oldest House itself, but maybe all of reality, while AWE... Well, those initials might as well stand for the Alan Wake Experience. That's right, while the main game has some references to Alan Wake, this DLC is a straight-up crossover, with some really interesting bits of lore added to the interconnected Remedy Universe.

Finally, I was forgetting about sound design. For the most part, it's very good, though one minor annoyance I had is that the game uses your system language as default. In my case, it's Spanish, but I like playing games on English, and while you can change audio and text dialogue (I did), the Hiss' ""chant"" remains on the system language. Despite being my native language, I couldn't really understand what they were chanting until I learned of this fact; I guess it wasn't helped by the fact that the Spanish accent is different from Latin American accent. A cool concept, in theory, but it can get lost. Oh, another thing I was forgetting, the soundtrack; it's excellent, particularly during a certain story section that I won't spoil, but if you're familiar with Alan Wake, I'll say it involves the Old Gods of Asgard.

The game is stylish for sure, dashing through wooden desks and glass windows never gets old but you cannot build a house with paint alone.

Dream like narrative of Control is intriguing at first but gets tedious after a while. Seems like Remedy had a certain gameplay mechanic in mind then designed everything else around that. I really didn't care about Jesse, Dylan or most of the characters I already forgot names of. Everybody feels wooden and inhuman in Control.

The weakest point of Control is combat for sure. It's fun for first few hours but quickly falls apart and become rinse and repeat. Just go to new area, fight the same enemies and move on.
Combat is very inconsistent and unfair as well, you get one shot kills from debris thrown by enemies you cannot see. Enabling various assist options game offers helps to come extend but even that couldn't make me stick around.

I expected it to be more like Alan Wake where the enemies were beatable in at least a few days. Here I just had to give up at a certain point and turn on the assist mode. If you die, you are penalized and you are returned to the closest control point and you have to start over and over and over and over and over and over again. This is just frustrating. Would have been much better to be returned to the point where I died. I initially gave up but then discovered the assist mode and proceeded with it for the sake of the story. 
The story is also not as good as in AW. I just don't get it. It is told mostly through documents, a lot of text, text, text, text, text that one has to read to understand what's going on. And everything is dark all the time. The storytelling component is just not the best.

What I ended up with was the virtual equivalent of a hamster wheel.'Control' clearly puts the 'art' in 'artificial intelligence'. Its enemies exhibit the kind of brilliant diversity typically reserved for a pack of lemmings heading towards a cliff. After a few rounds of combat, I found myself thinking, “Why use strategy, when you can simply press the same sequence of keys until your fingers develop a mind of their own?”The game's location, The Federal Bureau of Control, felt like an endless, twisting labyrinth. Unfortunately, the minotaur at its center had apparently taken a long vacation, and in his place was the echo of the same three or four encounters that I'd had at the start of the game. With every turn, I felt like a seasoned time traveler, having seen it all before.Then there's the narrative. 'Control's story is as abstract as a Picasso painting. The problem is, Picasso never charged me fifty bucks to figure out what the heck is going on in one of his paintings. By the time I pieced together the scattered documents and cryptic video messages, I was less concerned about the paranormal activities and more concerned about my creeping existential dread.At the end of the day, 'Control' is not just a game. It's a monotonous techno-ballet. It's a symphony played on one note. It's the gaming equivalent of Groundhog Day, minus the charm of Bill Murray and the relief of a new day.In conclusion, if you're an enthusiast of pressing the same keys repeatedly while navigating through an ever-recycling landscape of baddies, then 'Control' might just be the greatest thing since pre-sliced bread.

The backdrop of the game had a lot of potential as its mysterious and creepy atmosphere captured my interest immediately. However, the overarching main story doesn't take this further, especially in the area of enemy design. Most of the enemies throughout the main story remain the same, with the really interesting ones being in the side content and I'm really not sure why they weren't introduced in the main game. The creepy/mysterious atmosphere sort of stays stagnant and is never really elevated. Sure, the world gets expanded upon in the form of collectibles but I can't help but feel that form of storytelling is a bit outdated. The weapon/personal mods doesn't really add that much to the game, nor did it really change up my playstyle and it felt too game-ified and I think it would have been better if it was left out entirely. 

However, where this game really excels is in its gameplay and the level design. Hurling objects at enemies, controlling them, and being able to levitate and shoot from above never ceased to feel satisfying even when the enemy types didn't change much. The way the level shifts, move, and its use of bizarre geometric effects really sells the paranormal backdrop and its always mesmerizing to see. The Ashtray Maze is the best example of that and I wish the game had more of that. 

Overall, it's a fine game. Despite my issues with it, I think most players would enjoy its mysterious atmosphere, gameplay, and the awesome side content.",1685698109,1685698286,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Searching for secrets is rewarding and enjoyable, the fighting feels great and the story is overall still pretty good.
A lot of people seem to think that the launch ability is too good, but honestly i think the issue is that the weapon mod rewards are random. If you have any weapon with useful tier VI weapon mods, it feels more useful than launch by a long shot, but the issue is that you don't get access to those without a bit of grinding, since they're random.
I also find it somewhat random how all of the good bosses are not part of the main storyline. If you were to only play it, you would in fact only encounter one of them, which seems a bit stupid to me. The ending also feels somewhat forced, i almost thought it was [spoiler] another fakeout instead of the real ending [/spoiler]. 
Still overall a great experience, the DLCs are absolutely worth it for the ultimate edition.

The combat more than makes up for the mediocre story though. You have different guns to use and unlocks various superpowers throughout the game like levitation, dash, and telekinesis. The pace is rapid and satisfying.

Combat System:
The weapons simply do too little damage in some cases, which results in shooting at bosses/elite enemies for ages, which is not particularly innovative. In the end, you just fly around a bit, throw objects, and shoot like crazy at the enemies, which becomes dull over time.
The game is also quite challenging, as if they wanted to incorporate a bit of a Souls-like element, except that the combat here is simply not rewarding or truly strategic. There is hardly any feeling of superiority, even though you are technically much stronger than the enemies. In Souls-like games, this balance shifts over time, and strategy and attack patterns often matter more. As a result, you feel like a pro when you finally manage to dodge or parry an attack. The combat system is the game's biggest weakness for me.
Using the ""everything is one-hit"" feature made combat actually a lot of fun, but you can of course turn it off for boss fights. Except for Hartmann, don't do it to yourselves, trust me.

Art Design:
The art design of the game is really nice, breaking away from the standard and featuring epic-looking areas. The effects and animations of anomalies are also very well done. Additionally, the atmospheric lighting often adds a lot to the experience. However, after 20 hours, it can become a bit tiresome due to the lack of variety, especially when faced with concrete walls constantly. But they're still able to show you something new or different from time to time. 

Level Design:
The different areas don't differ significantly, and the level design can be quite convoluted at times. Often, the obvious entrances are blocked, and you end up searching for the right path endlessly. As a result, the running distances become tedious, as you move relatively slowly compared to the size of the game world. The dash ability doesn't make up for it either.

Story:
Dude, I have no idea what the game is trying to say, but I like it? So far, I haven't understood anything, but that's probably on me. The main and side missions are diverse and often offer surprises or interesting stories/characters.
Edit: Ok I played it through but no worries I still dont have a clue what happened.

As a professional gamer, I have had the pleasure of diving into its gripping narrative, dynamic gameplay, and stunning visuals. Control is a game that truly stands out in the industry, delivering a unique and unforgettable adventure that will leave players captivated from start to finish.

Storyline:
Control takes players on a twisted journey through the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) as they assume the role of Jesse Faden, the newly appointed Director. The narrative unfolds with a perfect blend of mystery, supernatural elements, and psychological twists. The storytelling is masterfully executed, keeping players engaged with its deep lore and unexpected plot revelations. The game's atmosphere is superbly eerie, creating a sense of unease that only intensifies as the story progresses. Control's storyline is an immersive rollercoaster ride that will leave you questioning your own perception of reality.

Gameplay:
Control's gameplay mechanics are where the game truly shines. Players are equipped with a shape-shifting weapon, the Service Weapon, and gain a variety of supernatural abilities as they progress. The combat is fast-paced, satisfying, and incredibly dynamic. The ability to telekinetically hurl objects at enemies or create shields to deflect incoming attacks adds a refreshing twist to the traditional third-person shooter genre.

One of the standout features of Control is the inclusion of the ""Bureau's Oldest House,"" a shifting and mysterious environment that serves as the game's setting. The architectural design and attention to detail are breathtaking, with each area feeling distinct and carefully crafted. The game world constantly challenges players with shifting rooms, hidden passages, and mind-bending puzzles. Navigating the Oldest House is an adventure in itself, as players unravel its secrets and explore its intricacies.

Visuals and Sound Design:
Visually, Control is a feast for the eyes. The game boasts stunning graphics, detailed environments, and impressive particle effects that bring the supernatural elements to life. The game's lighting, in particular, is exceptional, adding to the overall atmosphere and immersion. The Oldest House is a mesmerizing blend of brutalist architecture and otherworldly aesthetics, creating a truly unique and unforgettable backdrop.

The sound design in Control deserves special mention. From the hauntingly atmospheric music to the crisp sound effects, every audio element is carefully crafted to enhance the overall experience. The voice acting is top-notch, with strong performances that effectively convey the emotions and complexities of the characters.

Whether you're a fan of action-packed combat or deeply immersive storytelling, Control delivers on all fronts. Remedy Entertainment has once again proven their mastery in creating captivating and thought-provoking games.

Prepare yourselves, fellow gamers, for a review that shall take you on a bewildering journey into the depths of dumbfounded infatuation and unquenchable lust. Control, a hauntingly atmospheric sci-fi masterpiece, beckons us with its sinister allure, enveloping us in a world where intelligence takes a backseat to primal desires.

Let us first delve into the alluring main character, Jesse Faden. Oh, Jesse, the epitome of irresistible allure and unattainable beauty. With her enigmatic gaze and commanding presence, she bewitches the feeble minds of us mere mortals, leaving us drooling in awe. Her every movement, every flicker of emotion, stirs the loins and ignites a burning passion that defies all reason. The writer of this review is unabashedly enamored, hopelessly devoted to Jesse Faden in a manner that transcends the boundaries of sanity.

But let us not be distracted by matters of the heart, for Control presents a sci-fi landscape that is as perplexing as it is captivating. The atmospheric ambiance, with its eerie whispers and unsettling shadows, casts a spell of bewilderment upon the feeble-minded. The intricate web of mystery and intrigue leaves the writer of this review dumbfounded, desperately grasping at straws to comprehend the intricacies of the narrative. But who needs intelligence when desire reigns supreme, right?

The gameplay mechanics of Control, a tapestry of supernatural abilities and mind-bending puzzles, are a playground for the feeble-minded and the lust-driven. The writer of this review, lost in a sea of confusion and carnal longing, fumbles through the game's challenges with a level of ineptitude that is both embarrassing and oddly arousing. The thrill of conquest, both intellectual and sensual, fuels the fire of desire that burns within the writer's loins.

In conclusion, Control is a tantalizing sci-fi adventure that ignites primal desires and leaves the intellect in a state of disarray. Its creepy atmosphere and enigmatic narrative captivate the senses, while the irresistibly alluring Jesse Faden commands the hearts and minds of the dumbstruck masses. Prepare to be dumbfounded, my fellow gamers, as you embark on a journey that tests your intelligence and leaves you yearning for the unattainable.

Finally I figured out that there's an immortality setting, and that made all the difference for me. I could still go through the whole game, but without stressing about dying (for the most part; there are still some ways to die).

Secondly the game has quite a few several issues, the combat is not one of them, although it can get a bit repetitive it is enjoyable for the most part if you max out the telekinesis ability or whatever it is called then all the madness can ensue, you can literally destroy even the stronges of enemies with ease. It can get a bit repeptitive but it looks so damn good, so many effects and neat graphics, its fun. 

However the backtracking is a big nono for me, I hate it in a story based games. Next one is the overabudnacne of reading material, this was so unbearable picking new and new material to spool through over and over again, I just did not care, even though it could expand the story which is in my humble opinion quite convoluted and nonsensical for me. If you think the story of Alan Wake was hard for you to follow, wait for this. Why are there people levitating in the air, why are there enemeis that glow red and can levitate, throw stuff at you and explode on you. God knows why, I haven't managed to get into the grips with the story. I just cannot comprehend it, even though I read throgh the lovely making of Control book/artbook I still do not understand neither of it.

Ok now lets get back to the dlc, the first one, the foundation, was tedious...like really boring , I did not like it, it was like a tacked on experience. But the second one tying Alan Wake universe with Controls was a blast to play through, much more coherent and I kinda understand it a bit. Both of this dlc are couple of hours long so get it if you like a nice alan wake tie in.

Overall I enjoyed it, the graphics, sound, the music , especially the track playing in the maze, it was fantastic, not as good as in Alan Wake, the huge concert with the old dudes but still great guitar riffs. The Combat is somewhat enjoyable, yet can get repetitive quite quickly right from the start and the backtracking is awful, so is the overload of reading material where you literally pick new and new material every minute....

The narrative of Control is a tour de force, expertly weaving elements of supernatural horror, science fiction, and psychological thriller. Every corner of the game is rich with lore, collectibles, and hidden secrets that immerse players in a dark and twisted world. The meticulously crafted atmosphere, enhanced by hauntingly beautiful visuals and a hauntingly atmospheric score, ensures that Control's grip on players' imagination remains unyielding from beginning to end.

Gameplay and Mechanics:
What sets Control apart from its contemporaries is its ingenious gameplay mechanics. Jesse is armed with a shape-shifting weapon called the Service Weapon, which adapts into various forms, including a pistol, shotgun, and more. This dynamic arsenal, coupled with Jesse's ability to harness supernatural powers known as ""The Director's Abilities,"" provides players with an unprecedented level of control over the battlefield.

The combat in Control is a mesmerizing dance of destruction, offering a perfect blend of gunplay and psychic abilities. The frantic battles against otherworldly foes are exhilarating, enhanced by destructible environments and physics-based effects. Every encounter is a strategic puzzle that encourages experimentation, as players unlock new abilities and upgrades, amplifying Jesse's arsenal and augmenting her powers.

Moreover, the Oldest House itself acts as a living, shifting entity, with the architecture and surroundings constantly morphing and transforming. The mind-bending level design keeps players on their toes, creating a sense of disorientation that perfectly mirrors the game's surreal themes.

Characters and Voice Acting:
Control boasts a diverse cast of characters, each with their own compelling stories and motivations. Jesse Faden is a magnetic protagonist, portrayed with remarkable depth by Courtney Hope, whose performance brings the character to life. The supporting cast, including the enigmatic former Director Trench, the resourceful Emily Pope, and the charismatic janitor Ahti, are equally well-written and superbly voiced.

Technical Achievement:
From a technical standpoint, Control is a marvel. The game pushes the boundaries of visual fidelity, with stunning graphics and meticulous attention to detail. The lighting effects, particle physics, and realistic material interactions create an immersive world that feels alive. Whether exploring the vast, concrete corridors of the Oldest House or venturing into the ethereal Astral Plane, the visual presentation is nothing short of breathtaking.

Conclusion:
Control is an exceptional gaming experience that should not be missed by any fan of the action-adventure genre. Its engrossing storyline, innovative gameplay mechanics, and immersive atmosphere combine to deliver an unforgettable journey into the unknown. Remedy Entertainment has crafted a gem that seamlessly blends the boundaries between reality and the supernatural, leaving players in awe of its sheer brilliance. Control is not only a game; it's an artistic achievement that sets a new standard for interactive storytelling.",1684631763,1684631763,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But there are serious problems with the game design that make it simply not-a-very-fun experience. Some of them:

1. Unclear objectives and navigation. It's just too hard to find your way around. You spend way too much time looking for locations that should be straightforward. A breadcrumb system would ""dumb down"" the game but also make it much more enjoyable.
2. Mushy combat. Combat is just not that satisfying, and that's a huge problem for a game in which physics-based combat is a huge attraction. The guns feel wimpy. It's hard to know when you're hitting or not. There's just not enough feedback in general, not enough clarity about what is happening, why, or how much, with the consequence that combat tends to be a matter of trying to find a decent position (that could change suddenly because of a secretly spawned-in enemy), softening up enemies with telekinetic objects, then killing them with a rather wimpy gun. The physics-based control power is very cool but not enough to make fights really satisfying.
3. Strange and unclear level-up mechanism. There are lots of things you can level-up but none of them are very clear or delightful. It took me a long time to discover that I could level up my core abilities from the fast travel menu at checkpoints.
4. Words, words, words. Tons of noise coming in about all the ""assets"" (meaningless), mods (often redundant), and intel (useful? useless?) you pick up as you move about. The Director video segments are incredibly boring to watch/listen to, yet might harbor useful information, I guess? Storyful games often have this problem of making the story too heavy-handed and dull. This one, which does give you the option to ignore or skip much of the story elements--documents and so on--flashes red triangles over sections you haven't read yet. I feel like the game is as nagging as my text/email inboxes.
5. Strange, strange pace. The game starts in medias res, in the middle of things, as you walk in with no prior set-up to the Bureau of Control. Suddenly you're in the middle of things, and although the story unfolds over time the game in general has a terrible monotony about it. Weapons upgrade very slowly. Environments change slightly. New abilities appear. New enemies appear. But it's all kind of the same, as you've come into a game that's already two-thirds of the way through and just winding down.
6. General lack of player-friendliness. To open a loot box (so to speak) you have to hold down the F key. Tapping it would be a little nicer, but whatever. What's worse is that you have to be closer to the box than I ever expect to open it. I will often run up to a box or document and press the F key only to discover that the game wasn't *quite* ready for me to press F yet. Playtesting should have shown the developers that just a *little* wider radius on the interaction circle would have paid off in much less frustration for players. A similar complaint but different: I'm often in a mission and know in essence what I must do: get rid of the slime from the pipe system, for example. But then once the slime is all gone... is it gone? Was that it? Am I done? Is there something else I need to do? In one game you're putting ""trash"" into a furnace (the ""trash"" turns out to be something else, not trash), and when you're all done... nothing. You're done, I guess? The game is just not very clear about a lot of things: what you're doing, where to go, whether an enemy missile is flying toward you, what to do next, what in the mission is left unfinished, how to level up, what weapon mods mean. There is a ""soupy"" quality to the game that most modern games have learned to clean up, to sharpen and make clearer and more satisfying.

It's a beautiful, beautiful game, and not a terrible game by any means. In fact it has so much greatness in it that its failures are all the more frustrating. But frustrating they are, and in the end I just lost interest and stopped playing.",1684603905,1684603905,False,6,0,0.530736207962036133,0,True,False,False

This game is funny, surreal, visually and sonically impressive, and has their most fun gameplay since Max Payne 2. However, it's not a game I desire to replay after finishing all of the main content.

To start off positive, the atmosphere in this game is fantastic. The 70s-era government prison/research facility for supernatural entities that warp reality it is both a wonderfully spooky concept and fully realized. And there is a surprising amount of variety between the areas of the building. It's basically the highest production value SCP game out there at the moment. The weapons and supernatural powers are a blast to use, especially the telekinetic throw which is incredibly destructive.

Destruction is what makes this combat so awesome in general. Your average fight will obliterate office furniture, crumble pillars, and smash through thin walls. It's the kind of destruction I always envisioned games of the future having back in the mid 2000s.

And the sound of everything is so well done too. The guns all have punch to them, the high pitched warp and deep bass hits of the telekinetic powers sounds badass, and of course the soundtrack sets the creepy mood and pounding action perfectly. There's a particular vocal track that plays when the game is firing on all cylinders that I don't wanna spoil, but I just have to bring up because it is one of the best action setpieces Remedy has ever done and one of the best in any game of recent memory. The way the track loops to match your pace as you traverse the area it plays in is just perfect.

However, with the exception of some boss battles and an extremely frustrating timed section that is thankfully optional, this game isn't all that challenging. The telekinetic grab and throw is too powerful and is by far the most useful combat ability. Very rarely did I have to use things like the shield, mind control, or the melee abilities. And when I reached a point where they might've been more useful, the ability upgrade system the game has basically ensured that I committed to abusing the throw.

Speaking of upgrade systems, there's one for weapons that is almost entirely useless. You can add passive bonuses to the weapons you have equipped, but they don't really have a significant impact on your playstyle until you get some of the more powerful ones late in the game. So for 50-60% of the game it's basically useless. Also, I really hate how you can only use two weapon forms at a given time and have to swap out for others in a menu. They really should've all been available at once like Max Payne's arsenal, and instead of upgrades that fill up your inventory with useless junk, should've had an experience system similar to how abilities worked at the very least. But since the game is so easy that this whole weapon loadout and upgrade system can basically be ignored, the complaints I have about it feel insignificant.

My biggest complaint about this game is that the story is pretty forgettable, which is shocking because this has always been Remedy's strength. I could honestly not remember the plot just a week after finishing the game. I remember most of the characters, if not by name at least by their personalities. And to see and hear from actors of the previous Remedy games like James McCaffrey, Mathew Porretta, and Courtney Hope all back for this game was like a nice family reunion. But the plot itself was just not all that interesting to me. The mystery surrounding Jesse's brother and Polaris aren't nearly as interesting to me as the nature of The Board or Trench's death, but the former is the much bigger focus of the game than the latter.

The pacing of the story is also a total mess. I stumbled my way into the endgame without realizing it until about halfway through because the middle acts of the plot dragged on for so long and lost its way with all of the exposition and lore dumps about the supernatural objects Jesse comes across. And while the moment-to-moment arcs of having to regain control over those dangerous objects were cool, they all felt like side missions that were only important because they gave Jesse a new power to use to progress with the exploration instead of having any narrative meaning.

In many ways, Control feels like the opposite of Remedy's previous game, Quantum Break. The gameplay, characters, and atmosphere far outshine the rather uninteresting story this time around. And even though I don't have much incentive to want to replay this game, it was at least worth playing once. Plus, the expansive lore and likable characters provide a lot of opportunity for a good sequel.",1684528713,1684528713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically, it's fun, and the story is good, but the whole experience is held back by a few things that just feel either unfinished, or just cheap and unfair.

First is the unfinished aspects of the UI.  You pick up audio and video logs (of various types).  You can listen to them at any time, great.  But you can NOT listen to them while still playing.  You have to just sit and listen, doing nothing else.  For some of the videos, fine, the video content is also interesting, but for all of the audio logs, and the ""may as well be audio logs"" of the Hotline feature, let us press ""play"" and go.  Lost the better part of an hour to this (at least).  There's a few other UI annoyances, but it's generally good, so this sticks out.  Also a bit of inconsistency with getting in/out of menus with the keyboard.  Just needed a few more passes on PC without a controller.

The biggest thing holding this game back though: insta-deaths.  95% of my deaths were ""full health -> huge hit to 5% health from nowhere -> stiff breeze finishes me off""  WAY too many of these to count.  I didn't feel like I was battling, I felt like I was just ""gotta kill everything in sight, and spin 360 degrees all the time because of the silent one behind me that's just going to outright murder me despite winning against the rest.""  And don't get me started on Hiss Distorted.  I finished the main game ""fairly"", but for the DLC I turned on the in-game ""100% damage reduction"" because I wanted the story, but not the BS.

Also too many plot threads just left hanging.  Didn't feel fully ""resolved"" at the end either, or even a decent path to BEING resolved.  AWE expansion better than The Foundation, and I never even played Alan Wake either.  Probably lots more there story-wise for those that did.

The game peaked at 12-15 hours for me and was mostly downhill for the rest of my playthrough. I only did major content missions, none of the garbage mmo grind quests, eg ""go kill 15 enemies in this area for a random upgrade."" 

Over 300 lore collectibles by the end of the game, which also felt extremely tedious given my roughly 30 hours of actual game time. 1 movie, audio log, or document every 6 minutes just bogged me down. Wish I hadn't watched/listened/read most of them. I don't believe any of the lore collectibles are listenable to while playing the game like in Bioshock, so I stopped over 300 times to read things that honestly didn't give me much value. I gave up looking at them by the end of the game.

As per combat I pretty much only used the base pistol and launch power to deal damage. The starting pistol was well rounded while every other variant had either low damage, accuracy, fire rate, ammo, or self-inflicted splash damage. By the end of the game everything was bullet spongy and many of the enemies were capable of 2-3 shotting me despite upgrading my health and shield abilities.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1683930451,1683930451,True,1,1,0.482155054807662964,0,True,False,False

The gunplay is quite fun, and paced really well. Fights devolve into chaos, but you are the cause of said chaos, not some scripted setpiece. 

Imagine taking some combat ideas from Doom Eternal, where you're in full control of what happens on the battlefield. Mix in some obtuse story telling and world building methods akin to a Dark Souls game. Paint over it all with an X-Files/SCP Foundation setting and you've got Control. The characters are great, and uncovering story bits both revealed just enough to push me to explore more, but left a lot up to mystery.

Some sections overstay their welcome, and I wish fast travel was something you unlocked later... But I think if it didn't have fast travel I would be begging for it. I found myself using only one version of the gun by the end so it might've benefited from 1-2 rounds of balancing.

But the shooting is about what you'd expect from a third person shooter and some of the enviromental storytelling is pretty good. Ultimately though, I started to question whether I was actually enjoying myself while playing it and unfortunately landed on ' not really, I guess.'

Much of the story is told through scattered writings, recordings, and videos that can be dense at times, but they deftly create an eerie X-Files-esque world with plenty of mystery. The visuals are excellent, with great shading that gives the game's many dark areas added depth.

Jesse's telekinetic powers are fun and always useful, and they compliment the sidearm so effectively that you're able to push the offensive almost indefinitely. The decision to use recharge delay rather than ammo depletion was a good call that doesn't trivialize combat at all. 

The game allows you to manipulate and weaponize the environment to a degree that I have not seen done before. Chunks of stone can be torn from any surface and large objects can sometimes be broken into smaller ones still usable as projectiles. The amount of detail is often incredible, with post-battle rooms looking like the aftermath of a tornado. 

All this sustained power comes at the cost of having a very small hp pool, and even after maxing the hp upgrade tree late in the game I personally think Jesse feels a bit too fragile. I was impressed however by the robust set of difficulty tweaks offered in the settings that allow you to boost health or damage values to your preference. 

Recommended strongly to Sci-Fi fans who enjoy games like Half-Life 2 and Prey, and those who enjoy Remedy's narrative style.",1683450417,1683525472,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

There are some quirks however that might deter many players from getting into it or even completing it. 

It is, in my opinion, best played in bite-sized chunks, as in, no more than 1 hour at a time - it gets fatiguing otherwise. 

Voice acting is pretty good, and the somewhat few in numbers soundtrack is also nice. Graphically the game looks good, though raytracing can and does look a bit grainy, and it caused crashes for me on certain levels, or made them invisible (completely black) until I turned it off. 

My main gripes come from forms of jankiness in this game - Camera and movement. Movement sometimes feels off, there are clipping issues such as that you can get stuck on nothing or your bullets/projectiles don't hit the enemy because they collided with something invisible. Camera can be extremely janky also, sometimes while fighting close quarters it would zoom in so much you couldn't see the enemies around you, and other times you would have to fight it to turn around and face the incoming enemies. Also the sound seemed off a few times for me, as in it was hard to determine in which direction the enemies were based off on their sound cues. Another gripe, so to speak, is the mod upgrade part of the game, or, simply put, the pointless RNG - you cannot choose the mod/upgrade you want, only it's main type and ""level"" (and even there some lower rarity mods can be more powerful than higher rarity ones).

All of these gripes can make the combat feel extremely frustrating and unsatisfying. You know what you want  to do, you have the tools to do it, but the game is actively sabotaging you, making it feel extremely unfair for no real reason. Controls would also sometimes feel unresponsive (eg. you cant run after you expend your energy to dodge.), having me die in extremely dumb ways. Also, enemies would sometimes spawn behind you mid battle with no proper sound queues and since there's usually so much going on you can die super easy. 

On the other hand, when it all works well it is pretty satisfying and some of the powers you can acquire are pretty cool, though personally I feel some are useless.

It can also be quite challenging, as some combat encounters are much tougher than others, it even seemed weird to me that some early-game encounters had stronger enemies and more of them compared to some mid-game encounters (both of them following the main-quest), so the game doesn't seem properly balanced, but I didn't really mind. Some enemy types however can be a true challenge to beat, they can turn invisible and insta-attack you when they turn visible, and there can be so much going on the screen with so many similar colors that it becomes extremely difficult to spot them and their tell (a small rainbow-ish shadow).

There are also a few puzzles here and there, nothing too challenging and while at first I thought there would be no hand-holding, it can get quite annoying listening to characters repeat the same ""hint"" like a broken record while you're solving the puzzle. 

So from everything I wrote you might wonder why do I recommend this game? Simply - for the story.

It's the only real driving force of this game, and while the pretty graphics and the decent soundtrack do complement it, without them this game would be a boring jank fest. The story will keep you going 'til the end, but for it to be impactful and meaningful you should take the time to read the documents you pick up and watch the projections/videos you come upon during your playthrough.

There is one really cool level near the end of the main campaign as well, I must say it was really enjoyable - if only there were more such levels. 

Overall, Control has an above-average story with interesting characters, average gameplay and good graphics/soundtrack.

Essentially, you take control of Jesse, whose after her long lost brother. Once upon a time, Jesse and her brother had located a projector which opened door to other realms, this caused Jesse to establish a higher consciousness relationship with an otherwordly entity known as Polaris which can protect and aid her in her journey. Jesse stumbles upon Federal bureau of Control, an ever shifting building which is inter connected to multiple places / planes that houses agency which deals with Altered World events (basically paranormal events.)  Jesse who assumes the role of Director upon entry then is tasked with cleansing the building from an possessive force known as entity that is disruption how the building functions. 

You are tasked to visit multiple departments and sites, not to only followup with an exciting story which is always a strong point for Remedy, but also see the world slowly shift around you. While the game takes place in a single building, you almost never feel like its a building, there are doorways to different planes, undergrounds that are connected to weird places, hallways and rooms that changes and lots of secrets to explore as you make your journey through FBC.

The game follows a metroidvania structure in which Jesse gains different upgradable powers which helps her to backtrack and unlock areas which were previously accessible and grant her more options to win tougher battles. during combats Materials are gained from combat and higher level enemies grant more rare materials / drop affixes which enhances numerous weapon abilities such as extra damage when sighting,  reduce ammo efficiency, reduce recoils and so on. Materials can be used to upgrade weapons and skill points are granted by completing missions which can be used to upgrade your abilities with longer durations, durability and more damage. 

As Jesse gains these new powers the game starts to shape out into different directions and refreshes your with new strategies to avoid game becoming dull and boring. Powers include levitate which drastically changes traversal and combat and allows you to reach areas that you were not able before. There is a shield, telekinesis, and a couple more which are more combat focused. Jesse uses a weapon called ""service"" weapon which can shape into different weapons (sniper, shotgun, rocket launcher, handgun and a auto mini gun) and you are allowed to switch between two instances at a time but can change them at any given time too. 

Enemies are not varied but there is enough variety in them to challenge you through the game. enemies also come with different levels, some shielded and some elite which can be a bit bullet spongy. At times JEsse can get ambushed by lots of annoying exploding enemies from different directions that I often found to be unfair.  that said, the physic and destructibility of environments enhances the experience of combats and makes you feel the impact your have in the areas. 

Game starts in the executive areas which introduces you a game-hub and all the tutorial you need to understand the structure of progressing a mission. as you go through the game, you get allowed to visit Sewer system which isnt my favorite area but also houses some interesting combat section and a couple of exciting side missions and locations. Research centre is probably where the game gets exciting as it has multiple locations dedicated to different studies done on paranormal objects. each department has its own theme / shape / story and you get to do some interesting side quest that also explores the FBC extensively. a notable one is where you get to find the source of mold that is growing in centre. this place also contains one of the best parts of the game ""THE ASHTRAY MAZE"" which is basically an ever burning smoke in an ashtray which has the power to merge the world around into a changing maze. Containment sector is where FBC keeps all the dangerous or studied subjects. you get access to Penepticon, a prison like structure which its cells contain objects of power and also get to explore long sealed sectors which are effected but objects of power that are out of control. 

Side quests are often interesting but some can be a bit daunting if you want to focus on them without progressing the story but few of them actually have great boss fights and well paced combat sections.

one of the problems I  had during the game play was that the game is littered with lots of textual content which opens a lot of lore about each department to you. while interesting, the amount of them scattered around did not make me feel rewarded for each one found. instead I enjoyed back tracking and exploring heights I was not able to previously. Battles are paced well but they can end up becoming repetitive as you stumble to same type of enemies times and times as you specially back track the areas. while I do understand this is necessary to stop the traversal from becoming boring but the variety and rewards are never enough to make up for this repetitive fights. 

Visually the game aesthetics are amazing. use of negative and positive space, lighting that focuses on not only creating a unique white collar working space but also drawing your focus on where it should be paired up with raytraced indirect lighting, shadows and reflections create an often visually stunning game. 

Final Score: 8.5/10
====
Foundation:

Simply the weakest piece of DLC.  foundation explores some interesting ideas lore wise but gameplay wise its very simple and non interesting which I almost wanted it to be over asap. Foundation takes place in the deepest part of FBC where the nail (that protects our world from merging to astral plane) is broken and you are task to fix it before Astral Plane eats our world. While the threat is urgent, its urgency is never felt through a slow progressing story that asks you to take of different challenges in Astral Plane in order to fix the nail. Areas take place in caverns below the FBC and unfortunately due to their nature they do not challenge jesse abilities nor are very intersting to explore. 

Final score: 5/10
=====
AWE:

This DLC is what you need if you want to skip or simply had to rush through foundation. AWE bascially bridges world of Alan Wake to Control and how FBC was involved. AWE sets you up in investigation sector where the ""darkness"" has leaked and infested our swimmer, dr hartman. You also get to read some exciting notes about bright falls and understand what happend to Alan wake after the events of AW1. the dlc also borrows some Horror elements from Alan wake and implements them so good that I was surprised with its exciting nostalgic reminder of AW. The game also introduces a new fun weapon and a couple of new enemies which areat that crazy different to core game but something to shake up the fun generally. 

Final Score: 8/10

+ Combat has the right pieces to be fun but... (see below)
+ DX11 is pretty to look at
+ Starts off great
+ Plenty of collectibles and an interesting setup of loot to collect to make yourself more powerful
+ Overall fun abilities
+ Things go boom and debris flies everywhere

- Horrible load times.
- Starts off great but goes downhill. 
- Story itself is a huge disappointment.
- Dull and boring characters.
- Useless map. Whoever approved this map should be let go. For a game like this, a more DOOM style map is required. You are going to get lost; you are going to be ""in the right area"" but turns out there is a door in some other location leading to a specific part of the area you're in and you cannot reach until you find said door. Very frustrating.
- DX12 runs like absolute shit, but in the reverse direction. Textures don't load in for a LONG time, so you're looking at flat textures until they do, right up until you enter a new area, where it all happens again. Ray tracing looks nice, but at the cost of this?
- Control scheme poorly chosen. Play it on a M/KB. I know, blasphemy for a game like this, but it just works better, and it shouldn't.
- Enemies pop in and out of combat, literally. A nasty bug.
- Gun that can turn into anything but can only hold two forms. Poor design choice.
- Useless gun forms. Basically filler.
- Frustrating and stupid checkpoint/save system. Enjoy running for DAYS back to wherever you died last.

Control manages to make you ask more questions than getting answers. I usually enjoy cryptic games, but this one in particular felt like it was purposefully trying to confuse you, all the time.

With that said, let's get to some of the details.

Graphically speaking, it's really really good. Performance overall is excellent, and while I'd absolutely love to run at much higher resolutions (1440p/4k), apparently running at full screen in pretty much any resolution other than native can cause several issues. Running at DX12 allows for Raytracing and DLSS, which makes the game look much, much better, but does not necessarily change the experience overall. The real highlight for me is the physics. After pretty much every shootout, you'll find many props destroyed either fully or completely, and with the abilities at your disposal, you can also use them to throw them towards enemies, which emphasizes the feeling of chaos in combat.

Speaking of combat, this is a bit more difficult to get into at first, as progression feels.... slow. You'll start by shooting things around, then dashing, then throwing stuff around (and using them to protect yourself) and finally floating. When combined, all of these abilities make combat feel amazing; you'll find yourself floating around enemies, throwing items and enemies, then crashing into them only to finish them off with your guns after that. Essentially, taking CONTROL. (heh, get it?)
That's all fine and dandy, but only when you reach that point. Before that, which happens near the first half of the game, kind of a long time, you are stuck trying to defend yourself, protecting yourself from every angle. NO CONTROL.

The level layout does not help one bit by the way, with the map designed to make you lose yourself faster than you think, checkpoints ""strategically"" placed to make traversal more difficult. Sure, ""the old house is a maze in and of itself"", but when it impacts gameplay, you need to strike a balance, and in that sense, I think they missed their shot.

The story is.... Remedy at its finest. If you've ever played Alan Wake and Quantum Dreams, you'll know what I mean. It's a mix of technical made up mumo jumbo, philosophy and very strange canonical connections mixed with juxtapositions between different concepts. At first it'll probably catch you for its cryptic nature, but when it's about half way through and you still don't yet understand what is happening, or feel this is more of a sequel to a previous game, only to make sense in the end, it feels cheap and unnecessarily complex. I did appreciate the DLC (no spoilers, no worries) and some particular scenes, but other than that, it didn't really manage to keep me up as it probably intended.

So then, is it actually worth it?

This is also a sequel to Alan Wake, and though that gets fleshed out more within the expansion content, even in the base game anyone who knows those games will immediately catch the tie-ins.

I have yet to finish the expansions, but this is my review of the main game as it is:

-Great gameplay ideas. Each power and weapon modification you get seamlessly fits in and just enables more creativity with how you can handle combat and exploration.
-Visually stunning. Even on mid-tier settings this game looks gorgeous in all respects. The destruction physics particularly are satisfying with this level of detail. The visual story-telling is also amazing and the environment design was great from mundane office spaces to mind-bending contorted rooms. The style and presentation are top-tier.
-No complaints on Music, been a fan of Poets of the Fall since Alan Wake and they made a couple bangers here.
-Difficulty spikes, I can appreciate the game has no difficulty select, it denotes vision for how they wanted the game to feel . . . Having said that, some of this is all over the place. While you get crazily more powerful as the game goes on and its satisfying, in some parts even with max-tier mods and gear you can get screwed in seconds by certain enemy configurations, or if you fall off a cliff edge or hole in the floor you didn't notice because you're too busy focusing on enemies who can kill easily if you aren't on the ball. The first boss in particular can kill you in like, 2-3 hits. But having said that, you can camp behind cover to kill him with patience. I'd say its more akin to Hollow Knight in terms of difficulty than Dark Souls (Plus the game is structured like a metroidvania) though. You lose 10% of your ""source"" (souls if we're talking DS terms) every time you die, so its not that brutal, just frustrating at times.
-Navigation is frustrating at times as well. You pass through areas you cannot unlock or access when you first encounter them, but depending on when you get the ability to access them you might forget WHERE that place was, meaning you have to run around all through the same areas again, and makers for quests will be general areas, not specific points (unless its a main quest but even then there may not be). The game does reward exploration though, finding hidden areas can give you skill points.
-Story-wise, its solid most of the way through, and the ending is abrupt, but fitting given the situation (You resolve the problem, but there's still work to be done to stabilize the House, basically). The game does a great job of hooking you in with the mystery of the setting, I couldn't let go when I started playing this. I wanted to see what was behind the next corner. Jesse overall was a good character, though she left me confused at times as to what her priorities were beyond looking for her brother. One of the characters drops out of the main plot entirely after her section and makes no re-appearance (at least in the main game) when she seemed to imply whatever she was doing was critical, but you can beat the main game and not see her again. They also don't firmly give many answers to why things occur in the setting, which does make some sense because not even the Bureau is 100% sure, they go to direct hints at Jungian Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, to extra-dimensional entities which may or may not be Lovecraftian-esque Gods. A few things you can read between the lines on though, and some of the redacted sections of documents you can fill in the blanks (in your head) on what they refer to as you learn more. The awkwardly cut and sometimes awkwardly delivered video footage you find also plays into this, as if subconsciously telling you they don't know for sure what they're doing. SCP fans will also recognise the format for various ""SCP"" documents loosely translated into this setting (No ""class"" types though). Overall I enjoyed it enough, and it made me want to play the whole way through even if some dialogue made me roll my eyes.

The combat feels arbitrarily punishing at times which just feels frustrating. I didn't get the same fun feeling of beating a tough encounter in a game that is meant to be a challenge e.g. Dark Souls or it's variants. Here I was just glad it's over. This game makes itself look like a power fantasy/super power game, but even in the late game, with personal mods and ability points invested into health, some of the basic enemies will still chunk half of your health bar with an unlucky shot.

The writing isn't good, just convoluted. The protagonists one liners are a real eye-roller for me. The ending is terrible, the game just ends on an anticlimax.

Only really leaving this review because of all the positive ones. This game is a 6/10 at best. Don't believe the hype, go play other games.

Visually, the game is impressive. While the anti-aliasing is a bit too aggressive to my liking, it doesn't change the fact that this game is gorgeous and that is greatly helped by the Bureau's architecture.

Music is also pretty good, not my usual style but it fits the game perfectly without falling into cliché hollywood grandiose.

Gameplay is solid. The abilities, while a bit déjà vu, are fun to use and the environment is built to compliment Jesse's moves, mainly Launch.

The story, while a bit too short, manages to not overwhelm with the SCP-like information, which is amazing for someone like me who isn't usually into these things. I'd say the only thing Control lacks is a clear defined villain, The Hiss as a group is fine, but not having a face to identify as ""the enemy"" makes it harder to get invested, because you feel like the Hiss will never be gone. 
Characters sadly don't get much time to shine, except Ahti and Marshall, but even them aren't super fleshed out. But despite that, all these characters have that uncanny look to them, which isn't a dig, it's part of the charm of this game in my opinion. To add to that, some game sections are clear standouts, yes I mean the Ashtray Maze is a clear standout.

The ambience is my biggest takeaway from this game. There's nothing quite like Control, with its long hallways, blocky structures and large open areas. It evokes this feeling of a cold, soulless bureaucracy, but you nonetheless eventually grow fond of it anyway. 

There's one graphic setting that kind of makes my computer lose its mind so I had to disable it, but otherwise the game runs like butter.

The DLCs are nice, adding more game to the game, which is how DLCs should be. The additional abilities manage to be interesting by reusing the previous ones in clever ways.
I liked the second DLC's bossfight(s) because it helped with the main story's lack of a face for the enemy.


Overall a solid game, with great ambience and a lot of weird stuff for those who love that.

The gameplay is just typical action/adventure game stuff. Go here, do thing, go here, do another thing, go here and do another thing. Sometimes you have to go to multiple places to do one thing and it is absolute agony. I think what is also so horrible about the gameplay is all the side quests that show up that I couldn't really give a fuck about. There are these random timed quests that really seem to do nothing at all, and then theres these side quests given to you by characters you come across which you get absolutely nothing for. The only thing you do those quests for is to get gun mods and stuff but in all honesty they don't really feel necessary and just seem to slow the game down for me. Not once did I feel a need to change out my mods to fit my play style. There are upgrade points you can use to upgrade things like your health and your energy, which is fine, but that should have been the extent of the ""leveling up"" that your character does. All this extra shit with the currency and modding is really boring and all in all, is just a waste of time. 

Another really annoying this is that there are no checkpoints in the game, so you go around claiming these control points. Think of them as bonfires in Dark Souls. (that is exactly what they are) Me personally, these control points work really well as fast travel points because the actual explorable world is really huge. The thing that it reminds me of the most however is Jedi Fallen Order, which is another game that I really enjoyed, but I also really hated the checkpoint system in that game with Dark Souls bonfires being disguised as ""Meditation Points."" In this really narrative driven games, it almost kills the enjoyment of the game to be killed in combat and have to replay the last hour just because you didnt find any control points. And before people say ""oh so you're mad its difficult,"" I play the game on the hardest difficulty and it isn't really that hard. I've been playing for about 5 hours so far and I've only died 2 times, and each time I had to replay about half an hour worth of gameplay just because the devs wanted to be darksouls. Its not difficult, it's just extremely annoying. Bad game design IMHO.

The story itself so far is really great. I think the devs should have just went all in on the story and made this like a horror game or something even more narrative driven and drop all the action bits that just slow the story to a halt. I think this world is really cool and kind of reminds me of SCP in a way, but the only thing keeping me from really loving this game is the mundane gameplay. To me all the extra quests and character upgrades just seem to be time wasters, so that people spend more time with the game so they feel as if they got their moneys worth. However I wish they didnt do this because the story on its own is worth the buy, it would have been even better if the gameplay didnt feel like a chore. 

All in all, this is a good game. I think it is kind of a chore as the game starts to drag on and on, however the story is really good and it is worth it just for the story. All in all I give the game a solid 6/10",1682332130,1682332130,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere is very eerie and uncanny at times, and the whole premise of the game feels very interesting — if a bit derivative, considering that the SCP Foundation has been a thing for quite a long time now.

The gunplay does not feel very precise and satisfying, but it still works — considering other things you can do besides shooting the gun, the combat does not become stale. Well, maybe a little bit.

The enemy variety is almost good. There are many types of enemies with different gimmicks, but unfortunately most of them are just regular humanoids/soldiers/etc. There are some more interesting enemy types and bosses out there, but they are quite rare. Considering the whole SCP Foundation premise, they could have gone a little bit more creative with enemy types. Some boss designs are good, but the good ones are mostly optional. There is no prominent and memorable final boss either (the AWE DLC has a decent final boss, but it's not related to the main story).

The exploration felt very hectic at first — especially considering the very confusing map — but it grew on me over time. Once you reach the point where you can freely explore every nook and cranny, the architecture suddenly makes much more sense. Even the map doesn't feel as confusing at this point, and the bizarre arrangement of various environmental elements and map layers adds to the overall charm of the game.

The graphics and the presentation are beautiful, and they still sometimes carry that elusive Max Payne vibe. There are a lot of “fun” physics and beautiful particle effects, and it feels great.

The sound design is subtle and satisfying, and there are a couple of real bangers in there. However, most of the ambient soundtrack was not very memorable.

I felt that the story was not concluded in the most satisfying manner, and unfortunately some loose ends are still left open to interpretation. That is not to say that every question should be answered — indeed, in some stories it is best if certain things are left to the player’s/reader’s imagination, especially if they are borderline surreal or David Lynch-esque in nature.

However, this argument does not apply to the basic narrative structure of the story, which should ideally hold up well regardless of what the backdrop is. In this case, I didn’t feel that the overall story structure and resolution were satisfying, and I did not feel fully connected with the protagonist.

The balance of various gameplay mechanics does not feel very precise. It is possible to abuse some mechanics and completely neglect others. What’s more, it’s one of those games with a half-baked crafting system (because why wouldn't there be one...) , and as such, you are left managing a lot of different crafting materials and trying to make some sense of all the loot you are getting. Most of this loot is useless, so you’ll often need to clear out your inventory while very rarely running into a worthwhile upgrade. The upgrades also quite often devolve into a “this is clearly the best in slot” kind of situation, where you can ignore many tweaks or hidden mechanics that the game offers you. Still, it is not all bad, and overall the crafting/upgrading system feels competent, if unnecessary and somewhat weak.

Overall, a lot of soul was put into this game, and I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end, including the DLCs. Despite the flaws, I was motivated to finish the game and then look for the game's remaining secrets after completing the main story.

However, I can’t help but think that it could have been an absolute masterpiece — and unfortunately, it wasn’t. Perkele! I’ll probably play it again at some point just for the atmosphere alone.",1682235929,1682309057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do you know that weird feeling of power you get when you're in a dream, where you suddenly know how to throw objects with your mind, manipulate the environment, and even fly? How you actually feel like you're pushing against the ground to fly, and how everything feels hard to grasp, but easy to understand? That's what playing Control feels like. 
The whole game has this ""dreamy"" feel to it, as if everyone is experiencing a collective hallucination but you're the only one that's actuall aware of it all.

The game is entirely set on the Oldest House, which serves as headquarters for the FBC, the Federal Bureau of Control. An organization very much inspired by the SCP Foundation, the Bureau is responsible for dealing, containing and understanding paranatural phenomena happening in the USA. The House is an ever-changing enviroment, with walls twisting and turning as the House itself wills it. It is also a very hard place to find, seeing as its location is also changing all the time and it can only be found by specific people that truly want to find it. The House serves as our open world, and the atmosphere it provides is breathtaking. There are different sectors all around it, but not even one of them feels like it belongs. Every place has that uncanny feeling to it and I just love the way it's designed overall.

The story follows Jesse Faden, a woman who has been personally affected by the Bureau, her life having been changed forever when she and a bunch of friends got into contact with beings from another side, putting the entire city of Ordinary, their home, in danger. The whole event is then covered up by the Bureau and she spends years of her life trying to locate them so she can finally get answers and find a missing loved one. As she finally reaches her objective, she sees herself in the middle of a catastrophe that only she can solve. I'm a sucker for female protagonists and this one just hits me different. Jesse is a very fun protagonist to follow, the acting and voicing of Courtney Hope, who has previosuly worked on another Remedy Game, Quantum Break, makes the character all the more interesting and fun to play as.

But the real deal is the gameplay. I've played the entire game twice, already thinking about a third playthrough, and the fun just doesn't end. There's something very addictive about the gameplay that just makes me come back for more. 
The RPG mechanics are very simple and you will not require any grinding to progress, which makes the experience all the more enjoyable. It's hard to put it in words, so the best thing to do is just play it. The game has a feel like no other I've ever played, and it's definetly in my top 10 favorites.

Other than that, the game just looks fucking gorgeous. Remedy has been doing facial mocap for every character since Alan Wake released more than a decade ago and it finally reached its peak with Control. But not just that, the whole world has a feel to it that can only be communicated visually. The twisted, the uncanny, the sometimes ""normal"", it all comes together to deliver an experience that does wonders for the eyes.

Control is a game I love and will always come back to, so I'd definetly recommend anyone that is interested to give it a shot.",1682141754,1682141754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very worth playing if you like singleplayer, narratively-driven action games! Though, it's certainly not perfect, here are some of my biggest grievances with the game:

Repetition:
There is never too much of a reason to vary the way you do combat in Control, all enemies are weak to the same 'break armor with launch, then kill with launch or shoot to death', and the shield is a catch-all defense, so you're approach to combat against different enemies will largely be the same.

Skills Tree:
Unlike the similar game Prey 2017, the skills and abilities you unlock through the skill tree are limited and not particularly exciting. It's still fun, don't get me wrong, but it would have been cool to see more varied powers or maybe branches of different abilities for you to choose. This, alongside enemies that required more varied tactics to defeat, would have been very fun.

Weapon Modifiers:
The weapon modifiers felt somewhat disappointing to me throughout the game, while a small amount of them do change how you use weapons, most of them are simple stat boosts that don't offer much variety or interesting customization or combinations of modifiers.

Movement:
I died more times than I'd like to admit trying to use Levitate to get around, maybe it's just PC, but the way it activates from holding down the spacebar takes some time to get used to and makes it very easy to accidentally fall off of ledges with no way to recover.

Length:
Control is just barely within a price range I find acceptable for it's length, being $40 for around 15-30 hours of gameplay. Not too bad, but I would recommend catching the game on sale.

Has a really strong base game play loop with great environments,sounds and enemies to fight.

The damage scaling and rpg elements make it so you are stronger at the beginning the  you are at the end. So your gonna have to resort to the same tactics over and over again to win. which is a shame because you do have a lot of different tools to use. Its just mos of them are not great.

Story is alright but is let down by a large amount of forgettable characters. Especially the protagonist who is really boring but still insists on having an inner monologue that we can hear despite her having nothing to actually say.

There is occasional moments where everything clicks together and this game is a blast but I still wouldn't recommend to most people.

Most of this game is fun. the combat is amazing. The controls are tight. 

but the EXPLORATION which is the main focus of this game is F****D. The map is Horrible, it doesn't show multiple levels so I wound up going around in circles multiple times trying to figure out a path. The game does say the General area of your mission and the most important rooms will be somewhat easy to find but if its a side mission or side room then good luck. It may sound like a dumb little gripe but the frustration this causes is enough to really bring down the enjoyment of the game. I don't need map icons everywhere but a better map would have seriously made it mush more enjoyable. 

The game it self is good with an interesting but sparse story. You will need to read A LOT to get most of the juicy tidbits of the lore. Most of the time you will only have a general idea of what is going on but its enough to keep you going.

I do recommend this game but be ready for some frustrating bits and some slight confusion in the story but with good fun game play mechanics.

I already played Control for a few hours before purchasing it on a sale, as I promised myself I would. It's not really a title worth playing if you're anything like me, but I'm probably going to finish it this time around just to add it to the collection. I'll not talk about the graphics too much in this review, as I am not the right guy to do so (simply not what I look for first and foremost in a title).

Control is a very novel game, until you realize it isn't. But it will try its darnest to convince you that is really, really is very special! And granted, there are some signs of the game being special. The whole thing plays like a System Shock game as if directed by Hollywood. ""BOARD ROOM"" appears in a Tarantino style font across my screen as I enter a room.

The first thing that got on my nerves playing Control is the never ending amount of cutscenes. The main character is like a socially anxious toddler obsessed with introspection. Every two sentences she utters she interjects her extremely obvious observations or repeating opinions between them. ""Oh hello"", ""HMM THIS IS A PERSON"", ""Nice day is it not?"", ""I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT, TOO MUCH INFORMATION"". It took me about 2 dialogues before I started to feel cramps in the skin on my forehead from all the frowning.

Gameplay opens up comparatively early - which is good. You go about and find some random assets that are ""objects of power"" (it's about as stupid as it sounds honestly). These form the gameplay loop by allowing you to perform some fancy moves like a ground slam, dashing around or throwing random junk lying about the room at your foes. The game recognizes the options the players are granted and incorporates it in an admittedly smart alternating system: your gun depletes a pool of ""ammo"", which regenerates after a while of not using it. Your abilities depletes a pool of ""energy"", which functions similarly. The result is weaving between the two for optimal results - which is quite nice!

This is also where all the positives of the combat system end. Despite being clever on the surface the game doesn't really do anything to facilitate proper use of the underlying mechanics. It is still conflicted about being this whole Hollywood production, and as such the environments and enemies must be thematically coherent above functioning as good mediums to express the gameplay through. The game is also much too slow for its own good, making it feel rather awkward and forced. Enemies slowly march up towards you, wildly spraying their guns at the ceiling or something (because they almost never seem to hit me). In response you provide them with a container to the face, which materialized straight out of your ass as just hitting the ""throw thing"" button grabs the nearest available, before unloading your entire lego-pistol on the next one. All while moving at a slightly-above-average-walking speed. It kind of feels like making an action movie but casting nothing but elderly people in the lead.

The bad however are really plentiful here. The game actually, and very insultingly in my opinion, turns into a ""complete the randomly generated sidequests to unlock new points11!"" somewhere after having properly introduced itself. And on top of already being a poor fit it also does so in the worst possible way. These quests consist of things like ""kill X enemies at Y, by using Z"" - which completely destroys the flow of the game. Instead of optimizing the gameplay loop the player is now forced to go around and kill enemies using 1 specific method, just so they can get their ""upgrade points"". It's awful.

The production quality is quite high, but it's also quite obvious it thinks of itself a bit more than it really delivers in practice. In reality Control is a strikingly average product that seems to have some identity issues on top of a bit of an unfeathered sense of self.

Edit: I think I was a little too harsh on control with my initial review - I would recommend purchasing it on a deep sale rather than not at all.",1681598517,1681651007,False,8,1,0.371747225522994995,0,True,False,False

You play as Jesse Faden, the new director of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) - a US government agency that investigates everything imaginable into the paranatural, located in a hidden, shapeshifting building called the ""Oldest House"". You arrive at the FBC in search of your long separated brother Dylan, who was taken in by the FBC after a paranatural event in your hometown when you were a child.

Upon being anointed director, you acquire the ""Service Weapon"" a.k.a. the gun you use in the game. Combine the multiple forms of this gun (think mini-sniper, shotgun, machine pistol...) with powerful telekinetic abilities to eliminate the threat that has overrun the Oldest House, the ""Hiss"", an (alien?) species who have infected FBC employees and seeped into the fabric of the building.

The game at its core is a 3rd person action adventure game, but the reason I mentioned metroid prime above is because it has a bit of a metroidvania feel as well - since, without spoiling anything, you gain new abilities as you explore the Oldest House, and you sometimes need to backtrack to use these. There is also a (reasonably simple) skill system that lets you invest points into upgrading your character.

For me, the atmosphere of the game was the most enthralling part, just exploring the creepy halls of the Oldest House and soaking the vibe up. Kind of like bioshock as well, the game doesn't really give you the full story by just doing the main quests, you have to explore and find text/audio logs to piece together a more complete picture of the story yourself - which I liked since it felt rewarding to do. The combat is also very fun, as you can get reasonably creative with how you approach enemies and, simply put, you feel like a badass. Voice acting is present with in-game cutscenes, which I personally thought were pretty well done and added to the ambience, even though some of the character animations are a bit stiff.

No sensible way of regenerating health, so many distorted effects on the enemies and surroundings that its more or less impossible to notice cues for dodges or shields, heavy penalties to your resources for dying, respawning at some silly warp point on the other side of the map so you need to run back to the encounter you're at (which is exquisitely dumb as hell in a game that, despite a few ""side quests"" more or less is linear). Ps. The map is also seriously flawed. Like what the hell were they thinking when they made that car wreck :D

Honestly, I'm not super good at games like these, but that's ok. The problem is that this particular game has such dumb penalties for dying that, when i keep dying to a challenge, it really makes it a drag rather than an enticement to get back into it again. I haven't given up yet, i'm gonna try to get my money's worth for this, but the 7 hours I've put into the game so far has for the most part just been filled with frustration over dreary details than immersion in a cool action experience so at this point i just can't recommend it.

Edit: I eventually uninstalled this. The combat quickly turned seriously boring when the mobs difficulty adjusted after a certain threshold and it was ultimately just a waste of time with no sense of reward for pushing through. A bit like Breath of the wild where you eventually just prefer to run away from enemies rather than take the fight because it just creates headache for no reason.

Being as this game is basically a metroidvania, it takes quite a bit of time for it to really pick up. Though the start is a little bit slower than the rest of the game, it is still quite fun. One thing that I thought was exceptional about the experience was how the abilities you unlock throughout this game almost always manage to feel meaningful, other than one or two. 

Combat feels great throughout the whole experience. All of the guns you can unlock serve unique purposes that feel as if they add variety to the game. Additionally, any abilities that deal damage also feel impactful to the combat, and rarely feel underwhelming. In my opinion this is the highlight of the game.

Where I think this game falls short is the story. To prevent spoilers I will simply say that the story often feels vague. Towards the start it feels like you have slightly too little context, which would be fine if the game elaborated on the story in a meaningful way, but throughout most of it, that doesn't really happen. Even pivotal moments in the story often feel unimpactful and bland, including the ending. While the idea of the story is interesting, I don't reccomend playing this if you're looking for story substance.

Overall, I would rate this game a 7.5/10.
9/10 for the combat, which is very flowing but in my opinion not quite perfect,
7/10 for the progression, which is sometimes lacking,
5/10 for the story, which while there, is not incredible.

Hands down one of the best single player actions games of recent times and arguably probably one of the top games of all time.

Not the best. Maybe not top 10 but up there and worth your time.

There is some small amount of hype around this game and I started off disappointed as the game play is not innovative and the story is not unique or new or amazing. In other words don't believe the hype.

However what this game is an amalgamation of some great stuff and packaged up in such a way that elevates it beyond the sum of its parts.

Game Play
Have you played infamous? Then you will certainly be familiar with Jesse's abilities as they are very much like those games. You start off weak with little in the way of weapons and abilities. You will progress at a really satisfying rate and by the end of the game you will be flying, flinging and smashing all over the place as a total badass.

Story
Have you seen The Lost Room?
The X-Files?
Twin Peaks?
Ever read SCP?

Then the story will not be a surprise, However if you are 15 and never heard of any of that this game will probably blow your mind.
What I really like about this game is that it blends all of these inspirations really well and comes out in the end as a loving homage rather than straight rip-off.

It is so refreshing to play a dedicated single player experience which has obviously been made with a lot of love. Not a multiplayer or micro transaction in sight and for that alone this deserves your money. Buy it play it you won't regret it.

Graphics
It is a great looking game. The setting and the verticality of the setting are put to good use. 
There really is only one problem graphically.
Sadly there is some real uncanny valley moments in this game. In some lighting Jesse looks like a monkey headed monster and Popes face triggered my fight or flight response the first time I saw it.
These are minor things however and do not detract from an excellent game.

Music
The sound effects are great. There is a really satisfying crunch when you hit the Hiss with chunks of concrete. And the service revolver has some nice heft in the audio department.
Sadly the music seems totally absent or an afterthought. Just some high tempo blandness when in combat. I do not expect every game to have Neir levels of awesome soundtrack but that is the benchmark and this falls sadly short.

It is not perfect. I have a few gripes.
Bugged RNG achievements. Never base achievements on RNG. The buggy nature was easily fixed with a quick google. Nuffle be praised.
Unskippable intro videos. I seriously don't care what physics engine you used. Let me skip them.
No exit to desktop in the pause menu. I am still having to alt+F4 games in this day and age. At least it does not require the 3 fingered salute.
I only encountered one graphical glitch where my screen went almost totally black.
No quick save and no save anywhere option. What year is it 1995. Come on game devs your awful save point systems really need to go in the bin. I paid for you game. Let me save wherever I like. That would also solve the next issue.
Due to some of the save points boss fights can be a real pain. I nearly uninstalled after the first Tomasi fight after watching that cut scene a couple of times. A quick save solves this. Then there is the train section where you have to spend 5 minutes killing baddies just to get wrecked by the boss to have to do the whole thing again. Difficulty curves should never be increased by having a long time between saves. Some of us have jobs and families and having to replay large sections of games is not really something I enjoy.

The better a game is the more i nit pick things like this. If you get this close to perfection then I think it is worth pointing out why it fell just a little short.

The story is told from point of view of an untrustworthy narrator, which reminds me a little bit of a Gene Wolfe novel. It has elements of Jungian psychology; archetypes, resonance, and subconscious symbols, retold in-game as ""objects of power"" or ""altered objects"".

The gameplay is really smooth, with solid gravity and up/down mechanics for combat and solid level design. It feels good to throw concrete blocks at enemies or to manhandle them with your 'force' powers.

The DLC's add more dimension to the story, though I would have preferred additional things like enemy NPC's and a few more bosses.",1647354056,1681336671,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I feel the gameplay is not interesting enough for a 2nd playthrough but that's fine for me.

Story is interesting but seems unfinished, probably intentionally now that we know a sequel is coming.

The only real pet peeve I have is the lack of incentive to revisit past areas after the main story is done. Mostly due to the fact that Jesse has some extra narration that adds to the story and with the lack of incentive to revisit past areas means that this extra narration can be easily missed.

Otherwise everything else is great! They nailed the supernatural bureau aesthetic, the grey with red colouring is nice and the music in the game are such bangers.",1674358359,1681120191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game teaches you this very quickly while playing -- what I thought was fun became tedious. The same exact puzzle room after room, the exact same treasure chest in the exact same spot with no differentiation in items you receive. 

The same rote breadcrumb storytelling that keeps you running from point A to point B just to feed you another ""worldbuilding"" cutscene that just plays out like a child's rehashing of some science fiction nostalgia bait you'd see on an adult swim snippet. A lot of AAA-games lately do this, shuffle you through the world with 3 combat sequences here, two physics puzzles here, one jumping puzzle here and at the end you get rewarded with some **insert genre** stereotype character with the face of some actor that they spent 40 million dollars to scan in doing a funny little voice or a dance or whatever 'narrative building' action that sends you on to the next guy.

And underneath all of this absolute sloggish content that is completely unworthy of your time exists a genuinely good game. There is a great game here, with an amazing physics and graphics engine that truly makes the world feel alive. The combat is fun and makes your character feel powerful. And yet you have to subject yourself to some of the most boring and uninspired skill systems, boss fights, puzzles and, frankly, some of the writing is pretty poor as well. 

AAA games all suffer from the need to have 80-90% of the game content slashed and reduced down to the core elements that need to be there to function and be enjoyable. Spend your time playing RE4 Remake and skip this uninspired mess. Watch the story on a youtube video. 5.5/10

original review: this is pretty fun if you don't mind the same room palette for 80% of the game.

-Wonderful worldbuilding with consistent tone. Tongue in cheek humor, SCP Foundation-type phenomena, awe & wonder, mystery. All throughout the whole game.
-Power fantasy, *chef's kiss*. Captures the feeling of flight, earthbending, and paranormal agent all in one. My younger self would've gone nuts for this game. My current self goes nuts for this game! The combat is FUN.
-Unique aesthetic. Blends the utterly mundane with the bafflingly weird. Mmm such nice contrast.
-Consistent visual language. Good design, good UX, smooth controls. You learn the game's rules organically and it doesn't trick you. I played again after two years and felt easily reminded of how things work.
-Performance - no bugs, no lag! This game runs great and looks great.
-Nicely balanced blend of fast-paced combat, metroidvania exploration (with fast travel), and simple puzzles to advance the plot. And you can spend more time on your favorite activities as you desire.
-Pretty high replayability. Story worth repeating, repeatable randomized bounty/challenge quests, and in particular the Jukebox and the Arcade missions are super fun to do again and again.

Cons?
-I could see the aesthetic getting repetitive. It IS repetitive in the sense that the world is largely a labyrinth of generic office environments and labs. In my opinion, that makes the sudden gaping abyss, mountainous pile of rubber ducks, or mindbending optical illusion hit even harder. The visually interesting stuff actually stands out because you're not constantly bombarded with it. But I could understand people not liking the look/feel of the world. 
-The colors are usually washed out, think 1999 The Matrix but more gray than green. Low contrast and darkness at times may create some accessibility issues for colorblind & visually impaired. Fortunately, doors are clearly marked with red or green lights.

To be completely fair the core gameplay loop is really average but I didn't give a single fuck about that because the environmental story telling, characters, voice acting, level design and the overall visuals are just spot on. You don't get no grandiose story on a silver platter but the driving force here is exploration and damn they put some serious effort to build this whole thing up.

The Foundation expands the history knowledge, brings new environment, packs up couple of extra gameplay hours and ties up one loose end. Personally I wouldn't give it much praise but that doesn't mean it's bad just not hitting me in right spots, still very solid.

AWE is more of the same some could say (extra department) but damn this thing brings new enemies, new mechanics and opposing to The Foundation it opens a whole new chapter of the Remedy's connected universe.

The gameplay is very mediocre and repetitive. The weapons and abilities are very poorly balanced and aren't meaningfully different from each other. The upgrade system is also extremely boring, it feels like pressing buttons to make numbers go up instead of customizing your character. The controls are janky and aren't as fluid as a real 3rd person action game. I definitely had issues with weird camera angles and getting caught on world geometry.

Pretty fun. Combat can improve a little bit, sometimes it feels too easy to die. Like sometime opponent just 2-hits me, even in late game, when i got all the powers and upgrades. And sometimes when i dodge, i cant see the surrounding, so i get stuck and then i die. did not feel fair sometimes. However there is a setting to adjust the damage, so that is considerate. Other than that, the combat feels quite satisfying. Gun forms are cool, the powers are cool, and overpowered late game. I usually just launch everything onto the enemies. Hide when powers are recovering. Launch again when recovered.

Map system sucks. I look at the map, and i cannot tell which way leads to where i want, because the actual path might need to go through an air vent that is overlapped with some paths. I could not tell. I walk around the room, looking for the entrance to the room, and I couldnt find any. Why? Probably because the entrance is at another floor. And no way to mark the map, I could not remember the places of interests i found earlier.

Control is one of the weirdest and most unique AAA games put out in the last 5 years. It's setting is incredibly original and I found myself awestruck and intensely captivated by The Oldest House and it's surreal mysteries. 

Nowadays due to ballooning budgets and big companies getting more creatively risk averse, you don't get weird AAA games that break the mold or try to do something original as much anymore, so when a good one does come around, I think it's a cause for celebration. Remedy is that rare AAA developer who has stuck to their vision and weren't worried about if everyone was gonna like it or not, and I firmly believe we badly need more of that in the game industry RN. In not just mindlessly chasing trends, Remedy managed to create something incredibly original and exciting! Their inspirations are very different from your average AAA studio. Control took inspiration from The X Files, David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, The SCP Foundation, And Brutalist Architecture, as well as all of Remedy's previous games, and personally THAT IS 100% MY CUP OF TEA!

However, as much as I love this game and the media it was inspired by, I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece. It has some actual big flaws that prevented the experience from being in the camp of masterpiece (which is very frustrating cause at times, IT GETS SO CLOSE TO THAT!) 

I think the story is easily the weakest part of the experience which is unfortunate cause it easily has the most potential. I love the setting and lore and mysteriousness presented in the narrative, but I feel many of the characters just don't click with me much. I wish they did. I did love Ahti The Janitor though! He's fascinating! And the game has a very strong opening, but it's ending just kinda abruptly ends and doesn't feel quite right. I wish Jesse Faden was a more interesting character, cause I didn't find myself caring deeply for her or what her brother was up to. I can't really articulate why, it's just something about them feels a bit milk-toast and disconnected if that makes sense? May have been a deliberate choice, but I am just not sure if that was the right call to make... 

Also there are some bizarre difficulty spikes in combat that feel incredibly frustrating when they do happen. Enemies kind of lack variety or a sense of progression. I am not the biggest fan of the glut of weapon upgrades lying around everywhere in your menus and I hope Control 2 dramatically reduces the amount in the game cause many of them sorta feel pointless. I also am not sure that the dark souls design in terms of enemies respawning works here?? I know the director of the game loves Dark Souls and that's great, I am just not sure if that kinda design feels right for Control. I am hoping Control 2 is a HUGE improvement over Control 1 and helps this franchise reach it's full potential.

 Despite all the negative I said, I still ended up loving this game and what it's trying to be! I think it's refreshingly original and I have immense respect for Remedy as a studio. I wish more game developers were like them in their originality and risk taking! Also my god, the lighting in this game is some of the best I have ever seen. Especially it's implementation of Ray Tracing! The Northlight Engine is a BEAST! Remedy are very talented. 

 I give Control a light 8/10 and think it's honestly criminally underrated.",1680156506,1680163442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Hmm, maybe I should come back to this later?"", something she could easily say. But nah. ""Hmm, how do I get across?"", or even just, nothing.

On top of that, the save point system really sucks, dying somewhere, you gotta run all the way back to where you were before and usually restart the process of what you were doing. Some enemies have ridiculous kill shots and shit that kill you super fast which causes you to go in a loop of running through the levels to get back to where you were again and again.

I dislike many portions of this game.

This gives you a more behind the scenes look at what happened to Alan Wake and the entity that attacked that town. It's a mix of your typical sci-fi government (the FBC, or Federal Bureau of Control) poking around where it shouldn't and releasing horrors upon the Earth, and those horrors are treated in SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect) fashion. I think it works well, I don't mind the added hilarity of some of the more cursed objects like the lawn flamingo or the killer fridge.

This game has more of a goal with the story following it, you kind of uncover what's going on and try to stop it. It takes place entirely inside this mystical government building that's ""alive"" in a way, it moves and changes and the people that work there are just as strange. The Janitor's character is wild, just enough eerie mixed with trustworthy.

Combat can be handled how you choose, you gain powers as you go with enough force to kill or you can just use your gun. I personally tried to use my powers as much as possible and absolutely annihilate the fully destructible environment around me. Some powers you gain will actually let you rip apart bits of the world/building to use as weapons, and it works very well in most scenarios.

Graphically it has the ability to increase your power bill, it makes full use of RTX at the time and without DLSS your GPU will cry. When turned up it looks amazing and to me is the only way to experience this, there are so many scenes that make full use of the engine here. Audio presentation, controls (heh), and almost all other components here worked quite well.

I do have some problems with it though, and some recommendations.

Pros:   The game boasts an exceptional gameplay by offering the player a gun, named ""a service weapon"", with 5 different forms to utilise against the enemies as well as the special powers from telekinesis to levitating which help you in both eliminating the threats and exploring the facilities of Federal Bureau of Control.   Both graphics and physics of the game are on an exceptional level for the time of its release, with Control being one of the first games to utilise an RTX technology. What's more, it isn't as taxing on your pc's performance as you might think it would be, at least, in comparison to most of the AAA titles. Combined, the visually diverse locations and high-quality light implementations allowed Remedy to create a large set of spectacular images.   The main selling point of this game, at least for me, was Remedy's trademark lore and story approach with it being delivered in a variety of types: from sumple notes and documents to radio podcasts and video presentations. This is the sort of game design that motivates the player to explore as much as possible while the subtle visual cues help him to not miss out anything.   In addition, it has some good DLCs with one of them continuing the main plot and the other being, essentially, the teaser to a long awaited Alan Wake.   And on top of the cake, it has two songs from the ""Poets of the Fall"" and the ""Old Gods of Asgard"")   Cons:   It should be noted, that the game also has its weak points. Personally, I found the main plot line, especially so, the brother-sister line really weak. The game fails to create a necessary emotional connection between the protagonist and the player for you to share such a personal goal. Not to mention, [spoiler] the person in question, her brother, isn't mentioned all that much in a positive key, aside from several notes near the end of Control  [/spoiler]. Therefore, the aforementioned rich lore and even some charismatic side characters easily overshadow, what should be, the central point of the game's narrative.   Another downside I would like to mention is the bugged collectible I encountered in the Foundation DLC. Due to the game not having manual save system, I had to reload the main game ending save to complete the DLC once again in order to trigger the last collectible. According to the steam forums, there are several instances when the game bugs the desired collectibles in this particular DLC. Very unfortunate that this issue still persists within the game.   All in all, Control is a great game, which deserves a continuation. I hope that the main quest wiil be improved in the future title and the gameplay pushed even further.8/10",1679807878,1679808025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first, I loved it. Except that I had to switch language because no lip-sync at all. Come on devs, there's cool fully translated audio but you don't know how to properly lip sync ?
But the more I played, the more it was tedious and not fun at all.
I rarely saw a game that failed so much in almost way possible.
The core gameplay is not enjoyable, I never felt that doing headshots to ""zombies"" was effective. Same with superpowers, never fun to use and very effective.
The story is ... bad, do not expect something that want to catch your attention, maybe the dialogues were just bad or the tones used because we don't care at a certain point.
Don't exepct an open world, the map is just a very close building, a little big in visual but you will always feel that it's tiny when you control the character.
The foes are lame as possible, and putting a huge amount of health for everything doesn't help a lot to enjoy this game with previous lame weapons as described.
Apart from that, I have to admit that the visuals are beautiful, but eh, graphisms don't make a game and this is the perfect example.

Let's see:
Graphics: beautiful game, great physics engine, runs smoothly. I have not encountered any crashes, game breaking bugs, stuttering, texture pop-in, nothing. 

Gameplay: The gameplay is quick and tactical, it's a lot of fun. Mostly well balanced. You have access to 6 different weapon mods that completely modify how your service weapon functions, but I've only been using 2 throughout the entire game and only switched it up for one bossfight. The difficulty is just right, as I rarely ever died to regular mobs but came close to dying several times keeping the tension right at the sweetspot. Some bossfights were more difficult until I figured out the right strategy but it never got frustrating. 

Atmosphere and story: This is where the game really shines. I was really into all this paranormal stuff as a kid so the setting of the game feels really nostalgic. It incorporates the familiar with the obscure and the paranormal stuff doesn't hit you on the head with overly pretentious nonsense or clichéd religious bullshit. It's kind of like the Twilight Zone meets Lovecraft meets the X-Files meets Lost? Has a good balance of the mysterious, the mystical, the comedic, the absurd and the wonderful. It's presented in a very engaging way. I don't remember the last game where I was hunting down lore documents this much. And Darling's videos are something special too. 

Characters: Again, just praises. All the characters are awesome. 
The main character Jessie is pretty well rounded. She can be caring, scared, sad, but also tough, determined, persistent and she has a great sense of humor to top it all off. Nothing really groundbreaking of revolutionary but believable and compelling enough that it was easy to empathise with her and have a bond with her and her story. 
The supporting characters are more stereotypical, or rather archetypal from Emily the overeager but good hearted scientist to Arish, the straightforward and easygoing cop to Langston the oddball corporate man and comedic relief. He's not really cracking jokes or anything but his whole attitude and delivery got a couple of good laughs from me.

Most definitely. Why?

Because this game has by far the BEST built-in difficulty / accessibility modifiers I've seen (unlimited health and one-hit-kills are menu options, not cheats!!). It looks awesome. The story is engaging, levels rarely get tedious. The facial modeling and motion cqpture for Jesse are unreal. This is a gorgeous and epic game that is so much friggin fun. Floating around and launching stuff, destroying desks and other scenery, the satisfaction of finding a loot box you missed...

The lore, the mystery, the smashery... it's just worth every penny and I've enjoyed every minute played.

Of course no games are perfect. Here are the negatives:

* Checkpoint saves that you can only trust at the rapid travel points - which are occasionally too far away
* Those gosh darn angry spikey energy balls you can't kill. I don't know what is in the archives in the Containment sector because those darn things chew you to pieces!
* Limited replay value. The DLCs are fun, but once completed, you sort of run out of things to do.

The story's well-written, and I had even more fun the second time I played this, when I was finding more things I'd missed the first time around.

I particularly appreciate the accessibility features on this. I am very much not good at this game, so I used a lot of the official difficulty modifications. The game was still challenging - which says something in a game where you can be unkillable and do one-hit kills - and enjoyable. And I think the user modifications ease some of the game's problems outside pure difficulty of fights. For instance, enemies will respawn when you return to different areas, randomly. While this can be useful for gathering mods and meeting the requirements of achievements, this can get very frustrating when you're dealing with the game's dubiously helpful and simultaneously unhelpful map, and getting lost trying to figure out where you're supposed to be going, and have to do a lot of back-tracking for this or that quest. Being able to get through fights quickly is a boon to gametime, particularly when I was already spending an inordinate amount of time trying to read the map. (The map is honestly relatively accurate for a federal building, but that accuracy breaks immersion when I'm spending more time figuring out directions than playing; what would have been more helpful is perhaps a zoom mode that lets you view sub-areas and passages, and highlights for locations you've discovered but can't access yet because of a lack of abilities you've yet to unlock, similar to what ""Star Wars: Jedi: Fallen Order"" had in its maps, the same year this released). I also think your inventory should be larger/unlimited. It's weird that your archive is unlimited, but probably 1/4 of my time in-game is spent getting rid of mods I don't need to make room for pick-ups that have tiny pick-up distances.

Gameplay-wise, you get a lot of really amazing abilities, and it's kind of sad, judging by the achievements, that more than half the owners of this game on Steam give up before unlocking the best ability in the game. I don't blame people for giving up: it's a hard game, and if they played before the difficulty mods were added, this'd be a beast to manage. It's also a rather large game, and a big time investment, and that's without the DLC. With the DLC, it's even bigger. But it's not overwhelming, either. Probably the least useful ability is the mind control power, but maybe that's more helpful without game assist stuff on. Generally, the computer AI isn't that great, particularly when calling on rangers for help. Your allies are more likely to die rather than help you kill anything and their aim is terrible, though I guess they attract enemy fire away from you, so that might be useful? But I never needed it outside getting the achievement for ranger kills, so it wasn't an issue that it was useless, so much as a challenge when I had to protect rangers in the game.

There are also a couple bugs: the anchor room still has a 90% chance of crashing the game if I don't attack it JUST right, which might not be entirely down to using or not using assist mode. If you restart the game, there's a glitch I've been experiencing where certain rooms don't reset, stopping you from advancing the story around the time you need to use the override/want to collect the rush forward ability. It requires deleting your saves entirely. So... hope you really wanted to restart, because you can't start from the beginning and go very far otherwise.

The soundtrack is really amazing, and I still adore the level that I call ""what if someone made a modern ""Labyrinth"" video game focused on ""Within You""?"" I've also fallen more in love with the Poets of the Fall songs scattered throughout the game, particularly ""My Dark Disquiet"". The cast did an amazing job with acting, as well, and really made the characters more endearing. The callbacks to Alan Wake didn't honestly do anything for me (and I'm pretty sure there were ""Quantum Break"" callbacks in this, but that game was so unremarkable it was completely lost on me), and I was far more interested in the new cast, particularly since I really liked Jesse, Emily, Arish, Marshall, Underhill, and my favorite character, Ahti. He is one of the best characters in any game.

Overall, I had a really good time with this, and I'm looking forward to the sequel.",1657920877,1678826174,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

+ The combat is also very well done, with a suitable amount of screen shake and brilliant sound effects, every his just feels so impactful and satisfying.

Fairly standard stuff for a game of its type but very well done.  Some of the objectives can be a little frustrating as it isnt always clear what it wants you to do. Expect a fair bit of running around the same areas trying to find your way to your objective. 

The graphics are pretty good but I have a really hi powered PC (always have the latest enthusiast gear in my pcs and watercool them) it ran fine but I was surprised that I wasnt seeing far high frames. It also seemed to dip a lot at particular spots.  That doesn't mean it wont run just as well with entry level PCs as I am running very high screen resolution etc but I did wonder about the optimisation.

So it is a relatively straight forward run and gun linear games with some psionic powers.  The powers are really fun to use and they keep the game interesting as does the slow upgrade of your abilities which gives you an objective in itself. 

Too linear for me to say it was a truly great or memorable game for me but well worth buying and a fun game of its type.  If you like these sort of games it is really good.  Of course, it has the obligatory female protagonist which is becoming a bit tedious these days but in this game it fit in and didn't feel like it was just ticking a box.

I just am hoping someday the devs add more content. I have already played through the two dlc's that you can get and they were somewhat shorter than I'd hoped. It's sad to see how this game sits in my steam library all the time. Ofc after this review imma play it cause it's still a great game but I am just hoping one day more content will be added. Maybe a new enemy/resonance that's just as strong or stronger than the hiss. I would personally love to see something like that in the near future and I'm sure many would agree with me on this.

The atmosphere and story seem like they're going somewhere interesting, but I cannot get used to the combat.  I'm struggling to get beyond one of the earlier bosses because of it (specifically [spoiler]Hiss-Corrupted Tommasi[/spoiler].  The combat feels sluggish and unresponsive, like the character both moves too slowly and transitions into a run or a crouch slowly as well.  The combat doesn't feel snappy or smooth.

  This would seem like a minor gripe about a game that is (ostensibly) more focused on the story than the combat, but the combat encounters, from what I've seen so far, are (realistically) a major part of progressing through this game and can seriously arrest forward motion.  They feel too difficult, not in a challenging but a continuously frustrating way.

  Admittedly, I haven't played many Alan-Wake-style games before, so maybe I just don't fully understand this style of combat.  Most of my combat-game experience is with smooth, fast-paced first-person-shooters, like the Half-Life series, Unreal and Unreal Tournament games, Tribes: Ascend, Planetside 2, et cetera.  I can see the vast numbers of positive reviews this game has garnered, so maybe it's just not for me.

Control is a third-person action-adventure game, in which you take on the role of a young woman named Jesse Fayden. On the search for her lost brother, she finds the ominous Federal Bureau of Control, an organisation with the sole task to find, isolate and analyze strange events and paranormal objects.
Control is set in a semi-open world with a metroidvanian structure, i.e. is made up of different areas that can be unlocked at certain points in the game. You explore the enormous, brutalistic architecture of a building that seems to violate the very laws of nature, while fighting off a strange force that brainwashes the heavily armed security staff. The combat focuses on eliminating groups of enemies while taking cover and using your surroundings in order to gain an advantage in battles.

[b] What's good about it... [/b]
First of all – Control is a must for fans of games like Bioshock, Half Life, supernatural/surreal horror as well as science fiction with a tinge of dark humour. It is also THE best reimagination of the SCP-universe, and might in many ways surpass its source material.
But Control is more than that. It is a game made by a passionate development team. Every single detail oozes with creativity, love for the source material, and a general attitude of „heck, let’s just do it!“ Great motion capture technology and voice acting brings the characters to life, the brilliant sound design makes your skin crawl, and the astonishing lightning effects create many beautiful visuals. If you just play games for their visual experience, then Control should definitely be on your list.
As a science fiction enthusiast and a fan of the SCP project, I immediately fell in love with Control. This game is a masterful example in how to interweave themes with story and worldbuilding. The name of the game says it all: Control is about… well control, specifically losing and regaining control. Science has failed in a world where logic ceases to exist, and paranoia spreads as a consequence. Jesse has an alternative view point. She doesn’t have the need to analyse everything, but rather accepts that there are boundaries to her understanding.

[b] ...and what's not so good [/b]
After my 30 hours of playtime, when I leaned back in my chair, rubbing my face and listening to the song while the credits rolled (someone at Remedy clearly is a fan of progressive metal, let me tell you that), I realized something: Control is one of those games that will become an absolute cult classic, and it will be fondly remembered for some of the most mind bending moments in video game history.
It will not be remembered for its combat though.
While being mostly fun, entertaining and at times quite challenging, fighting your primary enemies in Control is interesting at first, becomes repetitive after some time, and will definitely feel tedious at the very end. The mechanics surrounding your supernatural abilities and the stylish „Service Weapon“ – a shapeshifting gun – are intriguing and can be modified with certain collectibles. However, it never feels as deep, rewarding or flashy as in other games. Combat essentially boils down to „shoot, take cover, launch stuff, repeat“. The challenge is less a matter of ability costumization, and more of a knowledge of your surroundings.
And, yes, the bit where Control disappoints the most is its enemy variety. For a world so surreal and twisted like the Oldest House, you surely hope to see more than just rocket launcher wielding soldiers with red eyes. Well, it is what it is.

[b] Bottom line is... [/b]
If you care for the „experience“ aspect in games, for spectacle, story and exploration, then Control might be one of the best titles in recent history. However, do not expect high amounts of replayability. It’s a ride you‘ll probably take only once. But you certainly won’t forget it.",1678295782,1678295782,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

The story overall is pretty good and the characters are likable however much of the gameplay involves backtracking and fast travelling from one place to another.

Gameplay and gunplay are done well and as your abilities grow so does the fun, I just wish you had more than two options for the gun at a time. IMO however the story is by far the best thing about it with a mix of X-Files meets Twilight Zone and a little bit of film noir (not sure what else to really call some of the ""intermission"" segments). It doesn't fail to keep interest, sadly however the story is a bit short without much of the side missions.

Backtracking, backtracking and more backtracking...
This is really the only downside I find to the game. Initial exploration is really good and the locations are done very well. However there is a fair amount of additional content mixed into these locations which require you to traverse some locations multiple times until you find these ""side missions"". A note I shouldn't complain about as reusing locations and content in a game is typically a plus - I just find it tedious at times. On the plus slide of this, it doesn't constantly throw these side missions at you every 5 seconds, most of them you can explore at your leisure.",1678291953,1678291953,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The entire atmosphere is incredibly well implemented and as strange as everything may seem at first glance - the longer you play and immerse yourself in the story, the better you understand everything around you. Many things actually reminded me a lot of the SCP universe.

Nevertheless, it should be clear: Control, even if I would recommend it to everyone, is not a game for everyone. Because apart from the strange story and mood and the initially inconclusive beginning, it makes sense to read through the various files, which you can often find as collectibles. You should listen to every audio recording and every little video to fully understand and immerse yourself in the different aspects of the story. Apart from the fact that this can probably also seem too muddled to some players.

However, I see these strange and confusing aspects as a great strength of Control, because you often wonder how everything is connected and, especially in the beginning, what everything means. This kind of tension can be extremely fascinating and thrilling, if you want to get involved with it.

However, I also see another big advantage in the implementation: No annoying bugs, no unfinished or immature story, but a well-implemented combat system, interesting characters and the feeling that you always have something to do. Something like that, especially for only 30 Euros, has really become a rarity, especially in the last few years.

The Good:  Stunning graphics and gameplay.   I enjoyed the Government/SCP-esque story line.  I've been a keyboard guy my entire gaming existence.  Control moved slowly enough with new abilities that I could get somewhat proficient with a controller.  The mold missions, the Hotel, and the maze were the high points of the game.

The Bad:  Not much variation in textures and settings.  90% of the game is a Mid-Century concrete office building.  All of the baddies have the same paramilitary/SWAT appearance.  Even the ""bosses"" look the same... black, white, grey and red.  No variation.  I truly disliked the save points.  If you were competing against a boss and died (and you will die) you have to repeat all of the steps from the save point to get back to the boss.  That really chapped my arse.  The story starts out great but quickly becomes mid with the monotony of the environment.

Control became a chore to finish... like mowing the lawn or changing the oil on the car.  Instead of the bosses and environments becoming more interesting and challenging, Remedy just throws wave after wave of the same baddies at you.  80% through the game I engaged the in game ""cheat"" options to reduce the damage taken and finally enabled ""one shot kills'.  That was only fun for a bit but it still took a long time to finish.  

Ahti was woefully underutilized... pity that.

The Ugly:  Ran into a glitch where the screen would roll to black out of one corner or the other.  Thought it was part of the game at first, but quitting to the main menu and restarting wouldn't clear it.  Had to quit out to the desktop and restart.  Only happened 3 or 4 times, but all of those incidents were at critical moments.",1678101970,1678101970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There was also the added bonus this game was made by one of my favorite studios Remedy (Max Payne 1 & 2, Alan Wake, etc.) so I was more than eager to finally give this game a proper play-through. 15 hrs later and still going I can say this game really manages to be one of Remedy's best since Alan Wake. 

Tight, responsive controls are the biggest praise I can give it as the main character's movement is very well done being both smooth and very reactive to the player. It's really surprised me how fun this game is just based on the controls alone, very well done. The environments, sound/music, and art style really shine here as the game's only location (The Oldest House) opens up into a Pan's Labyrinth of surreal and bizarre locales that really engage the player with its' supernatural themes. 

Without spoiling much I'll say the game's story right out of the gate is nothing short of interesting. The dialog and writing here won't blow you away (though there is a unique element to dialog involving the player/main character) it will keep you intrigued into just what exactly is happening in this ever evolving and mysterious world Control is set in. 
If you've spent a significant amount time on the web with nothing better to do like me you'll see some similarities with a particular plot point that's used to describe various elements within the game that you've seen on the web before. While at first your brain catches this, you begin to realize they've taken that concept and given it a high profile makeover and they've really made it their own. Seeing how they've taken inspiration from this interesting concept and really went wild with it brings a smile to my face. 
The elements they add really help flesh out the overall lore and world building Remedy set out to create here and with what they've released so far (looking at you Alan Wake AWE DLC) I think Remedy is attempting to set up a far larger, more connected world than I ever expected but deep down have felt like it could be an actual thing since the ending of Alan Wake a decade ago. We must remember, ""it's not a lake- it's an ocean.""

OK, getting too spoilery so we'll wrap it up. Control's story, lore, and world building are executed strongly with some really great controls and engaging environmental design all wrapped up in a spooky, supernatural, and cerebral experience. Definitely worth a play-through if you're a fan of Remedy or looking for a unique take on a third person shooter/action adventure game.",1609692082,1678083991,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Some of the positives, negatives and in-betweens:
+ Fun gameplay
+ Supernatural powers are unique 
+ Nailed the SCP-esque atmosphere
+ Interesting setting (The paranatural events with the brutalist architecture and monotony of a bureaucracy combine to make it a fun place to be).
+ Good characters (Some of them are really interesting and fun and you really get to like them).

-/+ Map system is pretty useless but navigation isnt hard (use the signs in-game to navigate around)
-/+ Missed opportunity with no final boss (Not a huge deal to me but I can understand why people might see that as a missed opportunity- especially since there is an obvious choice to be one).
-/+ Some weapons are useful, others not
-/+ DLC are their own thing. The stories are interesting and flesh out the game and the world, some of the additions are interesting, but not too interesting on their own.

- Missed opportunities with story and characters. (Not to spoil anything but the game sets up a potential moral conflict where the story could get interesting and complex but its glossed over which is a missed opportunity).
- Main character is pretty bland. (Mostly tied with the above point. She's more of a blank slate and they could have done a lot more with her and the story).
- Combat can get tedious 

Id give it an 8/10 overall and cant wait for the next installments!

After you assume the role of director and take on your first few missions your options in combat still feel very limited which made me hesitant about seeing the game through. Having either evade or shield as her first power would have made the initial encounters feel less, well, clumsy but you get them not too far in and combat becomes very enjoyable for the rest of the game. Other than that there are minor problems with target selection when using launch as well as seize which shares a keybind with swap weapon type by default. It is a bit strange to be staring down an object and use launch only for you to grab a random piece of concrete from behind you, again not the biggest of deals but could've been addressed easily. Also I should give fair warning that there is no passive healing whatsoever and the only way to restore it is by picking up orbs dropped from defeated enemies.

The levels are designed more for story purpose and make for poor battlefields as a lot of the time you're just fighting in these bland open spaces.

If you're a fan of Analogue horror; SCP or nostalgic of mood/narrative driven action games of the 7th generation like Half Life, Bioshock or Batman Arkham Asylum I'd recommend it; but at a discount.  

Its art direction is superb, the core lead likeable; the combat is fluid and crunchy and it has some of the best lore documents and logs since the original Bioshock. It's not particularly scary, but the odd Lynchian flair and the political ideas under the surface make it a more interesting play than it initially seems to be a first.  

It's not perfect though. The narrative can pad out story reveals that could’ve been dropped earlier, the game has way too many filler combat sections; devaluing the combat as a whole; side quests feel ultra repetitive and undercut the stakes and map navigation is absolute trash. (All they had to do was add the dead space system of a summonable line), which once again feels like a naked attempt to pad the run time. 

This is absolutely not a bad game; for an AA experience Its one of those rare experiences where Indie ambition and actual publisher money can make something that feels like nothing else on the market; (the type of game I tend to love) but it's a mixed bag at points.

There's so much I could write about: the many layers of the intriguing and deeply disturbing plot, the overflowing creativity and originality of every corner of the game world, the bizarrely beautiful art and sound that often made me feel like I was going insane, the developers' surprising ability to blend a serious narrative-driven experience with genuinely exhilarating (see: fun) gamified elements, or even just the plethora of quality-of-life features that you rarely see in any game, especially a 3D metroidvania.

Seriously, the game is quite spooky but being able to go through the game destroying all before me by yeeting anything and everything around me into my enemies is one of the most enjoyable and hilarious experiences I've had. It brings back memories of Half Life 2's gravity gun, but much funnier. Evil corrupted entity that would strike fear into the hearts of some of the most battle worn soldiers charging you? THWAK, garbage bin. Nightmare creature screaming into your very soul eviscerating the room with a red death beam?  BAM! Table to the face. Zombified mold people stumlbing towards you menacingly? POW, meet my good friend high velocity lamp.
I love this game.
And if that's not enough for you, the other powers and weapons the game has at your disposal for aiding your battles against extradimensional terrors are quite enjoyable as well.

There are some lags and bugs, that really do kill the fun of the flow - other than that - it is fine.

A brutalism inspired, hyper stylized shooter, updated and improved,
but my guess is - they aways leave some bugs in -

like.. the color coding of the map is just horrible, positioning of the area description titles on the bottom of the map instead of a title line is just wrong - missing differenciation of what is a division segment of the building and what is a coressponding subsegment of that very part of the building sucks - its missing on the inhouse navigation boards - these minor improvements would still make you wonder where the hell in this mazy, every shifting place you are - without making it too colorfull- leaving it out completley just adds to the frustration.

The marker on the map does not aim to where the player is looking, even the avatars head is not looking into the direction the arrow is pointing -
camera and looking direction of the avatar should be linked during map mode - like the ""true inner eye"" of Jesse Faden and her very own mind map of the oldest house.

I like and junked this game, but to make it a classic, a RTX remake just is not enough -

There are some changes, that need to be made (mentioned above ones, and more.., working controller config and implementation, more diverse grunts and sighs for the avatar... colorcoding additions to the navigation systems - ingame and menu wise)

loading screen typo should not be white but... character related - 
buzz word should not be red, but... yah.
There should be a fast travel inside the fast travel if you know what i mean.

But after completing the game the are no additional information about he/she. [i] It's like he/she doesn't matter. [/i]

Also after finishing the game and two dlc-s you suddenly realise that there is no point to be [spoiler] the director of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) [/spoiler]. You/Jesse can't even read these [spoiler] classified documents [/spoiler]. Even when you read this review you can have access [spoiler] to hidden text and you are just a gamer/developer/reviewer [/spoiler] but [spoiler] the director of the FBC/first person of the FBC/head of the FBC [/spoiler] don't have access, [i] nonsense [/i]. And [spoiler] the Hiss [/spoiler] are still there. They keep [spoiler] appearing and killing uninfected [/spoiler] personnel. [spoiler] Infected personnel [/spoiler] are still flying and making these annoying hypnotic sounds. You/Jesse can't [spoiler] cure them although IMHO Polaris could help (also Polaris could help your/Jesse's brother who is still in coma) but developers don't care [/spoiler].  You/Jesse can't [spoiler] reopen the Oldest House [/spoiler] so that all personnel can [spoiler] go home to their family's/friends/pets, everybody are locked in the Oldest House [/spoiler]. You/Jesse can't remove [spoiler] mould from the Oldest House [/spoiler]...

So the game [spoiler] has no end and there is no point to be the director because despite all this fantastic abilities you/Jesse can't change anything, any your action has no sense since the very beginning/arrival to the Oldest House till the ''end'' of the game and two dlc-s/100 % achievements. N0\zero control/you CAN'T RULE the bureau/CAN'T play the leading ROLE at all [/spoiler].

And yeah I know about rumors/leaks about [spoiler] Control 2/second part of Control [/spoiler].

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ What?! We have lost contact with a secret government agency, tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of spacetime? Constant shifts of the building with extradimensional beings trying to cross over into our reality? Well, count me in! 
Mulder, I just got a call from New York, gonna investigate the case. Meanwhile, do me a solid and try to stay out of alien conspiracies until I am back.

++ The environments are designed in the brutalist architecture, my favourite style from 1950s; just imagine concrete, glass and wood in rectangular-shaped harmony. 

+ Tired of putting bullets into unidentified subjects moving towards you, promising a slow and horrific death? Fear not, young agent. Just use your psychokinetic powers and crush them with concrete debris, forklifts, or any other items you deem fit for the job (pencils not included).

+ Found a creepy safe; blood occasionally emerges from the seams around the object's door. Test confirmed the blood is not human. X-rays taken of the object indicate that something is trapped inside, though the images are always blurred, which indicates the contents of the object are moving. It also means I am not touching that thing. 

o The janitor with the Finnish accent is the key to it all. Wait a minute. The development studio is from Finland. Coincidence?! I think not!

- I don’t buy into the core motivation of the female protagonist; after almost two decades she would no longer exhibit such drive to continue the search for her brother. Also, have you ever believed in being picked by a gun to become the boss of a secret government agency? Yeah, me neither. 

-- Several agents reported a sudden shift in spacetime on its planned release date. After a brief investigation of the phenomenon it has been classified as the EPIC syndrome. Indications point into the direction of the company Digital Bros, the parent of 505 Games, which we believe has been corrupted by the malignant entity mentioned prior. As already observed in other cases, the reappearance of the game into our reality, the STEAM timeline, took place after exactly one year.

[i] Summary: [/i]

The study and control of paranormal phenomena combined with the responsive combat gameplay create a solid foundation for a good game; the authentic depiction of the architectural style from the 50s provides the right frame for that scenario. 

Recommended for fans of the supernatural and the brutalist architecture.

Right away, the story grabbed my attention and did brilliantly at keeping it.
It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
The Game Mechanics also were brilliant. Forcing me to constantly look at the game and puzzles differently Almost every moment of the game and force me to think.

If you are looking for a Brilliant Story driven game with awesome Game Mechanics. This is for you.

One form work like a pistol the other work like a shotgun etc. Along with the gun you can also collects paranormal object to obtains different kind of supernatural powers like dashing, floating, telekinesis, etc.

You can level up your gun and power to some degree. For example you can upgrade your telekinesis to create a shield from debris then upgrade it more so that while using a shield, you can dash in to the enemy to attack them with the shield.

There's also a mod system. You can equip mod to power up yourself or your guns. You obtain the mod by exploring the world and pick it up from chest or from killing enemies. The mod you get got a random stats. One increase damage when doing a head shot, the other increase damage when your health is low etc. The mode have rarity like common, uncommon, rare etc. I didn't like the mod system much. You just got a lot of random mod with randomized stats and it fill up inventory pretty quickly. There is some unique mod you can get when you finish a certain missions but overall it's feel kinda lackluster.

The map is pretty good. There's a lot of variety. As you progress to the story you will find areas such as an office, a prison to hold paranormal object, cavern, and others. I can't remember any thing much about the music so it's probably average. At least it's not annoying I guess.

The story is pretty good. Pretty cinematic, kinda like watching a TV show. You go to a government agency that deals with paranormal stuff, kinda like the SCP foundations. There is a lot of document you can find and read about all the various strange artifacts collected in the bureau. The story is okay for the most part but the ending is kinda abrupt. In the last battle you just fight through a couple waves of common enemies, reach the villian, doesn't even talk or fight, watch some cutscene and then it's just end.

There's some bug that make certain mission uncompletable. The mission is called Put a Record On. From what I can gether is when you go to a jukebox you supposed to do the mission first then after you finish you can ""start an expedition"" which is kind of like a bonus dungeon where you can fight waves of enemies and do some objective within the time limit along with various buff and debuff. The bug just make you start and expedition right away so you can't do the mission but the mission log is still there. Some people find it in the second playthrough. I found it on the first. You may or may not found it. As far as I know the bug is still there. So beware

I have yet to complete it but I'm working on that as if entranced by some other worldly force! I like to give balanced reviews so here are my pros and cons:

[b] Pros: [/b]
- Really cool protagonist. Strong, female, smart and determines, no nonsense and relatable. She's clearly an imprint character for you to fill her shoes and perceive the world through like a Master Chief or a Geralt of Rivea, so you can make your own decisions without butting up against her personality but she's great fun and great representation.
- Graphically beautiful game all round.
- The 50's-70's aesthetic of the game is wonderful and there are so many posters and documents to uncover. The prop design team clearly had an amazing time.
- The powers and abilities are all not only fun and exciting feeling, but visually impressive AND tied brilliantly into the lore.
- The SCP adjacent themes of the Federal Bureau of Control are both captivating, brilliantly thought through and hilarious at times. I loved getting to tell my wife that the reason I was screaming at the screen was because I had just had my arse handed to me by a possessed juke box or a rubber duck.
- All of the characters you meet are well voiced and very characterful. They really feel like a team of people you want to get to know, helped I'm sure by some great motion capture work that made everyone feel very believable.
- They created a really exciting universe that I so badly want to explore more. I want to spend more time here so I hope that there will be many more games to come. I could see this being an ever expanding set of games like the Batman Arkham series.

[b] Cons: [/b]
- I play on an obnoxiously large screen and there was no support for that sadly, so I had to play at a normal, mortal size in the middle of my screen. I don't know how hard that stuff it to programme into a game but purely for my own selfishness I would have loved some wide screen support.
- Some variety in enemy types would have been nice? For lore reasons that I won't spoil, most of your enemies present themselves as military-ish SWAT team-like foes, and while there are some huge exceptions to this rule...with the weird and wacky worlds of infinite dimensions of possibility at your disposal, it would be great if there was some more variety in the enemies.
- Sometimes (infrequently but enough to make a point of), chasing down (some of the) mysterious artefacts from other dimensions was presented as a life and death matter, but boiled down to moving to 3 or 4 points in a single room and waiting for said artefact to stop teleporting. I feel like maybe this could have been removed or improved. Perhaps we could have had to track down these artefacts by following a series of clues in various research documents? Otherwise it just felt like a fetch and collect quest...but this could have been due to time constraints. They weren't bad but they just seemed unnecessary, so maybe working on this feature in future instalments would improve these segments?

[b] TLDR:  [/b]
This game is great fun and is really well polished. Control presents a really fascinating universe and setting that I can't wait to keep exploring in the sequel and it deserves all of it's many awards and praise. Definitely pick this one up!

Take the original Half Life experience of being inside a colossal, secretive government building invaded by Bad Things From The Outside, then smash it into 1970's aesthetics with a twist of David Lynch. Scatter some Bioshock-style audiologs and mythmaking plus some sidequesting and you have a decent approximation of Control.

There are some things that are hard to get over: the odd rubberface of the character models and the inconsistent quality of the script and acting drag down a well-built and realised world. Some narrative delivery trickles into needless indulgence. Fiddly controls cast itchy interference on what should be a more balletic sense of power. The upgrade system in general has not had enough thought.

The difficulty curve is also inexpertly graded - with regular encounters sometimes far harder than actual bossfights - and towards the end is highly dependent on finding one specific upgrade for one specific weapon. Likewise the style of combat spends ages coaching you to whittle away from distance (because otherwise you will definitely die), only to abruptly lurch forward into almost a brawler-style up-close-n-personal mode with heavy emphasis on one-hit kills. 

Nonetheless, the game itself is worth playing! It is! The core plot devices and world-logic are novel and clever and good and deserves your attention. The main character has her charm. The maps and environments are complex but rewarding to learn, and the game has a good sense of its own secrecy which rewards those inclined to explore; the initial limits you encounter fold away as your power grows. Some set-pieces are just terrific, especially when stepping fully into the most reality-twisting modes, and the combat and weaponry has its moments. 

At its heart, Control is a good central conceit generally well-executed. There is no aspect of the core game (story, combat, navigation, mechanics) that does not have at least one moment of being impressively paid off. It might not stick the landing every time, but for these instances - and just plain being more inventive than your average shooter - Control deserves a look.",1676590870,1676632718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Control's concept is wonderful; explore a dimensional nexus co-opted by the US government to study and contain paranormal phenomena. That fortean setup allows an action game to go anywhere, and the SCP wiki is a free source of inspiration for crazy places and enemies.
Control is visually outstanding, with evocative ray-traced lighting and kinetic firefights that tear its environments to shreds.
Control ironically gives you quite a lot of freedom of movement, letting you sprint, dash and float around The Oldest House and take a three-dimensional approach to its competent over-the-shoulder shootouts.
It's a real shame it's all so tedious.

The enemies are astonishingly uncreative given such an expansive concept. 'Fed soldiers possessed by invasive noise' would have been good for a military wing section, but judging by the first ten hours they make up 99.9% of everything you'll fight. This dullness is compounded by the wearying volume of encounters thrown at you, the increasingly huge enemy health bars and the dominance of the One True Strategy; telekinetically flinging handrails, mops and fire extinguishers at everything you see and popping off the odd headshot from one of the two initial guns.

The main character has no identifiable personality and does nothing to earn any of her power. She just got an invincibility star off-screen and gets chosen by Excalibur to be Allan Dulles 5 minutes after she stumbles into the X-Files looking for her bald brother. Every other character except the janitor could be profitably replaced by vending machines stocked with cans of exposition, as at least then they wouldn't keep making such awful faces. The environmental storytelling is delivered mostly by a Crystal Maze token dome style blizzard of redaction-spackled notes, which you have to grub around for in the menu and it's absolutely never worth bothering because they're all fragments of an SCP wiki from an alternate dimension composed entirely of diazepam and existential ennui.

Control is really popular and has great reviews so maybe this is just me - you'll have to take it with a pinch of salt. All I can say is it's rare for me to get ten hours into a game and give up, but here the agonisingly dull combat and lack of any interesting characters or story to drive me forward combined to kill me off.",1676407291,1676407291,False,19,2,0.479516386985778809,0,True,False,False

I cant compare Control to any other game, its truly a unique title. Immersive gameplay, cool abilities, interesting dialogues, deep lore, impressive implementations of different architecture styles. Sure, awesome physics, thats a well known fact, this game is crazy with its physics engine, it's really fun to control and throw items, different particles, and see how world reacts to these interactions. Reflections look cool, graphics are good, not awesome. It definitely has some horror elements to it, you will feel tension a lot, and thats cool. 
Talking about flaws, notes arent informative, I dont recommend you wasting time on reading in this game. I really wished they told a more completed story, and didnt leave us with tons of questions, because, comparing to dark souls series, you wont be able to even remotely figure something out after the walkthrough. Fights get annoying after like 15 hours of gameplay (if you wont explore every corner of the game, you can complete it in 12 hours max). Quite a subjective matter, but if you dont like dark interiors, this game isnt for you. But thats a feature, the whole world, and its really massive is built in a single big ass building, thats just the style and its logical from story line perspective for environment to be this way.

Story is 11/10 for its quirky weirdness, and the atmosphere befits it. Frankly, the game is worth buying at full price just for the maze sequence.

I really only have two criticisms:

1. The challenge in the game is almost exclusively about overwhelming the player with bullet sink enemies and sheer numbers. Most of the time it doesn't matter and you'll just shred Hiss waves like they're paper mache, but it's really annoying on alerts and expeditions where you can wind up feeling like you're just playing a bullet hell game that wasn't designed to be a bullet hell game.

2. A much bigger issue: the Direct X 12 bug. In the DX12 version, there's a bug where decorative wall textures frequently load in their initial super-low resolution version (which looks like something out of the original 1992 DOOM) and then the engine never replaces it with the full resolution texture. It doesn't seem to happen with the DX11 version, which is fine if you're not running all the ray tracing bells and whistles and can still get high frame rates with DX11, but it's a great looking game so it would be nice if the bug were fixed and the DX12 version made playable.

Other than that, though, spectacular game. One of the few modern games I'm actually really happy I bought. I might buy it again on another platform just to support the developers, because I think they've crafted something that's truly fun and interesting, which is a major accomplishment in this day and age when so many others are pushing toward the most derivative possible skinner boxes and maximal microtransaction ""content"".",1675640379,1675640379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One big problem is that the fighting system has some serious issues that kick in as soon as too much is going on (eg expedition, shüm). One of them is the target locking if you need to grab certain objects from the floor. You grab everything else, but never what you are really aiming for (eg the cubes for expeditions). Also some attacks have a close insta-kill damage that is just unfair. Full health? Forget it, one hit is enough to eat your maxed out lifebar with extra life equipped on it. It doesn't help that the game does give you a merciful 1 lifepoint to avoid an insta-death, the next grace shot is killing you neithertheless before you can get into cover. This is all very annoying. 

Loot fairy is also horrible. Common, I gathered a total of 15 level VI items so far and only one single item was 'ok', but still did not even fit to my actual playstyle. The rest was just total garbage, like getting weapon energy by letting myself hit by a certain enemy type. Really, what is the point of rewarding players with 'high quality trash'? Especially if you do a class 3 expedition run for it, it feels like a total waste of time.

The RNG system seems to be broken also. The occasional level VI item you can get via the board countermeasures is always nearly everytime the same mission for me. Same location, same condition. This is true for many other 'random' generated challenges. You see them over and over again. Ridiculous.

Protect missions are also just stupid and totally luck based without abusing some game mechanics. Your own allies walk like Lemmings right into the arms of any enemy. In fact it look like they want to cuddle them, just to make sure they will get hit with 100% accuracy. Fighting from a tactical position, taking cover, these seem not to be an option for them. And if it wasn't enough of it already, they constantly just stand in my way rather than being of any help.

A lot of bad game design in this game that kills a lot of fun in it.",1675542989,1675636044,False,1,0,0.522218465805053711,0,True,False,False

Surely the graphics-physics are impressive and the combat is fun, but what I appreciate the most is the originality of the world (highly inspired by SCP no doubt) and richness of the content.

Get it on sale if you really think you'll like it (which I'm glad I got it on sale for -70%!), but don't trust the critic reviews. Metacritic User Score of 7.5/10 feels way more accurate with what I felt. The over hype honestly killed some of my enjoyment.
------
It is times like this I wish I had more than a Thumbs Up or a Thumps Down option for this. I'm awkwardly stuck on the fence between of giving this a pass or a fail (and eventually failed it, as explained further on), much like how the game has been functional and playable, but a bit awkward to control. And this is right after playing a few really good game with solid gameplay and/or story. This game is highly rated by critics, but I fail to see how the game is as great as they say it is. I cannot deny that good effort was put into it, and I did enjoy several parts of it, including the final act(s), but several things just mar the experience and it just can't be ignored.

For starters, I like the supernatural secret government SCP-Foundation-like setting, and was excited early on when seeing hints that things aren't normal in the place you are in, via visual story telling and the documents you find. However, I never really felt engaged by it. By the time my initial excitement ran its course the narrative hook came and went and never really caught on, which surprised me given how much detail and work was put into the lore, and I like lore stuff! I most played in a lukewarm mood and hoped it would get better (but that could just be my depressed side being a jerk as usual, making me a hard audience to please). The story is interesting, the characters are memorable, and the ending was nice (and glad the awkward gameplay didn't ruin the flow of it), but it felt like I was just 'there' doing things; and more so than typical in a video game.

The gameplay itself feels like an uncanny object, not unlike the things you encounter in-game. It ticks all the boxes for a game, but ironically feels a little out of place, which isn't a good thing. Several game play choices made me scratch my head in confusion, like how loot drops are random like an MMO (in a single player game), how restrictive the upgrades are, ranged combat feeling a bit frustrating, feeling unsure if you are actually getting stronger, and how annoying and often times unfair the boss fights can be compared to casual random encounters, just to name the big issues. It is not outright bad, the power trip (when it finally shows) is very much there, but it is far cry from the perfect masterpiece the critics imply it is. Some of the gameplay feel like they are from a game a couple decades old, before people learned ways to improve on the format.

I really hate to 'crap' on a game that people think was great by not recommending it, but I just cannot bring myself to recommend it after thinking about it for a long while. Given the flashy trailers and the rave critic reviews, it feels like most people that are into this kind of setting or genera of game would not enjoy it as advertised. I came in with high expectations and was moderately disappointed, and those expectations were intentionally made high by marketing. I checked out what other games Remedy Ent. made, and I was in disbelief that they made the hit game Max Payne! They know what they are doing, but yet it feels like they rested on their laurels in a few (but not all) key aspects when making this. If this was an indie game, I might rate it higher and be more forgiving of mistakes, but when it is marketed as A+ fantastic, and get a B- or C+ run-of-the-mill, I'm going to feel put off.

In short... Huh, you already saw the TL:DR at the top, so no need to repeat.",1675535175,1675535175,False,1,0,0.522218465805053711,0,True,False,False

If that's not your thing, there really isn't enough here for you. Game's good, but not good enough if you don't want weird shit dripped straight into your veins.

The Good: Graphics, story, characters, setting, core gameplay (chucking rocks at people). The gameplay is surprisingly shallow considering you unlock several powers and different weapons along the way. You kinda just fall back on throwing stuff. Still fun, but gets old near the end.

The Mid: UI, music

The Bad: The absolutely horrific loot and upgrade system. It's painfully clear that the game was not designed with it in mind until someone up high said ""every other game has a loot system, we need on too."" The game should have been occasional, meaningful upgrades to weapons and skills. Instead it's constant management of dumb things that give +1% damage. Even worse, the enemies are tuned in such a way that you can't really ignore the system for the entire game. Though I'm sure it would make a good challenge. 

DLC 
The Alan Wake one - unless your a big AW fan, don't bother.
The Foundation - a fairly short slog, worth it if you want more story.

This was a fine game 7/10
I genuinely hope the sequel is a base management / squad tactics game of day-to-day operations in the FBC.

Control is a really enjoyable, story-driven 3rd person shooter experience with emphasis on exploration and creative combat. 

Without spoiling the plot, the setting is a kind of retro-futurism, thriller, sci-fi mystery... The vibe is similar to Arcane Studio's PREY - you're trapped in / exploring a surreal environment (in Prey it was a space station, in Control is ""The Bureau"", a paranormal investigation and containment office located inside an ever-shifting structure known as The Oldest House). Another comparison could be made with System Shock 2. Everything feels dream-like and you never know what plot twist will turn your world upside down. 

Explore, unlock, return. Talk to NPCs, read redacted research notes, listen to audio tapes, watch real live-action presentations on projectors, piece together the plot and expand your arsenal of supernatural powers and versatile weapon loadouts. Fight against a variety of enemies, including epic boss battles. 

RTX and physics are what completes this thoroughly enjoyable system of combat and exploration - countless windows and polished walls offer realistic reflections and readily break and shatter when you shoot them or use telekinesis near them. Bits of walls, railings, office furniture, papers - all sent flying with explosions in the most satisfying way. The telekinesis power (being able to pick up various objects -including enemies- and throw them) is one of the most satisfying mechanics in games, ever. 

Be prepared to do some reading and exploring in between fight scenes, like PREY, it is a game of patience as much as quick reflexes. Although this game is far from straight action, the shooter aspect should not be underestimated - it is still a challenge.",1675157957,1675157957,True,2,0,0.533898293972015381,0,True,False,False

The story, the gameplay, it's just such a fun game to play, and reading the documents you find along the way is a really nice touch that I loved to read . It's like X files meets the Matrix, and the story isn't just confined to the main missions, with quite a lot of really good side missions that expand on the games universe, even pulling Alan Wake in, and continuing that story right where it left off, as well as, (so I hear) Quantum Break, which is now next on my list to play. I'm really excited to see where the Remedy Universe is going with several games linked (Maybe Max Payne is in there somewhere).

This game did all the right things to make me love it. The combat is fast, it's challenging at times and really fun to play. Destructive environments never get tiring and there is so much environment to play with, across a lot of different levels of the Oldest House, where your story is set. I was not expecting the game to be as good as it was, and I'm so glad I played this. It sets up nicely for Alan Wake 2 coming this year, and I can't wait for Control 2. Just don't leave it as long as you did with Alan Wake, please.

I had a couple of crashes but nothing major. This could have been due to laptop overheating, though.
I saw the bug that some others had, where you get a black screen when you start the game, after seeing all the company logos, but only once, and I restarted and it was gone. The game doesn't seem to like overclocked GPU's so any of these issues could have been related to when I had the turbo switch turned on. None of these issues, made me not love the game any less. 

It's a masterpiece of storytelling, weirdness, mystery, adventure and action.

First off for some bias, I don't like games that don't allow for manual saves. I have a life and things come up, I can't be nailed down to a game waiting for a checkpoint for a save. I like to have a little more....CONTROL (ha!) over when I play and for how long. Double that with some very finicky (buggy?) autosaves from the game which don't actually work leading to a very tedious retread over already completed portions. 

I love a good mystery and story. I grew up with the X-Files and related media, so this is right up my alley. Too bad the controls are not great and gameplay can be so tedious I need to rage quit a few times. So much of this game is rinse and repeat: talk, shoot, get into an arena style combat situation with bullet-sponges, gather resources, talk again, repeat. It really puts a wet blanket over everything, and the lack of manual saves put me off further attempts for a while. I really hate the carousel pony item ""quest"". 

Got in a bundle/save situation, so at least I didn't waste too much. Still on the fence about requesting a refund, I do want this to work out. All in all, I think I would enjoy a movie or tv miniseries instead.",1675114261,1675114261,False,7,0,0.519955694675445557,0,True,False,False

The story with his brother goes nowhere, that was literally the reason why Jesse's there but in the end they just say he's in a coma. That's it?

The ability to toggle the camera to be on your left or right is neat and useful for shooting around corners. The weapons in this game all share the same ammo pool, which is a nice touch that makes the game feel more tactical. Stronger attacks/shots use up more of the ammo pool. The weapons and abilities in this game all have their own situational roles, and don't feel excessive like some modern shooters.

A lot of modern-era shooters will have tons of slightly different copies of a basic gun format - like a shotgun. The only differences with shotguns here being magazine size, fire rate, etc, which don't feel too different gameplay-wise. I'd rather have a much smaller-selection of weapons but with significantly different mechanics and tactical roles (think Doom, Quake, UT, Halo, or this game).

- Interesting world and story.  It's like Fringe with a little bit of Stranger Things thrown in.
- Combat is a fun mixture of kinetic powers, levitation, and gun play.  It was definitely one of the selling points for me.

Cons:
- By default, the game is set to the absolute hardest settings..and the developers don't mention this.  The vanilla difficulty feels a lot like Elden Ring or Dark Souls 2.  So, unless you're in for a masochistic experience, I'd recommend dialing back the difficulty a little. I reduced the damage received by about 40% and that made for a game that was still challenging, but not onerous.
- The last expansion, A Dark Place, was underwhelming--not to mention it had some cringe lines and voice acting.  Unless you're a die-hard Alan Wake fan, I'd skip it.

Hold that thought in your head and add in a demonic invasion in the middle of the SCP site

In 3 hours of gameplay, I had to restart the game twice - because doors closed and locked until I completed some part of a mission, but I had already completed that mission. And most recently, the game completely froze and I had to reboot my PC - which should never happen in a modern game.

On top of that, the ingame map is horrible, and the environment design makes navigation incredibly difficult unless you have a great memory and sense of in-game navigation (which many of us casual gamers do not have). The map itself is very inaccurate, it doesn't really show you where pathways are - often depicting a hallway or path when there is a wall instead - and it is horrible at showing the difference in elevation (which is a huge aspect in the game). There are many occasions where I have spent minutes running around just trying to get to a nearby sector, to no avail. And, the guidance to mission locations is often horrible - I've repeatedly resorted to online guides which tell me that a mission is in some unmarked part of the map, or that it's not on the map at all and is instead only accessible by the elevator.

On-map route guides are not a new idea in gaming, nor is it a new idea to simply have a decent map that helps the player to navigate.

The gameplay is fun enough to mostly overshadow the flaws. Once you get Jesse's powers upgraded, you'll be the supernatural deep state girlboss you've always wanted to be.

The flaws:

* the ending is really sudden and leaves a major loose thread (probably saved for Control 2)
  * the pacing in general is kind of weird. Some sections overstay their welcome, some go by in a flash
* it doesn't gain anything from being open world - it just means more running around
* the Foundation DLC is pretty underwhelming. It ties up one of the main plot's loose ends, but it's a lot of busywork missions with very few new lore elements

I showcased that review because I was gobsmacked by how abysmal the game is, particularly given that it received an unbelievable amount of hype. I relished tearing Alan Wake a new one because it was so easy. It's bland all the way through; doesn’t do anywhere [i]near[/i] enough with its (really interesting) plot premise; it’s mechanically a complete snoozefest; and the environmental design’s tediously monotonous. The only credit it deserves is for its atmosphere, which is excellent.

So, understandably, I was a little sceptical when I saw Remedy Entertainment had another exceptionally hyped game on Steam. I liked the look of it, but I took my time and waited for a discount anyway because I wasn't going to be burned again that easily.

Turns out I needn’t have waited; Control is a fantastic game with some nitpicks that don’t tar the larger picture too much.

The first [i]huge[/i] improvement is the gameplay. Alan Wake was so deficient in gameplay it set a low bar to pass, but Control really excels in this area. The satisfying thing about Control’s combat is that you [i]know[/i] when there’s just been a fight in the room. Chunks of concrete lie scattered about the floor; desks are overturned with papers scattered everywhere; mail cannisters flung from the delivery trolley are strewn around; computer monitors and office windows are smashed left, right and centre; glass all over the floor. Combat is actually a straightforward cover-shooter affair, but everything in the environment is so fragile that it all falls into chaos during a firefight. Afterwards you look at all the mess and go “woah.”

You get a small array of weapons that all have their uses, but the real stars are the telekinetic powers you’ll fling around with reckless abandon. You can pick up and throw almost any environmental object, and if there aren’t any then you can just rip out a chunk of the wall/floor. Launching stuff is by far your most powerful ability, and you feel like such an unbelievable badass doing it. Watching the bodies go flying and chaos ensue after you fling stuff about makes for some viscerally satisfying combat. One of my favourite touches to this system is you don’t have to wait for a lifted object to reach your character to throw it at something, you can actually launch it as you begin lifting it in the distance. This leads to moments where an enemy straight ahead of you is clubbed round the side of the head by a rock you’ve flung from the corner of the room behind them, so satisfying!

However, I do have to deduct points from Control for its world design being a blatant rip off of the SCP Foundation community collaborative fiction project. Your character becomes entangled in a secret government agency that exists to track, contain and control paranormal objects and events. Throughout the game you interact with various objects that have had their normality corrupted by paranormal effects that the agency has detailed in dossiers you’ll find around the place. Many of the objects have wacky and fun moments when interacting with them, which makes exploring and following up on the side missions entertaining. However, while I assume the objects and their powers are products of the developers’ original thinking, the base idea is still a wholesale lifting of the SCP Foundation. That said, as rip-offs go, it’s an amazing choice. The SCP Foundation world is an interesting one that I’d like to see more games set in, so Control definitely offers that, even if under a different guise. You pick up world lore through documents, audio and video recordings as you traverse the bureau offices. Just like in Alan Wake, this media is used really well, and I highly recommend taking the time to read and watch everything because I think experiencing the world of Control is a lot better than your character’s actual motivations for being there.

Ignoring that the world-building is lifted from elsewhere, the plot is Control’s only real let-down. It starts off compelling and mysterious, pretending for the first 30 mins or so that it’s a horror game, but rapidly switches into a marginally eerie action game after that. I found that my motivation when playing became about seeing more of the agency and the bizarre objects it handles, rather than the actual mission goals. The limp plot culminates in an equally unfulfilling ending that tries to do something clever, which was fun for five minutes, but there’s no climactic finish before or after that, and a lot of Control’s mysteries are left unanswered.

Furthermore, the character acting is decent in places but nothing spectacular. The main character herself is sadly the most wooden and boring of the whole cast, frequently talking in a bland monotone regardless of the situation, she rarely musters raising her energy level. She’s meant to be the person thrust into leadership, but she never really inspires a commanding vibe even when she’s in the late stages of the game. You could say she’s a reluctant leader, but I don’t think her actions really suggest that she fights her responsibility in any significant way. She occasionally whinges that she’s not really the person for the job, or that she can’t do it, but the wooden acting and her subsequent limp handing out of orders flies in the face of her apparent objections. She also never really seems [i]that[/i] surprised by literally [i]anything[/i] in the agency, despite the otherworldy vibe that the whole agency both has and, by its nature, deals with [b][i]all the time[/i][/b]. Like, she reacts with words that suggest surprise - “woah”, “well that’s something”, etc. - but she manages precisely zero energy as she does so, as if she’s been versed in paranormal activity her whole life.

Back on the positive, one of my big criticisms of Alan Wake was its miserable and lacklustre environmental design. Given that Control is set in government offices and uses an entirely grey colour palette, it’s easy to assume it’s going to fall into the same trap as its predecessor, but it’s actually astounding just how much variety Control manages to achieve in spite of the setting choice. Each sector brings just enough character and variety to distinguish them and offer their own feel.

Overall, I thought Control took a lot of Alan Wake’s weaknesses (lacklustre combat and environmental design) and injected them with the necessary pep they needed. Unfortunately, Remedy Entertainment managed to find another great lore premise and underutilise it from a plot perspective, however the larger world-building is really enjoyable (obvious SCP Foundation copying aside). You’ll get the most from Control if you [i]want[/i] to really immerse yourself in its weird ways, and the combat is jazzy enough to keep you playing between discovering more about the Bureau of Control.",1628069506,1674431436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world they create with this game is a very interesting one. Paranormal entities and an interesting Men-in-Black-style organization that you are trying to understand from the inside through recordings and written missives. I appreciated the challenge and the supernatural powers. It was overall a fun and engaging experience that I would recommend.

That said, I can't say I fully recommend it. I prefer games that reward you for taking the time to increase your character's strength. This game simply increases all enemy strength to go along with yours, and then some. For example, there is a minigame called SHUM where you have to eliminate all of the baddies in a survivor type challenge. I couldn't quite manage it the first time so I thought it would be easier if I came back to it later after I had gotten a few more ability and weapon upgrades. Big mistake. Now it's entirely, frustratingly unbeatable for me because every single enemy does considerably more damage and my own strength hasn't increased nearly as much to match. 

Another criticism is that, as many others have pointed out, the main weapon that you have seems to lack any real meaningful punch or power. I found myself utilizing its most powerful form that is meant to act as a sniper type weapon for normal combat. It was the only form that seemed to really have any real weight. Even the shotgun form at point blank wouldn't one-shot anything. I am sure it was designed to be challenging, but the end result is that is isn't that much fun to use.

Instead of developing any actual interesting or challenging enemies, they but a red halo around them and use red lighting to make them harder to see, so you're just fighting the same rehashed 4-5 enemies for the whole game. 

Items to upgrade your gear can only be dropped from enemies in certain floors of the building. Unfortunately, one of the main ingredients for anything is only found on the only ""safe"" floor of the building, meaning there are only 2 spawning points for enemies, and once you clear them out, they won't respawn until you fast travel away and come back. After 20-some hours I spent 2 hours trying to farm 3 of these upgrade materials and only came away with 1. But if you don't spend your time trying to farm them, by the end of the game you don't do any meaningful damage.

The premise sets up a grand mystery about a secretive government organization, a traumatic past for our protagonist Jesse, an unknown yet dangerous threat called the Hiss, ever growing powers for Jesse, as well as a world filled with powerful objects with extraordinary powers. The graphics and visuals perfectly showcase a massive, sprawling government facility/office from a pre-internet era. Watching entire rooms morph and reshape themselves into outrageous geometric shapes awed me and will awe you too.

Unfortunately, the game fails to do anything good with all of this.

The secretive government organization that regularly confronts objects of unknown power is filled with mundane and generic characters. Nearly all of the NPCs you talk to are devoid of character and personality. So much so that I can't give a single defining trait for any of them beyond talks a lot or is bland. 

The dangerous and mysterious objects of power have the same powers. Moving by themselves, teleporting things, and moving other things. Every single one of them are mundane items like clocks, or rubber ducks with nothing odd or different about them. 

Jesse's powers are little different from those objects of power. She can pick up objects and throw them, pick up debris as a shield, dash around, and force punch people. Eventually she gains one seemingly unique power: flight. Unfortunately, she's not allowed to fly all the time, she's slow while flying, and her enemies get this power too. In fact, they get to fly without limits. So they're better than her at flight.

The Hiss isn't so much a mysterious threat as it is a lazy name for ""The Big Bad."" It has no motivation, there is no explanation of how it works, and almost nothing about its origins. If you renamed The Hiss to ""Bad Stuff"" or ""Evil Energy"" it would have the same meaning. Worse still, the Hiss infected enemies Jesse's fights are just guys with guns and armor, or guys with some of Jesse's powers. The developers did add screaming zombies that explode. Some even fly!

Finally, Jesse's story is incredibly bland and pointless. Our Main Character wants to save her brother, but you learn practically nothing about him. She spends zero time talking about his interests or hobbies, any fond memories she has of him, or what she misses so much about him. In the end, he is nothing more than a plot tool to provide motivation for Jesse. Furthermore, the game barely explains Jesse's traumatic past through emotionless voice overs by herself and a few dry reports by the government. In the end, her brother ends up in a coma and Jesse hasn't even defeated the Hiss.

If you don't care about story, characters, or world building, then maybe you can get some enjoyment out of this. Except you can find better stories with more engaging game play than Control.",1670378619,1674084114,False,7,0,0.57052314281463623,0,True,False,False

It's a good first person game to play with mouse or controller, since a lot of your powers do not require as precise aiming as many FPS games and the controller input implementation is great. It has a beautiful attention to level design with its use of color palette and lighting. There's some corny dialogue and voice acting at parts but most of it holds up pretty well and that works for the conspiratorial fiction vibe. It also mixes in some live action in fun ways. Fighting the various enemies is pretty entertaining too, with a highly destructive world and Jessie's powers unlocked throughout the game.

It runs pretty well on Linux and Proton at this point. I am able to get 50-70 FPS on max settings with ray tracing disabled on an AMD card. It seems to scale pretty well so I think most recent GPUs with Vulkan will run decently with medium settings.

Pros:
-Excellent visuals
-Fantastic level design
-Parakinetic abilities make you feel like a god
-Fridge duty
-Ashtray sequence
-Combat flow is fun

Cons:
-Bland characters and inconsistent tonality weakens the overall story
-Protagonist never shuts up about what to do (yes i know i need to rip out the 4 shiny things, thanks jesse)
-Endless Monologuing
-Tabbing out pauses the game so you need to actually watch the 4 hour elevator rides
-Enemy AI is jank, you can charge headfirst into a group of enemies like its doom and be fine but the moment you round a corner they'll remember how to aim and hit you for 95% of your HP
-Despite having a shit ton of freedom with the setting, enemies are basically just zombies with guns

Doing side missions and finding secrets will be the key to awarding you a large portion of the ability points which is the so ever scarce precious points resource needed to unlock the potential of half of your combat system and the main source of strength beyond weapon and personal mods you will have to sort through ever so often. 

Strongly recommend giving the reading on this game a spin or at least glossing text documents and taking your time to explore and find the files, tapes, and other media the game hands you in breadcrumbs and pieces as understanding the world will make the game much better. 

I played the game technically speaking twice, first time I skipped through most exploration, side stuff and story and by the end I felt heavily under powered and frankly annoyed, I restarted unknowingly I was one mission away of finishing the game, I chose to dump my original save and replay the entire thing and actually take my time exploring the world offered to me, reading and watching the multimedia, and by the end the combat was 10x better and the story was that much more engaging. 

I have mixed feelings on the Darkness DLC, excellent feelings on the foundation one and lots of nitpicks with missions making you feel lost half the time, I strongly recommend you aren't stubborn and look up stuff if isn't clear enough, I didn't and, at times, spent over 40 minutes looking for the one thing missing.

Regardless, I can say without a doubt that this is one of my favorite games I've ever played. It feels like you're playing through a full-length x-files movie. The mystery and the weirdness are something that is very welcome in our modern day of gaming. It reminds me of when I played through Half Life 2 the first time. 

Pros:
- Incredible visuals. It's almost like the environments in this game were designed with ray tracing in mind. The lighting is sick.
- The story, while somewhat predictable at times, is engrossing. I've spend hours reading through the little bits of research and correspondence that you find throughout the game. Bits of humor and craziness are sprinkled into the writing and it feels very authentic. Dr. Darling's presentations/recordings are welcomed pauses in the gameplay and are reminiscent of Bioshock's method of telling the backstory.
- Combat is fluid and entertaining
- The voice acting and writing are superb. 

Cons:
- I found that the layout of the building can be confusing and sometimes not very intuitive. I realize that this is somewhat by design. The bureau is not supposed to be straightforward due to its very nature. However, from a gameplay perspective, this sometimes breaks immersion, as I found myself leaving the map open while running around to make sure I was going the right direction.
- The map could be a little more interactive. I would love if I could filter the map to only show hallways/rooms/corridors on my current floor.
- In some instances, the controls are clunky. For instance, I wish there was a way to keybind the [spoiler] levitate [/spoiler] ability separately from [spoiler] jump [/spoiler]. 
- I wish that natural health regeneration was a passive ability that you could invest points into. Many encounters end up with me activating [spoiler] shield [/spoiler] and running around trying to find the health pickups, which detracts from the otherwise smooth and engaging combat.

I didn't like the expeditions, though, but that's not an important part of the game, thankfully. Some of the facial animations were funny, sometimes Jesse would look like she was cross-eyed, or the characters would look creepy, but this is not important to enjoy the game as well.

On a side note, sometimes I still go to that music room just to listen to ""My Dark Disquiet"". Poets of the Fall performed this music live when I saw them live in Lisbon, it was amazing.

At first, I did not like Control. I’m the kind of gamer who stays away from anything remotely horror-adjacent because I’m a whimp. The scariest games I’ve ever played were probably Metro 2033 and the original Bioshock, to give you an idea of my scale.

So, why did I even try Control? Because I’m a huge SCP fan, and I kept hearing that Control was “SCP: The Unofficial Video Game.” So I hesitantly downloaded the game and tried to give it a fair shot.

At first, I did not like Control, but I soon learned to love it. It certainly had its flaws, but I found the game hard to put down, and hard to stop thinking about in my spare time. I’m sure the game will live in my brain rent-free for a very long time.

The game is definitely SCP: The Unofficial Video Game, and it does its job well, which is the game’s greatest positive for me. The story, the environments, the ambiance, and the collectibles all weave a paranatural world of both curiosities and terrors, and it’s yours to explore. I could not have asked for more. 

I also started playing the game because I had been itching to play a decent shooter, and, while it didn’t disappoint there, it also didn’t deliver exactly what I expected, as someone who has almost a thousand hours of CSGO in my backlog. The gunplay is fun, but it’s not the highlight of combat, and I never felt like my FPS skills tipped the outcome of an encounter in my favor. The combat in Control relies more on your paranatural powers than your ability to click on enemies’ heads, and it was a lot of fun.

However, Control isn’t without flaws. The game had occasional performance issues for me before I tweaked the settings to perfection, which most people won’t do. Some enemies were overly frustrating because they either had no obvious way to reliably damage them, they output huge bursts of damage that you’re not prepared for, or a little of both. The timed missions were a flavor win, but a huge fail in execution, and I did two or three before deciding they weren’t worth my time. All of the firearms have an accuracy range regardless of your motion, so I could have my cursor right on an enemy’s head and still miss, which was frustrating to me.

While not perfect, Control is a game that I would recommend without hesitation. I had a ton of fun with it, and I can’t wait to continue finishing all the side quests and exploring the DLC.",1673577002,1673577002,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also I feel like the things showcased in the promos for this game feel much buried in later missions rather than introducing them to you right off the bat for more enhanced strategy. Also I was a little unintrigued by the guns and mods in this game. The mods are so plentiful its a hassle, and switching guns feels so annoying too. Having to open up your arsenal frequently gets annoying, switching guns isn't as simple as max payne/alan wake because you can only have 2 weapons at most ready by default, and the mouse wheel cannot be used as a switching button for an odd reason. Also there are so many things to upgrade and switch that it feels like you always have to switch something before you fight otherwise you have to rely on abilities because who wants to sit through a minute or two deciding which mods do what, what you will equip for yourself, as well as what you're going to upgrade. Running and gunning just gets you killed most of the time, so that same gunplay style from remedy shooters previously is gone, which is bad since it seems like the abilities seem much stronger than the guns themselves, making them pretty much for show. Also free exploration of areas is absent, because the Hiss clusters will prevent you from exploring freely and will hold you back, as well as clearance doors. This game also has random side missions that activate randomly and are timed, and if you don't make it you have to hope it shows up again. Also there are WAY too many collectibles obviously, way more than even Alan Wake had, as you have to collect 250 pages of notes, personal and weapon mods, radios, and tv shows, and more. I honestly felt these slowed down the game and strayed me from the action that this game is known for, and it felt really repetitive having to search for collectibles around and around both free exploration AND battles. I also feel like the game is too drag-on. I get it that they don't expect you to beat their game in a day, but there is just too much to keep track of in this game, on top of the long story content. I really think a good chunk of the content here isn't needed and I think for this type of gameplay that the game has so much content it becomes too much of a good thing. I still would like to discover the story and I think that is the reason for me to finish it if anything, but is it a game that i'll return to once i've completed it? No. Because it's just too much to handle, and it deviates from what other remedy shooters made players feel in the game, such as suspense and intrigue.",1673506967,1673506967,False,1,0,0.500480294227600098,0,True,False,False

In combination with a somewhat interesting but very mysterious story. Worth a playthrough on anything but it is one of the best implementations of raytracing I have seen. Worth a buy at its usual $10 sale price.

The style is not like much I have ever seen and it pulls off a great mysterious atmosphere that kept me hooked and playing. Control manages to have a great art direction, high fidelity and a refreshing visual style that is further enhanced with great ray tracing and post processing. With a 3060 I would able to push the game to max and have just about 60 fps all around with dips in combats and increases in breaks of action. 
It leaves a lot of questions unanswered while also giving great bread crumbs with lore collectibles which is just enough to be engaging but not teasing. The great Foundation DLC also does a great job of fleshing out but not fully some elements of the main game in a fantastic way. 

Only thing I did not like is sometimes enemies would respawn just way too quick, I would leave the room and they would be back if i turned around and some side missions just really do not feel worth doing. There were some enemies that killed me incredibly quick at times that I could not see but nothing that made me want to put the game down in a rage. Also I was not a fan of the Alan Wake DLC because I personally do not like Alan Wake but fighting the invincible monster with light was a fun puzzle.

The game's setting, the Federal Bureau of Control, is a secretive government organization that deals with supernatural phenomena. Players take on the role of Jesse Faden, the bureau's new Director, as she explores the mysterious Oldest House and battles otherworldly enemies known as the Hiss.

One of the most striking aspects of the game is its exploration of the concept of power and control. The game's story is filled with themes of identity, agency, and determinism, which are woven into the fabric of the game's world-building, characters and gameplay mechanics. The game's setting, the Oldest House, is a constantly shifting skyscraper that defies the laws of physics, and serves as a metaphor for the nature of reality, hinting at the idea that things are not always as they seem.

The game's characters are also well-written and well-acted, and players will find themselves invested in Jesse's quest to uncover the truth behind the FBC and her own backstory. Through dialogue, cutscenes and supernatural abilities, players will experience Jesse's internal struggles, inner turmoil, and the weight of responsibility in her new role as Director.

The gameplay of Control is a mix of action, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The game's combat system is fluid and satisfying, with players able to use Jesse's supernatural abilities to take on enemies in fast-paced and dynamic battles. The game also features a variety of side-quests and puzzles to complete, which add to the game's replayability. However, the game's mechanics are not only there to entertain but also to give a sense of discovery, as the player will stumble upon hidden rooms, secret documents and supernatural objects that will shed a light on the FBC's history, the nature of the Hiss, and other unexplained phenomena in the game.

The game's graphics and sound design are top-notch, creating an immersive and atmospheric experience. The game's visuals are stunning and detailed, with the Oldest House being a highlight. The game's soundtrack is also noteworthy, adding to the game's eerie and otherworldly tone.

Overall, Control is an excellent game that offers a unique and captivating world, a well-written story, and satisfying gameplay. The game's themes of power, control, and reality add depth and meaning to the experience, making it a must-play for fans of action-adventure games and anyone interested in exploring the limits of interactive storytelling. It's a game that has a lot of secrets to uncover, and players will find themselves hooked on unraveling the mysteries that it holds.

[u]The Positives[/u]
+ A third-person, action orientated adventure full of personality.
+ Combat is fast-paced and thrilling, the use of Jesse’s psychokinetic powers especially satisfying after unlocking them—levitate and use the environment to hurl projectiles.
+  The Oldest House, being an office building, isn’t the most attractive setting to explore, but there’s much to be confused and amused by.
+ Unique boss encounters that make side quests worth completing.
+ Even though it’s a linear experience, there’s still a lot to do in the form of side content, mission alerts and expeditions.
+ Quality voice acting, which is always appreciated.
+ Excellent expansions: The Foundation and AWE.

The fact that it is connected to another amazing Remedy tittle only makes it better for my. Story and world are A+ for me.
Gameplay wise you have a fair selection of guns, extended with some fun editions if you have the DLCs. Additional weapon and personal mods give a nice depth, complexity and personalization.
The powers you gain add even more ways for you to make the character your own and play the game as you would like.
Visuals are breathtaking especially if you can max them out and add raytracing.

I actually had a ton of fun with this game and binged 20 hours of it in just a few days. But for a game that was so lengthy and for a playthrough that was so thoroughly explored, it felt like the (main) game ended way too quickly. Even after reading all the notes and listening to all the audio logs, it didn't feel like a complete narrative. The ending sort of rushes up out of nowhere and there's no satisfaction to it. Tons of questions raised and not many of them even vaguely answered. Even the enemies leading up to the end were uninteresting and lacked any challenge. Weirdly, the maze section about an hour or two before the ending was a way better action sequence than the actual climax.

Not to mention, for all the ""weirdness"" that is built up throughout the game, things don't get all that weird for the most part. They even set up this idea that the building you're exploring regularly shifts unexpectedly, but it rarely ever happens. There definitely could've been a lot more ""what the fuck"" moments for this sort of setting.

The gameplay itself was a lot of fun and easily the best Remedy has made so far. You feel like an overpowered god zooming around with all your powers. Maybe a little too godly though. I don't know how good the other upgrades are, but Launch seemed ridiculous. Able to flatten bosses in no time at all. But even if it wasn't challenging, it was a lot of fun. One thing I wish was changed was allowing the [spoiler]levitate ability to activate after dropping from a ledge[/spoiler]. With the camera angle, most of my deaths were caused by slipping off ledges than the actual enemies.

I'm probably being too harsh, but that's mostly because I had massive expectations considering this game has been hyped up by so many. It's definitely an awesome game and well worth playing. The humor is dark and hilarious. The detail with the live action scenes and the puppet show are amazing. The notes and audio logs help to create this weird and wonderful atmosphere that blends creepy, supernatural mysteries with the relatable mundaneness of a workplace. Some of the attention to detail blows my mind. I love seeing the utter destruction as concrete gets torn from pillars and walls. And on the flip side, a projector I knocked over continued to play its projection wherever I carried it to. It seems small, but I was in awe. Reminded me of how amazed I was with the cloth physics back in the early Splinter Cell games. They put a lot of love into this world and it's a very fun world to get lost in for a while.

If you like New Weird, horror/thriller surrealism (think Annihilation with Natalie Portman) like I do, you will adore this game.

Weapons feel impactful and responsive, upgrade decisions are meaningful tradeoffs, and you can tangibly feel your character becoming more powerful as the story progresses, without the game getting significantly easier. Speaking of which, it is actually quite difficult at times -- enemies hit hard, some of them very hard, and health pickups don't have a huge grab range. This means that you have to balance playing aggressively and healing with taking cover and waiting for your abilities to cool down or for an enemy to move into position for a telekinetic lineup.

There's so much that is incredible about this game that I can't fit it all in one steam review -- but I strongly encourage anyone reading this to try it. The game can be a bit freaky at times though, no jumpscares but an extremely creepy atmosphere. There is also a more horror-movie themed DLC called AWE that gets a bit more intense.

Go in blind and enjoy the story. When you get to the Ashtray Maze, prepare for a dope-ass fight/exploration sequence like you've never seen before. And remember:

You are a worm through time.

The thunder song distorts you.

Happiness comes.

White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye.

So having just finished the game with a pretty fair amount of side content finished, it is very worth while playing. Not mind blowing, but certainly fascinating. Between the increasingly bizarre setting and extremely brutalist architecture I found myself wedged in a setting clearly inspired by Doctor Who and SCP Foundation. With many direct winks at both these properties and other things. Much like one of Remedy's other titles, Alan Wake, you've also the strange bits of collectibles and the notable television shows to watch. Though Control falls into the deep end of the bizarre and strange. A surreal world with one foot in reality and the other in some far off ethereal realm with horrors that go well beyond comprehension.

As for how the game looks, when it comes to pure detail, it looks wonderful. Debris come flying in lovingly crafted detail when explosions and impacts slam against objects, walls, and other items. Though things to get a bit samey here and there, as traversing the semi-open world has many similar hallways and areas. Though I do feel this is an artistic choice, a brutal contrast between the seemingly fantastical within the authoritarian walls of the Federal Bureau of Control. And boy does this game absolutely love it's black on red contrast. Some areas bathed in darkness with the lighting system really giving strange depth to many areas with heavy contrasted lighting. And it looks great. But can and in some cases will leave you feeling lost as you proceed through the increasingly labyrinthine maze of the world.

As for combat, it's smooth but has a couple major flaws. When it comes right down to it, you can spend most of the game tossing various objects in the environment at enemies and barely use your weapons. And while combat attempts to promote juggling your ways to go through combat, the sheer simplicity of ""throw desk/lamp/chunk of rock at enemy"" becomes the standard. Is that bad? Not necessarily. But in spite of that, I do think it's pretty damn cool.

Story isn't bad, but feels stretched thin. The ending (I'd say more but don't wish to spoil anything) is extremely abrupt. Even with a certain thing (if you know, you know) that happens, it feels very sudden. However, I'd say that one of the expansions feels more like a epilogue if played after the campaign and so far (haven't finished the expansions  yet) feel good and like something of a continuation.

Not sure what else to say. Game ran incredibly well for how old my PC is (I'll put PC specs at the end) and only had a few dips. For newer PC's (2018/19 or newer) should have absolutely no issue running this game. And for just how great it looks, I'd say that's surprising. Remedy or whoever did this PC port did an outstanding job.

So yeah. 7/10. Good game, not mindblowing, but well put together with a few flaws. But I'd still say it's a gem and gets a lot of points from me for having an extremely well put together and incredibly unsettling atmosphere.

Middle Ground: Story is ok, cutscenes can be long-ish

Cons: too much repetitive live video capture. We get it, smoking man is smoking.

Overall, so far I am happy with the purchase and expect to get at least one full playthrough out of it, and hopefully I see opportunity for replay. TBD, this isn't a real RPG in terms of choice/consequence that I have experienced yet, although I have a timer mission all of a sudden... Maybe I'm wrong, we'll see. Either way, interested in finding out.

ETA: After finishing the game, and not getting the platinum trophy due to bugs in the big stupid collection quest, I decided a year or so later to play this again. The games save system is old wet garbage, having to retrace steps and fight the same enemies over and over again is lazy game design.

I didn't buy this game on release, because it was an exclusive elsewhere. I am extremely reluctant to purchase another one of their games if this is their modus operandi for save systems.

Part-Metroidvania, part-action shooter, part-cosmic horror, the game is a natural escalation of Remedy's previous games like ""Alan Wake"" and ""Quantum Break"" (my OCD is triggered by them breaking that little naming convention they were starting to set up, there), but highly, highly-refined.  The slick, clean, Mid-Century Modern design of the game, coupled with Remedy's talent for using lighting to effectively sell anxiety and ambiance, combines to create an atmosphere like no other.  And the game's natural progression, from having you feel like discount-Dana Scully in the beginning, but like a vengeful Goddess of Telekinesis by the end, is smooth-as-silk, and very rewarding.  The basic fun of the gameplay plus the gobs of really well-written lore hidden everywhere keep the player addicted, and hell-bent on pushing through whatever poor bastard gets in Jesse's Walkman-adorned-way to the very end.

Control is a good game, so long as you are interested / can get invested into the basic story setup and general world. If you find something weird in the game and have an immediate reaction of ""wtf what is it doing?"" and then read the little text blurb you pick up interest out of sheer curiosity - this is great.

There's also a lot of deeper lore that's quite interesting (ahti is a great character and is obviously a big deal throughout). But a lot of other characters don't go very deep, and neither does the story. There's a LOT of questions that get raised about all sorts of things, and the game finishes with no answers. The story itself, really, doesn't really ""end"", since there is an ending and it just... doesn't really answer anything or put a final stop to anything. It's more like the story just stopped, rather than ended - clearly set up for DLC, which then goes on side tangents telling its own small story with (some) lore.

The game's combat is somewhat unique yet also falls flat in certain ways. Launch feels a great skill to use, but becomes THE way to fight every fight as the gun isn't really all that powerful. At the same time, you have health, health upgrades and it all basically comes down to not having health - enemies will two hit you very frequently.

There's loot to collect in both weapon and personal upgrades, but quite a few don't seem like anyone would ever use them and there's an arbitrary inventory size limit that leads to busywork. Bit of a missed opportunity.

All in all, i really feel like the world and its complexity and sheer weirdness is what pulls this game forwards. I really wanted to keep exploring the world and finding everything there was to find, both in pure exploration and in lore sense. Control 2 was announced recently, and i hope they manage to build on this game - improving on the flawed combat but keeping the fun aspects of it, and further broadening the selling feature, it's lore and world.",1672852495,1672852495,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My Rating: 95/100

Story: 10/10

Gameplay: 11/10 (There are so many different skills that you earn while playing the story. You get the ability to rip pieces of stone out of the ground and use it as a shield or throw one stone on an enemy and you get the ability to hover and glide).

Difficulty: Some passages are hard but makeable.
(based on normal difficulty)

Graphics: 11/10 The graphic is absolutely fantastic. (You can shot at glas and you see the bullet hole and you can shot at fire extinguishers and they explode.)
(My graphic points are based on the graphic and what year the game was released. So for example if the game is from 2010 and the graphics are good for 2010, it's a 10/10.)

Sounddesign / Music: 10/10

Duration: One Story Run: 13h - 17h 

Replayability: Yes if you whait a bit

Price: Game: 29,99 (Absolutely Worth it), Ultimate Edition 39,99 (Absolutely Worth it)

Additional comments:
In this game you can do many side quests and find many collectibles.
The setting of this game is a large FBC (Federal Bureau of Control) building with different areas such as an office or a black stone factory and many more.

The game definitely has its issues.  Guidance, for one.  The game doesn't give you much to go off of, and sometimes the objectives you need aren't quite in the area it told you they were.  The ""waypoint"" system doesn't do anything until you're already on top of what you need.  There's some UI/UX issues, especially with personal and weapon mods.

All that said, it's really, really fun.  Even when I'm lost and just wandering around, it's very enjoyable to play.  Looks great, movement is intuitive, and combat isn't overly complex.  The world is expansive, and many areas have a wide, apocalypse-brewing Portal feeling to them. Most of the control (ha!) system is ok.

It's a very tactical shooter. And I have been reading SCP for years so I really like the theme of the story, even if I find the way the main characters dialogue a little cheesy. 

On top of the innovative game play, I'll be honest about my own skills and say the game became a lot more enjoyable when I discovered they had included an ""assistance mode"". You can make granular changes to the difficulty settings like percentage of damage reduction and damage dealing. I turned my damage reduction up juuuust a bit. Or even invincible if you really don't want to redo a certain part. It otherwise doesn't have difficulty settings that I'm aware of and without reading a guide the whole way through, there's a lot bosses you just won't understand how to beat unless you get yourself killed and lose a bunch of energy the first time through. It's refreshing to be like ""I hate this boss fight"", turn on invincibility mid battle when the next hit will kill you, and just plow through till you get to the part of the game you enjoy. 

Con: It falls victim to the same thing a lot games with unlockable skills do, where you're expected to backtrack to areas and complete puzzles later. Except it's not always clear if you need to find a new skill later, or if there's a secret ledge you just haven't found yet, so you end up wasting time attempting or checking a guide, which breaks immersion for me pretty bad. I went in blind but eventually realized you unlock the ability to [spoiler] levitate [/spoiler]. Which makes accessing a lot of areas much easier.

I never felt bored or tired of fighting hiss due to the options of how to handle them.

Main story: I really enjoyed the story, a good bit is hidden/written in files, correspondence and tapes so make sure to find as much as you can for more backstory, especially relating to O.O.P, A.W.E and A.l.  I was always left wanting to know more, so it really hooked me. 

Overall gameplay: the overall gameplay loop is enjoyable, you progress fairly large sectors where there are branching hidden areas you can return to and access as you get higher clearance and powers. Absolutely Make sure to do any and all side quests you come across, most are very well done.

Graphics: Graphics are very nice in control, the faces I thought were especially well done. lighting is good and I didn't have any problems that kept me from getting immersed.

Conclusion: Control is worth it even at full price, but it shouldn't be hard to find a sale anyway. after playing it I'm definitely glad I gave it a chance.

The world is now your weapon in an epic fight to annihilate an ominous enemy through deep and unpredictable environments. Containment has failed, humanity is at stake. Will you regain control?

Let's first talk about the story itself. The story is a bit confusing and not that easy to understand, unless you're willing to invest some good time in reading the collectibles that you've gathered throughout exploring the game.  But it's not half that bad even without completely understanding it.

Combat is good, you have a set variety of weapons to choose from where you can also modify them to make them even stronger. (With my personal favorite being the Pierce) and powers such as throwing objects on enemies and seizing them.

Enemies are sometimes annoying to deal with, but easy to understand and dodging their attacks in numerous ways. I wouldn't say it's Dark Souls like in terms of difficulty, but it sure isn't a walk in the park either.

For the achievement hunters, this game is really doable in a matter of 30-40 hours of game play. If you have spare time to read the collectibles and listen to audio fragments, you should. The game will make much more sense once you do that. It also took me about ~32 hours to 100% the achievements

Graphics & Performance
- Had to cut down this paragraph, but basically, with the exception of some questionable settings you have to turn off, the game is beautiful and runs fantastic and stable to boot. This game is a benchmark for PC games to look up to. Not just graphically impressive, but visually inspired and unique in its themes.

Technical aspects
Some of the sillier choices Remedy made was to, for example, force TAA on at all times. Damn shame. There is also a persistent issue with color banding that makes you feel like your monitor setting are wrong, making dimly lit areas look really bad in the spots where colors switch, which the game has a lot of. Seems like an oversight, because this is not normal in other games. Other than that, the physics engine and simulations as well as environmental destructibility are also truly some next gen things that go hand in hand with the high fidelity graphics, and partially make them what they are. As mentioned before, only in the roughest situations do the frames drop, and you will almost never run into such a situation if you have a halfway decent CPU. Game felt very responsive from an input lag perspective, and mouse input felt nice and raw, as you would expect from a proper PC port (cough, Bethesda, cough). Controls are intuitive and mostly customizable, allowing for gameplay that actually feels the way trailers make games look. 
One painful major bug, at least when using DX12, is that textures tend to load in veeery slowly, which is absolutely awful for any game, but especially this one, because it has a lot of textures and details you would want to stop and look at, whether it's to admire aspects of the game or to read text on stuff that interest you. 
The character controls very snappy and is relatively fast overall, forgoing shite ""cinematic, realistic"" movement like in RDR2 in favor or more game-like responsiveness, while still looking cinematic, and therefore achieving the best of both worlds

Gameplay & Balancing
The core gameplay which you will experience a lot is pure combat -and it's really fun and satisfying, save for a few unfortunate flaws.
1. The Service Weapon feels underpowered. Even with powerful mods, it feels like the Launch ability is always vastly stronger than most if not all Service Weapon modules. There is no tree or other ability to directly upgrade the service weapon other than one that gives a small damage increase and extra mod slot. Nothing to change total ammo capacity, time it takes for the gun to start reloading, etc. This means that as soon as you have decently perked into the Launch damage perk ""tree"", Launching stuff at enemies will be your main damage dealer by FAR, and your Service Weapon will be the pea shooter you use while waiting for your energy to reload. This also encourages you to just go for max energy capacity and max energy regeneration rate - for the vast majority of my playthrough I had used 2 (out of 3 total) body mod slots just to increase my energy regeneration. The Launch ability is cool, but the Service Weapons with its different modules is much more versatile as a concept and theoretically should be more skill based than the auto-aiming Launch attack, meaning it should by design reward more difficult gameplay with satisfying damage output. This is simply not true, which is a big shame. The Launch attack should've served as something of a stun, followed by Service Weapon as your main damage dealer, at least imo. The weapon and body mod system is also very lackluster. Firstly, you can't craft or upgrade specific mods, they are ALL random drops or are randomly created when you choose to buy them with materials and source (basically currency). They come in different tiers, and some are extremely specific to the point where no one in their right mind would use it, even for a specific character ""build"" (not that this is possible, with how utterly dull the perk ""tree"" is and the near non-existent weapon specialization). Basically, only 40% or so will have useful effects, and you will be bombarded with low-ish level mods even later on in the game, which just end up cluttering up your inventory, meaning that as you continue, you have to devote more and more time to just keeping your inventory clean so you can keep picking stuff up, in the tiny hope of finding something good that can actually improve your loadout.
The sheer amount of randomness, and the specificity of materials needed that only drop in specific areas which you have already moved past, will mean that unless you go out of your way to back track, buying weapon upgrades (you can upgrade each weapon module for the Service Weapon 2 times each) will become  a matter of coincidence on whether you have just the right materials to get that new module or upgrade. Also, the source currency is extremely rare in the beginning (or rather, costs for early stuff is too high) whereas later you will be swimming in it, having nowhere to use it. It's frustrating. The extremely large degree to which the game relies on randomness for upgrades is tiresome. The other big issue pulling the overall experience down is the health system. The game is designed for you to take damage and constantly pick up new bits of health that enemies always drop. While this encourages fast paced gameplay, which I enjoy, it kind of means that you WILL be hit, which is true in many cases, and it's not always clear what exactly hit you, making some damage feel unfair, especially from the invisible cunts. I also noticed that I just kept dying and dying, therefore I specced into health, taking maximum health perks first and body mods to increase my health, making my bar 4 to 5x as large as it was in the start, and yet there are enemies that two, and sometimes even one shot you - or would, but there is a hidden mechanic in the game that prevents you from getting one shot, leaving you with 1 HP instead. Looks like Remedy realized how bullshit some of the damage you took felt, and implemented this ""guts"" mechanic just to make deaths feel a little less bullshit. It's more so about ""keep spamming dodge and hope you don't get bullshitted"" rather than dodging at the right time and staying mindful.

Story
- (I ran out of characters) Basically, it's good, doesn't hammer it into your face, just too many audio logs and documents thrown at you, too many of which contain not all that much lore relevant info. Gets you more and more invested over time

Overall, you can really tell just how much effort went into this. It's not always perfect, it's rough around the edges in some important places, but the overall experience and uniqueness compared to most other modern games is phenomenal. As an enjoyer of any good action adventure game, you will at least like, if not love this game, and you will absolutely adore it as an SCP fan. It lacks microtransactions, loot boxes, unnecessary tacked-on multiplayer, or any other shady modern practice, and is instead only concerned with being the best possible standalone single player experience it can be, without overstaying it's welcome, but while still giving you a good 22-30 hours (Took me 30h as someone who plays brisk, but does most side quests, including the DLCs) of almost pure enjoyment. Truly, I felt dirty having only paid 10€ for this, because it is clear at every corner just how much effort has been put into the overall game, regardless of some of its weaker aspects. I fully recommend this game to most people, even at full price, and have high hopes for Remedy, who have proven themselves to be able to stand out atop in a dying industry that is being buried by its own greed.",1672443016,1672443016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Control is, at its core, a 3rd person shooter...technically. I say that because you use telekinetic powers about as often, if not more often, than the gun you are given. Its not exactly a cover based shooter as you can't ""hug"" cover like in some other games either. I will however say half the game is about the atmosphere and the overarching story, so if that's not interesting to you then there won't be a whole lot here. But what is here is pretty unique, for better or worse.

First, gameplay. It starts out small, gives you a gun with some interchangeable firing modes. But as you progress you get a few more tools, [spoiler] such as being able to telekinetically throw things, raise a barrier shield that you can then launch at enemies, you can fly eventually, and you can even BRAINWASH ENEMIES[/spoiler]. So yeah, there's honestly some cool stuff to play around with here gameplay wise.

Now the important stuff, the atmosphere and story. What exactly is it? Well if you know what SCP is, imagine that, but dealing exclusively with extradimensional entities and phenomenon. Not ""these beings came through a portal, but otherwise look fairly 3d and standard"" but rather ""this thing has more dimensions than we can perceive and is affecting reality in ways that don't make conventional sense"". With that being said much of the atmosphere keeps things cryptic and certainly has an air of mystery about much of the phenomenon in the setting, often with varying degrees of danger. [b]You will see some seriously weird stuff in this game[/b] be prepared for that.

And with that being said the story, while certainly present and a proper narrative, does leave some things intentionally vague and open to interpretation. If you take a genuine interest in the world, investigate and explore, reading the various documents you find and watching the various ingame videos then you will have a great time with this game, and will likely better understand the finer details of what's happening...up to a certain point. I say that because there is intentionally vague foreshadowing that the game doesn't pay off, implying there is more happening here than what it appears to be (which would be par for the course as far as this game goes).

Also -1 point because they locked off two of the best outfits behind preorder PS crap.

In essence, if you are patient, and take an interest in the world of the game you will find a game quite unlike any other at present. Its not a perfect game, but it gets about an 7/10 for me. Definitely worth paying money for and in turn supporting the developers, instead of trying to get a freebie/bribe from EPIC.",1672190763,1672190919,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

It felt like a mix of The Matrix and Star Wars. You can levitate/fly, use different abilities like telekinesis and mindcontrol. You can make a shield out of rubble to use for cover, and shot it away at your enemies when you are done with it.

What I would like to see for the next game is a better map of the area you are in. And there is basically no waypoint either to show you the way of where you need to go. The whole game takes place in a big company facility. Many of the areas look very much the same, like offices, hangars etc. You can't even change the map view for different floors, which was very annoying. There was so many times that I just ran around and not knowing where to go. In the mission log it says which part of the building you need to go to, but you only have signs with arrows here and there to show you the way, which I did not like. It was very confusing, especially when you are new to the game. I had to google a walkthrough guide for almost every side mission, and a few main missions, until I had run through the same corridors, rooms and offices so many times that I knew the whole facility by heart. Since the environment is pretty much the same the whole game, it got a bit monotonous and boring after a while, but the amusing action and the hunt for better loot is what kept me going.

There was a good variety of weapons in the game, but I felt like a few of them could have been made better. My weapon of choice was the starting pistol (Grip) for most of the game, and the shotgun (Shatter). I did like the grenade/missile weapon (Charge, and also Surge if you have the Investigations DLC) but I killed myself more times than I wanted to by the blast radius, which I never learned how big it was or how to avoid it. It was very difficult to see it. Many times I was just levitating and shooting with Charge at enemies way below me and I took a great deal of damage and died, and I just did not understand HOW?

You can upgrade every weapon 3 times. You can also find weapon modifications or personal modifications that you can use. The weapon mods improve the stats of your weapon, like accuracy, reload speed, damage etc. The personal mods improve the stats of your abilities, health, energy etc. You have 3 mod slots for every weapon and 3 personal mod slots. The modifications come in different tiers and stats, so you are always on the hunt for higher tier gear which was a lot of fun.

The game does not have a difficulty setting, which was a shame, because I found the game too easy most of the time.

The Foundation DLC allows us to delve deeper into the lore while proviidng some welcome alternate mechanics, while the second one provides a refreshing change of pace. The ability to fully customize difficulty can also make the game more approachable for people mostly interested in the story and atmosphere.
The main downside to me would be how hard it can be to unlock some costumes (or even knowing they exist) and unique weapon mods without checking the wiki. Most of the other combat mods feel pretty bland and some of the repeatable missions feel, well, truly like repeated content shortly.

most: the SCP story feel with stunning visuals that make you question reality and amazing combat that actually makes you feel powerful.
least: sometimes it's a bit too dark or confusing and the map is misleading so I get lost and use google every now and then to get un-stuck. But as I play and learn the maps, this becomes less of a problem.

[b]Does the game now have a good frame rate? Does the game have good, smooth gameplay?[/b]
Yes, Ryzen 5 / RTX 2060 / 1080p Med settings = sustains 60+ fps even under heavy combat

[b]Does the game have intuitive controls?[/b]
controls are similar to many games of this nature... Batman(not punching), Tomb Raider, Witcher
There are some unique controls in the game but nothing overly complicating. You can lock on your target, dodge attacks, fly (levitate) and much more.

[b]Can you rebind controls?[/b]
Yes.

[b]In Control, is the AI good (i.e., somewhat competitive & intelligent)? Is there randomization with the AI? Is the game hard?[/b]
I have about 60% of the achievs and I can say the difficulty spiked for me around the 30% mark. I actually started a new game to get some practice in and the second time around I am way more skillful. The AI bring various challenges but again nothing overly complicating so far. Fighting the AI is fun regardless. A fight can go wrong very quickly. Most of the challenge for me are the boss fights and not using google when stumped on a puzzle.

[b]Does the game have basic features like being able to save, pause, & take pictures? Can you change the view to third-person? Can you adjust the settings such as the difficulty, graphics, or audio?[/b]
All of this I believe is a yes, except for the difficulty. There is no setting for this.

[b]Is the game fun & interesting or does the game quickly become repetitive? Would you still buy Control today considering your experiences thus far with the game? All relevant & respectful answers are appreciated, thanks.[/b]
This game is awesome. It does have some repeat monsters but I find the combat very fun and gives me a real sense of power flying around wrecking the place up. Any and all minor issues are overshadowed by the epic dev work in the game. Easily worth the 10 dollars I paid for on sale. Probably the best game of the year for me at that price.

This game looks and feels great (barring slight texture popping/modification). There have legit been some sections in the game (although some are a bit hidden) that have been so fun and amazing that I just want to replay them and have more experiences like them!

The game play can be as varied as you like, though there are definitely some min/maxing you can do for ease. I was surprised at the amount of variation in abilities, weapons, locations, and enemies.

The only real cons for me are that I very deeply disliked about 3 boss fights, 1 particular enemy, and dropping the ball on some of the weapon variations. That is not a bad ratio over 30 hours of gameplay. One of the Boss' is an optional boss, and another is a DLC boss. There were some bosses that were just ok, which I thought could have used a little something more, but overall fine. The enemy I disliked is one that turns invisible, now obviously you can play how you like, but in my experience it really came down to blocking their attack and hitting them with shotgun, which is a shame and made that enemy annoying. There are several weapons in this game, but some are just simply not good enough (even with modification) so they don't end up being used. Some get added but don't really have a chance to shine like the early additions. 

I will say that a couple things to note. I would look up unlocking the other suits in the steam community post for some very easy editing for the true ultimate edition, and that, unfortunately, there was a bug (still present to this day) on the quest  ""To Put a Record On"" that prevented me from clearing all the main missions. Because of the bug on a quest, an already bloated game list, and the remaining things only being bonuses (included backtracking/hidden locations), I did not 100% the game, but doesn't mean I didn't want to.

The gameplay in this game is amazing. The movement is fluid and the combat is super fun. You have a lot of ways to deal with enemies and the skill ceiling is very high. If you can get really good with the combat system and controls, you'll become unstoppable. 

The game starts slow, the map is confusing at times, and the documents are abundant and if you read them all you'll spend hours just reading. I skimmed over them and read maybe half. They do fill you in on the story somewhat, but most of the documents are useless and forgetful and aren't required to play the game. They are mostly just items to collect.

The story is a bit strange and not that great imo, and the acting isn't amazing either. But the gameplay—did I mention how insanely fun this game is to play? 

I already finished the main story, but there is still much too do, and I plan on putting many more hours into this one.

-The atmosphere is fantastic, creepy vibes and weird geometry make the map design wonderful, the music and visuals adding an intensity to every fight that gets you REALLY into it.

-The worldbuilding sucked me in immediately. Comparing it to SCP is fair but a disservice to this game, as Control is its own wonderful world full of unique ideas and epic moments

-The gameplay is fun, letting you meld your various weapons and powers together to let you engage every fight however you like. The movement is crisp, and the controls easy to get down. Not a lot of weird tech to learn but there's a few little tricks you can pick up to make taking a few enemies out a little easier. 

-I wont comment much on the story as I don't want to spoil, but this is the real selling point for me. I was hooked immediately and it had me guessing til the very end. 

The only cons I can think of are as follows: 

-The character models were good, but it felt like the game had been dubbed over another language. Mouth movement often didn't sync up with the dialogue and it was a little jarring sometimes. 

-Some enemies can swarm and stunlock you very easily, especially in the post-game DLC. There's no ability that allows you to break out of stunlock, so often times getting surrounded means a game over is coming very quickly. It's easier to mitigate this early game, but later on some of the enemies you face can teleport, leaving you very few safe havens in a fight.

The good:
The game is good, it has unique art, story, and gameplay mechanic. It respects the gamers from the narrative's perspective - giving them the freedom of imagination, space, and time to fill the gap of the unknown and unexplained.

The bad:
- Some boss fights are utterly unbearable. It seems like that in some of the sequences the QA or the game designer didn't have spent enough time exploring and testing their own creation.

The ugly:
- Upgrading guns, the character, stats, features, and abilities have been done well enough until you play the game 2nd time. Meaning when you come back to it and you know much more than it's been presented at first. You do realize that the game doesn't respect the player. Almost like - whatever the player does, the game praises its every move by saying ""good job"" and blinding an eye to mistakes. The player won't understand what is actually good or bad until the point the character's dead or you lose points. There is no freedom to strategize the character's development.

I really admire the locations in the game with the overall macro-location called the Oldest House being perfectly fit for the story. It's labyrinthine offices, labs, maintenance rooms look quite realistically but are often twisted and shifted unnaturally showing that those are not just ordinary facilities but areas touched by supernatural world with strange things and items happening there. Add to that other dimensions ""spilling"" inside, as well as otherworldly thresholds. Areas are gloomy, mysterious, full of suspense (and suddenly teleporting enemies surely contribute to that). The authors deftly use lighting, shadows and coloration to accentuate various scenes or events and covertly guide the player through.

The plot is a bit vague, but still not bad. Combat encourages proactive behaviour, dynamic position-switching, actively engaging targets with both weapons and psychic abilities. In fact, those abilities are even more useful and effective than weapons.

As for downsides, I'm not fond of the equipment system and how upgrades are obtained. It resembles a mechanic from some online service game where you just have to kill a lot of mobs that drop common/uncommon/rare etc. mod or resource. It's not especially grindy, but looks pretty primitive and oversimplified.

There are also just a few weapons in the game and they are in essense ONE weapon with differend modes of fire. Aesthetically they look almost the same, although being different gameplay-wise. Not all of them are equally useful: like, ""rocket launcher"" is so weak that it isn't worth it's charge time, really. Additionally, when I've obtained its unique mod for +100% blast radius I soon found out that my blast reaches back to me (with hp damage) despite me being decently away from a target, thus almost completely negating the mod's advantage. 80% of the time I used the very first Grip weapon variant with upgrades as it's nicely balanced.

[i]The main protagonist Jesse Faden arrives at the Federal Bureau of Control a.k.a. The Oldest House, which is situated in New York City, to find her brother Dylan, but there is something wrong with this building. She meets mysterious janitor Ahti, who sends her to the office of director Trench where her journey begins.[/i]

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
I won’t say more about the story, because I don’t want to spoil it, and it would be a long read because of its complexity. By playing the game, you will learn about lore, but at the beginning, you could feel lost. Main missions are well-made, and the same goes for side quests. Each of them offers unique experiences, and they are not repetitive. But there is one problem. It lacks enemy types. In the beginning, it was fine, but later, there were no new variants of Hiss. Hiss is the name for an entity that spread around The Oldest House. It can manipulate people's minds and change them into mutants. Some are normal guards that use regular weapons, but others can fly or blow you up with grenades. By clearing them in a specific location, you can unlock a Control Point that works as a save point and place where you can refill health or energy. Also, you can spend skill points obtained from completed missions here, and modify your Service Weapon. You can upgrade Jesse’s paranatural abilities like throwing objects, dashing, learn how to make a shield and more. They are awesome and helpful during heavy fights. So, I enjoyed the gameplay, but for some reason, this is the third game in a row that has respawning enemies (check my review for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091110242/recommended/1172380/]Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091110242/recommended/1259420/]Days Gone[/url]). It can be very annoying when you want to save the game at a control point, and suddenly Hiss appears in front of you.

[h2]Service Weapon[/h2]
Control is not an ordinary action game, so your main weapon is way different compared to other games. It looks like a revolver, but it works very differently. You don’t need to reload it with ammo. It reloads itself after emptying the magazine and can transform into five different forms (four in the basic game). In the beginning, you have a pistol mode called Grip. Later, you can get a shotgun, submachine gun,  sniper rifle, and even a grenade launcher. You can quickly switch between two forms that suit your playstyle and situation the most. My favourite combination was Spin (submachine gun) and Charger (grenade launcher). Each weapon form can have up to three mod slots, where you can place various boosts. For example, you can upgrade damage, reload speed, rate of fire and many more. Also, Jesse can have her own three slots to enhance personal stats. Mods can drop from dead enemies, or you can get them from crates spread around the FBC, and they are craftable in the inventory. I really liked Service Weapon because it's something different and makes the game unique.

[h2]The Oldest House[/h2]
The whole game takes place in one building, but trust me, this isn't a common office skyscraper in New York City. There are a lot of secrets waiting to be revealed. The atmosphere is fascinating, and sometimes your brain will not know what to think. You will feel like in The X-Files. During combat, you can spot well-made destruction of objects. You can see how furniture falls apart, glass shatters, wood breaks and so on. If you think you are safe behind a thin railing, you are not. You must choose the right cover if you want to survive. Control is a nice example of how action games should look like. The only thing that spoils immersion is collectables. On the one hand, they can tell you a lot about lore, but on the other hand, there are too many of them. You walk a few steps and read a document, another few metres, the next piece of paper. Yes, you can skip reading, but you know. It would be better to tell about the lore in some different ways, than with 412 collectables. Some of them are videos or recordings, which is good, but others are texts. Maybe more cutscenes or conversations would be better.

[h2]DLCs[/h2]
The Ultimate edition contains two story DLCs, Foundation and AWE. The first one will bring you to a secret cave, where you must stop a new threat, and fight of a few new enemies. It's a shame the devs didn't add more new Hiss, as killing the same ones repeatedly can get a little bit annoying. This also applies to the second expansion, AWE (Altered World Events), which spawns only one new enemy type. At least the new investigation sector of the Oldest House is awesome, along with the fifth form of the service weapon. It's a lot darker, and makes the game feel more like the X-Files. Both expansions are a nice addition to the game, and they will take you the mystery of the Control universe even deeper.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
[b]Control is a well-made game with nice physics of destruction, mystery lore, the unique Service Weapon and an atmosphere that will remind you of The Files-X series. If you want something different from ordinary action-adventure games, try it. I can recommend Control to you.[/b]

Even on medium graphics it looked really cool and I'm sure it looks even better on high if you can run it. After the story there's loads to do but some feels unfinished or rushed so it's not as good as the story.

The story revolves around Jesse Faden who enters a surreal supernatural government building in search of her brother. As you progress through the game you are able to obtain a number of weapons (which all work on a short cooldown system, there is no ammo count) and abilities which you can then revisit areas to get to new places or grab objects. You also get weapon mods and personal mods that affect the character themselves. There are control points throughout the game which are the checkpoint and spawn point (think dark souls bonfire) where you can go and refill your health but that does not re-spawn all the enemies, the enemies re-spawn at randomly. You meet some interesting characters and the plot gets more depth as the game progresses which is nice but the strong points are the almost x files type surrealism and the gameplay. The dlc is solid and well worth it. The game ran well even at higher graphical settings for me. There is also an assist mode that they added which does not affect trophies, it has all sorts of options including immortality and one hit kills as well as damage reduction and recharge rates of your weapon ammo and energy, which is amazing to have for those who want it and really fun to dabble with here and there.",1671723104,1671723104,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DLCs?
Tried them. Don't care for them.
I tried playing both of them but in the end I just realised while playing both of them that I just don't care about the expansions at all. So sure, get them if you want (you probably have to because of Ultimate Edition) but the expansions aren't too interesting.


Game's Story - 7/10
This game's story is... weird. I barely understood what happened but I was able to grasp enough straws to understand it for the most part.
The story is unique and interesting and peculiar and fun and I enjoyed it a lot, it wasn't perfect, but it was good enough.
Although, it still didn't get me invested enough to read all the collections (little slips of paper) that can be found around and about.


Visuals - 7/10
The game is beautiful at times. It looks similar to real life and has great animations and lip sync.
Although, there wasn't a single moment where I was absolutely blown away by the visuals, so I just can't feel inclinced to push it any higher.

Also, the map is annoying and stupid.


Audio - 7/10
SFX - 4/5
Nothing special. It's alright, nothing to complain about here.

Music - 3/5
Yet again, nothing too special. The music fits into the background and adds well to the game but I barely noticed it while playing excluding a few points.
It is well done, but just isn't good enough to reach a 4 or 5.


Gameplay - 7/10
The combat (and physics) is satisfying and fun. Definetly the best part about this game. The mixture of the abilities and guns you get allows for various different playstyles.
However, I feel as if I get tied to 1 playstyle throughout the game due to the fact you can only equip two guns at once and the skill tree favours putting all your points into singular abilities.
Also, I don't remember enjoying ANY of the boss battles.

The crafting isn't that great and I definetly could've done without it, I didn't even know how I got half of the crafting items when I did get them.
Fortunately, the crafting isn't that complicated or ""in-your-face"" and is very simple to use.

The constant audio tapes, videos and slips of paper are a nice touch. However, they acted as more of a barrier between me and the gameplay.
I felt obliged to read/watch them to get a better sense of the world, location and FBC. Whenever I did though, it was like I was picking up a controller and pressing pause on any fun until it I was done with it.


Value For Money - 6/10
The game costs £34.99 when not on sale. Which is a bit too much but I was able to pick it up on a heavy sale which this game often has.
It is usually on sale for 70% or even 75% which is certainly worth the money.


Overall - 68/100

Not liking the genre is the reason I've stopped playing somewhere around the halfway point (55 hours). It seems to be the same genre as the X-files and Buffy the Vampire slayer TV series, i.e. supernatural fantasy with a noir or sci-fi veneer. If that's what you're after, then this game is probably for you.

I had bought the game thinking it was going to be a sociological based sci-fi or commentary on society a la 1984 or Equilibrium, Logan's Run, or even Office Space. The name 'control' had me thinking along these lines, along with a few early reviews. I was mistaken. Nothing in the story hooked me in, and I was not sufficiently curious about the whys and wherefores of this imaginary world to become fully immersed in it. I was continuing to play because I enjoyed exploring the map and unlocking new areas and generally interacting with the world.

Regarding individual aspects of the game: 

Level design is great, expansive environments in which you can interact with and destroy a lot of objects such as furniture, plenty of moving walls and morphing architecture, as I first encountered in such titles as Legacy of Kane: Soul Reaver when I was a child. Similar to games like doom 2, you will never really see much of the outdoors, which can be disorientating, you will seldom be able to see into the distance, like a dungeon crawler or being inside a large shopping mall. Thus you may rely upon the minimap to orient yourself in space, which isn't an issue as said minimap works well and is easily accessible. It doesn't do a good job of indicating vertical positions, but this didn't present an issue. 

Some rooms are quite large, and there are a few instances in which you will be in an outdoor map with a similar visual feel to the later levels of the latest two games in the Doom series. Orienting yourself with the relative positions of distant objects is not something that is possible in much of this game. You will see distant objects from time to time, but usually they are not anything important to you or what you are doing, nor will you later travel up close to them.

Some of the player mechanics were interesting, like levitating and telekinesis. It was refreshing not having to worry about ammunition management, as the main weapons have unlimited bullets that simply have a time delay on reloading.

Cut scenes and verbal interactions were high quality, with fully animated faces. Character design of faces and the animation of body movements were all very high quality, no barriers to immersion there. If you don't like to be interrupted in your map exploration too much, it is important to note that you cannot listen to some of the audio media while also moving away from the sound source, i.e. you have to stop moving to be able to listen, this I feel interrupts the flow a little, but this could be more to do with me not being engaged with the genre than the actual mechanics themselves.

Overall, to friends who like this genre, I'd be tempted to tell them this is a great game that they would really like, albeit I cannot be sure as it wasn't a good match for my own tastes.",1671353065,1671354116,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Overall a good game. The art direction could have been better - there is a fine line between being aesthetically minimal and boring. Tends to be on the latter side. 

Combat is okay - the powers are good, gunfight is not very satisfying. 

Story could have been richer.  Anyone expecting rich emotional payoff that one expects from Sam Lake's games (Max Payne, Alan Wake) is going to be sorely disappointed. A lot of paranormal mumbo jumbo without any real attempt for character/situation development. It feels like a cookie cutter FPS in which you keep clearing levels without ""feeling"" the mission.

My biggest gripe is that the checkpoints are badly designed. If you die (which can happen frequently if you don't have many ability points to spend - that can happen if you don't do side missions) you start again at a faraway point.

The game looks very good, the optimisation is top grade and for me personally, it has the best Ray Tracing I've seen in any other game. The combat is good, shooting feels great and that along with the various abilities provides many ways by which combat can be fought which makes it non repetitive and maintaining the fun all along. 
Even after game completion there is enough in the game to keep you engaged be it the side quests or the DLC's which are amazing as well.

Through a lot of diverse Characters who are in charge of different areas/departments of the world you gain a lot of insight in your own destiny and the work of the bureau in general.

The gameplay is exceptionally stale right from the get go and if other reviews on here are anything to go by, it doesn't go anywhere with the same enemy types, just more of them, and no new strategies to exploit. You can't even headshot enemies to get extra damage, so its not like you even need to aim.
The combat is ""Shoot guys until you run out of ammo, and while you wait for the gun to recharge you throw stuff at enemies until you run out of energy, then shoot them some more."" Rince and repeat.

The story is...at best, trippy and confusing. At worst, it's downright bad in its pacing, the characters and the dialogue. Right from the getgo you as the player are left completely in the dark to what even the main character knows and she doesn't really react as someone in her situation would, even if she has had knowledge of some aspects of the world. Like she gets a gun that is ALIVE about 10 minutes in and he reaction is ""This gun is alive. Huh"". Or 30 minutes later when you get the ability to use literal telekinesis to throw objects and...she DOES NOT REACT TO THAT. AT ALL.
Even if she knew something about the world was not as it appears, i very much doubt even someone who worked at the building the game takes place in would have NO reaction to getting the powers of telekinesis.

The map was often times confusing, and i spent some time running around confused as to where i needed to go.

The skill system is, as i mentioned at the start of this review, laughably bad and reading one of the top reviews that said i quote ""An amazingly fun combat and skill system."" just made me laugh. The skill system is a simple +% to health or ammo or telekentic energy which might i add, at the start of the game, is simply insufficient and runs out very easily so the skill system very much just feels like something they tacked on last minute, and if other reviews are to be believed, only there to SERVE the increase in enemies as you progress through the game, so you don't actually get progressively more powerful or again, unlock any interesting new mechanics that keep the gameplay fresh.

Performance wise, it ran....Okay. It honestly ran worse that i was expecting - With an rx 6800 xt at 1440p highest settings i was getting about 80-100 fps which, honestly, was far lower than i was expecting it to be compared to the lack of detail in some textures. For example, during dialogue there is sometimes some closeups of jesse's face and you can literally see the pixelation on the face which was quite the stark contrast to the two games i had been playing recently, RDR2 and Horizon zero dawn which not only ran better, but had far better details, not to mention they actually had AMD's FSR, where as control only has DLSS and no support for FSR.

I got this on sale for £8 and honestly...from what little i have played of the game, i would say it was not even worth that much. I have had far richer experiences for similar prices from indie games such as Symphony of war: The Nephailim saga or Crosscode, not to mention those two games are (if ""Howlongtobeat.com"" is to be believed) literally twice the duration of this game, which is apparently at best only 25 hours long.

I would avoid this game, even under a heavy sale.",1670904348,1670904348,False,0,2,0.433070838451385498,0,True,False,False

-Most side missions are fetch quests or just boring.

Fast forward to today with modern hardware it is 4k with all RT its awsome, also suffered from stutters that are now completly fixed.

But even if you cant do RT you should play it for the narrative and mechanics.

Well Iam having a blast, the game starts very slow and boring, but in 2hours gets really really fun as you get powers, throwing objects is awsome, arriving at a scene where everything is in place and then you need to combat some badies and after it the scenario is all messed up like a hurricane passed thou gives you a sence of acomplishment hehe

Also the story makes no sence at the start but after awhile you start connecting the dots, this is becuase the narrative is something special, cant tell anymore without spoiling.

I started Control just to try it out and see how it would run on my PC before going back to other games, but, the game has no benchmark option, and I decided to start a new game and then delete the save to test the performance. I played for 30 minutes, and that was enough to bewitch me. I [b]needed[/b] to play Control, in that 30m it was THAT good. The review will be with no major spoiler, and I’ll be talking about it as I would while suggesting it to a friend of mine. 

[h1]Narrative and World Design[/h1]

The game has a very unique way of telling its story. Usually, in a game, the player learns about the world and the events in it alongside the main character, but that’s not the case in Control. [b]Jesse[/b] – the name of the protagonist – already knows a lot, it’s you the player who doesn’t. So during the game, you’ll be putting together a puzzle without knowing what the picture looks like, and the narrative does a [b]great[/b] job at that, helped, obviously by the world design. The whole game is set inside the [b]Federal Bureau of Control[/b] or FBC, a clandestine organization that works with para-natural events. Once inside the Bureau’s building, we learn that the FBC's main job is discrediting an event and instead giving a more reasonable explanation. Thing is, there are para natural events, and the FBC contains them from the public eye and studies them. It had been a long time since I played a game and read every single piece of lore and document in it. The first document I read in Control set a tone of love and detail that made me want more, hence reading every piece of lore I found. The document stated that no employee was to bring in any smart device for reasons, but the game is set in our days and once I was done reading it going back to the game I noticed it was all old PCs and old tech: that’s attention to detail. Every side mission, piece of lore, audio note, or video adds so much to what you see exploring the map that it helps connect the dots and get an even bigger picture than the main story depicts. An important mention goes to the map design when it comes to para natural objects, it really gives that black magic fu*kery moment, like those [url= https://media.wired.com/photos/5932352daef9a462de9815d0/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/illusion-ft.jpg ]illusion photos[/url] that are still but it looks like they move. It’s a very unique aesthetic the game has that combined with the gameplay just provides a very unique experience.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The [b]Service Weapon[/b] is gonna be your gun throughout the game: a shifting weapon that has multiple forms. It goes from being a [b]simple pistol[/b], to a [b]shotgun[/b], a [b]sniper[/b], a [b]mini machine-gun[/b], etc. The game has a [b]mod system[/b] that allows you to customize the weapon forms and how they perform. That mod system also translates to Jesse, customizing her already great abilities and an [b]ability tree[/b] that improves her abilities or unlocks variants of it, on top of an [b]outfit system[/b] to customize Jesse’s looks. Game design as a whole usually is the science of limiting the player and building an experience around it. Already introducing something like gravity in a game is hugely limiting in the movement the player will be able to do, and often, in games, it so happens that there are a lot of limitations making the game not as fun as it could be. The best example I can give is the Souls series against Sekiro from the same developer: both are good games, but the movement of Sekiro is on another level. Control has a Metroidvania-like progression system: the more you go forward with the story, the more abilities you unlock and the more the map opens up. It was since Nier: Automata that I didn’t see a developer so proud of the movement and the design of their maps that they give you full control and make said maps a playground for the player. By the time you finish Control, the map is fun to go around in, and it’s extremely interconnected. This attention to game design goes into everything, for example, there are no levels in Control. No traditional levels, the enemies have them to tell the player how challenging they are, but the player doesn’t have a level-up bar, the ability points are awarded for playing the game and doing missions and side missions. They want you to have fun so much that in the options there is an [b]Assist Mode[/b] which can be used to tailor the experience to any player, starting from aim assists that literally lock on to the enemy, to immortality, one-shot enemies or having energy/ammo/etc. quicker. The challenge from the game is more than fair, but it’s nice to see they allow everyone who wants to play it to make it easier and have more fun with it!

[h1]PhysX[/h1]

One of the many powers you’ll wield is telekinesis or the power of moving objects with your mind. It’s a very cool power, but it’s even cooler how Remedy did it, using PhysX by Nvidia and building a world that is physics enabled. Every object in control can be picked up and thrown, and it’ll break. Everything can be destroyed and used. It was crazy to me when I threw an object on a desk and instead of moving the whole desk, it broke in half, with splinters and everything. I’ve been video gaming for a long time, but especially in the last generation a lot of devs left the physics more barebones to favor stronger graphics, and it was a breath of fresh air seeing a game with all-around physics that still looks gorgeous. Something else I was shocked for how good the physics simulation is, was when I walked on some [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mh6aix/control_i_know_im_late_to_the_party_but_it_really/]stanchions[/url] and when falling they pulled each other down. It’s not flawless, but it’s something that really compliments the game’s gameplay.

[h1]The Foundation, AWE, Expedition, and Isolation[/h1]

As this is the Complete Edition, it comes with all the DLCs and expansions, and as i’m approaching the end of the review it’s important to talk about them. Both [b]the Foundation[/b] and [b]AWE[/b] unlock at the end of the game, and they both act as an epilogue after the game’s ending, though the Foundation does that more as AWE is heavily connected to the Alan Wake’s games. They both add a map to explore that is just like the ones in the base game while playing the story, with new mechanics and powers/weapon forms. [b]Expedition[/b] is a free DLC players have access during the story, and it’s a repeatable mode with 4 objectives where stronger mods can be obtained and a challenge can be faced, ending in Tier 3 difficulty with an extra outfit. And this is where I’m gonna talk negatively about Control. Not for the game itself, but for some business choices: if I’m buying a complete edition, I expect [b]everything[/b] to be in it, including pre-order bonuses, but especially exclusive content. There are two extra outfits on PS4, one is a reskin but the other is completely unique, and on top of that there is a unique mission with a cameo from [i]Hideo Kojima[/i] “[b]Isolation[/b]”. The game has this content in it, it’s just locked on PC, and thankfully, thanks to some modders we learned how to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2448810379]edit the executable[/url] to unlock the skins that are not included for some reason, and the Isolation mission. It’s a bit “hacky”, but worth it if you ask me.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

The game is extremely solid, fun, intriguing and absolutely a gem I added to my favorite games and will suggest to everyone I know. [i]I’m already planning a couch replay to show the story and gameplay to a less gamer friend![/i]

The movement in this game is very fluid, with excellent animations not getting in the way of player input. The levels in this game are huge, so infinite sprint is very handy.

But what I can tell you is that, like I said, the game looks gorgeous (it was one of the first game with RayTracing)

The gameplay is really fun too. Sure you do mostly the same in combat. (shooting, throwing objects to enemies...)
But the physics in this game make you feel you play a Battlefield, because the interior is destructable and you can pick up nearly anything with telekinesis and when you throw it, it correctly smashes into pieces. Ragdoll physics are good too.

40 hours in, I've beaten the game, and although I've enjoyed certain things, I have some mixed feelings:

1.) The story/world building here is top notch in presentation, but there really is no ""story"" through-line that gets wrapped up at the end. There are a ton of questions left unanswered, and the only way to get any type of context, is by grinding, doing side quests, reading items collected in game, etc. That may appeal to certain players, but to me I found it to be an annoyance, so much so that towards the end of the game I was collecting items or voice recordings and not even listening/reading to them, because the information it does give you is so convoluted and opaque that it doesn't really clear anything up to begin with.

2.) The game play loop is very one-note. Enter an area, dispatch waves of enemies until clear, move on. That's it. Also it can get very difficult very quickly, and often the only way the game changes things up as you progress is just throwing more and more waves of enemies at you.  The game play itself isn't bad, in fact it often feels very fluid and purposeful, but the repetitiveness left me thinking ""okay, I'm sick of this"" towards the end of the game.

3.) The level grinding/item collection/crafting system I found really annoying and honestly I paid very little attention to that part of the game while beating the main story. 

Overall it's a well made game worth playing. But the way the game is presented, the characters, the cut scenes, the effort that went into fleshing out this world, and the lack of any kind of closure as to some key questions left me a bit disappointed.",1669835055,1669835055,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

✔ great details with stunning special effects
✔ the story & atmosphere

✘ almost impossible to see where to go and where you are
✘ overpowered launch ability

Conclusion:
The story with the paranormal setting is nice. Special effects with collision damage are stunning (fe shooting at a fire extinguisher).
Personally I didn't play it out because with around 11 hours game time I searched almost half of it where to go/ how to reach it. The map system is one of the worst I've ever seen in a game. One map with multiple levels on top of it without seeing which level you are.
The fight mechanics are fun in the beginning until you have the launch ability. Upgrade it and you can kill any enemy with 1-2 launches. I tried to use it as little as possible and to kill the enemies with my guns but at a later stage of the game it's impossible with the mass massive horde of enemies with shields.

The game has really striking aesthetic and visuals, there was never a dull moment really during my playthrough, and I really enjoyed how Control managed to convey different scales, perspectives and cleverly use them in puzzle solving. 

The game isn't perfect, and I feel it falls short in the combat. Throwing things around is immensely fun. Shooting enemies that teleport that buff others isn't. Going around to find crafting materials really doesn't grab me here either. The skill tree was pointless ultimately IMO, every reward could have been given as quest rewards instead. The pistol is cool, but the additional modes are severely lacking, and even the base version has to be heavily specced up to keep pace with just throwing tables and rocks around. I think the devs were going for this idea of ""difficulty"" in their heads, but the low damage ceiling of your weapons isn't what made the game challenging, just a bit more tedious at times.

The story starts out pretty confusing. You get pretty much no details or real backstory.
Sure, you get information from documents etc that you find spread across the game. And there are A LOT of documents. When starting the game I was curious and read all the documents I found. A few hours in I probably had hundreds and stopped caring. I want to play a game, not read a book. 


The gameplay is entertaining, but it gets old pretty quick. After a while its just the same thing over and over and over. Especially the DLC.

..but before I start to write some negative: In my playtrough I had 0 crashes, no bugs or something like that. So technically there is everything good. And in general, there's nothing about Control that is BAD per se. But outside the graphics and visuality (which is quit nice), everything is just... mediocre. The world is mediocre, the gameplay is mediocre, the characters are mediocre. 

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]
Most missions, main and side alike, involved just killing enemies in a location and fetching item or talking to NPC. I wish there were more puzzles involving using Jesse's powers or paranormal phenomena, like motel sequences or the luck experiment (which was a creative mission, I give Remedy that). But this is not enough to satisfy me. You can literally complete the game only using one maxed-out ability and one service weapon form, and you have very little reason to improvise and change your tactics. In-game hints say the combat is supposed to be fast-paced and player should stay mobile, but you don't really need to, as most fights are in closed spaces with no room to flank and you end up throwing concrete pieces from behind cover. There are some 'stronger' enemy types that force you to move away from them, but as said before, leveled ability or weapon form lets you dispatch them easily. 

[b]STORY/ LEVELDESIGN[/b]
You are thrown in the middle of a mysterious X-Files conspiracy type of world that you know nothing about, weird ♥♥♥♥♥ starts happening around you and it's actually good. Until.. it's not. It's like the development team threw all their major ideas into the first two hours of the game, so you couldn't refund it and then got lazy, not expanding on said ideas but instead resorting to using environments that you can find in literally any sci-fi shooter ever. Yes, the unique presentation is cool. But it not safe the game from the rest: lifeless laboratories, maintenance areas, copy-pasted metallic constructions that you have already seen for the thousand-ish time. 
And just like its gameplay loop and the repetitive level design, the lore files should be here named as well. Once you've read a couple of them, you've really read them all. They go in circles, with only bits and pieces differentiating from one another. There are a couple of clever ones, but it's obvious they went quantity over quality with this one and this is not, how you tell a good story..

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]
I beat Control in around 21 hours after completing all side content. The 'Foundation' DLC took me 5 hours and I don't really recommend it.

The beginning and middle portions are near-mastery level writing composition and storytelling. Engaging combat, a simple to understand progression system, quick movements coupled with decent gun play, the list goes on and on. The character development is, in my opinion, among the best of all time. I was riveted at times to my screen, anxious and sometimes pretty spooked at what the Oldest House was going to conjure up next.  Nearly every object and interaction with NPCs seemed genuine and based in reality (at least loosely). The physics engine works fantastically, even on my lower spec'd laptop. I can't rant enough about how many pluses this game had going for it.

-What I don't understand is why the developers absolutely massacred the last 1/3 of this game.
The game gives itself concrete shoes right as the crescendo melts the player's brain. You have been looking for answers for nearly 12 hours to some absolutely mind-numbing problem sets. What does the game do? It resolves the plot in a tidy knot with an incredible amount of loose ends and nearly no resolution whatsoever. 
-Those fascinating characters that you're just dying to understand more? Meh, just forget about them.
-THE MAIN ANTAGONIST AND PROTAGONIST? Eh, don't really need to know what happens to them either.

Visuals: 8/10
The game's strongest suit is it's flashiest. The visuals are phenomenal, with a great sense of style and detail. Despite the feeling that the game constantly invited me to study the environment, I rarely found anything worth noting that would actually contribute to progression or understanding the story. Even then a majority of the actual objectives, if they weren't literally giant red blobs or trying to kill you, were often completely missed because they so easily blended in with the environment. The only things that ever stand out are the freakishly paranormal things, leaving any mundane but nonetheless important objects or locations to be easily regarded as unimportant, ultimately passed by on accident. The visual effects of destruction and combat are incredible, but can disruptively cloud the screen with smoke and distortion effects, sometimes making combat and navigation difficult.

Gameplay: 6/10
A firm, serviceable foundation of gameplay mechanics: third-person shooting, a simple stat upgrade system, some visually impressive supernatural powers, and a whole lot of running through mazey hallways with a map that might as well have been made with ASCII characters. There is almost no experimentation in the mechanics, most enemies are given frustrating gimmicks like shields, a funkload of health, or perfect dodging, instead of challenging attributes you need to strategize to overcome. Therefore, there is a painful lack of true engagement, though the components are all in place for a powerful gameplay structure.

Story: 3/10
We don't know anything about Jesse, the Foundation, or any of the ins and outs of the universe at the start of the story. We don't know anything about Jesse, the Foundation, or any of the ins and outs of the universe at the end of the story. That's the best way I can summarize the world building.
I know there is so much lore hidden in the documents and recordings you can find all over the facility, but unless you're a major reader, this is probably one of the worst possible ways to teach players about your worlds and about the characters in the world. Gamers, more often than not, are very visual people; it is why many of us favor games over books. Don't make us read books in order to fully understand the world. It's fine for extra details here and there, but don't leave us in the dark because we don't feel like reading Control: Volume 39.
The game tries too hard to weird you out, to confuse you, to be all meta-spooky-creepypasta on you, and all it ever does is further the lack of understanding of the plot or why you should care about completing the next quest.
They attempt to convey that Jesse is conflicted about her duties, her goals, and her disbelief, but they leave this to a small handful of internal dialogue lines and that's about it. There is an ironic disconnect between the player and the protagonist, where I too often felt like Jesse knew something that I didn't, even though I should.
Several points in the story felt like having a flashbang detonated in my frontal lobe.

Conclusion: 6/10

So, my character became invisible, just turned into a floating gun, appearing only when zooming in or interacting with objects.
Then the black screen bug that happened to me twice already, once in the middle of a fight, and the second time during a cutscene. It's like a black wall goes through the game, making everything black besides highlighted objects, and the only way to fix it is to restart the game.

Its not all bad though - the world is interesting and looks gorgeous, the environment is destructible and satisfying, motion and controller vibration is handled very well, and the characters and situations are reasonably entertaining.

I've already finished the game and its expansions on PS4, and I bought it on steam, to enjoy it at 60fps. 

[h1] What is CONTROL? [/h1]
Its a 3D-[b] Metroidvania [/b] Story driven action game, that took place in an unique and unusual world... set in a building...

For the first time Remedy chose a more open world design, and for me they nailed it. You have everything a metroidvania has, shortcut that allow you to backtrack or return to a checkpoint, areas that you can unlock with new abilities, etc.
[b] Exploring ""the old house"" is satisfying[/b], du to the artstyle, and the well crafted level design. There's no minimap or quest marker, you navigate by watching your environements. Its way more rewarding to explore the world like that. More developpers should follow that philosophy in my opinion.

The game took place in a retro-futuristic building that feature brutalist architecture. The work on the [b]environement aestetics are excellent, each place can be a wallpaper[/b]. There's way more to discover but I won't spoil you this.

[b]The combat and plateforming are excellent.[/b]
Finaly, a third person action game that is not a cover/shooter. Here you need to move, jump, use the right approach. Its fast paced and fun. 
And FINALY, a game where platforming is not some ""press X to jump automatically on the next platform""), here you have real jumps. Thank you remedy.
As you progress, the game will feature more depth. You have a skill tree, an you can customise your stats with mods that will heavely influance your playstyle, especially on late game. 
[b]Controller is recommanded, the game plays better with it than with a keyboard [/b]

I also like the story about the old house, and the altered items.

[h1] Is the game perfect? [/h1]
[b] For me the game is a 10/10 [/b] but that's subjective...
I've read some of the very few negative reviews (the vast majoriry of them are very positive) and most common complain is ""the game is too hard, you die too often"". Let me tell you: that's not true, the game is easy, you will not have any trouble to beat the game.

I played through the whole base game, the AWE DLC and about 20% of the Foundation DLC so I gave it a lot of chances. The art direction and atmosphere, the whole X-Files/Stranger Things vibe of it, top notch, excellent. The graphics in DX12 mode with ray tracing on a RTX card are amazing. When Control is good, it’s really good. The problem is that every 2-3 hours you slam into a difficulty spike or a bunch of frustrating cheap deaths that suck the fun out of it and you put it down for the day. It took me 5 months to get 29 hours into this game. There’s a moment early on where you press a button and an invisible miniboss spawns behind you and kills you. Stuff like that happens all the time. When you die in a challenging game you have an idea of what you could have done better to “get gud”. Here instead it feels more like the game saying “haha, I got you!” over and over. It isn’t just enemies spawning right behind you (though that does happen a lot), a lot of the issues have to do with how the mechanics of the game are designed:
- All abilities (telekinesis, levitate, shield, dodge, make) use the same energy meter and when it depletes you can’t do any of those things until it fully recharges. If you dodge a lot of incoming projectiles/enemies you can’t levitate or throw anything back at them until the meter recharges all the way, etc. Inversely, if you launch a bunch of projectiles at enemies you won't be able to dodge the surviving ones when they get close until your single energy meter recharges.
- Similarly, all guns use the same ammo meter so switching doesn’t help if you run out and like with energy you can’t fire anything again until it refills all the way. Didn’t we learn not to do shared ammo after Invisible War?
- You only regain health from Control Points (checkpoints) and fallen enemies so if you are low after a fight there’s no way to heal back up in between.
- These three issues together mean that after the initial volley in a fight you’re stuck slowly jogging around trying to hide from enemies who are usually faster than you while you wait for the energy and ammo bars to refill so you can do something other than just look at them.
- Corrupted areas glow red, most enemies also glow the same red making them hard to spot.
- Lots of frustrating difficulty spikes on bosses and mini-bosses that give you no indication of what to do to beat them. The game also penalizes you 10% of your money every time you die, which makes them even more annoying.
- Jesse, the player character, is slooow and most of the enemies move faster than you so you can’t disengage or reposition without burning energy on dodge, which then means you can’t fight back with abilities until it recharges.
- The Seize ability requires pixel perfect aiming to trigger, it’d be nice if it had a wider targeting cone like the launch ability does
- I wish levitate had an upgrade that let you move at running speed, since most of the time it just makes you a big slow floating target. You can dash while levitating, but that uses up more of your single energy meter.
- The AWE expansion uses light for a lot of puzzles, which initially was pretty cool but as it goes on you keep being put in situations where you have to run through a pitch black area where you can’t see anything, frequently resulting in you getting stuck on the environment or a box you can’t see and then dying. Also, your energy doesn’t recharge in the dark, which is really annoying when you get to fights that require you to use energy to launch a power core to put the lights back on and again all you can do is slowly run away hoping you don’t get stuck on something you can’t see.
- The Foundation expansion is drawn out and repetitive. The new sharpened enemies are cheap as hell, moving in on you nearly instantly and throwing axes faster and more accurately than other enemies shoot bullets.",1668979586,1668979706,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When talking to other NPCs in game, they act super stiff; it is painful to watch. This is incredibly jarring compared to the high quality graphics. This is worsened by the fact that they clearly recorded all of the characters doing a generic set of movements, independently recorded all of their voice lines, and then stitched them together in post-production. This causes delivery of a voice line to often not match context. This is not the fault of the actors, this is a fault of the editing.

Every ability and weapon pales in comparison to ""throw rock"". This causes a dreadfully boring gameplay loop.

The story sucks. Jesse Faden's (the main character) writing is poorly done. She has no character growth throughout the game that is meaningful. She arrives at her self-realization without giving motivation for that realization. The main storyline works the same way. The hiss are here and attacking. We spend the whole game trying to find out why. spoiler of why->[spoiler]Oh they just came through the projector. That's it. That's literally it.[/spoiler] When the antagonists have an equal amount of motivation for existing as the main character (zero), then nothing interesting happens outside of direct battle, which since this is a video game, means combat. And since the gameplay loop is boring, there is basically no compelling reason for the enemies to exist at all. You might look at this and say ""Oh that is a bad take, you clearly didn't read all of the collectable lore documents"". But guess what! The lore documents actually don't say anything of interest either! The parts that are supposed to fill in these details are blacked out as they are supposed to be ""redacted"" information because this is a top secret government agency. However, this is just a cover for the fact that the game doesn't have anything interesting to say. To top it off, the main character collects classification access cards which allows her to access areas of the map that are ""more classified"". This doesn't interact with the collectables at all!

To talk of good things, this game does an excellent job in its level design. Particularly, one can turn off waypoint and directional hints and still easily navigate without looking at the minimap. This is something that is often overlooked so it definitely deserves praise for this.

There are moments that are uncanny, sometimes in a somewhat horrifying in implications, and sometimes in ways that are comedic.
There is a particular segment involving headphones, a maze, and particular taste in music that led to a section that had be laughing with joy at the sheer ridiculous beauty of it.

Speaking of beauty, Control is a beautiful game, that is for the most part taking place within the most ugly brutalist architecture.
During combat there are incredible inksplotch like particle effects as huge chunks of concrete crash into each other, as a harsh red light pours over the environment, all trying to offset the ugly enviroment.
It's the most beautiful representation of an ugly office.

Combat is incredibly fun, but not the most challenging. There's a certain amount of chaos with some of the powers you unlock throughout the course of the game, which can make actions somewhat unpredictable, and likely wouldn't lend well to, say, a Doom Eternal style of difficulty.

In Control you take the role of Jesse Faden, who enters a secret government building in New York in search for her missing brother. At first glance the building seems completely empty except for a seemingly crazy janitor, but when she stumbles over the body of the former director of the agency, Jesse discovers that there is much more within the building than just human beings. 

Control is no horror game, but it is definitely slightly creepy. Unfortunately, this doesn't count just for the atmosphere of the game. The creepiness already starts with the super-confusing, wannabe-mysterious and borderline nonsensical mumbo jumbo it tries to sell you as a story. Even if you read and watch the hundreds of tons of annoying collectibles (gag-reflex!) that are scattered all throughout the building, you won't understand anything beyond the mere basics. Retaining some degree of mystery is one thing, but the point is: I don't think that there is anything crucial to understand here. The game just tries to hide the fact that its story is a huge pile of f*ckin nonsense under a wall of text, that is little more than boring, mindless gibberish. What makes it even worse is that the game seems to take all its ridiculous sh*t completely serious. The characters make this desperate attempt even more obvious. The main character Jesse is incredibly stoic and cold and seems to be completely unfazed by all the life-threatening supernatural stuff that is suddenly going on around her. Her counterpart, an employee of the office named Emily, whom she meets early in the game appears so naive and overly friendly that you have to ask yourself how she landed a job in a top secret agency like that. The only slighty interesting characters are the lead scientist of the organisation and, believe it or not, the mentioned crazy janitor, whom you only meet 2 or 3 times. The lackluster story is complemented by the in terms of a Remedy game unusually dull german voice acting, which is really unemotional and kind of stiff. The english voice acting might be better though. 

The setting within this mysterious, weird, shapeshifting office building is cool, but in the end Remedy does surprisingly little with it. For the most part, it just stays exactly that: A boring, perfectly normal office building.

The only thing that I perceived as positive at the beginning at least, was the gunplay. There is no regenerating health and the enemies are dumb but they come in numbers, so the fights require quite a few skills and demand a well-balanced combination of the right function of your gun together with the right supernatural power at the right time. But despite all this, the combat gets old rather quickly, too. A major reason for this are the respawning enemies who always come up at the exact same spots again. Why give this game this sort of semi-non-linearity when all it does is spawning the same enemies at the exact same spots over and over again? It just becomes tedious, especially in those areas where they spawn tons and tons of enemies so that the fight just goes on for too long or you'll die once or twice too often.

The unintuitive menus don't add to the already sparse fun either. Navigating those is quite laborious and it makes a huge chore out of the simplest things. Finally there is the at times pretty confusing leveldesign and massive backtracking. Many areas look pretty samey (since it is, as mentioned, just a lame office building in the end) and the borderline useless map only shows you the bare schematic minimum and makes navigating the building extremely inconvenient and irritating despite the fact that fast travel points are pretty abundant. Furthermore, don't get me started on those dreadful, awful, stupid, sh*tty, annoying ""Board Contermeasures"" side-quests. ""Kill so and so many of this particular enemy type with that particular weapon in that particular area..."". Oh my god. If it hadn't been for the Steam Achievement to complete 25 of those I would have flat-out ignored them, that's how awful and annoying they are. All those sidequests basically just bloat the game to a ridiculous degree. If they just would have left out all of this distracting, repetitive, superfluous side-stuff and instead focused on fleshing out the main story, the game would actually be way less irritating and have much better pacing. To top it all off, Control has some of the worst boss fights in gaming history, with some bs difficulty beyond belief. Everybody who already fought the final boss in the Alan Wake DLC will probably know what I'm talking about.

Theoretically, Control has more than decent grafics and animations. Pratically it looked like sh*t half the time, because it had severe problems with texture streaming. I won't blame the game too harshly for that, since my system is not the most recent anymore and apart from the muddy textures, it runs completely smooth and stutter-free the whole time, even with maxed-out settings. Nevertheless, this wasn't really beneficial for the overall impression the game left on me. 

Overall, Control is pretty far below average for a game from Remedy, the people who brought us gems like the Max Payne- and Alan Wake games as well as the absolutely fantastic Quantum Break. It is an absolutely overrated ""mixed bag"" at absolute best for me. Admittedly, there is some fun to be had here, especially after you got the Impulse Weapon in the Alan Wake DLC, which turns you into a paranormal arsekicker. But in my case, this didn't happen until around the 25 hour mark, which was way too late. Most of the time i found Control to be painfully mediocre, boring, confusing and highly irritating. It has objectively solid gameplay, but completely failed to really grip me. Due to its overall weird and confusing premise and design, it just doesn't flow very well for me. There are certainly a lot worse 3rd-person-shooters out there, but definitely a lot better ones, too, especially from Remedy themselves (*cough* Max Payne *cough*). It is not your average military cover-based shooter, you have to give it that, but that doesn't make it a good game automatically. Literally everything in this game, even the initially exciting combat ends up feeling like a big chore and the game already starts to drag seriously only a few hours in.

If you are a hardcore Third-Person-Shooter-fan with an acquired taste for stuff out of the ordinary, Control may turn out okay for you if you just focus on the main story and leave out all the side-quests and DLC. But if you decide to see it all through (a big mistake that I made there, too), the game heavily oustays its welcome and just seems to go on and on forever. 
Take a careful peek if you are looking for ""something different"", but I dare say that even then it's going to be a ""Love it or hate it""-thing for you. Control is not really a bad game, but it is extremely bloated, boring and frustrating as f*ck for sure.

The story of the game had me fully enthralled up until the end until it stumbles and then ends on a super flat note. When credits rolled all I could say is ""That's it?"". The game sets up a lot of interesting questions but nearly nothing was answered. There were so many loose ends to the biggest plot points, which I felt was very unsatisfying. The DLC didn't do much to relieve this issue. In fact, it arguably made it worse. Perhaps we will see things expanded upon in a Control 2, but I don't think that excuses the rushed ending / final act of this game.

Gameplay wise, the game is fun, but the balance between the guns was off. Anything other than the pistol and shotgun felt weak by comparison. Any power other than launch felt useless in most cases. Also, managing mods felt more like a chore than a fun gameplay element. I found myself ignoring them completely, especially in the DLC when the bonuses they give are negligible.

The good: 
The story is weird and entertaining. It's well enough written that it makes absolutely no sense when the player starts out and as things progress the weirdness begins to make more and more sense.

The Bad: 
The game is wearing out its welcome because of the utterly unsatisfying combat. Starting out the weaponry was just a little too anemic and the enemies just a little too bullet-spongy, I thought at the time that it was just an early game difficulty issue that will resolve as my character becomes more powerful.

The exact opposite happened, enemies got more bullet spongy, and the weaponry fell farther and farther behind due to a lack of meaningful damage upgrades. The only thing keeping the game tolerable is the overpowered telekinetic throw, but it's just a crutch, it makes the combat tolerable but turns the enemies into a roadblock, an inconvenience keeping me from completing the damn story. One weapon became useful after finding a DLC upgrade, but it's area of effect and becomes a liability in cramped areas, so it's only useful in about 50% of environments.

Control is a lot less linear than their other titles and is definitely inspired by the Souls formula.

Exploring it seems daunting and confusing at first but then it really grows on you and you start to become an expert on navigating its maze-like corridors. There's plenty of lore and secrets to find and the gunplay is fluid and fun, especially once you get some of the more acrobatic powers. The game also runs very well and has some really nice graphics. The physics and destruction/particle effects are smooth and cinematic. Seeing the wake of destruction in your path is always fun. If you've enjoyed other Remedy games and are looking for something unique and refreshing, I say try this game out. It may surprise you how un-derivative and fun it actually is.

It's unfortunate how often I found myself thinking, ""they shouldn't have bothered"". The environments and level design are quite good, and I liked poking around and finding lore. I can't avoid mentioning the destruction physics and graphics, which were beautiful, impressive, and made me feel like I was actually destroying the world around me. The story and characterization are decent, with par for the course voice acting for a video game. The game is a fine length with plenty of levels and missions. Overall, Control is a solid game that's worth trying.

The gunplay is another story. While levitating, dashing, launching, seizing, shielding, and the other combat powers you have at your disposal felt effective and even enjoyable at times (especially launch), the guns never felt right in any of their incarnations. The visual effects of the service weapons as they shapeshift are a nice touch, though many of them feel either inaccurate or unable to rise to the task, damage-wise. For magic guns they felt very much like something was missing, and could have used some more work. For a game with so much of its duration devoted to combat, it doesn't feel like gunplay got its fair share.

With such anemic gunplay, I was surprised to see a skill tree, crafting, and randomized mods complete with a rarity system. This is where ""they shouldn't have bothered"" comes in. The skill tree is utterly boring, being mostly +X% to a stat with the occasional ability upgrade that could have been a quest reward. With an expensive reset cost and the fact that you'll be able to nearly max out everything, the skill tree doesn't exactly play into buildcrafting. Then again, neither do the mods. 

When I say ""randomized mods"", I mean in the style of an MMO. Each mod has a random stat and then a random buff to that stat within a range, depending on its rarity. These things are everywhere, trip over a box and you'll find three. I feel that this system makes little sense for this game. Especially with the DLC mods, there are so many different effects that you'll find it difficult to create a specific ""build"" and will probably stick to the core stats like damage, hp, energy, etc. It's a thin veneer of progression that wouldn't be out of place in a multiplayer game, RPG, or MMO.

So say you want to engage with the mod system and flesh out a ""build"". Well, the jukebox has you covered. After you've farmed up or crafted some coins (tickets), you can pay to enter a repeatable mission and earn some random mods. This is the exact same mission every time you play it. It's not even changed procedurally or set in different areas of the game. It's the exact same level, the same objectives, the same enemies, the same boss, etc., every single time you play it. This mission is designed to be farmed. It's not the only farming you're encouraged to do, either. What's worse, as you play, your tiny inventory quickly fills up and you'll find yourself stopping after each mission (or in the middle of a mission) to do inventory management. Compare mods, equip mods, delete mods, farm mods, fill up your inventory... it's not an engaging system. They simply shouldn't have bothered.

Control is at its best when it's being a single player game, with environments and worldbuilding that suck you in, with exploration and lore, and with the missions and duties of being the director. Control is at its worst when it thinks it's a multiplayer game, with boring skill trees, mods, crafting, and inventory management. It's so needless and mars what would otherwise be a perfectly serviceable game (save the service weapons).",1667879764,1667879764,True,62,2,0.850526630878448486,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately no one told the designers less game is better then bad game.  It's full to the brim of systems that make the game worse.

Random encounters. These are a mixed bag. Combat is somewhat fun so it's ok, stops things from feeling like a tomb. You can just run past it if it becomes annoying the issue is how it interacts with the other systems.
Random loot. I guess? Enemies seem to drop stuff with randomly chosen names usable only for crafting, and directly drop mods too. it's works I guess.
""board countermeasures"": no. Who thought it would be a good idea to force players to grind wandering around looking for a random encounter in a specific area. There's no story added here either. it's just a side quest system added for no reason.
Jukebox tokens: Doesn't add anything to the story, the quest is bugged, and it's a bit too hard for when it's introduced. Gives a system for those who want to go do combat on demand so that's a plus.
Smup: A nice optional combat on demand that allows for replying boss fights.

 lucky they is signs that helps you navigate. the abnoxious map

- why i need to stop holding Shift to crouch?
  bruh...you can change it, in the game settings to (hold shift to run) 

-if you're the person that don't mind watching youtube, video because you don't understand where you supposed to go, then enjoy

Pacing for the main story is executed very well, though some side quests could’ve been shored up a bit. The story proves interesting throughout, constantly managing to excite your curiosity with its well-implemented mystery elements and stellar worldbuilding, though reading all of the lab notes and official letters can get tedious at times.

Live-acting has introduced the amazing character of Dr. Darling in a natural and exciting way that always made me eager to find the next of his tapes. Exploring this history of The Oldest House combined with world clues in the fantastically designed interior space proved intellectually rewarding and visually memorable.

Gameplay feels very honed, every learned ability fluently intertwining and proving useful while not overburdening the player with too much information to process. The design as well as concept of the Service Weapon make sense in the world and allow for quick and convenient shifting of strategies for combat.

If you’re in the mood for an intense story with horror elements on the basis of smooth and action-packed gameplay while learning ever more about the depths of the government’s knowledge of paranatural beings and objects, Control is right for you.

You will like Control if:

      -You like surreal stories that dive into the power of the human mind and its ability to shape the world around it, even in the face of the utterly unknown.  We're talking surrealism that is willing to knock upon the fourth wall at times as it questions the power of storytelling and ideas (just like the story of the game and the vision of the game's creators).  This is something it shares with Alan Wake, and if you liked what Alan Wake did there, you can probably skip the rest of the review and buy it now.
       -You want to experience a strange and surreal version of our world filled with paranormal forces and you are willing to read lots of files and documents found in the game setting to understand the nature of this world.
      -You are willing to sit through a long and gradual build-up that lets you fumble in the dark, surrounded by weirdness you don't understand, before the game starts very gradually leaking you a sense of what's going on.

That's all I'm going to say.  The rest you'll need to experience.  I'm not saying that to be coy or save the surprise; I'm saying that because it's just too hard to try and describe the experience that Control provides.  It will bend your mind.  If you give it the chance, it may change your perspective on the world around you.  Remedy has done it again.

Also fantastic about the Ultimate Edition is that you get a continuation of Alan Wake's story that left things extremely open-ended, thanks to the AWE expansion.  If you've played Alan Wake, that expansion should be a highlight.  At the expansion's end [spoiler] it even seems to hint that Remedy plans to come back that story in full with a future title [/spoiler]

Storytelling and worldbuilding through collectibles (case files, reports, tapes, short vids). A lot of backtracking. A map that most of the time doesn't help you to do this backtracking and confuses you. Checkpoint saves instead of manual saves. That's rough, but.

Despite all that I found myself really enjoying the game because its design transforms aforementioned ""rough patches"" into strengths. Control is set in a huge building, The Oldest House, that reminds me of a carefully crafted maze. The level-design makes sure to keep all sub-locations intricately vowen between eachother in a way that just sticks to your brain. Plus there are plenty of visual cues for the player to follow. The faster you discard the itch to open your map – the better. And when you do just that, then start reading/watching/listening everything you can find the atmosphere immediately grips you and holds you close to its chest till the very end. 

You and the Oldest House become one, as it should be.

From the makers of Max Payne, Alan Wake, Quantum Break and more, the game is masterfully crafted to the genre defining standards you’d expect. 

Control’s strengths lie in its presentation, setting, story, exciting sequences, and challenging combat. 

The game’s presentation is high quality. Its “science meets fiction meets horror” vibe is reminiscent and clearly inspired by the SCP collaborative fiction wiki. The game centers around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. The environmental storytelling, art style, dialogue, and various environments bring the FBC to life and make the player invested in finding out more about the world and the FBC. 

The setting is a strong suit. The FBC’s main facility is the Oldest House, a space-defying, constantly shifting labyrinth connected to various alternate dimensions through spontaneously occurring Thresholds. Its brutalist architecture is fun to watch shift around and the inside of the building contains a universe of itself. It was fascinating to see how the FBC was trying to map and explore the Oldest House, with some areas containing makeshift camps for exploration mission to the uncharted depths of the labyrinth. I especially found the “ashtray maze” in game location to be especially interesting, and its sequence to be some of the best third person action I have ever experienced. 

Its story is good, especially if you read the collectible files and materials. They detail some high-quality sci-fi horror concepts, you can explore some chilling rabbit holes. The story follows protagonist Jesse Faden, played by Courtney Hope, as she unravels sinister happenings at the FBC as well as comes to grips with her own past that has become an integral part in the FBC’s activities. 

The game's combat is challenging and fun. I died a TON. Its fast and frantic action will keep you on your toes. The abilities Jesse can wield are very fun! Projectile weapons, mind control, telekinesis, dashing, levitation, melee, and more keep the action varied and you can tailor your experiences to the ones you like the most via the games skill trees. The game’s destructible environments add to the fun, its great to see Jesse rip a chunk off the railing in front of her to launch at an enemy. 

The graphics, sound design, soundtrack, and voice acting are all very good. 

I mentioned it earlier but the “Ashtray Maze” sequence was one of the better third person action gaming sequences I have experienced in a long time. Very high quality. If you don’t end up buying the game, its worth a look on youtube. A lot of people in the comments agree with me. 

I would recommend Control to those who like polished third person action games with a horror twist. The game brings a lot to the table and comes on sale from time to time.

What I don't like are the enemy spawns, which are fixed, but very much random. I've tried to farm some crafting materials in the beginning, but that became an exercise in frustration to run through the same two areas again and again to hope for some enemies to (re-)spawn.
The radiant quests amplify this issue. I've tried some in the beginning and the remaining ~10 to get my last achievement... and yeah, it still sucks to run through empty halls over and over and over again.

• There are also many secrets and finding them can be quite fun!
• ""We don't know what it is, if we knew what it is, we don't know what it is"" — the content of most non-plot docs.
• The firearms arsenal isn't the most useful for this environment. You'll more often use abilities, revolver and shotgun, because these things always solve all your problems.
• Bosses — kill them fast or you will die from their spam attacks. No special tactics.
• Most of the deaths (for me) were from falls into pits (too dark, clumsiness, or after dash in the heat of battle).

You’re the director tasked with saving a building, maybe a bit more, but that about sums it up. 

Gameplay: The controls feel fluid and the movement is good, combat is fun but repetitive. You get a few powers and a few guns to mix it up with, overall it feels pretty good. The game is linear but with the ability to explore levels to find the occasional secret. Depending on how you spec your character the game can be a little too easy, or rather frustrating. Launch is overpowered. 

Story: There is a lot of lore in the form of pickups and whilst it is extensive overall the game didn’t explain a whole heck of a lot as to what was going on. Lots of unanswered questions by the end of the game and the DLC really didn’t add much instead offering more questions. 

Graphics: Not quite top tier but they’re very pretty. Though the facial animations are a bit hit and miss, in fact all the faces of the human characters are a bit janky. 

Music: A missed opportunity, there are two fun missions with music that really changed up the atmosphere, a pity there were only two.

Everything you need to understand the main plot is delivered through very well-delivered voice acting while much of the context for the game world is provided via notes and documents. I appreciated how these together fill the game to brimming with bits of humorous background. However, a small downside is that there are a few occasions where the game will dump several documents on you at once and it feels a bit overwhelming and can halt the action (the start of the AWE DLC is the worst offender for this).

Something I wish the game did not have at all is the random 'crafting' system. Some of your character progression is tied to equipping weapon and personal mods that you can find randomly. The strength of found mods increases naturally as you complete main quests, but it's still rather uncommon to find upgrades to mods you have equipped. To balance this, there's a way to craft random mods with materials that you also find randomly. Trying to improve my loadout by farming materials and crafting what are essentially lootboxes really detracted from my first run through the game. Just as an example, let's suppose you have an common quality mod that increases weapon damage by 15%. You see an option to craft a random uncommon weapon mod in the menu. Weapon damage is just one of dozens of weapon mod effects. Assuming you get uncommon weapon damage, it's strength is picked randomly from a range like 10%-20%, so there's a distinct possibility that even if you get the effect you want, the strength will be lower than what you already have. It's just really tedious and disheartening and I'd encourage anyone starting the game not to engage with this system at all. You will get plenty of mods just from exploration and enemy drops that it's not worth the time invested to try and maximize your stats increases through crafting.",1666061421,1666061421,True,4,0,0.530401051044464111,0,True,False,False

The story, characters, side-stories, voice-acting, are oozing with love and passion by the developers. And let's not forget about the soundtracks for Control (such ""Take Control"" and ""Dark Disquiet""). They've even put love into the production of the songs.

Graphically and game feel wise, this is a strong title, but its primary weakness is its very derivative story and its non existent characters that lack all personality. The story is an uninspired amalgamation of SCP lore combined with the Scifi TV series, The Lost Room. There could have been something special here, but the game rarely goes into the levels of craziness that its inspiration goes into. I'd recommend picking a random SCP story or watching The Lost Room instead.
 As for the characters, Jesse is emblematic of everything wrong with modern presentations of women. She is devoid of any personality, flaws, connection to others (beyond her brother at least), sexuality (God forbid right?), or really any kind of goal or motivation beyond her brother (who is more a mcguffin as we rarely see /interact with him). They could have revealed that she is a robot, and it probably would have gone a long way to explaining her character. She only serves as just another example of a long line of lifeless female leads. Everything is handed to her, she works for nothing, she feels / cares for nothing, she has no flaws, and she doesn't grow or learn from anything. The killer fridge object has more personality. The supporting cast is no better, I challenge anyone to even name one of the supporting characters or one of their lines of dialogue (aside from Dr. Darling who apparently horded all of the charisma and charm for himself).

If you can get over the plagiarized story and lifeless characters, there is an enjoyable experience to be had which is why I give it a recommendation. Ignore the story and make up one of your own in your head. You get 30 hours of fairly solid collecting and combat (albeit rather unbalanced combat as your throw ability just dominates everything).

Achievements: You are looking at a smooth ride here with nothing missable in both the main game and DLC.

Control's primary strength lies in its combat system. At its core it is a third-person shooter. The gun play is very good, with a main weapon that has alternate forms that behave like different types of weapons and can be progressively upgraded. More importantly are the supernatural powers you acquire and upgrade over the course of the game which have offensive and defensive uses that allow for various play styles and are very fun to mess around with. The game can be challenging at times with occasional slight difficulty spikes that might catch you off guard, but nothing is unreasonable unless you go looking for it. The real difficulty lies with some of the optional bosses found in certain side quests which can be unforgiving and will truly test your mastery over your arsenal of weapons and powers.

Visually, the game relies on many elements of the paranormal and surreal that can also at times border on horror with an occasionally dark and unnerving atmosphere. The graphics are top notch, and noteworthy are the facial animations which are very well done. One thing I love is how they incorporated numerous short live-action videos that you can find throughout the game while exploring, which contribute to the lore and world building and can give additional context to the game's narrative but are for the most part completely optional.

Narrative isn't necessarily one of the strongest points of the game but I enjoy it regardless because it is [i]weird,[/i] and I love that. The story capitalizes on many of these paranormal and surreal elements that are a running theme through the game and the events and twists are interesting enough to keep me immersed if for no other reason than it is just plain absurd at times, and that makes it great.

Music is something I struggle to comment on in games because I am rarely paying close enough attention to it, but here I've taken note of how the game tends to stay pretty quiet most of the time letting the atmosphere speak for itself, and then ramps up in intensity as combat begins. More notably, the best mission in the game features a kick ass original heavy metal track playing as you're navigating the level blasting away enemies, which always puts a smile on my face. More games need heavy metal in their soundtracks.

Control is by no means a perfect game, no game is, but it is still one of the most fun games I've played in the last few years, and I love it's weirdness.",1665901761,1665901928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u] GAMEPLAY: [/u]
A sweeping number of core game mechanics are never explained, so good luck figuring those out without resorting to internet forums.
Wield the game's iconic sci-fi gun! ...which in actuality is a peashooter that requires a full clip to kill basic enemies until you  [spoiler]can combine unlocked new forms and acquired mods.[/spoiler]
Be killed in a single shot by enemies that spawn behind you more times than you care to count.
After acquiring [spoiler]telekinesis[/spoiler] early on, you now have the main offensive skill which instantly makes the plot gun almost entirely obsolete. You can (among other things) [spoiler]tear chunks of concrete straight out of the walls[/spoiler] to pummel enemies with! But don't dare think you can [spoiler]lift boxes with a slightly bigger volume than others objects[/spoiler] until you've upgraded that ability extensively.
Fight off spawning legions of the in-house army/security team that has been turned into [spoiler]glowing red, inter-dimensional sound zombies.[/spoiler] And be on the look out for those increasingly [spoiler]mutilated enemies with added force fields, flight, telekinesis and invisibility[/spoiler] to make their bullet-sponginess more annoying.
Be on the look out for low effort 1st draft SCP objects, [spoiler]some give you access to more powers[/spoiler], occasionally having to backtrack to reach them after hitting a certain point in the story-line.
Lining up your reticle for the perfect ranged attack on an enemy while walking into a new area? No you're not, because [h1]AREA NAME TAKING UP THE WHOLE SCREEN FOR A FEW SECONDS[/h1]
Basque in the glow of ""amazing physics"" causing items to crumble or blast off if you so much as touch them, or occasionally if you even touch something adjacent to them.
Perhaps some well crafted puzzles are more your speed? Well don't worry, all the answers will either be right in view when you're solving it, right next to you just before solving it, or you'll be treated to an NPC barking ""hints"" every 10 seconds.
Enjoy the single jump animation, and how plain ridiculous trying to jump towards a ledge that allows you to grab onto it can be!
Take a break from that excitement to witness face animations that make it seem like almost everyone has recently recovered from a stroke, and be on the look out the occasional flutter of cross-eyed closeups!
And to top it all off, be aware of the floor and air in case they suddenly become deadly.

[u] STORY: [/u]
 [spoiler]You play as Jesse Faden. A self doubting, unexplainedly overpowered protagonist with an internal dialogue that doesn't know when to stop stating the obvious. Having selflessly spent all of her life hunting down the clandestine government organisation which kidnapping her younger brother when they were both children, Jesse spends a whole 10 minutes infiltrating their headquarters before becoming the 'Director' of the entire organisation. Surely there's a moral struggle or some assertive fightback against this decision? Of course not, instead she just goes along with it because apparently an ability to say ""No"" would derail the plot.
After that, enjoy being told by a series of passive-aggressive NPCs that the sprawling half baked Government version of a mashup between Infinite IKEA and the Backrooms is in serious need of repair, and then every single time willingly offer up yourself to single-handedly take on this task. Because maybe they're actually your friends all of a sudden?[/spoiler]",1665696085,1665721594,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Old Review 1:
The game is still meh. I've warmed up to it enough to at least want to beat it now at some point. I'll be taking my sweet time though as I can only play for what seems like about an hour or so at a time before I get bored with it. As for getting the game... I expect you to make up your own damn mind. Because at the end of the day you'll do want you want anyway. Who cares what I got to say about it or how I feel, etc. Think for yourself.

Old Review 0:
Nope. Everything about this game is trash. The only thing going for it is the telekinetic mechanics, and the interactive environment; as they're simply just fun to play around with. Add a goddamn compass or something to prevent players from wondering around for hours circle jerking trying to find a single mission location. I only paid $11 for this game, and I still feel like I wasted my money. Oh... did I mention - ADD A COMPASS (it can be a toggle on/off at the very least). It's not hard nor challenging... It's simply annoying, and utterly inconvenient playing blind with the same annoying enemy spawns, junk gun mechanics with a shit map UI that's literally worthless, and creates more confusion than it helps. I wanted to like this game, but I can't enjoy playing a game so blindly wasting so much time quite literally circle jerking myself into frustration trying to find a simple mission location. This game lacks sense of direction... Which I guess is what the developers were aiming for(?)... Oh well... Don't get me wrong - I love exploring every bit of a game, and doing all I can, but feeling lost when wanting to continue on with the objective is simply frustrating after a while; dealing with the same enemy spawns, etc. As I say ""Those who snoop find the loot"". I'll try to stomach my way through this game since I now own it. If I wanted to play a game with no compass or some form of a real time waypoint - I'd just play Morrowind... Which I beat that game in roughly 150 hours with no help or guides my very first play through (of course I only beat the main story, and maybe did a few side quest)... And that's saying something getting frustrated with this game. This game is mindlessly confusing for no reason accept to drag a short game out... And that's my conclusion only 15 hours into the game. Well played developers - well played. What a hoot. Last thing... I play games to have fun - not to make chores out of them; my everyday life is stressful enough as it is. That's where this game ultimately fails in my personal opinion... It feels more like an incoherent chore than a game.

Let's say that the unraveling of everything that's happened is being presented in the most perfect way. There are only few cutscenes and just some dialogue with other characters kept to the essential. But most of the time you will gather letters or find audio tapes. The best part - in my personal taste - are video tapes you come across with pristine live action content. All that combined with believable characters, probably motion captured facial emotions and a straightforward story being told makes that aspect whole for me. There are also some profound ""specialties"" within the game's realm supporting the story's frame you will come to love - these are basically objectives on the side put in a believable, relevant context to further build a foundation on what's really going on.

Other than the neat tale you are being told and a part of, there's combat. Yes. I wouldn't classify the game as a mere third person shooter, since you get to have some outerworldly abilities. For example, remember Half-Life's gravity gun? Let's say your body can do what this utility brought to you. There are more ""classics"" you'll be able to acquire during your gameplay. Again, I don't want to spoil too much, just look forward to become a capable angel of death. Your gained skills can also be developed via a skill tree, which is what you already know from many other games. There is nothing surprising, but it serves its purpose and you can decide in a limited way what to focus on.
Besides those superpowers you are able to be equipped with a couple of different guns - just to get back to the 3rd person shooter aspect of combat. You are able to upgrade these weapons also buffing them with up to three modifications per gun and at a time. These and also character mods can be gathered from killing enemies or looting caches.
[b] NOTE: there is no exaggerated focus on looting - it is something that happens on the side. [/b]
The enemies you encounter are coming at you in a decent amount of variations. Floating ones, ground troops, some shoot certain explosives at you or they have shields of different types - also ""weird"" ones. Be surprised, I guess.

The game plays fluently on 60 fps - I only experience dips for some reason when opening/closing the map and game menue. The game automatically reduces its fps to 30 within the menue. Why the map is laggy, I have no explanation. What really annoyed me was figuring out that I always have to close the ""Nahimic"" audio service, since that conflicts with the game and hinders it from booting up.
Sometimes during combat, there is just so much going on that you have to absolutely focus on one thing and one thing only to make out anything. That is a rare circumstance, but you will notice it. 
[b] Also, I wouldn't recommend the game to people suffering from epilepsy, since there are many flash patterns and rapid picture changes - during combat or dialogue, respectively. [/b]
I took my time and am nearing the end game now, I assume. What bothers me is that the game suddenly started to crash. It did not do that for 15 hours, but the last two hours it started doing it. Not sure what is going on, but it is a fact I do not want to leave unmentioned. 
Sometimes, navigating with the ""help"" of the map is a real pain in the arsicle. This is because the map shows ALL the floor levels at the same time, only they have different shades. I assume this is a design choice, which I do not condone. You will manage to find your way, and in return you will get a headache. 

These are just little annoyances, nothing big. The game is absolutely fun and it will keep you captivated for its thrilling history it has to tell - I wanna go as far as to say that it is poking fun at a known institution. Again, being vague for your benefit.

The setting is fresh, the amazing world and the atmosphere that it creates along with the audio and visual effects make for a truly immersive experience.

I personally loved the story and its bold approach.

My Opinion And Thoughts:

LOVE this game. It deserves more awards. Everything you want in a video game. The story is great and explains enough so you don't have a clear picture but enough to understand almost completely. A lot of quality of life mechanics are there(It feels like the game reads your mind). The theme is spot on! The game explains all the video game mechanics in clever ways. The way you and the enemy's evolve is great. The game adapts to your play style and helps to improve your play style without feeling like your being talked down too. The graphics are amazing, The game looks good and runs good(even without RTX). 

Over all:
Amazing game. Heavy(and I mean HEAVY) recommend.",1656524748,1665520095,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I found that the story got increasingly worse as it went on, after starting with so much potential and promise. The tone did a complete inversion around halfway through and after the game and the DLC it's more like Futurama. It became clear that they were becoming more and more like SCP and couldn't help themselves from employing Reddit-tier comedy, to the point where the Board is cracking wise. Also, Faden's internal narration didn't really add anything, and at key points pulled the player right on out of it. Like her saying ""that was awesome!"" after the Ashtray maze fight with the awful quirky metal theme song. That's a story way too in love with itself, and there's a lot of that near the end and it practically ruins the Foundation DLC.

You can just find a way to tell the story without having her have to react after reacting with a zoom on her eyes, especially since none of it is crucial to moving the plot forward. ""But then what about Polaris?"" literally just write out Polaris, there's so much glaring bullshit in here that didn't need to be if you're gonna stumble through the ending the way the game did. There's simply too much grafted on with loredump collectibles and questions introduced for I assume some sequel. You could have at least done something big with the janitor, anything to wrap something up other than an extremely hamfisted story of a girl that for some reason doesn't want to be a leader (never explained) who by the end just decides she has what it takes because she has powers (no other emotional or character change occurs.)
Also you can't spend so much dialogue with that whole girlboss ""we're gonna do it OUR WAY not like those old stuffy men!"" when you spend literally no time at all showing how anything is being done differently, or how it was particularly done poorly before (Pope is no different than Darling, but I guess she's just so peppy it's okay.) 

Other than that the game is great. I would still recommend it just based on the gameplay and the swings it takes. But once again, by the end it became very clear that the game assets were being reused again and again. With the exception of some places like the Black Rock Quarry and the Astral Plane (both pretty constrained) it's all the same hallways and office equipment. Early in the Executive Wing things seemed to have more thought put into the design, but again midway through everything takes a real dip in quality and we're seeing the same stuff again and again.

Only for the reasons of constant crashes (to desktop) being experienced throughout my play-through, and particularly on the last mission. The Nvidia driver version was only a few months old, released in 2022. Thankfully, updating to the very latest drivers (October 2022) resolved the last mission crashes.

Control is AAA gaming polished to it's finest. The Story is a compelling mixture of science fiction and paranormal rooted in our world, dripping with atmosphere and keeping you guessing all the way through. 

The gameplay offers an expansive set of environments to traverse, with multi-layered access points and a tinge of metroidvania exploration opportunities. There is plenty of side-quest content and a skill tree to unlock, crafting system to get to grips with, and upgrades and collectibles-galore. These are all big-budget AAA  tropes though, even when executed this well. At times, the game's pacing can be off and if you don't like the loop then it will get a little boring by the end because you rinse-repeat the same approach to combat and exploration encounters. 

Having said that, I believe Control represents a true paradigm shift in terms of how well put together it is - the production values are so high, the acting and mo-cap is next-level, and the environmental destruction is something to behold. There are unique gameplay moments here which have not been replicated elsewhere, and some mind-bending to go along with it (think Chris Nolan, Inception). And let's not forget the RT graphics, which are stupendously good. Even with RT off, this game looks great. 

Control deserves every bit of praise it gets. I wouldn't rate it as one of the best of all time, but certainly in the last few years, this is one of the highest profile gaming experiences you will get.

Control is one of the best games I have ever played. It sits somewhere among Spider-Man (2018), Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto IV, Half-Life: Alyx, and the 2010s Tomb Raider trilogy. I consider (almost) all these games platinum standards in different aspects of game design.

THE GOOD

What Control excels at is lore and world building. I don't enjoy fantasy settings much. However, I love stories that sit in richly designed worlds. I feel there aren't too many games set in realities close enough to ours, while also embellishing it with creative layers of fiction. Control sets such a high bar in this area, I really hope that their planned sequel is able to live up to it. This isn't surprising coming from the folks behind Alan Wake. Control is miles better. I can also confirm Control is significantly better than Quantum Break, which *was* fun and creative in its own way. I digress.

I may be coming across as a lore hound who hunts down every scrap of paper in games. This is not true. I'm a skimmer. And I really appreciated how Control catered to me. This game is chock full of documents and collectibles. I'd even say they're half the fun of the game. What I really like is how easy each collectible is to comprehend. Since the game is set in more-or-less-the-real-world, people don't write (or talk) like Vikings, so the collectibles tend to be straighforwardly written, requiring just enough brain power to comprehend to not get tiring. On top of that, most of them are short pieces of text. If they were any longer, I'd have lost interest. Instead, I found myself scavenging every corner of the game's setting to connect the various collectibles stories together like Mail Room Charlie. The writing is immensely clever and more engaging than many bestselling thriller novels I've read.

The world that Control creates reminds me of Men in Black, but less funny. They're similar in that both stories add layers upon layers to the reality we know while coming up with satisfying explanations for why these layers are hidden away from us in our day-to-day. Think: Neuralyzers in MiB.

While the lore is what made Control really memorable to me, it packs many more punches. Gameplay is stellar. Control is a metroidvania-style open world game. I didn't know this when I hit play on day 1, and was taken aback by this. I didn't think I would end up enjoying it as much as other people seemed to. As I said, I'm all about linear games. However, the raw gameplay mechanics Remedy have constructed are laid out perfectly throughout the map. Control fosters intrinsic motivation for random exploration and re-treading the same locations. Unlocking new areas is well paced. Going back to the same locations spawns random new waves of enemies each time, keeping exploration somewhat fresh, even after you've collected all collectibles. Traversing the map outside of missions never got frustrating or tiring either. There is *no* ammo management (love it!), there's a pretty good fast travel system, and it's generally easy to disengage from combat, regen health and book it if you prefer.

Oh and the art direction. Control looks unique. The architecture, symbolism, BOLD color choices throughout, are superb. I can't praise it enough. When I first saw footage of this game, I didn't take it to be a graphically demanding or *pretty* title. Boy, was I wrong. If you're a fidelity-hungry player, you won't be disappointed. The game's beautiful, and even more so with raytracing on. For the amount of eye-candy RT adds to this game (I played nearly maxed out, and tried turning it off to compare), I was surprised with how well it performed at 1440p on my RTX 2070 + Ryzen 2600X combo. DLSS helped a ton. Environment destruction is some of the best I've ever seen. I also enjoy returning to the same locations to see them destroyed in all new simulations in the course of new firefights. To cap it off, there's a reasonable in-universe headcanon explanation for this.

Ultimate Edition includes both DLC chapters (as a patient gamer, very appreciated!), and they meet the rest of the game's high quality bar. The two chapters are set in their own map expansions, like earlier chapters in the game. They become available as the story progresses, and are astonishingly well-integrated into the narrative. I recommend playing AWE first, Foundation second. I also recommend playing Alan Wake before AWE. Thank me later.

THE BAD (but not really)

There aren't many things about this game that I can critique. It's close to being an all-rounder.

Actually there's one thing, and it's really a nitpick. The acting felt a bit distant at times. I couldn't tell if there was a disconnect between the actors' performances and the in-game characters, if it was in the timing of line delivery, or just the writing. There's also an uncanniness to facial expressions throughout this game.

Jesse also has this habit of speaking to herself, which has some bearing on the story. Near the start of the game, I was confused about her personality. It almost felt like the main character was being the comic relief in an otherwise grim and sinister game. Perhaps it was that first impression that threw me off on the acting in this game overall. It grew on me eventually, and I realized that Control wasn't intended to be a 100% *serious* game. It makes some room for levity, and it does so pretty well.

OH there's another thing, and this one's really bad. There's a late-game boss fight in a large room that contains a huge boulder in the center. When you get to that location, know that you'll be facing the full wrath of whatever Remedy employees decided to include this fight in the game. I died in that boss fight more times than the entire rest of the game combined. I'm 90% sure of this.

So there.

THE CONCLUSION

Control gets a big thumbs up from me to anyone who enjoys immersive story-driven games. 

VERY important note: This game is not very scary. It may look all dark and horror-y but for the most part, it really isn't. The AWE DLC chapter is a bit darker, with some areas that feel stressful if you're prone to it. I don't remember any jump scares really *getting* me. I don't think the game attempted more than 1 or 2 of them in my entire ~50-ish hour completionist play through. Helpfully, Control also includes some trainer-like settings to tune the difficulty to your liking if you really want to.

So please don't be discouraged by the game's genre. You will miss out on a masterpiece of the 2010s.",1664868320,1664868601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oh, the devs put on that Control had a pastiche of influences, and I’ll acknowledge that X-Files, MIB, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer all have some presence here. But you cannot in good faith pretend that you didn’t rip the vast majority of your game directly from the SCP Foundation.

The theft is blindingly obvious. The documentation format is identical. Control has HRAs, SCP has SRAs. “Secret organization dedicated to locking down consensus reality” is the exact same narrative as the SCP Foundation. The ‘Federal Bureau of Control' is the Unusual Incidents Unit with a pretty coat of paint. To any fan of SCPs, it's rather egregious and utterly inescapable throughout.

I went looking for interviews with representatives of both IPs to get their takes on the similarities. The SCP Foundation’s public take is that Control is a ‘homage’, and that Remedy have stayed on this side of legal with their creation. Good on them, classy response. 

Remedy’s take was deplorable. “Oh, well, lots of people contribute to writing SCPs, and the canon is so varied, so who’s to say if we really stole anything? It was just an influence. Anyway, they focus on ‘secure, contain, protect’ and we focus on ‘control’ so really we’re totally different. Why are you being so myopic?” 

Frankly, I find this attitude insulting. It isn’t myopic to point out that you’re coasting on years of other people’s work without crediting them appropriately.

As for the game itself…well, it's a Remedy game, so the narrative is too busy huffing its own farts to worry about actually being good. Excellent visuals aren't a substitute for clear storytelling, a lesson that wasn't learned from Alan Wake.
 
Twist my arm and I'll admit that gunplay is fine, level design exceptional, combat fairly well tuned. There are some selling points here, but ultimately, none of them matter.

I like the concept; an SCP-like organisation that gathers, catalogues, and studies anomalous objects suddenly thrown into a lockdown due to an unknown entity. Combat just doesn't feel as engaging as I would like it to be. Maybe late-game you get to be a telekinetic badass but I find the enemy scaling - even in areas you have already visited at lower levels to be an odd choice to show off the new abilities.

Bosses are okay, but are mostly damage sponges whilst you avoid 1-2 shot kills. Nothing we haven't all seen before.

Having loads of optional collectables that add to the lore of the world in an organic way is a brilliant idea and fits the theme of this game perfectly.

Pros:
-Art design that will have you stopping in every room to admire and take it all in
-Interesting and varied enemy designs
-Lots of collectibles and secret areas
-Combat progression and weapon upgrades are rewarding
-The few memorable/like-able characters really steal the show (Darling, Langston, Ahti the Janitor) 
-There are so many funny stories behind the Altered Items and Objects of Power

Cons:
-Excess dialogue and exposition, especially in the first hours of the game
-Jesse's inner monologue that literally tries to tell the player what to think
-Second play-through feels too easy 

Everybody should play this game at least once, because it really is incredible. Just take the time to read every collectible to really get the most out of 'Control'. ALSO, play the DLC content as soon as you're presented the opportunity before you're too overpowered.

Heavily reminiscent of SCP, although not quite as dark. Overall, this game is very good but it has some issues. The first half of the game is extremely interesting and very good. The gameplay continues to evolve in fun ways until close to the end and manages to stay fresh. The end of the narrative was a bit disappointing but that's largely due to how strong the first half of it was. The game leaves some loose ends but honestly given the setting and lore I was surprised there wasn't more left up to the imagination, and some of the late reveals are too predictable. This game also has some bloat issues with a few uninteresting side quests and annoying random fights when re-exploring areas previously visited. The game has a crafting/loot system which does nothing but slow down the game and add a ton of menuing to equip slightly better stuff. This whole system could be removed and the game would be better for it.

Despite the writing, Control is actually pretty okay as a flashy, challenging third person shooter you could blow through in a single weekend. Floating and throwing stuff around made me nostalgic for inFAMOUS's combat.

Still, there are better single player shooters from this era, and I'm taking points off because the game frequently uses a strobe light effect that can harm photosensitive players, with no option to turn this effect off. Accessibility is important!

⭕ - Conclusion -:
Control is an interesting idea for a game which takes place in one setting. The only issue is the repetitive nature of the setting and gameplay. The story is interesting and complex but can be hard to follow at times as a result of the complexity. The game is definitely worth playing due to its unique combat and an overall unique experience.",1663896571,1663896571,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The dialog within this mission is the funniest I've ever heard in a game.

The gameplay mechanics take a little getting used too at first, but once you get the hang of how the different abilities operate, fighting, defending, and parkour gets much easier. Another masterpiece is the service weapon. A modular weapon with different modifications you can use to improve performance, efficiency, and damage of the select version is a really cool idea and works wonderfully in practice.

The story is not incredible or really something that would cause an itch to know more and more until you reach the very end. Overall not an exciting story that leaves you with a remark and you remember it your whole life.

The mechanics and gameplay is very thought through, they have made sure the mods and weapons align and connect with different play styles and chaining combos is also easier. Although I'm not sure why they didn't made this game a but more ruthless and more survival orientated.

The reason it says I only have like 0.2 hours is because I originally got this game for free a while back on the Epic Games store and played through it there first. I loved the game so much that I decided I wanted to buy it on steam so I could leave a review while also supporting the devs.

This game is amazing! 

The amount that the environment is destructible is what first got me. I sat there for at least a half an hour at the very start of the game just shooting at random things to watch them break apart. When I first noticed this was with a big meeting room table I decided to shoot, It broke apart into individual sections of wood where I shot at it and the metal frame also broke apart where I wanted it to as well. The wood parts splinter and the metal parts snap and break apart, all on the same object. I was loving it! My gosh the devs must've put in a ton of work in on that feature alone to get it break apart how you might expect it to.

So I should mention a few of the negatives I noticed are that the start of the game is a tad slow before you get more abilities, sometimes the character mouths don't move quite right (others are pretty good tbh), and there are sections of the game that are way too dark or waaaay too bright (I only played through the regular edition though, so maybe they fixed that stuff in this version), but that was basically the only bad things I have to say about this game. Everything else is fantastic!

The graphics look pretty amazing, the animations (apart from some of the mouths) are really good and flow really well from one to another, no bugs that I could detect, the combat is smooth and feels really good, the abilities are a lot of fun and make you feel really cool, the enemies feel pretty balanced and are fun to fight, the story is AMAZING (holy sh*t the story was exactly what I wanted from this game. Gave me chills! I love shows and games that make me theorize about what I think is going on while I'm in the middle of them, that sort of stuff is so much fun for me and they more than delivered! I loved all the redacted stuff!), and the game managed to keep me slightly creeped out throughout the entire game even long after I thought I had gotten used to what the game and environment could throw at me. I don't know if that just means I get creeped out easily or something, but who cares, I think they did a fantastic job on the aesthetics and overall feel of the game! It has a great vibe! The world also felt really fleshed out even though the entire game takes place inside one building.

This is is one of my new favorite games, I absolutely love it! Reminds me why I love videogames, so I thank the devs for their amazing work on what I should only describe as pure art! 

The game itself isn't super long (I had around 30 hours my first playthrough, but it seems most people finish the game in like 10-15 hours according to the internet?), but I definitely recommend playing it. The game deserves way more love, fame, and recognition in my opinion.

The good; Control has an amazing story, great voice acting, a mysterious  setting, and is filled with memorable characters. Care was taken to make the characters unique and to give presence to the enemies as a very real threat. You feel like a powerhouse, if a bit of a glass cannon.
The bad; Poor boss balance with numerous cheap one shot mechanics and an inventory management and upgrade system that felt more like it held back the game.
You get several different forms of your primary armament, the Service Weapon, but are only able to have two out. Each form draw from a pool of slotted upgrades that only effect the numbers and don't do much for build diversity.

There were very few times i felt genuinely challenged, rather it was something of a action-adventure romper-stomper... it left you feeling powerful and good.

   The music and sound are really good, and I genuinely enjoyed the plot. The setting is also excellent it combines the best attributes of, say, Men In Black, the SCP foundation, and X-files. I really love this setting and I really wish there was more. I sincerely hope Project Heron is a success, and they will be willing to release to Steam platform and not just epic games. 

  I also really liked the main character. My only complaint is that they gendered Polaris- I personally think it would have been cooler if they left Polaris as an It so we could fill ourselves in the blank and it would have been an effective breaking of the Fourth Wall, allowing for each individual player to be ""Her,"" but ultimately this is a minor complaint. I still enjoyed all the 4th wall breaks, and there are loads of easter eggs which is very cool. I found all the character sympathetic and like-able in their own ways, or dislike-able for good reasons. The puzzles were fun and not too difficult- even a dunce like me could figure them out and I only had to break out the pen and paper once. But it always felt good to figure it out on my own.

   The powers are really well implemented, I liked that each was unique and useful, though I depended overly on the Launch power- none of the others really compared. Maybe next playthrough (which I am greatly looking forward to doing) I will limit myself. 

   I love the mystery and how many things remain unresolved or concrete so we can create our own lore/narrative. That was the right choice.

  Eagerly anticipating the sequel, and looking forward to diving into the DLC next (though I have read some lack luster reviews, I will temper my expectations and still find enjoyment). Good work Remedy, big fan of Max Payne 1 and 2, and its good to see the ol' team still got it.

The gameplay takes a while to take off, but after a generally boring first few hours, new abilities and weapons start coming in a steady stream together with the story picking up intensity. Each combat upgrade (ability and weapon) shakes it up quite a bit. Once you gather them all? The game becomes one of the best action-adventure games with real powerful combat. Basically imagine Star Wars but better + phenomenal gunplay. Sounds epic right? Because it is.

The story, characters and lore are so deliciously written. Some things can go over your head if you're not immersed enough. The devs made sure that you are, though. The atmosphere, art, graphics and even the ""miscellaneous"" docs you can pick up and optionally read are masterfully crafted, and fill in the world real nice. It all hits ESPECIALLY hard if you're an SCP fan or generally of horror and secret labs and that good stuff.

It even has its touch of quirk and humor which really got me smiling/laughing at times. The MC even inspired me while playing it. That's how you know you're playing something great.

The Bad: I'm never a fan of punishing players when they die - I mean, if someone is dying then why would you make it harder for them to improve themselves/their equipment - which this game does. That Hartman boss creature was downright obnoxious - I lost way too much source on that. Unfortunately, I had been saving up for something when I started that fight and it takes a percentage of your total source when you die... so I lost a lot. And worse, you're supposed to be able to take a ranger in with you, but he kept just standing at the back of the room not helping, so getting Hartman down to that final sliver of life and then dying before you can finish him off is all the more infuriating. And that's after a ridiculously long side mission that was nowhere near as cool as it seemed like it was going to be. It was surprisingly uninteresting, which was unlike most of the rest of the game.

Also Ahti is the best character in the game, because why not.

Partially this is because of the obscurity of the lore and timeline of events, but it's also because it's actually got a lot of content (muuuch of which feels unnecessary - see stupid fetch side quests for single player game). Because this game requires more than a day of play, some of the gameplay elements break down and become something horribly undesirable rather than engaging.

Here's the biggest thing: the map. The map is awful. It's just straight up bad. There's absolutely nothing on it for you as a player to engage with usefully. There aren't quest markers. Not a bad thing! In fact, it's refreshing playing a game where you have to do some digging and exploring, especially with a map as a companion so you don't get lost in a maze of hallways and unmarked locked doors. But you can't engage with the map. You can't mark it yourself, there are ZERO labels for proper orientation with respect to quests. So what does this mean? This means that if you're an eclectic gamer like me (I often bounce between many different games during any given week), taking a break from this game makes you come back confused and lost. I literally have spent probably 30% of my time in the game just fiddling with the map, quests, and my orientation and repetitive exploration. This is bad. It means that the devs made a design choice that has functionally failed.

I'll probably finish it sometime in the future. The game is very beautiful, the combat is really fun and the variety of engagements keeps you from getting too bored. But geez.

By progressing through the story, Jessie (the main character) gains more and more abilities, which keep the gameplay dynamic and fresh, you can launch and smash, fly and dash and if needed be shielded for getting a breather. 
Story is a bit detached from reality as we experience it. The orderly, mundane environment of the Old House, which reminds of a regular corporate building, is like a juxtaposition to events somewhere between magic and sci-fi. It is certainly a narrative, which unfolds slowly bit by bit.

Control is a psychological thrill ride that does well in making you feel unsettled. The environment you’re in, as in the massive governmental building’s appearance, is unassuming. This design choice was cleverly part of the visual lie you are told because the entire complex is riddled with extraordinary phenomena.

The bland blank concrete walls, the almost endless hallways and photos of your boss hanging on every wall makes you think you’re in a real boring place. But when you’re bombarded by what appears to be spirits in human form, the mundane scenery quickly changes to frightening engagements.

You’re able to use a variety of weaponry that you will be able to upgrade as you progress, which is standard fare in these types of games. You’ll be able to fast travel locations as you make your way throughout the massive building, which makes backtracking convenient.

The story makes minor twist and turns that are welcome surprises and the game constantly makes you think there is more to discover. With this thought in mind, wandering around aimlessly, doesn’t necessarily seem to be “aimless” after all.

For as many abilities Jesse wields, controls never get clunky. They're as fluid as the physics in the game. I never got tired of dashing and levitating around a group of enemies and summoning objects and pieces of wall from everywhere around me to defeat hordes of manifesting enemies.

If I had to imagine what went on at Remedy's team when they were making this game, I figure that they were focused on:

20% story
10% gameplay
70% visual style stuff

I got the game because it looked freaking amazing, intriguing. The giant black pyramid in the void, the idea of flinging stuff at 4000005 km/h... Went all in the bin as soon as I played this trainwreck.
First of all, the checkpoint system is atrocious! If you died in point A wile your save point is in point B, which is FAR away, enjoy going all the way back to point A, dumbass!
So I got my ass handed to me at the start of the game, so I thought ""Fine, I'll turn down the difficulty-"" THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY SETTING! WHY?! I later figured out why, about 10 hours in: The game kicks your ass, so that when you grinded enough and progressed enough, you can deal with engagements better. That being said, your pistol is a last resort weapon and sucks ass. Because THROWING STUFF is clearly the more superior alternative... the combat gets quickly boring, and if you try to change it up and use the pistol more, you get frustrated because you are not doing what is effective. 
Also that Alan Wake whatever-the-hell mission was total bull and whoever came up with this mission should be ashamed.

Now, I talk a lot of smack about the game, but it does have its moments, some of the audio logs are funny, it's funny to see those videos that explain the oops or whatever the hell, but the story was just so lackluster and whatever... Like, at some point you just go ""Errr yeah demons portal object portal throw yeet funny scientist men"".
The ending was trash, and I refuse to play the DLC for this game. Remedy Entertainment? More like Remedy this game and throw yourself in the trash!

But then it picked up steam incredibly quickly, and from there on out was very well paced. All of the missions are interesting and unravel the story enough to get you more and more invested, and never overstayed their welcome by being too long or something. I tend to focus on story in games, and then go back and wrap up side quests and DLC. Took me roughly 15 hours, but better/more patient gamers will likely shave a couple of hours off of that number. 

It's simply a very well told story, with great actors, great gameplay, and great graphics. Third person action games are my thing, and this one is solidly in my Top 5 games of all time, probably neck and neck with Jedi Fallen Order. Not an accidental comparison - Control made me feel like more of a Jedi than JFO did. The combat is very, very satisfying. It's difficult enough to force you to make some decisions on your approach, and the game gives you plenty of customization options to tune that approach to your liking. Plenty of gun options and ability options, and then modifiers, to affect your combat outcomes.

In short, it was a very fun game, and when I finished it, I immediately found myself in that post-great-game-lull; that sort of empty feeling once you're done with a game, know you can't experience it fresh again, and have to move on to something else. It'll be a while before I find that something else.

If I had paid full price for this game, I would've been satisfied. It's often on sale, and it's absolutely worth the sale price.

It feels like an open world game despite taking place within the confines of the Federal Bureau of control. The FBC is inside the Oldest House, a shifting endless structure that feels alive with intention. The powers Jesse obtains throughout the game are pretty rad including: levitation, telekinesis and many more. 

Honestly this game can be difficult at times, not a throw your controller at the TV difficult but definitely challenging at times.

Now I've never played any Alan Wake game ever (nor even heard of Alan Wake until this game) and that did not detract from the experience at all.

It feels like we are truly just one slice, one story, occurring in this world full of the para natural. It feels like an homage to the SCP Wiki and other adjacent styles of horror/writing. A constant narrative theme also keeps the story so neatly packed together that its easy to follow along especially with the tons and tons of lore tidbits to collect.

Guys that aren't into women who wear makeup either because it makes them look like clowns or is oppressive some kind of way? Women have breasts, it's what makes us mammals.

+ great graphics and art style
+ great combat mechanics
+ great level design and exploration, especially later on
+ Decent and good story, told in a smart way, but one with which I failed to emotionally connect. But it was good enough on an intellectual level. Thankfully the amazingly imaginative side missions all make up for this
- some unbalanced fights


Overall, Control might be my favorite Remedy game. It's fantastic in terms of gameplay, combat and exploration. Great level design, with some amazingly imaginative architecturally impossible levels. The only part where it's good, but not really excellent is maybe the story. And not in the intellectual sense, since it's a pretty smart story, or at least told in a smart way; but unfortunately I didn't connect very much emotionally with Jesse's plot. But aside from the main plot, it's also got plenty of side missions, which again are very imaginative, fun and just plain cool. 

Graphically and in terms of art direction it is absolutely stunning. Especially the lighting in many of the levels, combined with the brutalist architecture that's taken to impossible dimensions, often just makes everything seem like one of those physically-impossible perspective illusions. They artists obviously have had loads of fun creating these levels. And they're just as fun to explore, as I constantly had a grin on my face while seeing what else they came up with.

Combat is probably the most dialed-in and tightly animated of all Remedy games. You also have plenty of ways to build your character's abilities, and they even managed to insert some randomly generated loot that contribute to your character's identity in terms of abilities. This all together with the amazing physics engine they have and it turns most fights into chaotically fun dances of death. A lot of the abilities are derivative of jedi powers, but they're done so much better than any game that there really is no comparison. Everything just so tightly comes together, with yourself and enemies also levitating, and you throwing pieces of concrete or marble at enemies; it's all a serious blast.

Exploration is also very nicely done, with loads of hidden areas, and once you unlock the levitate ability exploration unlocks on a whole new level, with plenty of areas that were beyond access before, suddenly come into play. It was so fun, that I went through the whole game once over after getting levitation. And there's plenty other hidden secrets that I don't think I would've found had I not ultimately also used a guide for anything I missed on my own. 

Besides the main plot which is intriguing enough and delivered pretty intelligently, there's also a lot of side missions that are just a blast. From imaginative stuff that feel like they are heavily inspired by tv-series like The Twilight Zone, to things I'm not sure where they came up with. The game is just full of little surprises, and often from the most insignificant-looking missions. 

The two expansions, Foundation and AWE, do a decent job of giving you more of the same, with Foundation especially having two very cool and smart missions, that again managed to have me grinning. AWE, which is a tie-in to the Alan Wake universe, is the one I'd been expecting the most, since I'm a big fan of that game. And sadly that's the one that kind of dissapoints the most. It can't all be due to expectations, but it does feel like just a giant tease for Alan Wake 2, which Remedy have announced. I mean, the bulk of the expansion, you have almost no tie-in to Alan Wake himself, throughout the expansion; expect for some reports that you find, plus the element of darkness (which I'm glad they did not go overboard with). And a particular foe that you keep chasing. Alan Wake himself only has 2-3 short moments, which add to the mystery, but it all feels very superficial. I mean, to not be so negative on it, it's decently enough, but I certainly expected more. As I said, more of a tease for Alan Wake 2.

The only truly negative parts about Control is that for some reason 2-3 boss fights felt incredible unbalanced. Two of them could be explained to my character build (plus these fights were also done in environments where you easily die by falling off into the void), especially since I hear others did not have the same difficulty. But the last fight of the Foundation expansion, one where I'm certain I went in overpowered to hell and back, having unlocked 95% of all existing skills, having max and regen health buffed, and I was not able to finish it without cheesing it. This is also due to the way they implemented the health system, where most of the time you only regen health by diving back into the fray. So, it forces you to gamble with your character's life. And this has worked decently most of the time, but in certain fights it has proven to be more than I can handle. Suffice it to say, I was really happy they took a different approach to the AWE boss fight.

Anyway, I guess that's about it. My score would be a 9/10.",1661198586,1661198586,True,7,1,0.585845053195953369,3,True,False,False

The unique world crafted by Remedy fascinated me from beginning to end. The map (while intentionally confusing) takes a refreshing departure from the AAA standard of handholding markers and incessant tips in favour of a more organic approach to exploration and discovery.

World building comes in the form of documents, tapes, and stylish expositional videos. While some may find this approach tiresome in many games (believe me I also groan at story-collectibles), the content of these items kept me invested and coming back to read up more. The world building is well-written, diverse, and most of all, interesting!

Control knocks destruction out the park. The game features near fully-destructible, physics-based environments where your abilities all feel grounded. Unleash your telekinetic powers on paranormal enemies in a maelstrom of concrete, furniture, and anything else that isn't robustly nailed down.

Beyond the delightful destruction, Control is a feast for the eyes. Ray traced reflections (opaque and transparent), global illumination, and diffused lighting provide a movie-quality experience while DLSS keeps your frame rate at a (reasonably) acceptable level.

Still haven't decided? This game was so good that after it arrived on Steam (having initially received the product for free on Epic Games), I repurchased the game and played through the entire thing again, plus the DLC (which comes bundled with the ultimate edition).

In the subject matter is also very good, this kind of SCP-like strange talk form I like very much.
My favorite thing is the combat system, the ability to float in the air and use super powers to control objects and attack enemies,it hit me in the heart. That's what I do in my dreams every night! Now I can finally put it into practice in a game!
I love jessy very much,hope I can still see her in the next series and look forward to experiencing more things with her.",1661006813,1661007024,True,3,0,0.486982345581054688,0,True,False,False
870780,120925796,76561198155383532,254,18,1112,0,1112,1660952255,"After finishing Control, I hardly know much more than when I was looking at the store page. Even some positive reviews don’t understand what’s happened in the story, yet call it “excellent”. All I’m left with is some hard disappointment, the fundamental aspects of the game drag it below the bar to which I can recommend. So I want to chime in with my review, the game has a very strong sense of atmosphere and graphically, looks incredibly polished. The world and abilities all seemed so promising, but it holds little water. 

First thing brought up is the sheer volume of documents it throws at the player. Most, if not all, documents are partly censored, a lot of them being completely irrelevant. I understand this all a part of the world and atmosphere the game is trying to present: blending the bureaucratic with the unknown ala SCP style. Creating a game under this premise holds an enormous amount of potential, which the game delivers on a bit. Several ‘Objects of Power’ provide the player with new abilities after completing their segments, some of which leading to full-on boss fights. It boasts a large labyrinthian map that morphs and opens up extra, secret passages. Even your gun is one of these abnormal objects. The issue with this document vomit is they censor out all the interesting words, making it hard to follow. It comes across they do this largely to keep it vague for mystery's sake rather than provide any substance to the player. In fact, it doubles down by having an NPC mention the whole facility is based in confidentiality, even from its workers. How am I supposed to believe this facility can even operate if every worker is left in the dark as much as we are, I call BS here. This isn’t delivered with the theme of growing insight and madness that comes with it, in fact, worker psychology is completely tossed out of this world. It’s probably due to the fact the world doesn’t try to develop anyone except for Jesse as a complete NPC (with the exception of one, maybe). So, what happens here is it tosses the player a bunch of reading with little to no substance to really sink their teeth into, and cardboard cutouts of characters. I can see how people lose interest rather quickly. The whole story revolves around this ‘mystery box’ where things will unravel and make more sense as you go. They don’t, the game just hopes you go along with the madness. 

Jesse wants to find her brother who was taken by the facility when they were young to investigate an “OoP”, while she escaped. Jesse traveled back following this psychic voice? Premonition? Inclination? I’m not sure what it is. For the sake of the review, I’ll refer to it as a plot device, since it really just exists to show the player where to go (as well as provide incredibly insightful inner monologue constantly from Jesse). Unfortunately, this game is chock-full of the modern design of ‘spell everything out for the player in case they were asleep for that sentence’. Don’t you love it when you pick up a key for a door, and instantly your character says “Hey, I bet this key fits that door!”? Jesse’s brother, Dylan, like the rest of these characters is just an empty husk for the evil-tism to reside in. Getting to Dylan and the conflict that would ensue is built up to be the thrilling conclusion, but the game doesn’t develop on this and instead (Spoiler) ends after making your way through more enemy spam, it ends abruptly after that. No arc, no boss fight, no impact. This is such a shame as it’s the turning point for the story to take place, but this game likes to substitute having a story and characters for a vague and cryptic mystery instead. It hardly brings up how he felt abandoned by her outside one line of dialogue, which Jesse doesn’t address, talk about missed opportunity for character building. The final act is so hard to follow and devolves into a confusing mess. The only thing it wants to commit to is that Trench is the one who went to turn on the big evil because he went mad and likes control. Yet, Jesse is immune to this evil that possesses and corrupts, its all because she’s just stronger and awesome-r! Jesse, becomes unimaginably more powerful, is just immune to the concept of how power corrupts just because. Talk about wasted character opportunities, again. So, I think it's safe to label this story as pretty slap-dash and clumsy, while the world does very little to hold it up and keep the player invested.

The gameplay loop leaves much to be desired. Outside of shooting things, the game introduces a few fun mechanics. But the only viable synergy is to throw objects at enemies while your gun refills its ammo. You get the ability to levitate, while fun leaves you wide open until you get the shield, which is just another defensive option from the dash. You also get one converted enemy which is just pitiful. Speaking of enemies, there is a stunning lack of variety. Other than basic foot troops and heavies, there are flying enemies that will always dodge thrown objects, flying creepers, and invisible creepers! Those are as fun as they sound, they cloak and as soon as they get close, blow their load taking off a massive chunk of your health. What about the shooting then? The game boasts a total of 6 modes your gun can be in, but really, 3 different modes. On top of that, you can only have two of them to switch between at a time. With all of this, we get a very dull  loop that players will be tired of before the 4-hour mark. The game actively discourages exploring by constantly spawning enemies on top you or as soon as you enter a room. This is such a juxtaposition given how large and intricate the map is coupled with the weapon & personal mods littered throughout. I want to look around, uncover and understand the facility but the game just keeps spawning enemies every other room, which gets so tiring you’ll just be fast-traveling everywhere since it beats the trouble. It all just ends up feeling like a total chore. The mods to find don’t provide much other than a slight percentage boosts. Nothing that really changes how your weapon operates or how you interact with enemies. Much like the story, Control misses its opportunity to introduce anything new or interesting.

Control really drops the ball on really testing the player in its (few) mechanics it introduces, take for example the puzzles. Good god the puzzles. Other than picking up power cubes and plugging them into their slot on the walls, which are hard to miss since they’re huge, and matching a pattern with solution elsewhere on screen, the game poses only one thing they can call a puzzle. It then spawns an NPC to give the player very obvious hints every 5 seconds, until basically the puzzle has been explained to you. If hints are pokes, these are full-on shoves. The game just outright explains to you what to do, and assumes the player is just a total idiot. The segments where Jesse get transported to the Hotel, I wouldn’t qualify as puzzles, since the player simply interacts with everything in the room to progress. It’s not a puzzle if you could just stumble your way into the solution, it’s padding.  

Control has a really solid foundation, the setting/atmosphere built up is cool as fuck, the abilities are fun, and the map, while a bit confusing, is ripe for exploration and full of mystery. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t have much to offer due to its dull gameplay loop, confusing mess of a story, but looking very pretty. Apparently, all games have to do these days to garner positive reviews is look graphically impressive. In short, this game is all sizzle and no steak. If you just want to shoot things, turn your brain off and just enjoy the spectacle of it, sure, check it out. It’s not bad, but I expected a whole lot more, and just got disappointment. 4/10.",1660979219,1660979219,False,2,0,0.39673498272895813,0,True,False,False

If nothing else, it’s an enjoyable jaunt through a beautiful, destructible environment that lets you be delightfully irresponsible with the office furniture. It also has a some uniquely imaginative moments marked with quirky humour and a charming self-awareness that made me laugh out loud.

But these moments felt too seldom, and the stretches between are plagued by long walks, tacked-on side quests, and unbalanced boss fights, all exacerbated by poorly placed spawn locations that make failure feel like a deliberate penance. These issues eventually became distracting and broke my immersion after the glam of a fun moment had worn off.

Overall, the gap between the good and the bad left me perplexed. Control soars when it leans into the bizarre and winks at you. Yet its dual status as a story-driven sim and an action shooter presents an identity crisis with a palpable tension.

But in all other aspects, my, is it *cool*.

The writing is what really shines in this. From the plot points and pacing through characterization and worldbuilding, to the various lore dump text files you can find. But the acting is excellent too. Especially the side character Dr. Darling, who's, well, a darling, really.

I feel the store page poster, you know the one, with some random redhead smirking at you with a smoldering stare, is a massive lie. That person is not Jesse Faden, main character of this game. It's some artist's impression of her, drawn based on visual description alone. From the first lines of the game, the main character oozes sensitivity and care. This is not some smirking quipping action hero, she's uncertain, ever doubting herself, philosophical, curious and looking for answers. Determined, yes, but always reserved, and ever aware that she makes mistakes. You have to really threaten that which she holds dearest to even get a ""fuck off"" out of her. The image is honestly a disservice to the brilliantly written and acted character she really is.

The game -if you discount the fantastical (""paranatural"") elements, the world itself and its showcasing- is basically a coming-of-age story of a 28 year old woman. Which makes a whole lot of sense when you learn her backstory.

Highly recommended to anyone. Though I suggest at the first sign of frustration in combat, you just go straight into the options and turn on various assistance settings until it feels comfortable. Up to and including immortality and one-shot-kills. The combat is cool with each new ability or weapon for 5 minutes, then it becomes a chore. And the difficulty is all over the place.

The game has great design and environment, an incredible lore, a good story and an entertaining gameplay. You also have an added degree of freedom when customizing difficulty, so you can tailor it to your own skills. (The exception being the aforementioned timed missions, but those only come up as side missions, challenges and in the DLCs if I remember correctly.)

-
My main complaint is how often enemies respawn, not only in areas you already cleared, but even in areas that you haven't left yet. While it's certainly a choice that helped setting up the game's atmosphere and tension, after a while, it became tedious and frustrating, It also had the side-effect of making me lose my patience and look up the solutions to some of the small puzzles in the game, whenever I got stuck for a minute.

Very entertainig third person shooter with a lot of physical effects. Some scenes will remind you of Matrix lobby fight with all ongoing microdestruction. Your main weapon is throwing objects into enemies and your guns work as back up. You also gain abilities later in game like dodging, levitating and shielding youself with debris.

The story is heavily inspired by SCP lore but still does it's own thing. It's actually interesting to read documents, listen audio records and talk to people about non plot things.

Two DLCs looks like they should be a part of main game. Even if AWE can be considered optional, The Foundation definitely serves as Epilogue for main story. Luckily, Ultimate Edition is the only way to go now.
You also can test your skill in Expeditions, they work as arena challenges.

I highly recommend to get this game and play it, especially if big discount is in effect. But you probably should skip it if you can't stand brutalist design in any form.

Завершено за 29 часов, включая оба дополнения. На геймпаде.

Отлично развлекающий шутер от третьего лица со множеством физических эффектов. Некоторые моменты напомнят вам перестрелку в фойе из Матрицы со всеми своими микроразрушениями. Основное оружие это метание объектов во врагов, а ваш огнестрел служит как дополнение. Позже ,вы также получите другие способности, например, уворот, левитацию и защиту себя при помощи щита из окружающего мусора.

Сюжет вдохновлён статьями про SCP, но, тем не менее, идёт своим путём. В кои то веки интересно читать документы, слушать аудиозаписи и говорить с людьми не о сюжетных темах.

Два дополнения должны быть частью основной игры. Если AWE ещё можно назвать необязательным, то Основание это совершенно точно Эпилог к основному сюжету. К счастью, в Полном издании пропустить их нельзя. Также вы можете протестировать свой скилл в Экспедициях.

Currently been playing Control for ~9 hours and I have to say, I've enjoyed it wholeheartedly. 
I am currently running this on high end hardware, so I haven't had any issues with performance/optimization, not that I get much of a say on it. 
I must say, that Control has been incredibly fun, the combat sometimes gets mind-boggling, theres just so much going on the screen at once at points... However, when Control's combat goes well, which most of the time it does, it is some of the best combat I have ever played in any game. 

The graphics look amazing, even on lower settings. The game feels alive, every action you do, missed bullets, thrown objects, they all effect the environment around you. objects exploding, and enemies puffing into a red mist make you feel incredibly powerful as a character, while the game also somehow balances this out. I've never felt completely safe in a fight in the midgame. 

The worldbuilding is amazing, I've been absolutely stunned by this game's ability to teach you about what is going on, what had gone on, and what will go on so immaculately, and yet still have you questioning parts of the world. People have said that if you're an SCP or Backrooms fan, you'd love Control, and I wholeheartedly agree with the statements. 

However, should you buy it? Yea, but likely when its on sale, this is more-so a ~20$ game if people are correct in saying the gametime is around ~12-15 hours.

Control feels very good to play, with fast and smooth combat that evolves throughout the game in a satisfying and rewarding manner. The combat revolves around your powers and your gun, with your gun having several unique modes to switch between that each serve a specific purpose. The best part about the game-play is without a doubt the powers: Offering an advantage over both your enemies and your environment, they really make the game for me.

The core of Control is in my mind the story. It was engaging and intriguing with the right twists and reveals to pull you deeper in, while still leaving things vague enough to be interesting throughout. The story also alludes to other Remedy properties. Something that becomes more apparent in the background lore, and dlc (Which are also worth playing).

The aesthetic and art-direction is superb. It really is what pulls the game together for me, and is worth mentioning. The only real complaint I can come up with is that going for achievements got somewhat tedious. Though I wouldn't have bothered going for achievements if I didn't enjoy the game.

Then there's the out of left field difficulty spikes. In a game that focuses on atmosphere, setting and lore having the immersion ruined by minor annoyances is a deal breaker for me.

I remember being so confused yet enthralled by the mystery of the Oldest House after being thrown into it immediately at the start of the game, a cold open where unique characters apply details and pieces of the story that you slowly fit together as you progress.  Admittedly the gun play became a bit repetitive at times, but the accumulation of perks and paranatural abilities that tie into the story provided a nice sense of progress toward the overall goal.  With the ultimate edition comes two DLCs; The Foundation and AWE.  Both are well worth it, contributing to the story immensely and helping to build a connection with Alan Wake to form a connected universe between the two titles, undoubtedly securing further titles that will further unravel the mysteries left behind by their predecessors.

The gameplay was smooth and visually stunning, the ray tracing alone was remarkable.

When I jumped into this game, I did not expect to get such an Alan Wake vibe. Funny enough, I forgot Alan Wake was actually made by Remedy...only later mid-game I realised this again. Of course I had those vibes then...the tv players, the stories. The eerie, ominous and weird/strange narrative. It just gets deeper and deeper and you want to keep going to uncover the story.

The controls are a bit strange at first (playing with keyboard that is), especially unlocking new powers, gotta get used to the variaties of abilities when in heat of battle...kind of tend to screw up a lot mixing buttons up sometimes, but nothing you can't get used to later on. Overal I think it was pretty flued, just don't be suprised if you don't get the hang of it right away I guess. I suppose using a controller is better for this, but I just preferred keyboard because mouse aim is nice.

The flow of the game was pretty fun, I'd say the gameplay is more fun than the story itself. Sure, some points I did sit at the tip of my chair, wondering what would unfold..but what kept me coming back is the fun shooting, flying and throwing objects around. And every now and then you find yourself in a situation where the rooms are entirely ff-ed up, like reality is bent and you think you're crazy. (Kind of Layers of Fear-esq for anyone who played that). I think I loved that the most, really eerie. 
The one thing I wasn't really... fond of is the moment you're low on HP, the screen turns really dark and 'glowing' red. This is a pretty dark game, and especially in some areas....I just can't see shit when this happens. I'm franctically running around trying to escape or find HP on the floor and surviving. Maybe it's with an intention to add to the thrill, but I personally think it was more of an annoyance because I couldn't see anything at all. Sometimes I just let myself die so the screen would turn normal again...(if there was no HP around) But other than this, I didn't really have much bad to say.

For any of the Alan Wake fans out there, there's a DLC that indulged into the story , how it's connected with the Control-universe. I played it entirely, was really fun. And it does give me nostalgia punches because a lot of the gameplay is pretty 'familiar' from Alan Wake games! ;) Won't spoil, but you'll see.",1659276083,1659276083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The amount of care that's gone into every aspect of the game, from the visual presentation, to the story, to the level design, to the gameplay, it's all absolutely astounding. I found myself stunned by the graphics and visual design of the game every time I booted it up - even though the world is, at its base, a series of corporate offices, the way the world bends and twists those elements into alien, unfamiliar features and layouts is breathtaking. The way the game blends its graphics with live-action video feels way smoother than the premise sounds, and the visual direction of the game - the way the cutscenes are ""shot,"" how set-pieces are revealed, the tight zooms on Jesse's eyes as she narrates her inner thoughts - it's all so cinematic, movie-style without being a movie masquerading as a video game. The combat is challenging, and mostly satisfying - difficulty spikes in the late game and DLC tend to feel a little unfair, by way of simply throwing hordes of bullshit monsters at you (the Hiss Distorted are particularly criminal), but patience and practice, plus Assist Mode if you need it (an incredible feature that should be in a lot more video games, frankly) make the game completable for anybody. The end of the main story falls a little flat for me, possibly because it's in service of the game being an open world that continues to be fully playable after the main story is over, but on the whole, Control is a triumph, and one of the best games I've played in years.

Overall, I finished the main story feeling disappointed. Maybe my hopes were just too high after hearing only wonderful things about this game.
  
For a game focused on SCP-like weirdness, there are very few moments where these elements are used in the actual gameplay or level design. The beautiful world is wasted with constant uninspired combat against repetitive enemies. There is a “god mode” in the menu that makes you invincible. I wish I had activated this to avoid getting burned out. If you’ve played Alan Wake, expect the experience to be very similar.

Despite my disappointments, I still recommend Control for great environment art, and there are actually a few stand-out moments that feel amazing! 

Pros:
Art and environment design. Every map is visually stunning. It’s worth a playthrough just to gawk at the beautiful brutalist architecture found in every level. The designs are truly surreal, and I found myself stopping to just to stare.

Lore. There are a ton of collectables in various mediums that flesh out the game’s world in interesting ways. Everything you get, including video and audio files, is saved for you to look at. It’s all meticulously crafted and feels authentic.

[REDACTED] Maze. The best level of the game, deserving of recognition on its own merit. This level encompasses the SCP level design that I wish was used consistently in the game.

[REDACTED] Fridge side quest. A unique mini mission that surprised and terrified me. My favorite fight of the game! I plan to go through the other side quests eventually to see if there’s anything else like this.

Cons:
Combat. The gun and abilities are fun to use, but almost all combat is against the same type of enemies. It gets old very fast, and while I’m still interested in exploring the Control universe, I don’t want to slog through repetitive mini-battles just to pick up the next mission item.

Soundtrack. I was hoping for something at least somewhat thematic to go along with the beautiful environments, but there wasn’t really anything at all. Aside from a couple of stand-out singles by Poets of the Fall and perhaps another band, there wasn’t anything memorable here.

Story. The story doesn’t pan out. (As a disclaimer, I haven’t played much of the DLC or side quests yet.) I blame this on poor character development. You meet a lot of interesting characters as you go through the story, but none of them, including the protagonist, are given any time to develop. There are no arcs, no conflicts, no drama. Questions are presented if you should trust certain people, etc., but this is never expanded upon. This means there are no real stakes, because everyone is a cardboard cutout.

Definitely not the case. If you have a decent to master race PC, please play this game with ray tracing enabled. It's gorgeous to look at. Outside of the graphics, it's SCP Foundation meets... well, that's all I got haha. 

The combat is fluid and fast-paced. AI certainly keeps you on your toes. There's a variety of powers you accumulate, which makes each fight different - sometimes. The dialogue is pretty relatable to real life; the animations when characters are talking can be a bit jarring, if not funny to watch. Characters aren't the most important part of the game. It's the story. This huge, sprawling building capable of transforming and moving, along with an immersive soundtrack makes this one of the best games I've ever played. 

Go in expecting an absolutely gorgeous game with great combat, great background (like I said, SCP Foundation vibes), with a nice story - it's nothing to write home about, but it won't turn you off, either. And don't overthink the story. It's really not that complicated. The female protagonist spells it out for you.

Like AW, this game also has supernatural, mystery, puzzle, and horror elements. You play as Jesse Faden, a woman who looks for her brother in the mysterious headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, a government agency dedicated to locating and containing items with paranatural properties. Basically, like the collective fiction SCP Organization stories. She discovers the building was corrupted by a force known as The Hiss, turning their workers looking zombified and hostile.

The gameplay and premise reminds me of Prey (2016) which is sold in a bundle with this. A seemingly important person enters a mysterious research facility, rescues survivors, and fights corrupted humans with weapons and powers. Jesse has powers such as telekinesis and levitation, making the game feel unique and not just a third-person shooter. Both games also have what I would describe as ""indoor free-roam"", since all levels are set indoors, but you can freely travel to any area you've unlocked, opening shortcuts to some and fight respawning enemies. There are also sidequests and an upgrade system for your weapons and skills.

The graphics are obviously great, and there's also a photomode so you can take clean, mid combat screenshots. I also really like the style of the headquarters, very classic yet modern like Marvel's TVA. And the surreal parts are just as cool, shifting hallways, mold-infested basements, floating cubes in the void, etc. I recommend doing all sidequests since many of them will take you to unique locations and many bossfights. They don't feel very fetch quest-like, and took some time to finish. Luckily if you missed any and already completed the story you can just go back and do them, no lock-outs. I also like how they incorporate live-action actors (who their characters' look are based on) in several cutscenes and collectibles, like in their previous games Quantum Break and Alan Wake.

When you start Control you might notice there is no difficulty setting, and the game gets difficult not long after. It sounds punishing for casual gamers, but luckily the devs added an assist mode in gameplay options which can be changed anytime. You can lower your enemy's damage as well as energy & ammo regen, or just straight up turn on invincible mode and one-hit kills. The last 2 are a great help in the Expeditions content, basically time-based challenge rooms accessed through the jukebox. It’s really difficult and can be tedious, but gives an outfit once you finished the most difficult tier.

Control is a great third-person, open world game which is successful at being action-heavy and still maintain a creepy and mysterious tone. It is definitely a must-play for lovers of the action horror genre, and if you're a fan of creepy, surreal, and mysterious stories such as the ones made by filmmaker David Lynch. The Ultimate Edition already contains both expansions, so you can still do more stuff even after reaching the ending. There is one weakness though, no New Game+ or multiple save slots, so if you replay a mission you basically revert to your save when you start said mission.",1658918299,1659068134,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

A story-rich third person shooter with fun, fluid movement and the occasional puzzle.
It's got a great aesthetic, runs smoothly, has an intriguing story and way of telling side-narratives. Throughout the game you'll find lots of reports and bits on various items and occurences, I strongly recommend reading and watching them. 
Look around, pay attention to alternate paths, but don't obsess over impossible puzzles. You'll come back smarter.
Kinda like Half-Life, but way richer, stranger, and more unique.
Nearly everything has physics and can be used as a weapon, some puzzles use them too. They fit the environments and are very intuitive.

There is only one bug for me, the game minimizes when pressing caps-lock.
This is fixed by stopping ""csr Bluetooth Service"" in Task Manager.


Worth it, even at full price.

In long:
As of writing, I'm done with the campaign, where I took my time to read and explore most places and several of the side-quests. Some bosses were rather tough, but if you get up and tidy your room after failing, it feels amazing when you finally beat one.
Side-quests are mostly unique and interesting, they unveil more of the history and events in the Bureau and beyond.
The atmosphere is lovingly made and got me slightly spooked at times, but it was always very pleasant. 
Lots of impressive setpieces. There are no jumpscares. The environments are beautiful and can always be used in your favor, just watch your feet.
If you like the SCP Project or anything in the way of people trying to understand the paranatural in a reasonable fashion, this game is for you. Everyone acts like they have a brain, there are no dumb horror tropes.

Gameplay is great, fights are challenging but fair. I died several times, but it rarely felt undeserved.
The weapons represent strongly defined archetypes. They look alien yet familiar, feel great and can be modified in meaningful ways. Every ability has its place and purpose, there are some unique ways to combine them too.

The lead character is a strong woman, but everything is written in a very believable way, 
with no silly SJW-pandering. Her attitude is actually comforting in a few of the stranger, weirder places.
You can tell the developers love this game beyond their paychecks and had creative freedom.

1. While the maps are fairly extensive, the entire story is set within a single ""building"". 
2. There are a variety of extra paranormal abilities that enhance your combat, along with a unique set of weapons. 
3. The plot has a way of drawing you into each element of the fairly simple story as it unwinds new layers.

And while the basic gameplay does ultimately boil down to (1) find a new area on a new mission and then (2) kill all of the enemies there, it manages to make the journey and gameplay interesting enough, while wrapped in a relatively compelling story, that it doesn't feel repetitive as often as most shooters do.

Overall great, I enjoyed it greatly; controls, combat, location and ambiance, story and lore, characters, all awesome. Rewarding exploration and fluid combat to boot.
A couple things however made me grow tired of it very quickly: first the expeditions, ugh. A game like this could certainly use such an arcady mode, no nonsense and all action, but damn it's just too hard. Second, flying enemies. Too much of a bother. Either you focus on them or get crushed by things flying into your face or worse from who-knows-where. Stuff like this breaks the flow, makes things tedious, like ""oh great yet more of those flying f..."". When it's one or two eh ok but the more you go on they become swarms, adding up to the ground ones. This progressive build-up of irritation just made my joy of playing vanish in just a couple sessions after finishing the main story (which kept me hooked, and besides, I started getting annoyed only once in the Foundation). Tried to carry on to finish the DLCs with assist mode on, but eh even though I think it's a feature all games should have, it just drains away any sense of accomplishment.

Well to hell with that, it's probably just me being tired and a noob, there's certainly somebody else who can enjoy what I complain about. All in all a great game, try it.",1658533458,1658533458,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

 I've only played 5 hours and never want the game to end.
This game has it all.
Physics, lighting, HD GFX, ""zombies"", ""beasts"", super powers, loadout mods, a strong story, interesting literature pick ups, creepy moment's, jump scares.
But it doesn't get stuck on any one thing, it flows so nicely.

It's a gunhoe blaster game, but then its not, its a precision aimer, but then it's not, its a maze runner, but then it's not. It's a puzzler, but then it's not.

The game play is fluid, the design and decoration causes me to take moments out of play to enjoy the time and effort put in to it.
Level design, is great.

One of the best games I've ever played, and i'm a mere 5 hours in.
I grabbed this on sale therefore one of the best bargins I've snagged in a long long time.
Even if it's not on sale, I think you'll feel it's money well spent.

The voice acting and casting and the sprite authenticity are all really high end.
 
VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

35 play hours later...
Yeah, still very much enjoying this, the story is really good, the level design although somewhat cumbersome to navigate in certain places, makes up for it with the sheer quality of awe inspiring aesthetics.
I think the cumbersomeness also gives you the feeling of being trapped and confined in the aoldest house even when it's so huge.

Every new area has that start of a new game feeling, the devs have really cared and tried hard to make the experience unforgettable, so much so, screenshots have never been so satisfying.
The in game camera is just a bit more than basic, but it performs well.
(check out my screen shots and leave a comment!)

Once you learn the ropes and pick a play style, invested the skill points and tweaked your build, it does get a littlebit easy, but still challenging enough to kill you for your mistakes.
Customisation's unlock after the initial playthrough, so I will likely go through this playthrough as a completionist, then play hard mode primarily story orientated.

I just did the dimensional research maze run, it was the most trippy and iconic moment in my gaming history.
There are also lots of nostalgic items in game, so you also get to laugh at old tech.

In game flying feels like how I remember in my IRL lucid dreams.
I don't lucid dream very often any more, so it's nice there is a way to emulate the feeling.

I wouldn't play this game if you're opposed to backtracking, as you'll be doing a lot of it, especially for sidequests / doing dynamic stuff for leveling purposes. From an atmosphere standpoint, it's fantastic. Strong SCP vibes, I've heard other reviewers mention Half-Life and I'd agree from an atmosphere standpoint as well (just not from a gameplay standpoint, plays totally differently).

While it has it's charming points like the interesting traversal of the environment, the story for me lacked something, lacked...not sure how to say it... pizzas? This game definitely appeals to people but it lacks something for me in gameplay and story.
Please note that I'm a pretty casual gamer, not very good, but not bad either

Gameplay:
Fun to a point, but even with the powers and leveled up (I'm a pretty grindy person, get super buffed before doing the main story, you know the memes), but you can still get overwhelmed even when you're technically over level and that annoys me.
The looter part was frankly really disappointing for me, I did not feel compelled to try for the best of the best loot, just was not satisfying enough to try and get it (and I bloody played Dark souls and Nioh for heave's sake and got better feeling from that).

Story:
I personally prefer to not get spoiled and check the story for myself but this story was simply lackluster, it's missing something. I frankly couldn't care less for any character if they lived or died, was like, huh, who was and did what to whom? 

Overall this user cannot recommend this game and strongly recommends watch a streamer/youtube walk-through to see what you want to get.",1658168867,1658168867,False,1,0,0.506369411945343018,0,True,False,False

General premise is... have you heard of SCP Foundation? Remedy decided to do their own take on SCP Foundation. For those unaware it's a collaborative writing / creative project about a secretive super-organization that contains anomalous and unreal phenomena and entities that could disrupt the normalcy of the world, and those border somewhere between supernatural horror, sci-fi, magical realism and cosmic horror - supernatural, weird and otherworldly is real, it can be studied and quantified but they're still incomprehensible or threatening and magical thinking is as viable as scientific method. In this particular take on SCP-like secret org, a young woman named Jesse Faden finally finds a way to their offices to get answers about her past, only to discover whole place is besieged by some thing that takes over people. Most of the game you fight that thing but address Jesse's past in the meantime.

One major character character of the game itself is the locale itself - the Oldest House, a mysterious, supernatural skyscraper, headquarters of Federal Bureau of Control. It's got some quirks and weirdness, and it's pretty gorgeous with a variety of most concrete and yet evocative environments. That may actually put off some players - all action takes place in a singular massive building, and while there's some weird places it's mostly service and office areas. Nonetheless the environmental artists truly knew what they were doing, all areas feel distinct and evocative, a real treat for fans of videogame environmental design and architecture. Lots of nooks and crannies and routes to explore, too.

The gameplay, now! It's kinda a metroidvania? You unlock powers to progress trough areas, and revisiting and collectibles are all over the place, but story is linear. You also get a gun, but chances are you'll be dealing most of your damage with abilities, because the gun while fascinating in it's transformations has a limited ammo pool and not that big damage. Meanwhile, telekinetic throw not only is easy to upgrade to deal great damage and hit multiple enemies at a time, always has ammo, but also knocks them down hard and looks spectacularly as chunks of concrete get dislodged from wall and smash into enemies with satisfying sound and visuals. Other powers are neat too, like levitation which is essential for traversing levels lategame, or mind control to turn weakened enemies into allies, or shield. One problem with combat though, it can be pretty... all over the place, lethality-wise, some fights are just painful, others meanwhile are easy. You're better off investing in health moreso than abilities, sometimes. And this can be frustrating, with predefined respawn control points sometimes being located further off and such.

Overall... yeah,. if you play a lot of third person action games this may feel kinda derivative but otherwise it's quite a ride, I totally recommend it, and it has quite a load of moments I  wouldn't want to spoil but that are totally worth experiencing on your own.",1658149752,1658149752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics, the combat, the story, etc. This game is unlike quantum break which felt like a standalone game. But this game feels more like Alan Wake because they share the same universe.

These creatures are somewhat similar to the taken in Alan Wake, but have a different purpose. Finally, it ends with Jesse Faden accepting herself as the director of the FBC so she can let the lockdown continue until she takes away all the remaining hiss from the FBC since the previous director Trench turn on the slide projector that let the hiss in. Overall, that was an excellent game that keeps me more excited for the next games remedy are making which as everyone knows, Alan Wake 2 is coming in 2023 :)",1658131596,1658131596,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
