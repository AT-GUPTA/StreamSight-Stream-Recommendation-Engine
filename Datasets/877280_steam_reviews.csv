-Design are vast you just need some time to learn about the widgets because workshop does't have too much to give but soon when more themes and widgets available it will be the best better than windows system. my problem right now is how can i replay the task bar so i can fully clean my desktop and replace with this application.
-the Developer is also very active so no need to be afraid to ask or suggest about more ideas.
-just telling you yes it is a base on SAO but someone already upload genshin impact theme and i know more are coming soon.
