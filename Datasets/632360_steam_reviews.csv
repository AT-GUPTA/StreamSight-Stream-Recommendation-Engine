As a rouge-like game it might take a little bit of getting used to in terms of how to survive long enough on each survivor (character) to accumulate enough gold and get items. When you start the game as a new player you wont have a lot of options in terms of what types of items will drop, what types of enemies will spawn, and other variables that can change each play through. 

There are online guides that will help you unlock these options, and an online multiplayer mode where you can play with others that have already unlocked those perks.

Ingredients

15 dried Kashmiri chiles (see note)
2 teaspoons toasted whole cumin seeds
2 teaspoons turmeric
2 (1-inch) pieces of cinnamon
9 whole black peppercorns
7 whole cloves
1 teaspoon sugar
10 garlic flakes (or 2 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped)
1 inch-piece ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
1/2 cup palm vinegar, or 1/3 cup rice vinegar
1/2 pound pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
Kosher salt
1 medium onion, roughly chopped (about 1 cup)
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup water

Directions

Combine chilies, cumin, turmeric, 1 piece of cinnamon, 5 peppercorns, 4 cloves, and sugar in a spice grinder. Grind until a fine powder is formed. Transfer spice mixture to food processor or mortar and pestle and add garlic, ginger, and vinegar. Process or pound until a fine paste is formed. Scrape out paste into a small bowl and set aside without washing food processor.


Place pork in a large bowl and season with salt. Add half of spice paste and turn pork to coat. Add onion to food processor and process until a paste is formed.


Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion paste (do not wash food processor bowl), remaining 4 peppercorns, remaining cinnamon stick, and remaining 3 cloves. Cook, stirring constantly, until onion is soft and oil is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add remaining spice paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil separates and mixture starts to sizzle, about 5 minutes longer.

Add pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 10 minutes. Add water to the food processor bowl and swirl to rinse. Pour mixture into pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover, and cook until the pork is fork tender, about 1 hour longer. Serve immediately with bread or rice, or for better flavor, cool, store overnight in a sealed container in the refrigerator, and reheat before serving.",1653398969,1708838330,True,0,0,0.410780936479568481,0,True,False,False

The cast of characters for you to play is highly varied, with each ""survivor"" having a unique playstyle. This keeps it fresh, play a glass cannon, super-agile archer like huntress then switch to a beefy tank with loads of aoe and in your face melee combat.

It's very good

(this portion of the review is still under development)

So after playing this game in early access and a lot after launch I really don't like this game for the same exact reasons that I don't like the first game.
Items don't tell you what they do, a very minor gripe I have compared to the main issue the entire series has.
Damage is just nebulous and health bars are absurd, be it your own or your enemies health bars, or damage. The numbers are just obscenely high and every run of this game becomes Diablo 3 where I'm just spamming attacks at a huge health bar enemy while I desperately hope I don't get hit once within this actual 10 minute boss fight. Apparently that's what people like about this game, that the damage numbers are crazy and there are just particle effects everywhere, but I can't see my character, or my enemy (only their health bar on the ui which is going down very slowly) and I don't know what is going on or why I should get gear. The minute runes got unlocked for me I just lost interest in this game because I'm just only going to use rune of command and I'm only going to pick the best items in the game that make me win, and then I'm going to crush this game with no resistance, the only thing challenging about it being that it's trying my patience. Oh and if I don't want to have the problem where I'm overpowered and crushing everything I'll just play on Monsoon difficulty where everything kills you in one hit and enemies STILL have obscenely large health bars. This is just one of those games like Vermintide 2 where a good difficulty setting just doesn't exist, it's always too hot or too cold it reeks. I just don't understand this game or why you'd want to play a game with stats and damage numbers where they just mean nothing, idk why you would ever want to play Diablo 3, that game sucks. At least you can aim in this game and jump around but it still plays like f'cking diablo 3.
This game is just anti-game balancing and it's not hard or easy it's just boring. I really wanted to love this game and the first one, and when I first played this game I thought ""wow they fixed it, the game is fun now"" but in retrospect I'm thinking that's just because I was enjoying the 3d take on the game and how the game controls. I actually like the combat in this game a lot it's just numbers that suck. I am desperately, eagerly awaiting a Deadbolt sequel, that is your best game Hopoo games, please make another stealth action game that doesn't have numbers. I know you can make a fun game, this game has fun controls at the least, but just don't have numbers, please god don't make an RPG, don't make Risk of Rain 3, just make a fun game that controls well, no damage, no upgrades, this isn't your Forte after doing it with Risk of Rain, Risk of Rain 2 and Risk of Rain remake the re-riskening or whatever it's called. This ain't it guys. I love the music though, please keep giving Chris Christodoulou work, he is the best thing about Risk of Rain.",1577911891,1708510500,False,0,0,0.466431081295013428,0,True,False,True

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

System-wise:
- no quick queue. You have to search for a lobby manually with no auto-refresh
- no way to reconnect after dc
- ping not displayed in lobby

Gameplay-wise:
- stupid that you have to fight with other players for the loot when playing with randoms
- only way to continue playing after dying is to wait for the other players to finish the stage, which can take up to 10min if you get an unfortunate early death. Having to wait for so long is not fun. With little effort the devs could come up with a better revive mechanic that doesn't waste the player's time so much...

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

It's fun by itself even if you don't like rogue likes because gameplay is just that good. It's such a shame that the latest game they released went back to 2d format. Ror2 stumbled onto gold and they completely ignored it.

I love the items and characters in this game. Each plays significantly different and items have major impact making you a lot stronger, but you'll always be at risk of dying if you overstay. Each zone or level is really scenic with its own unique atmosphere.

Ror 2 just did so many things right. When I play other newer rogue likes a lot of my criticism is that they don't implement elements of Ror2. Most notably the increasing difficulty timer that encourages players not to overstay or speedrun beyond their skill level. I also love that Ror2 is not afraid to let you ascend to godhood with infinite looping and infinitely stacking items. Not enough games are willing to give their players that power fantasy and in this case it's well earned in longer runs.

I highly recommend picking up the DLC for this as it adds even more items and levels to explore. Very similar to a zombies play style. You run around, kill monsters, earn money, spend money on chests to receive items. Lets not forget that there is more than just chests to peak your interest. Shrines of all kinds await for you to find. It is an incredibly satisfying game that doesn't block content if your playing on a lower level (at least in my experience).

Half of attacks and enemies come from off-screen, meaning you cannot react to them - but the design and difficulty of enemies has not significantly changed.
Unlike Slay the Spire, which gives you numbers when you are about to be hit, or Hades, which gives you multiple tries, it is entirely possible to be one-shot by threats you did not expect.
The weapons also feel very pathetic. That is by design, so that your powerups feel even better. But it does not help if you struggle to get anywhere, because of these aforementioned issues.

I guess that is the side-effect of playing a rogue-lite. I want to get back to it, as it was fun and i know there are still other mysteries to unlock, i do not know if there is a point to it or not. I do recommend others if they want to play the game but at a stretch is harmful for me, i get addicted beating a vitual game not for story but just to beat the game.

Edit 2: I am 18 hours in, playing on drizzle or beginner difficulty, and as i can explore more even tho I bosses are much easier, I have to say i like the game to some extent. Gaining cool powers and different bats, drones and other familiars that accompany me through my journey is fun. I have to say tho that i wish the story was something i did not have to want to go looking for but i understand the design choice of not bothering people who dont care about it much, It is a good game for people who enjoy rogue-lite and got the time.

Edit 1: This is 3 hours later, I am 10 hours in, after I decreased the difficulty to beginner so that i could understand what the game actually is like and defeating first 3 bosses, 3 events and special places, i can say that yes, i get the appeal. the game felt bad at first maybe but not anymore honestly, guess i just suck at it also my pc sucked so set my graphics to low and now i can play well. My initial review of the game being a hollow experience, while it stands on what i based it on, as i mentioned, with bit of time invested I understood the appeal, tho it happened faster than what i was expecting. game is not bad. will update if any thing more change.

this was my first time playing a 3rd person rogue-lite. while starting i could not see much story and not sure when will. so for me it has been mindlessly killing things that attack me. Someone said this game is a persuit of a power-fantasy which may describe many roguelites but this one in particular does match as i could not find anything else worthwhile to do. I think this is a game for people who like roguelite for the sake of the challenge and like the experience in 3D.

for me personally if i am to get into this game i would have to see what is here, then would just get sucked into it just to beat it without really any other motivation, as my body and mind is not craving such an endeavor, i want to say this game is not for me at this moment, maybe when it came out 3 years ago but not now, maybe i took too long to play it, but maybe someday.

The game ran well enough in singleplayer on my core i5 7gen pc with no gfx card and 12gb ram, but had trouble in multiplayer co-op, maybe it was because i was hosting but i could not confirm this as playmate uninstalled after one session. 

i am 7 hours in and I wished it had more story and would have given some breathing space, it is hard for new players to get used to what the world is and what is happening, needed time to figure out what, why and... why(?). so the more time you give it the more you like it coz you are exerting effort but it was effort to understand a game that has little semblance with the real world and so i feel reluctant to get into it in one go as it feels like  a chore for nothing, maybe i feel like that about everything now, maybe i am getting older or maybe it is just the stress but it feels to much to get into and so the game feels hollow at times, maybe this would change with time when i get better at this game i would start to enjoy it, I think that says a lot about me than it says about the game.

Maybe i will change/add to this review someday

Risk of Rain 2 is one of those games that you can play repeatedly, get bored of after a week, then pick it up again in a couple of days once again. 

For an early access game rapidly approaching 1.0 release, it is truly an experience that is seldom rivaled in the market of roguelike Third Person Shooter. Hopoo games has done an incredible job listening to the community, and truly cares about the progress and sheen of their game, to an almost Blizzardesque level. 

If you enjoy a cast of interesting characters with a variety of play styles and functions, Third Person Shooters, as well as an active dev team and a rapidly growing community, ROR2 is for you!

2024 Review (Post release + Pre DLC 2) 

-This game has only gotten better, and if the steam reviews do not convince you to purchase, the sheer number of hours of gameplay loops should.

-If you have any interest in roguelikes, pick this game up, as well as its DLC. I have played for over 230 hours, and I still have not unlocked all there is in the main game or DLC.

-I once again stress how worth this game is, and oh by the way, it consistently goes on sale, though it is worth full price regardless

-Still HIGHLY recommend",1596048933,1707944234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Great gameplay, thirteen characters to choose from, amazing soundtrack as you play, great maps for you to survive on, and a plenty of items for you to choose between making each run different from the last. The co-op in the game is also amazing, allowing you to play with three others to do challenges or just have a good time.

Have some pancakes :)

STEP 1
Put 100g plain flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl.

STEP 2
Make a well in the centre and crack 2 eggs into the middle.

STEP 3
Pour in about 50ml from the 300ml of semi-skimmed milk and 1 tbsp sunflower oil then start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.

STEP 4
Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream.

STEP 5
Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper.

STEP 6
Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into the mixing bowl, return the pan to the heat.

STEP 7
Leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.

STEP 8
Hold the pan handle, ease a palette knife under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against the base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate.

STEP 9
Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.",1577709793,1707785406,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

The gameplay loop is simple: Kill enemies, collect items to get stronger, find teleporter, kill more enemies, die, repeat. Many games do this however they tend to lack in most other areas. The simplicity of the game for one is surface level, deeper you'll find a somewhat more complex layer of gameplay, adding to the replayability factor as you can reach different areas depending on what you do for each run. There are no permanent ability modifiers or unlocked areas that persist between runs, everything is available from the start, you just need the skill, luck, and experience to find it. The story knows it doesn't need to be complex, it's very straightforward and fits well into the gameplay. The environment is uniquely designed for each area and hand crafted. The sound design and BGM are absolutely phenomenal and really lock your focus to the game.

But what makes the gameplay itself fun? Completely busted builds. The fun lies in completing challenges to unlock new, truly unique, characters to use, skills for individual characters, and items to drop in the game. Then make the most absolutely broken and unfair build possible. You achieve this by challenging yourself. It takes creativity and knowledge of the items and game system to know what you need, it takes skill to have a chance, and luck to finally make it happen. And to make it easy to learn the system you can see every item you have unlocked in the logbook and its stats. Including how it behaves when you stack it. The crowbar for example gives you +75% damage to enemies at 90% or more health, and you do +75% more damage for each crowbar you have. Meaning 12 crowbars gives you +900% damage on your first shot for any enemy. This is an actual in-game challenge to unlock a new ability for a character. Get in, and go wild. And remember... You're probably not beating the game anytime soon.",1707759444,1707759444,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

- Characters are all viable and have unique skill sets that require mastery (some more than others though)
- Core mechanic of trying to scale your power faster than the enemies scale theirs is really fun

- Janky physics

Cons:
- Need to read a wiki to understand all lot of things about the game
- Multiplayer can be a little iffy. I've had desync issues that ended a couple runs :(

- drop in
- murder (they started it)
- gamble in more ways than one
- find teleporter
- die to laser/supernova and reset from step 1

- stage 2, standard operation procedure
- die to  s u c c and reset

- stage 3, spend 10 minutes looking for teleporter
- die to bison/5 billion wisps. Reset

- stage 4, triple void seed or 20 billion golems/mushrooms/FUCKING LARVA
- you guessed it
- miss the legendary chest or come up a dollar short after finishing TP

- stage 5
- 3 xi constructs (count em')
- if it's your first time, find the artifact portal before the TP and get the artifact of honor (and then get even more confused when you find yourself at step 1 again)
- if not, you're probably dead but on the off-chance you're not, proceed having not found a scrapper the whole run

- moon
- experience modern warfare
- more teleporters, but this time they're spicy, just like the enemies
- ascend and miss twice
- get challenged to croquet
- he has a bigger hammer, you lost
- if you didn't lose, he reveals his Albanian heritage and beats you at your own game

now you've probably died a ton, and even when you win, you get the eternal glory that no other game can replicate in a style like Risk of Rain can.

you get to start from step 1, again.

Alright. I caved and came back to give it another try with some friends. I keep my stance of not liking the new enemies. Especially the stingray looking things and triangle flying dudes that roast you with lasers. The new maps are meh for the most part. Mithrix stage is terrible with all of the charging. The void boss is a neat addition. The parkour feels a little mean until you have some good movement, but I can overlook that. I just finished cleaning up the remaining achievements I was missing since the update. I really like railgunner. W survivor. Bandit isn't bad but kinda feels like a discount Captain. The void survivor feels actually really good, though I wish he had some alternate abilities. The corrupted void items are a nice addition as well;  I really like pretty much all of them. Revising my rating after getting back into it. 

10/10 before SoTV. Now I give it a 9/10.

Updated April 2022:
Man. I used to love this game before the bandit and void updates, but I'm not so sure anymore. The new enemies seem annoying just for the sake of being annoying. No sense of uniqueness is felt with them, just some extra flying enemy that shoots something at you, or this ground enemy that is difficult to target. Final stage has more chores added to it that don't feel great at all. I loved it before all of the unnecessary fluff or ""charging"" was added to that stage. The new items are interesting as well as the new survivors, but that's about it. This is coming from someone that 100%'d the game in achievements all on monsoon with no artifacts in 1.0. Through all of this I'd still recommend it, but it's no longer a 10/10 for me. 

Updated at 100% achievement completion:
Wow. This game is awesome. I've poured so many hours into learning how to play each character and how to build effective builds. This game is fun solo or with multiplayer. I do both often. The additions with 1.0 are great, and I look forward to the next updates to this awesome game. If you are on the fence about getting this game, do it and enjoy the ride.

Previous review:
This game is a lot of fun with friends. For someone that doesn't typically go for multiplayer fps type games, the characters are varied enough to where I can find something that is fun for my tastes. The items have a lot of variation and bring a rogue-like feel to the game, but it might take you a bit to remember what each item does before you steal it from a teammate that might benefit from it more than you. The enemies are also diverse and fun. You'll pick up on which ones you really hate fast. Overall, a nice pickup.",1578224651,1707714457,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have to say, this is one of the most fun games I have played in a very long time. It is incredibly fun and enjoyable both alone and with friends. 
The support for modding is fantastic and allows for even more content which is amazing! I also have to say, as someone who loves music to the core, the soundtrack to this game is undeniably impeccable. 
My one and only downside is that the developers rely heavily on the ""charge the thing"" trope. You need to do it for every stage, the final stage both for the final boss and the boss for SotV DLC..... Not bad, just disappointing that the trope is such a fallback for them.

This is a rogue-lite about getting big with ludicrous numbers. Period. At least half of the encounters in this game cannot be excused for being balanced the way it is unless the idea is to stat-check everything not you.

Risk of Rains 2 is overwhelming disheartening in the start. If you are looking to buy this game, make sure you have guides or have someone to piggyback with. The unlock-able characters and a fair bit of the alternative powers are not worth the effort in the slightest, especially since one of the best characters in the game is given to you at level 1. 

You will not find a balanced experience. The balance is becoming overwhelmingly powerful that the thousands of enemies have no chance, or be murdered down and resent to the lobby. 

The character designs and kits are where most of the enjoyment comes from, aside enjoying breaking the systems. So, it may sound contradictory to my earlier statement, but I can assure you that most of these characters are not worth the effort in farming up a broken build, die to a random enemy you've never seen before like a Jailer, restart, get bad items, restart, get kicked because you are running cross-play with a friend and get the super common lobby breaking glitch, restart and maybe, maybe... Maybe you'll get someone you enjoy playing as.

With Risk of Rain 2, you aren't at risk of getting wet, but at Risk of losing 45 minutes of progress to a single hit instead.",1707697019,1707697019,False,2,1,0.489457488059997559,0,True,False,False

I love how the game formats achievements to directly link to unlocking new characters and items, makes it feel as though every run has a secondary goal. I strongly recommend everyone to try out the game at least a couple of times, especially with friends. Looking forward to the upcoming DLC.

Graphics 4/5:
Although the graphics aren't anything thats going to make the headlines. I really enjoy the style and it suits the game perfectly. The only reason this didnt get a 5 is because the game is a bit older and the graphics could be a bit more refined or updated but no loss of enjoyment here at all.

Sound 4/5:
The score/soundtrack to this game is absolutely incredible. As a musician I love when a game is scored by someone that obviously took a lot of pride(and rightfully so) in the work they did on the project. At times the SFX can be kind of overwhelming simply because of the amount of things happening at once, but thats just the nature of the game.

Gameplay 5/5:
I have no *real* complaints here. Of course I will throw out criticisms from time to time during gameplay but who doesn't do that after you've played a game for 80+ hours? Truth is, I picked this game up on a whim just to have something to play with buddies and got sucked in so much more than I would've expected. It is just absolutely good classic co-op fun. Well balanced and thought out from beginning to end.

Story 2/5:
I was actually tempted to omit this category simply do to it being irrelevant. Instead I've decided to include a new category to prevent the score drop.

Wildcard 2/0:
Never expected this game to be so great, but it really is, so they get a couple of extra points I wouldn't normally include.

Total score: 17/20 (Highly Recommend)

It's fairly repetitive compared to other rougelike games (only a small handful of bosses, characters, maps, and items with mostly boring effects), and the gameplay leaves something to be desired. Half the time you're sitting and waiting for stuff to spawn, the other half you have a billion enemies after you constantly. Dying doesn't feel like a lack of skill half the time, as trying to dodge dozens of beams, fireballs, and other projectiles that do half your health each just isn't fun and usually ends in unavoidable death, not to mention Malachite elites just outright oneshot you if you decide to loop. Most of the bosses aren't that great either, most evaporate your health if you can't dodge or hide behind cover, and unless your run is really good, they can take a good while to kill. As for characters and items, most characters want very specific item builds, which makes the heavy item RNG suck to work with, even with Printers and Scrappers. And plenty of high rarity items aren't even that good, and a good amount of the items in the game don't even feel noticeable or all that helpful. All things considered, Risk of Rain isn't that bad of a game, but there's definitely better rougelikes out there",1706008917,1706825556,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- transitioned perfectly from a 2d side scroller into a 3rd person shooter. Bigger games have tried less risky ventures only to fail and fade into obscurity, whilst risk of rain shows it can conquer both the 2nd and 3rd dimensions flawlessly.

- has established itself as one greatest rougelikes ever made, it is a beautiful blend of hardcore whilst also being approachable. Death can come quick and hours of progress can be lost in a flash but you'll be back in a run in a matter of seconds hitting crazy power levels.

- and finally has a dev team that not only puts out high quality dlc and support for a game they clearly love making but they also cherish the community they have built.

I have nothing bad to say about this game, it's one of my favourite rougelikes with countless hours logged across all systems it's avaliable on, the graphics are pleasing, the game controls like butter and the ost slaps hard. 

This is a game I strongly suggest everyone play but especially those that may be intimated by genre, I started with this game and have never looked back, it's the best starting and end point, you will be craving more when you've blasted passed your 100th hour but you will still come back for more.

Artifact of command + or - Artifact of Sacrifice = a fun time.

Check out thunderstore io for RoR2 mods, some are even vanilla compatible so you can fix the issues I had with the game via mods & still play with your unmodded friends. Though you will need to do the prismatic trials to unlock the scythe & Merc's ability before you start playing modded as the prismatic trials are not available while modded.

Old review:
I really wish Borderlands would've handled like this game, just the feeling of excitement as you get absurdly Over Powered is just a joy; & even when you are OP the enemies can still get you if you aren't careful.

It is also 4 player online which is great! Though multiplayer brings some weaknesses of the game balance out as some players may end up less equipped for the situation at hand as the enemies may have outscaled your friends while they were dead waiting to respawn.

Also strangely people can join an invite & spectate mid-game but cannot join mid-game, which is unfortunate.",1681704712,1706302869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By no means I mean ""This is a bad game"", it still is a very fun game and even better with friends, but i'd say it kinda falls short compared to the first one. The change to 3D is cool, but it takes away some of the charm the original game had (and with the recent RoR Returns release, this only got more apparent), while the first game is more simple and compact, generating a more satisfying experience, this one flips on that entirely and tries to do too much and hits too little. What do i mean by that? A lot of characters are very hit or miss; some item pickups are entirely outclassed by others or just straight up useless (and don't even get me started on how the DLC is just paid access to the best items and characters in the game); going for more lengthy runs feels heavy discouraged, with the ammount of enemies that can just straight up one shot you (Elite Greater Wisps, Brass Contraptions, Void enemies (which explode on death, and literally deletes you if u stay in the explosion radius), etc.) or can lead to one shots (Yes, we all hate Malachite Elites here). 
Overall, still worth the purchase if you like the series and specially if you have friends to play with, but I'd still take the first game (Or RoR Returns, which is just a better version of the first game) over this one.
Also, BUY THE DLC, IT HAS THE BEST ITEMS IN THE GAME, YOU ARE LITERALLY CRIPPLING YOURSELF BY NOT HAVING IT.",1706209679,1706209679,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Items are very fun to experiment with other or specific items for your selected character. And the multiplayer is also nice to bring even more chaos.

If there were any changes I personally would like to see is if they could add a few more stages, like 2 or 3 would be fine. Another change is to implement a Day/Night cycle. Like a 50/50 chance to occur on a stage. And well, because of the title. Rain. Make it Rain in some of the grasslands/forest stages. Again, by chance.

And since I play Risk of Rain Returns, I would love to see Enforcer back. My main.
Adding some new moves to characters such as Captain's secondary would be nice.

Its definitely the best Rougelike that i have personally ever played. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that wants a incredible game for Playing alone or playing with friends. Some of my favorite things include:
The music is incredible and ramps up with the gameplay as you go.
The character selection is large and covers alot of different kind of play styles.
The game is still being updated to add more maps,characters and items.
The graphical style is unique in the way the textures fit with the colors.
Each map has its very own style, theres one with snow, Lava, Water, Sand, and many more things.
The amount of items is staggering, no 2 runs are the same.
There are artifacts that are basically add ons in the game that allow for you to make the game harder or easier... but mostly harder.
The lore of the game is very interesting. (Even though i never looked into it)
The bosses of the game are very cool and challenging when learning the game.
The learning curve alone probably took me 50-100 hrs to learn properly.
Theres so many more things that i love about this game but I dont really want to make a review so horribly long. 
The things i dislike include:
Personal shield generator
Cronobauble
Clay templars (i do like them they are just strong)
I dont really have any complaints with the game. In my personal opinion the game is well worth the money. I would buy it again if i had to. This game to me is a good 9.25/10",1705641507,1705641507,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

 - MUSIC: This game have an EPIC soundtrack, music that made me to listen out of the game. Thanks for Chris Christodoulou.
(9,5/10)

 - ART: A BEAUTIFUL art style and graphics. Every item that you pick will be added to your character, the maps and the environment really matches with the theme of the game.
(10/10)

- CONTENT: The game has 13 survivors (and the ???), with all having his own all having their own unlockable abilities. Also have 148 itens and 38 equipment in the game. And finally, a BIG lore, that you can find pieces of it, in every single map, item, equipment, character and monster.
(10/10)

 - GAMEPLAY: Each character offer his own abilities of mobility, damage and/or support. You certainly will find your type.
(10/10)

 - DLC: The first one (DLC) is incredible. 2 of the 13 survivors are from DLC, and my favorite survivor are one of these 2. They two have very interesting mechanics and play style. The (The second one (DLC) hasn't launched yet, I will update this review after playing it.)

 - PRICE: Found this on sale? WORTH. Found on full price? Also WORTH. LOL
(9/10)

 - MULTIPLAYER: A really fun game to play with friends. Is hard to balance the itens to everyone be OP, but, why you will share, if you can steal. But in general, it's a good multiplayer, just have good friends, or, be the stealer.

Most of it was just attempts to get good RNG or trying to get achievements to unlocks characters and items (some of them are stupidly grindy).

I will now point out things I disliked the most in this game:

- classes are the same (except a few) and what character you will choose will matter less the more time you will spend on run

- active skills are even worse in that regard: they do not scale well and your left-click attack will be probably better late game

- items completely define your build but because there are so many of them you will end up with mostly the same build regardless

- time is your enemy: you need to run fast and kill fast, everything else will be just inferior option that will not work in this game. I have tried many times to do some tanky/healing builds for fun but they do not belong in this game.

- lack of information: game has fantastic and very informative UI for menu and characters but when the game starts it literally change to the worst experience you will have, no information about items you pick, so you will have to memorize all those items and read about them in main menu

- TABing game doesn't stop time so you are punished for learning the game. You want to check how well items you picked synergize? Well too bad, take those stronger enemies now. Probably the most stupid decision I saw in any game.

this game actually changed my life.

maybe a year or two ago when i got this game i honestly had no idea what was going on, but my friend taught me everything there is to know about the game. i was struggling with depression and this game pulled me out of that hole. i played this game nonstop for like a month. 

i can't help but express my deep gratitude for the transformative impact that ror2 had on my life. in the midst of a challenging period marked by depression, this game became a beacon of light, pulling me out of the darkness and into a world of endless possibilities

from the moment I entered the immersive realm of risk of rain 2, I found solace in its captivating landscapes and dynamic gameplay. the breathtaking environments and otherworldly creatures provided a welcome escape from the struggles that weighed heavily on my mind. the game's vibrant colors and intricate design not only engaged my senses but also transported me to a place where joy and excitement were not just possible but inevitable.

the cooperative nature of risk of rain 2 became a lifeline for me. connecting with friends, in the shared pursuit of survival against increasingly challenging odds forged bonds that transcended the digital realm. the collaborative effort required to conquer the game's formidable challenges mirrored the support system I desperately needed in my own life. it became a reminder that, just like in the game, facing adversity together makes us stronger.

one of the game's most remarkable aspects is its unpredictability. the ever-shifting landscapes and the randomness of item drops served as a metaphor for life's unpredictable nature. In embracing the uncertainty within the game, i found the strength to accept and navigate the uncertainties in my own life. risk of rain 2 became a therapeutic experience, encouraging me to adapt, strategize, and ultimately overcome the challenges before me.

beyond its entertainment value, risk of rain 2 taught me invaluable lessons about resilience and the importance of companionship. the game became a source of motivation, pushing me to persevere in the face of adversity. the moments of triumph, whether in defeating a challenging boss or surviving a seemingly impossible situation, mirrored my own journey toward recovery.

in essence, risk of rain 2 was not just a game, it was a lifeline that helped me weather the storm of depression. its immersive world, cooperative gameplay, and lessons in resilience became integral components of my healing process. to the developers and everyone involved in creating this masterpiece, thank you for crafting an experience that goes beyond entertainment and becomes a powerful force for positive change in the lives of those who need it most.

Top notch art design, game play loop, soundtrack, optimisation, etc. I've gotten an enormous amount of fun out of this game playing both alone and with friends. You can play this game for hundreds of hours before feeling like you've mastered it, and it only takes a run or two to grasp the basics. In my lowly opinion, this game is currently THE best example of what a rogue-like can and SHOULD be. 

There are no arbitrary limits on any items/stats. Meaning if you stack 50 attack speed items it will keep on climbing (albeit with diminishing marginal returns for obvious balancing reasons) to no hard ceiling. Because of this you occasionally get insane and hilarious runs where you have 900% movement speed, or become an immovable tank. There are also no arbitrary impediments to progression. Although it took me a while to learn about the gameplay modifiers called artefacts (like Skulls in Halo), there is nothing stopping someone from unlocking them on their first run. You could hypothetically unlock 5 new characters, 10 new items, and half a dozen artefacts on your first run of the game. One of these artefacts allows you to choose your own items. This changes the game from a rogue-like to something pretty different, where you can just try new builds, or stack 30 of your favourite item, or stack 150 double jumps and nothing else... You get the idea. The artefacts extend the longevity of this game by so much. They really add unique challenges and/ or differences to your runs if you choose to add them, which, btw, can be stacked if you desire. 

The third person shooting feels intuitive, responsive, and overall adds a huge element of fun to the game. In so many rogue-likes you're limited by dinky pixel art sprites slowly travelling across the screen to defeat foes, and if you're lucky these will ramp up into something a bit more fast paced after several upgrades. In this game, there is a mix of snipers, melee brawlers, and rapid fire machine gunners --and more-- that all take the intensity and the immersion up a huge notch. Despite being an indie dev, the responsiveness of the shooting and the overall feel is of the highest quality. And this is coming from a degenerate who wasted all of highschool playing old Call of Duty's. 

This game really takes the best elements of the Rogue-like genre and does away with the stupid and annoying parts we all know too well. The maps are huge, the world has an interesting lore, and the progression feels natural and rewarding. This game would arguably still be worth it at twice the price. I plan to support all future projects this dev produces, and continue playing RoR2 for the foreseeable future.",1705534152,1705534152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hopoo did an amazing job of capturing the essence of the original and creating an amazing new experience. Solo runs are great but the fun factor increases when you play with friends. Soundtrack is one of the best you will ever hear in a video game. I listen to it outside of the game all the time.

Multiple content updates later and the game is better than ever. New and interesting items, survivors and enemies keep me coming back for more.

I'm seeing some reviews complain about the game being boring after a couple runs as all you do is run around and kill things. While that is essentially the point of the game, unlocking new characters and items is a nice challenge and adds variety to the game. 

Anniversary update wasn't huge but it added a lot of nice touches and fixes to go along with a new survivor (also a hidden one). They completely revamped the final level making it much more interesting and challenging.

The first dlc is very good as it adds two survivors, various new items, enemies, and final boss. Game is also very good without the dlc so if you want to wait to find out you like the game first before buying the dlc, you'll still get a very well polished game. The base game has various unique survivors to try out a different play style. the game also has a lot of depth from how each item you get stacks, interacts with another item, and how  important an item is to specific survivors. The game's main mechanic of spending more time on a stage making the game harder might seen scary at first, but the game is just looking for the player to learn how to maximizing exploring a stage while getting items and looking for the teleporter to get out of the stage. If you're unsure about enjoying this game, look up some gameplay to see how people play to find out what gameplay loop the game has.",1705279748,1705279748,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've tried out almost every character at this point, and I have not found one that I dislike. I also checked out the logbook and started reading the stories and journal entries for the enemies, survivors, and equipment, and that was pretty engaging too.

The difficulty is also good in this game. It has something for you if you're just looking to relax, and you can keep on playing for longer if you want to seek out a challenge. 

The only warning that I'd give is that, as a casual player, one run would take me around 40-70 minutes. (40 minutes if I'm just going for the easier content, 70 minutes if I'm looking for more of a challenge.) Admittedly, you can make an effort to run the game faster to decrease this time, but 40 minutes felt like the natural run length for me.

It rewards your play time by improving you as a player. If the default game modes are either too hard or not quite to your liking, just unlock some Artifacts to change it up. Command and Sacrifice specifically change the way you play on a fundamental level to the point that you're almost playing a different game, but in a good way. The community Discord is quite friendly and helpful too, and the wiki is mostly accurate--enough to rely on for all the important things, even if a few nit-picky details are slightly off.

Multiplayer is a great strength and weakness of this game--it basically depends on who you play with. Some randos are extremely selfish and impatient, and they can make it a fairly miserable experience if you can't keep up. On the other hand, some people like to help out and show people the ropes. Hosting a game with a lobby name indicating your expectations can go a long way. For example, ""Demons & Crabs Challenge"" will have a totally different mindset than ""20+ Stages."" Just don't be one of those weirdos who leaves the default name on.

Lastly, don't be discouraged by the initial character select. Unlocking them isn't as hard as it seems, and is highly worth the effort.",1705060787,1705060787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Time is difficulty in this game which means the longer you take to beat it the harder the game gets, which means the longer you are in a run the more enemies will be on screen with more damage and health which can cause your pc to stutter and have massive drops in FPS.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The game play loop is great and while it can get stale, they made sure to add as many ways to spice it up. Along with many different endings and just getting all the characters take a while, it is all very rewarding and you always feel like you are making progress. Not only that, but there are many ways to play it. Long range single target, hard to master melee, and great crowd control, everyone has a purpose and there is something for you.

The normal mode is a big finger in your face, you get rolled with no chance of this getting easier as the roguelike aspect only stands for each run, meaning the only skill can get you past normal. I can't even think hard mode is doable without a stupid amount of tears and blood. In and all, good ideas, well executed, but terribly balanced.

Edit: After giving a second chance to this game thanks to growing desire to play after seeing streaming of Risk of Rain Rebirth, I still can't recommend this game. Even after unlocking characters thanks to Wiki (as learning from playing is completely out of question with the kind of challenges required), most characters are as dull as the ones you get easily. The more objects you unlock, the more random runs are, making viable build terribly hard to get. The end boss level is unnecessarily huge forcing you to hope for movement perks. Further more, whatever the level you play at, the end boss battle is almost impossible for any close range characters with whom you can get wiped in a single slash. Honestly the whole experience of this game is terribly average. Very low fun, making this game not enjoyable to replay again and again.

Risk of Rain 2 is an absolute masterpiece that has captivated my gaming soul like no other. From the moment I stepped foot into the mystical world of Providence, I was hooked. The blend of intense action, strategic gameplay, and breathtaking visuals has made this rogue-lite treasure an instant favorite.

One of the standout features of Risk of Rain 2 is its seamless transition from a 2D platformer to a fully immersive 3D world. The developers have crafted an environment that feels alive, with each level teeming with intricate details and hidden secrets. The feeling of exploration is unmatched as I traverse stunning landscapes, all while battling hordes of monsters.

The game's diverse character roster is nothing short of extraordinary. Each survivor possesses a unique playstyle, allowing for endless hours of experimentation and strategic gameplay. Whether I'm trying to master the precise precision of the Huntress' skills or immersing myself in the sheer power of the Engineer's turrets, every moment feels fresh and exciting.

Risk of Rain 2 also boasts a rewarding progression system that kept me coming back for more. The rush I felt when unlocking new abilities and items is exhilarating, pushing me further into the perilous realms of the game. The synergy between various items creates an intricate web of strategies, ensuring that no two runs ever feel the same.

Multiplayer in Risk of Rain 2 is an absolute blast. Joining forces with friends to take on colossal bosses and overwhelming waves of enemies is an experience that words can hardly describe. The teamwork required to overcome these challenges fostered an intense sense of camaraderie and tested our ability to cooperate under pressure.

Furthermore, the game's stunning soundtrack adds an extra layer of immersion that elevates the overall experience. Each melody ingrains itself in your mind, perfectly complementing the chaos of battles and enhancing the sense of adventure.

In my humble opinion, Risk of Rain 2 is an absolute must-play for any gaming enthusiast. Its engrossing gameplay, stunning visuals, and addictive progression system make it a game that keeps on giving. I cherish every moment spent within its vibrant worlds and eagerly await each new update that expands upon its already magnificent universe.

So, if you're seeking an adrenaline-pumping adventure filled with endless excitement and opportunities for growth, Risk of Rain 2 is the game for you. Prepare to lose yourself in this masterfully crafted gem that will leave you yearning for more.)",1704594156,1704594156,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know, I know, theres a point to these death messages. However, like the meme comments they are inspired by, they remain mean-spirited. Play something else if you arent a masochist.
As a masochist, and one with thousands of hours on arguably harder games, I think there could be some polish on the base game that would bring serious shine. However the studio opted to have DLC.

Edit: played another 15+ hours of this game with the DLC. Made the game objectively worse. The litany of simply irritating enemies feel unbalanced to an even greater degree and the new items are. . . Ambitious? but poor. New lunar items are worst of all. Really disappointing.

It's come a long long way since I bought it, and since I last reviewed it, so I figured I'd rewrite my review, and I'm happy to say that in the time I've followed this game, It has only gotten better and better. The gameplay is just wonderful, and provides a good challenge even to good players, and the amount of content there is to unlock is crazy, from items, to enemy logs, to all the achievements, and the characters. Oh man the characters. Each and every one of the characters in this game feel completely different to play, all providing additional abilities to unlock over time, that completely change them so you almost never get bored. The level design is great, almost everywhere on every map is a wide open, yet beautiful space that feels fun to fight in. The maps, aside from being great to play on, also look great, and the art style really complements that. last but definitely not least, the soundtrack. Every song in this game is amazing, and I find myself often listening to the ost all the time. Overall, this game is an absolute steal if you like rougelites, and most people agree, is one of the better ones out there.

Update: Survivors of the void is amazing as expected, more great RoR2 with some twists. Highly recommend.

Play on the standard difficulty until you understand the game, grab a few mods that actually tell you what the items do, and most importantly: YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERY STAGE IN 3-5 MINUTES. The biggest Youtuber for this game is also straight up giving awful advice. Listen to the best players in the community, like Race - full looting is by far and away the most consistent method to getting wins in this game. Provided you're getting about an item a minute, you'll likely out-scale the enemies and win. It didn't take long with this method for me to play monsoon with all the characters and win my runs easily, and then the eclipse grind begins...

This game is actually a 10/10. The music, visuals, and moment to moment game-play is exquisite, and each character is so unique that it means that every run truly does feel different from the next. Also it has co-op, but I played solo.

Play with a keyboard and a mouse, it's easier. A genuine masterpiece and I can't wait for what's next.",1704493872,1704493872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not merely a game; it's a journey into the depths of both solitude and resilience, a poignant narrative woven through the delicate fabric of pixels and code.

From the moment the ethereal soundtrack caresses your ears, you're transported into a realm where the cosmos themselves mourn the trials of the stranded survivors. The haunting melodies linger like echoes of distant memories, awakening a sense of nostalgia for a world you never knew existed.

The visual poetry painted by the game's evolving landscapes is breathtaking. Each level, a canvas of dynamic beauty, tells a story of survival and struggle. The rain, a metaphor for both tears and hope, blurs the line between the ethereal and the tangible, leaving a profound mark on the player's emotional canvas.

Risk of Rain 2 masterfully interweaves gameplay and emotional depth. As you navigate through the labyrinthine terrains, the relentless onslaught of enemies mirrors the challenges we face in our own lives. The vulnerability of your lone survivor, standing defiant against the storm, echoes the human spirit's tenacity in the face of adversity.

What truly resonates and evokes tears, however, is the multiplayer experience. The camaraderie forged through shared struggles, the unspoken understanding among teammates, and the silent nods of encouragement transcend the digital realm. It's a reminder that even in the solitude of our struggles, we are not alone.

And then there's the climactic moment when you face the colossal bosses, a metaphor for life's most formidable challenges. The pulsating music reaches a crescendo, and in that moment, tears flow not just for the characters on the screen but for the battles fought in our own lives.

Risk of Rain 2 is not merely a game; it's a sonnet of solitude, a symphony of resilience. It moves you in ways that linger long after the screen goes dark, a testament to the emotional tapestry that great games can weave. As the rain falls, so do the tears of profound connection and shared humanity.",1704470458,1704470458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The stages look incredible and the only thing randomly generated are the item and boss spawns, which can somewhat get annoying if you're looking around the map for the boss summon as the game keeps on getting harder and harder.
The Enemy variety and reskins of them all look good and feel distinguishable enough so you can run when an after death effect suddenly is in your range.
Depending on the playstyle you usually have this game might be really hard or somewhat moderate, since you will be punished for every second you spend in a stage as the game gets harder, so you'll need to balance your time between finding loot and going to the boss teleporter... also End boss man... its good but, i've died too often at the last phase especially in the highest difficulty, which is something you need to definitely avoid until you feel ready. Monsoon is no joke, you will experience pain if you don't get core aspects of the game.

3 cups all-purpose flour (390 grams)
3 cups granulated sugar (600 grams)
2 1/2 tsp baking powder (10 grams)
1 tsp salt (6 grams)
1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature (226 grams) - 2 sticks
2 tsp. vanilla extract (8 grams)
1 cup pasteurized egg whites from a carton (or about 7 egg whites) (235 grams)
1 1/2 cups buttermilk, room temperature (345 grams)
1/8 cup vegetable oil (28 grams)
Red, yellow, blue, and pink gel food coloring

Vanilla Buttercream Frosting:
3 cups unsalted butter, room temperature (678 grams)
11 cups powdered sugar (1375 grams)
1 tsp salt (6 grams)
1/3 cup heavy cream (or whipping cream) (75 grams)
1 1/2 Tbsp vanilla extract (18 grams)
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and pink gel food coloring

Instructions:
Rainbow Cake Layers:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line four 7 inch pans pans with parchment rounds, and grease with a light spray of non-stick cooking spray.
Mix together all dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt) in a stand mixer with a paddle with a few gentle pulses.
Mix chunks of room-temperature butter slowly into the dry mix, on a low speed. Continue to mix until no large chunks of butter remain, and the mixture becomes crumbly.
Pour in egg whites, and mix on low until just incorporated. Mix in the buttermilk in two installments, on a low speed.
Add in vanilla and oil, and mix at a low speed until fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula, then beat on low speed for about 15 seconds. 
Divide the batter evenly between four bowls (about 450 grams of batter per bowl). Create red, yellow, blue and pink batter using a couple drops of gel food coloring. Mix by hand with a spatula until the batter is evenly colored.
Pour each color into one of the prepared cake pans.
Bake for 34-37 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow the pans to cool for 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula around perimeter of the pan to separate the cake from the pan.
Place cake layers into the freezer for 45 minutes, to accelerate the cooling process. Once the layers are fully cooled, carefully flip the pans and remove the layers from the pans.
Use a serrated knife to level the tops of the layers, and then frost as desired.
Vanilla Buttercream Frosting:
While the cake layers bake and cool, make the vanilla buttercream frosting.
Beat the butter on a medium speed for 30 seconds with a paddle attachment, until smooth. Slowly add in the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Alternate with small splashes of cream.
Once fully mixed, add in the vanilla and salt, and beat on low until the ingredients are fully incorporated, and the desired consistency is reached. 
If the frosting is too thick, add in additional cream (1 teaspoon at a time). If the frosting is too thin, add in more powdered sugar (quarter of a cup at a time).
To create the colorful the buttercream used to fill the cake, place 1 cup of frosting into three separate bowls. Color them orange, green, and purple with a couple drops of gel food coloring.
Leave the rest of the buttercream white until the cake has been assembled.
To Assemble The Rainbow Cake:
Stack and frost cake layers on a greaseproof cake board, using a dab of frosting to help stick the first cake layer to the board.
Start with the red cake layer on the bottom. Top with a thick layer of orange buttercream. Leave about 1/4 of a cup of frosting in the bowl, to decorate the sides of the cake with later.
Top with the yellow cake layer, then frost with the green buttercream, reserving a tiny bit of green buttercream.
Next add the blue cake layer and top with some purple buttercream (leaving a bit for the decoration later).
Top the cake with the pink cake layer, placing it upside down to make it easier to frost (with the caramelization from the bottom of the pan facing upward).
Apply a thin coat of frosting around the the cake, to fully cover the cake layers. Smooth using a bench scraper, then chill the cake in the fridge (10 minutes) or freezer (5 minutes) until the frosting is firm to the touch.
Add a second, thicker layer of frosting to the cake, and smooth using a bench scraper. Place the cake in the freezer to chill for 10-15 minutes, or in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Place about 1 1/2 cups of white buttercream into a piping bag fit with an Ateco 869 frosting tip (a very large french tip)
In four other small bowls, color about 1/2 cup of frosting to make red, yellow, blue, and pink buttercream.
Using a small offset spatula, spread dabs of each color of frosting around the chilled cake. Feel free to overlap and have with the step!
Top the cake with a boarder of white buttercream frosting, and then cut in and enjoy

Top tier rouge like game!
You can spend hours and hours on this game. Something that kept me grinding on this game are the Achievements, I don't usually hunt for achievement, but the fact that you'll get rewarded by doing achievements is the best thing ever. 

So I decided to 100% the game, and I did.

The point of this game seems to be to die a lot. Which is, you'd think, not a very fun point. WRONG. I have had so much fun running around the maps hollering and shooting everything that pops its ugly little head above the ground. And yes, also dying in the process. I appreciate that you don't start at the same map every time, that would be boring.
The soundtrack is excellent. I like it lots. 
I wouldn't recommend playing it with a keyboard and mouse -- my partner does, and he has more difficulty than I do (I use a controller).

I don't mind dying to fair deaths, but a lot of time I feel cheated by some bogus powerful hit that isn't even telegraphed.  

The different classes are varied and fun.  The loader is amazing (think playing spiderman meets Ridley in the exosuit).  The game is short but challenging, and the DLC adds some cool extra modes.  I definitely recommend this game.  It's hard, and you will die a lot, but just keep playing, and you'll get better.

[b] Rating: 9.2/10.0[/b]

Summary: Great PvE experience, if not one of the best. Risk of Rain 2 is a 3D incarnation of the original series. If you can get used to the high starting death rates, the gamer rewards you with endless replayability, with friends and family. Monsters and bosses are memorable, and it is one of the few games that I peek at logs of monsters and items, as it kindles our collectors' dreams. I too recommend the remake ""Risk of Rain Returns"". 


[b] Pros: [/b]
[list] 
[*] Stable and low-latency multiplayer experience - zero wait times.
[*] Thrilling boss fights, and memorable enemies.
[*] Decent amount of secrets worth pursuing, and character classes waiting to be unlocked by avid players. Kids loves this game.
[*] Nice DLC addition that extends game lifespan.
[*] Highly detailed wiki at our disposal: https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Risk_of_Rain_2_Wiki [spoiler] ""Command artifact"" is one of the best artifacts to get as you can choose your items that best increases the chances of winning. [/spoiler]
[/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] Death is unforgiving especially if you die early and have to wait for friends to progress. There""s an item that evens this factor though (if one dies, it's game over)
[*] Secrets might be a bit hard to uncover if you don't look at wikis.

----------
So I gonna be real here, Mithrix's existence basically ruins this game for me. If you don't really care about that or you actually enjoy whittling down an HP wall with FOUR STAGES including one where your items get removed, then consider this a positive review because the rest of the game is alright. However, considering how long it takes to kill him if you get bad RNG on your drops and how easy it is to get twoshot at any stage of the fight especially the last, I think he's badly made and pretty much invalidates the rest of the game. If he were, say, a ""secret"" boss that wasn't required to fully finish a run it wouldn't be an issue, but he's not.

Still got a refund even though fighting him put me over 2 hours due to his massive HP pool, so there's that. Yes I got to him that quickly, game's not that hard if you have FPS/TPS experience and get lucky.

Anyway, hopefully gearbox doesn't ruin this game because I can see why people like it, I just don't, at least not enough to want to pay ~$25CDN (incl. tax) for it and the DLC.",1703821161,1703821161,False,0,0,0.446140915155410767,0,True,False,False

He activated an artifact of command so each item could be chosen instead of just being random.  Probably made the game too easy but I see now what is possible and why people like it.  I'll leave the original negative review below as more of a first impression but I think I'll be giving RoR2 more of a chance.

Original negative review;

You look everywhere for a teleporter, but none is found....

Don't know what I'm missing, just not having fun at all in this game.  The goal of each area is to find the teleporter to get to the next level.  The problem is there's no map and they're sometimes tucked in to obscure areas which are hard to find.  It gets frustrating running around in circles for twenty minutes knowing your run is screwed since the game gets harder as time passes.  All the sparkly lights around the teleporter don't help if it's hidden in a cave.

On top of that, four of the five classes I have unlocked feel awful to play.  What kind of wet noodle shooters is the commando (default class) using?  The guns seem like they're doing almost nothing.  Even with his extra abilities, you're just tickling the bigger mobs.  The bandit is fun, but it's the same gun every run.  His rifle and shotgun are functionally identical, just different effective ranges.  Each run revolves around simply relying on rng for items.  Leveling up does nothing except make your numbers (health and damage) a bit bigger.  The whole thing gets very repetitive with almost no player agency.

What led me to this game was thoroughly enjoying Roboquest (RQ).  Risk of Rain 2 (RoR) was at the top of the ""more like this"" section of the Steam store page.  They're just not even close to the same game.  RQ has significantly more meaningful player choice with a variety of weapons and skills to pick from during each run.  Leveling up there is actually interesting since you choose an ability every time.  It's also better as a shooter.  Weapons and abilities are much more impactful and every death is avoidable through player action, even if you don't realize it until it's too late...  You always know what killed you, why you died and how you could have avoided it.  RoR just throws seemingly unfair and unavoidable damage at you to end your run out of nowhere.  It probably got harder than it should have because I took too long to find the teleporters earlier, but we covered that issue.

Overwhelmingly positive reviews and 52% ""beat the game"" rate (based on achievements) are really impressive.  A lot of people seem to be enjoying Risk of Rain 2.  I just don't get it.  Everything feels sub par and playing was more frustrating than fun.",1703691352,1703735280,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1672957076,1703727944,True,1,0,0.489690721035003662,0,True,False,False

actual review: I can't say with certainty with how much i truly love this game, i mean heck just look at my darn hours of my life wasted on this game and i have way more to show for it. This game is an art piece, a way of life, an artifact. (lol)  Anyways this game made me cracked out so much that i had to reevaluate my life several times in the heat of moments in this said game. Countless enemies torched and inflamed with so much gas i feel like this game isn't meant for children, yet colorful like it could appeal to children yet they play GTA V instead like its no big deal. 🤷‍♂️ Every time i get into a run i feel like I'm on a bunch of soldiers syringes and goat hooves to the point where the game is too easy and I just make my run harder by taking a fuel array, even though there are mods to make the game more to your liking in terms of difficulty. But sometimes i take my time and enjoy the actual game in its vanilla form (base game), and I just have more fun. Sometimes it ain't as fun as when as I first started and sure there are not so good runs yet nothing has made me love this game any less and I am really grateful that I can in contact with this said game.

Within 2 hours of playtime, I knew that this would become my favourite game ever. You can tell a lot of passion went into creating this masterpiece.

I enjoy how achievements unlock characters rather than grinding/paying for them. It adds a skill element to the game. Another thing is that the characters ability development is very satisfying, and allows for many interesting builds. One extra nitpick that i might add though is that there isn't an inherent quickplay system, instead having a lobby list which is quite notably empty, and joining games mid match will not allow you to play until after the whole game is over. I would highly suggest playing with a friend, as it makes the experience much more enjoyable. I would say now that the game is fairly good. 

Run in a field and hold left click simulator. Occasionally you might need to stand behind an object, or even spam your jump button. Buy if you want high octane gameplay such as: Looking for a teleporter for 5 minutes on a giant piece of abstract art, gambling, literally just running away from everything while you spam skills behind you, attempting to bait enemies into a place that isn't a 40 square kilometer wide open field, feeling impending doom as you are caught with your pants down in said field. 

I have no idea why this game is so highly rated. its not that it's a ""terrible game"" but its just boring. killing enemies is about as satisfying as pouring a cup of water into the ocean, the maps look like they were made by someone taking a terrain tool and throwing their mouse in a washing machine, and traveling across the map makes you feel like you are trying to swim in quicksand. Take this review with a hint of salt as i have only 1.7 hours in the game, but i would suggest that you only buy this game if its on discount for at least 50%. I think its worth maybe 10-15 dollars.",1703447419,1703583968,True,0,0,0.458333343267440796,1,True,False,False

The leveling seems pointless since only items make a difference and they all reset. The timer makes exploration pointless. If the RNG doesn't like you (which most the time it does not) you get quickly ending garbage runs. If you're lucky and get good loot, you still don't have time to collect it. My last streak had me facing the exact same boss 6 times in a row. 6 TIMES!

How much fun is that? Zero percent fun. 

Edit: 28 hours in, unlocking every hero, playing through the hardest difficulty and I still wouldn't recommend this game. The only reason I keep playing is because my roommate wants to play it. 

None of the heroes are balanced. There are very clearly better ones and worse ones. And it really is mostly all about the items and when even that is pretty much all centered around the same items being used because you have to, and other items being worthless. And at a certain point it;s basically just humping around while your automatic items items kill everything and you occasionally press left or right mouse button.

Also, the set Left Shift as an ability by default and left Cntr as sprint. Who F*cking does that!?",1703224079,1703501631,False,2,3,0.468871593475341797,0,True,False,False

With every appearance, the disgust does grow, As it scurries and skitters, a relentless foe. No respite from its presence, no escape in sight, It spawns and re-spawns, bringing nothing but spite.

Hate boils within, a deep-seated loathing, For Blind Pest's persistence feels nothing but foreboding. Spawn after spawn, it tests one's sanity, Leaving players seething with pure profanity.

Madness takes hold in the face of its spawn, For Blind Pest's persistence seems to truly be drawn. It's not just a nuisance, it's a blight on the game, A source of frustration, igniting a fiery flame.

Disgust and hatred, they brew and they churn, As Blind Pest keeps spawning, there's so much to discern. No solace in sight, no reprieve from its reign, It's a force to despise, a relentless bane.

So here's to the players who've felt its cruel sting, The ones who've faced Blind Pest, that vile spawning thing. May your hatred be heard, may your anger find voice, For Blind Pest's relentless spawn leaves no room to rejoice.",1703366450,1703444217,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

Graphics are decent, nothing insane but they are pleasing to the eye and work well aesthetically.

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

Great roguelike gameplay, good meta progression that doesn't make you overpowered, gives you  a nice feeling of getting better after every run, very fun, you will find yourself playing for much longer than you thought you would. Core mechanics are very well built and each character offers a unique playstyle.

---{ Audio }---
☑ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

I cannot express in words how awesome the audio design is, and how incredibly beautiful the music in this game is, search up any of the OSTs in this game and you will get an amazing auditory experience. 

---{ Audience }---
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐  Grandma

Good for majority, difficulty adjustment is available in case it's too hard, but you get better as you play so there is no real need to worry about that. Should mention that people with physical issues that make it hard to play demanding games should think twice, it is still possible to play just a ton harder.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☑ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

It's not the most taxing game but towards the end of each run, things get very hectic and may slow down your PC.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

It's pretty demanding at higher difficulties to keep your attention and keep moving around, however, when you get the hang of things, it's pretty easy overall unless you enter into Eclipse modes which add modifiers to your runs that make it harder, hence it is hard to master but pretty easy to learn.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

There isn't too much in terms of grinding, just some at the beginning to unlock items for future runs, however, it's not really grinding, you could just play through it normally without thinking about grinding and you will naturally unlock the items that are important.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

Each item has lore, so there is a lot of lore, however, none of the lore is shoved down your throat, and you don't need to understand what is happening to have a good time, tons of youtube videos talking about the lore if interested.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond

Roguelike, therefore infinite replayability, each run makes you better and better which gives you a great feeling of progression, after unlocking all the achievements, you can go for eclipse runs, when you are done with that, you could go for modded runs which add a whole different layer of difficulty. Great modding community, so there is an infinite amount of fun to be had in this game.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

The game isn't expensive, just get it. Seriously just get it if you are a fan of roguelikes and want a game that can give you tons of fun. The DLC is also a great addition to the game, so buy that along with the base game as well.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

Throughout my hours of playing this game, I can say that there aren't that many bugs, I have probably encountered close to around 2 to 3 bugs in my hundreds of hours. None of them game-breaking.

---{ ? / 10 }---

☑ 10

Conclusion:
10/10 game, recommended to all roguelike fans, great progression, hundreds to thousands of hours of content is available, great modding community and youtube community meaning there is a really good chance this game will be around for a long time.",1703360550,1703360550,True,7,0,0.560000002384185791,1,True,False,False

it is just way too hard for me. i even played the drizzle mode (the lowest difficulty in the game) and only once,ONLY ONCE,i beat the game.
but then we all talk about what i like about this game.
-the graphics are well designed
-its fun to play(especially with friends)
-the maps are so beautiful
-the soundtrack is an absolute BANGER
-its challenging
-the characters are unique and well balanced
-the lore is interesting
-the items are very good (except the personal shield generator unless you have an artifact that corrupts to shield into something very good)
-and lastly,NUGGET

so,if you have good experience in third person shooter, play this!
however if you are new to the shooter genre, dont play this.(unless if your insane)

The lack of clear item descriptions is annoying and you should expect to interrupt gameplay a lot so that you can make informed decisions, or have a Discord call of veterans to explain things to you. Supposedly this can be remedied with mods but I haven't touched them.

Final boss is also incredibly frustrating because it has several phases, most of which spam one instant kill moves. If you don't know his moves by heart, you will lose the entire last 30-50 minutes to one mistake, regardless of your build's usual survivability. Maybe it's more fun to fight in multiplayer (edit: this is indeed the case). Due to this final boss, unless you opt for endless mode, you're incentivized to only really pick items that increase damage rather than go for survivability... And you're also incentivized to not use melee characters and abilities. (In multiplayer this is alleviated somewhat.)

The above design decisions feel odd to me. Generally I get the sense that you are expected to really main this game to get a lot out of it. The moment to moment is fun, and I'm sure mastering the game feels great, but this game does not respect your time very much which sours my mood. 

For singleplayers: If you're a roguelike main you'll probably enjoy this game, and it's worth giving a look. If you're not big on them, or have never played them before, best pick up a friendlier one.

For multiplayer, this game is a great time with friends once you understand the basics of how it plays. I wouldn't suggest it as a party game, as I found the times with friends before I understood mechanics to be the least interesting - but once you know what you and a buddy or two know what you're doing, it's great.",1703228036,1703294199,True,0,0,0.513846158981323242,0,True,False,False

You can basically get enough crit %, get life on crit, some attack speed then some form of shield or overhealing shield on every character and ""win"" there is no strategy whatsoever. You need faster movement speed and a decent health pool too because on Moonsoon you'll get one-shotted pretty much anytime past the 30 minutes mark regarless of your stacks of teddy bears and armor. The 2 other difficulties are game journalist difficulties level.

Most items, I would say at least 80% of them are either useless or have a better alternative so every game with any character ends up the same except for 2-3 items, like mushrooms for Engineer is a must but can be substituted for the void version for the Huntress as she can shoots while moving for example. 
The active items are especially bad, only 2-3 of them are remotely useful and that is for a couple level before being irrelevant. The ""Trophy Hunter's Tricorn"" is particularly broken when you use ""Artifact of Command"".

Unless you're smooth brained, whatever you pick you can be used to finish a run, there's no real run ending mistakes to be made.

Multiplayer is horrible, people will steal your items or leave you with none that is if you find people to play to begin with. I haven't seen anyone in months, no lobby nothing.

Most artifacts bring nothing interesting neither, the ""Artifact of  Command""  completely breaks the game as it becomes so easy and ""Artifact of Sacrifice"" the polar opposite. ""Artifact of Swarms"" should be always on.

Most maps will feel too big and going from one place to another takes forever until you get too much movement speed and traverse the map in 3-4 jumps.

Most character requires some sort of combo or timing with their abilities but as you get strong enough you mostly auto-attack everything down and/or spam everything thanks to ""Purity"" and ""Alien Head"" or ""Brainstalks"".",1561782758,1703220500,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

While the first game was a side-scroller, the second game is in full 3D, often being labeled as a third person shooter. Fortunately, it largely succeeds at this goal and manages to stand out in its own right. If you enjoy either one of these games and can tolerate the genre shift you’ll most likely enjoy the other.

Risk of Rain Returns worked in large part because you were constantly forced to weigh the short term vs the long term. Navigating levels, choosing to take fights, popping teleporter events, and gunning for certain chests are all decisions that have weight because the game always asks you to pick power vs efficiency under the smoking gun of difficulty increasing over time, and often that choice can be extremely gray. Though the way items interact with your player character doesn’t lend itself to interesting decision-making on its own, it’s the way you’re asked to navigate through these challenges that makes the game compelling. Fortunately, 2 is able to retain this focus despite the shift in genres, save for one element that I’ll discuss later.

One of the best things Risk of Rain 2 brings to the table is levels with more identifiable landmarks. Given how the first game was 2D, it could sometimes be difficult to tell exactly where you are in relation to the rest of the level, which is an issue solved by the transition to 3D. Orienting yourself around levels is super easy to do now, and I rarely get lost playing this game compared to Returns where I actively needed to work to orient myself. Players can also now influence which area they go to via the Bazaar of Time, which is appreciated since there’s more area-specific gimmicks this time around. Abandoned Aqueduct has a button minigame to give you access to a chamber, Siren’s Call has a unique miniboss fought by breaking eggs, and Rallypoint Delta has a super expensive bot to repair that only appears in that level.

Players are also granted slightly more control over their loadout. Multishops are more common, allowing players to reliably gauge whether an investment is worthwhile ahead of time. Additionally, 3D printers/scrappers makes so that players can sacrifice random items in their arsenal to guarantee an item they really want, or prepare scrap ahead of time that is sacrificed first to eliminate that element of chance. This does expose a problem the game has with item balancing though, as I often find myself only using printers with the best items in the game (lens maker glasses, harvester scythes) instead of situationally considering duping based on what survivor I have. I only feel like I make that choice with Focus Crystals, an item uniquely good with brawler survivors and situational for all other survivors.

The Bazaar Between Time also lets the player easily purchase lunar items that are powerful but have significant drawbacks. They’re the kind of item that I wish was more common in Risk of Rain, having powerful buffs that are balanced by some negative effect, (the easiest to explain being the Shaped Glass doubling damage but halving your health) and as such are situationally useful on some survivors while being terrible on others.

My biggest complaint with the game that I alluded to earlier is the teleporter event. In RoR Returns, activating a teleporter summons a boss and begins a 90-second countdown. Once the boss is defeated and the countdown reaches 0, the player can move onto the next stage. What made this event so interesting is that it also spawns tons of enemies, and your movement around the stage is not restricted. Enemies stop spawning when the timer reaches 0, allowing you to approach the boss more easily and creating its own set of interesting decisions to make. This turns every boss encounter into a question of time vs efficiency, as you can camp out the boss and deal with mobs until the timer runs out, but that will increase the difficulty in the long term due to you taking a while. 

Risk of Rain 2 makes a couple of critical changes to the teleporter event: you can only “charge” the teleporter (RoR 2’s equivalent of the timer) by standing within a set radius of the teleporter, and while the teleporter event is still active (i.e. the boss is still alive and/or the teleporter is still charging) the player is prohibited from interacting with anything outside of the teleporter radius. These two changes combined reduce the flexibility of the teleporter event significantly. In Risk of Rain Returns, you could pop it earlier and run from the boss to explore the level as the cost of higher enemy spawns, and if you kill the boss before the timer hits 0, you can explore in the meantime to see if you can grab anything before going through the teleporter. In 2, if you don’t struggle with a boss there’s often minutes of wasted time spent waiting for the teleporter to fully charge so you can finally play the game again. Though this could make searching for chests after the event more committal, I don’t think it’s worth all the dead space created in the event you shred the boss. At the same time, I recognize having some limiter on the player’s movement is necessary, as it is far easier to dodge attacks in an enclosed 3D space than an enclosed 2D space. I would propose solving this issue by making chests openable during teleporter events and making the teleporter charge much more slowly instead of not at all if you step outside the radius. Because difficulty increases over time, fighting permanently outside of the teleporter event would be a poor idea. This would make running away from a teleporter event to maybe loot chests or deal with mobs sub-optimal and inefficient, but not outright impossible, which could improve the dynamic of teleporter events significantly.

Overall, Risk of Rain 2 improves some things from Returns’ formula but the flow of the game being interrupted by teleporter events makes me go back and forth on which one I prefer more. Overall though, Risk of Rain 2 made the jump to 3D pretty well all things considered, if you played the first game and liked it or find this game interesting from my review and enjoy third person shooters I’d recommend giving it a go.

Risk of Rain 2 is probably up there with Dead Cells and Hades as some of the best Roguelikes I've ever played.

I also love the difficulty mechanic where as the timer goes up the difficulty increases, it really pushes you to clear areas fast and puts that classic Roguelike pressure on you despite how different many of its core mechanics are.

A friend convinced me to play this game, and what an amazing experience it has been: Risk of Rain 2 is earth-shatteringly good. In my personal opinion, where an ever expanding ""deep as a puddle"" games continue to dissapoint and clutter the good games out there, this shining gem of a game proved to me that Rogue-Likes truly are IMPRESSIVE.

Risk of Rain's 2 gameplay is pretty straightfoward: you select a character with its determined ability kit, you spawn on the first map, kill monsters, collect coins, aquire items, become stronger... and then you die. And you learn from that mistake and do it all over again, and again, and AGAIN! Until either you fall just short of the Final Boss (or die to the Final Boss also) or you triumph and finish your run.
Trough your run you most likely unlocked some items, a new character or a new piece of kit. So off you go again to race towards the moon, realizing that if you loop just before the final boss, you can go gather more items and BECOME EVEN STRONGER, but the dificulty spikes up the longer you take to reach the BBEG. It becomes a risk vs reward adventure every single run, because you need to carefully balance your aquired item pool, if its refined towards a ""build"" that either you are following to a tee or that you stumbled into via good luck in shrines, chests and visists to a certain place away from time and space.
Eventually, YOU BECOME GOD yourself and go to beat the living hell out of the Final Boss (who much like the man with the capital G himself) is not too pleased to learn you decided he has to die...

But dont think you've beaten the game that easily: secret bosses, endless looping possibilities, ever increasing odds and of course the ability to mod the game, makes Risk of Rain 2 one of the best purchases for a deep and engaging mechanical and story expirience. I say story, because the story of the game is in its logs for items, monsters, stages and playable characters. Cryptic like Dark Souls, Mestirious like H.P Lovecraft - that would be my comparrison of this games lore and tales BIG and small, of those who landed on Petrichor V.

All in all, a satisfying game, with a massive replay factor and an easy escape from the usual AAA ""cutscene-action-cutscene"" games. Its will captivate you, it will challenge you and you will like it.
If I had to put a number to this game on a 0 to 10 scale: EASILY a 9.5 out of 10.
Reasons:
-Great Gameplay and Action
-Deep Mechanical Item system with amazing potential to Dominate (Brake) the Game
-Intriguing Lore and Setting
-Stupidly Amazing Fun with Friends (up to four)",1702978587,1702978587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is like a typical action roguelike but with a few different twists like the amount of time you spend determines the difficulty of the creatures and the cost of items. This encourages you to speedrun each stage so that you can kill stuff easier and get more items. The gameplay is typically [spoiler] you spawn into a stage, which is a mediumish sized map, you kill creatures to get money, spend the money on items, then you start the teleportal to take you to the next stage. There are variations to how you can proceed but that’s the gist of it [/spoiler]. Although the process may seem simple and boring, the variety of items, enemies, characters, locations, etc. makes going through the process different and fun each time you do it. The whole game isn’t RNG, you get to have some control like being able to continue with your run or kill the final boss. The game requires you to do challenges in order to get more items, characters, and abilities. Some of them are easy and some seem to be nearly impossible but that doesn’t discourage me from attempting to do them. There is sort of a story, but I haven’t looked into it much.
 
The game runs and looks great on my RTX 3060 TI on max settings. After running through 20ish stages in a row I see a little bit of lag here and there, depending on the enemies and items I am using. You don’t really need a powerful computer to run this.

I bought this awhile back and paid $20 for this and I would say it’s worth the price. I recently got back into playing it but this time with a friend and I would say it makes the game even better. Playing by yourself you get to take all of the items in the area, but with a friend you might want to share those items so that they can help clear the stage faster (or you can just be a greedy little goblin).

The game is still being updated and cared for. As of now, there is one DLC that you can buy and another one on the way. I am hoping to purchase it soon because it adds a lot more to the game.

gameplay in and of itself is great, because not only can you go for whatever builds you really want but you can choose which character and abilities you want to start with, and if you have played the game for a bit you could unlock modifiers to change how each run goes along with a pretty good gameplay loop with a balanced variety of items for different uses, rarities and even certain items that have tradeoffs because otherwise their effects would just be too strong.

the music is a real 10/good, slaps harder than it has the right to do, now i dont look up the names of the songs but trust me if you are too far into a run and start to get bored, the music either kicking up a notch or changing is a real lifesaver. i dont know how chris crusty-sock-doodle or however his name is written makes such amazing music.

the alternative gameplay options for gamemodes like prismatic challenges or eclipse runs are also a great way to change pace if you ever feel like you wanted more or want to play another way, these are great options, game also has multiplayer, not great, would not recommend, friends steal EVERYTHING, find a legendary chest that drops a red item you really wanted? yoinky sploinky.

now... the unlockables and the lore, i myself have not unlocked all artifacts or all log entries or even know the general lore of the game, but oh man am i a sucker for a game with some great secrets and BOUNTIFUL lore, for every item or log entry you unlock there is a small amount of lore text that accompanies said item that you can view at any time, along with 3d models of said items or creatures or generally anything, now i have to admit that some secrets that are quite well known, i didnt even know about until like 3 or 4 hours of playtime ago, and im sure there are some secrets i wont even find, mostly because im more blind than a stoned bat.

Even though it may be abandoned by Hopoo (or at least that's what I heard) it still is, and will always be, an amazing game. I dont read all the lore files in this game, but its a lot. Every item, character, boss, and map has its own unique and tiny story about what it is or just a piece of lore. Plus, I generally think its a game you could lose a bunch of hours in.

However, I've always be absolute garbage at shooters. Probably for the same reason I wasn't any good at sports: hand-eye coordination. That said, somehow I'm actually good at this game? And not just on Huntress (although she is my go-to for casual runs) but characters like Bandit, Captain, REX and Engineer. What's more is that the game is fun and utilizes the roguelike elements very well. I'm used to roguelikes. Some of my top games are Nuclear Throne and Slay The Spire. But I never expected to enjoy the 3rd-person shooter elements of RoR2. Honestly? That speaks to how good of a game it is. There's a really nice spread of items to boost your playthrough, and the characters give you a diverse amount of playstyles. Even when you do get the rare ""bad"" item, the flow of the game still keeps it fun, as a good item could be right around the corner. And when you do get those good items?  Elevates the run that much more. Multiplayer is good and makes the game even much more fun. I really appreciate the art, writing and music that went into this game. Really cool artstyle and very entertaining logs. And what's not to love about Chris Christodoulou's musical stylings. Really adds to the atmosphere.

I'm not one for number scores, so I'm gonna rip a page from the Completionist. If you like roguelikes and you enjoyed the first Risk of Rain, Play it. If you like 3rd-person shooters and action, definitely Play it.

Title: Risk of Rain 2 - A Pinnacle in Roguelike Innovation

Introduction:

Risk of Rain 2 has emerged as a frontrunner in the realm of roguelike games, captivating both newcomers and veterans alike with its dynamic gameplay, immersive world, and innovative mechanics. This review aims to elucidate why Risk of Rain 2 stands out as the best roguelike game to date.

Dynamic Gameplay:

One of the standout features of Risk of Rain 2 is its dynamic and fast-paced gameplay. The transition from a 2D platformer (Risk of Rain) to a fully realized 3D world has elevated the gaming experience. The real-time combat, combined with procedurally generated environments, creates a sense of unpredictability that keeps players on their toes. The game successfully marries the excitement of intense combat with the strategic depth that defines the roguelike genre.

Character Variety and Customization:

Risk of Rain 2 boasts a diverse roster of characters, each with unique abilities and playstyles. From the agile Huntress to the hulking Engineer, the game offers a wide array of options to suit different player preferences. The inclusion of artifacts, which modify the game's rules and mechanics, further enhances replayability by allowing players to tailor their experience. The synergy between different character abilities and items adds an extra layer of complexity, ensuring that each run feels distinct.

Stunning Visuals and Atmosphere:

The transition to a 3D environment has allowed Risk of Rain 2 to showcase breathtaking visuals that immerse players in a captivating world. The art direction is commendable, with vibrant colors, detailed environments, and visually striking enemies. The atmospheric soundtrack complements the gameplay, creating an immersive experience that draws players into the game's world.

Innovative Cooperative Multiplayer:

Risk of Rain 2 excels not only as a single-player experience but also as a cooperative multiplayer game. The seamless integration of multiplayer, supporting up to four players, enhances the enjoyment as friends can strategize, share items, and tackle challenges together. The scaling difficulty ensures that multiplayer doesn't diminish the challenge, providing an engaging and cooperative experience that few roguelikes achieve.

Continued Development and Community Engagement:

The commitment of the development team to ongoing updates and community engagement has played a crucial role in Risk of Rain 2's success. Regular content drops, balance adjustments, and community events have kept the player base invested and excited. The developers' receptiveness to player feedback has fostered a strong sense of community, making players feel heard and appreciated.

Conclusion:

Risk of Rain 2 is a testament to the evolution of roguelike games, setting a new standard for the genre. Its dynamic gameplay, diverse character roster, stunning visuals, cooperative multiplayer, and ongoing development make it a standout title in the gaming industry. The game not only embraces the core elements of roguelikes but elevates them to create an unparalleled gaming experience. Risk of Rain 2 stands tall as the best roguelike game ever, capturing the essence of the genre while pushing the boundaries of innovation.",1702270014,1702270014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has around 150 items, which seems a lot, but consider 50% of all those unusable.
A few white items can gradually outperform your average red/green and even some yellows (Duke/knurl/planula lol) making 60% of the items just simply trash because ""there's a better alternative"", or it's outright bad.
You never want a bauldron/poon/infusion/leeching seed/daisy/Stealthkit/razorwire and quail I guess cause it messes with your momentum to a degree I guess? But the rest is just existing for being put into green scrap.
80% of the reds are just shit (alien head/aegis/IDP/happiest mask/wake of vultures/ rejuv rack/bhaos)
and worst of all, most items are simply outperformed by void items and/or their void counterpart (plute/sspaces eg, putting vand aside).
What does a medkit do, a tougher times, monster tooth, warbanner or most Elixirs?
They go into scrap because they don't ""aid your build for mithrix"".
Maybe it's a good game for casuals? dunno?
Why I stopped playing after 800h?
Lack of stages/enemy variety/boss variety and the felt ""need"" to grind Eclipse levels which is doing the same 14 stages, eight times, on 13 different survivors.
It's just so repetitive. The game has like 12 enemy types which share 2 AIs (approach-attack / attack-when-approached) and -both- can be outperformed by walking in circles. 
The past few runs on trying to get Acrid to E8 I noticed i just ""don't wanna do this anymore"" so I quit multiple  (winnable) runs straight to my desktop.
Even worse, I streamed my grind on twitch in the beginning of 2023, which got me confronted with the respective community.
I've -NEVER EVER- seen so much atrocious gatekeeping. Comments like ""Well, you're free to not play optimally but be wary there's an optimal way"" ""I will not watch a ror2 stream that is not Eclipse 8"" amongst others will leave you subjectively and constantly judged by those who have already attained their ""E8 Gold badge"".
Should you still buy this, if you enjoy killing enemies for money to open lootboxes and get stronger (and walk in circles all the time)?
Yes.
Why'd I go to 50% and then 60%? Some of the trash items still have synergy when paired with good ones.",1680461035,1702250817,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

On harder difficulties the game can be challenging, but that is what makes the game fun. The game wouldn't be fun if you beat it all the time. There is a ton of replayability also, because of the huge variety of characters. Each time I tried out a new character I thought, THIS is the best one. And then I tried another, and my opinion quickly changed. I have never played a game that has me stumped on which character is my favorite or the best, because each one is just amazing. Each character is completely different from the last. On top of that, the game features beautiful audio and graphics that easily set it above many other Triple A games in my opinion. The game goes on sale all the time too, so if you are on the verge of buying it but you think it's too expensive, just wait until it goes on sale. I promise you it's worth it.

Anyway y'ever wanted to go on a power trip and turn a hard game into a world in which your only limit is the processing power of your computer?

10/10 OST, too. Especially the DLC. Actually, I demand that you buy the DLC if you're gonna buy this game, because man does that extra content change everything, and in a good way. Well, if you exclude Blind Pests, Blind Vermin, and Larvae. They need to go oh my god they hurt me so bad.

Every character is pretty fun to play as and they're all pretty unique to each other. Some characters take more getting used to than others, but nobody's better or worse than anyone else; it's a matter of whose playstyle you have the most fun with.

this is one of my few 10/10 games, i absolutely love this game and everyone should give it a go.

play it straight, once you've ran thru a few times look up thunderstore mod launcher and have a blast with add-ons.


Edit added at 250+ hours, with mods and DLC incoming, its still in my top 5 games and i dont think itll ever leave, i always find new stuff to try, new builds to acomplish and run thru. Starstorm 2 is a massive Mod to add, highly recomended along with any chars you ever care to try, the tesla trooper is a personal favorite.

Some are going to be insane because the combination of items you collect work so well together. Other times not so much... But you're not stuck with whatever item you get. Might get lucky to find a scrapper and a 3D printer. This way you can manipulate your items of your choosing. And of course each survivor is unique with their own skill. For example one item may not be the best for Captain but its a MUST have for Loader. Such as the (Back-up Magazine). I was also pleasantly surprised with how many hidden gems are in the game.

Here's several reasons why

>massive open areas with paths leading to no crates or pickups (traversal is INCREDIBLY slow first level so if you take one wrong path you will get behind in money).
>lack of a real matchmaking system. (you will ALWAYS be the one carrying or getting carried)
It's 2023, a server browser is not enough.
>3/5 times starting a run with randoms they will take half the items then leave in the first level.
>You have to jump through hoops if you get disconnected 
>The enemy spawns are nonsense. Typically the larger number of enemies spawns near one player at a time. Since you are all obviously split up because you can't share loot, someone is  guaranteed to get behind on funds.
>Does not feel like a team effort. You are all competing for a limited amount of resources on the map which makes the very high amount of dead ends even more annoying. 
>None of the characters have synergy with each other and you would get about the same feeling playing with bot teammates.
>The difficulty is wildly inconsistent. You will breeze past levels effortlessly, then on the immediate next level encounter run-ending difficulty spikes. 
>Every run must be played in one sitting, no saving, no coming back later.

It's a good game, not as good as the fan base tries to make it seem. 100%
