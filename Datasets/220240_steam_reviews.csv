It came at the perfect time for me, and I had a great time with it. It's certainly not the best game ever, but it has some pretty nice shooting mechanics. I loved scouting out a camp, and marking everyone with my camera just to run in guns blazing. 

The story slowly started to grow on me. In someways it follows typical tropes, but other characters are so wild and exaggerated that they're genuinely scary. Honestly, the thing I enjoy most though is how exciting it is to go for the next upgrade. Every time I needed to go hunt rare animals to upgrade my backpack in one way or another was a blast. The world is pretty densely populated with interest areas, and it's pretty large. I'm glad I didn't go find all 120 relics hidden around the map. The graphics aren't fantastic anymore, but in 2021 [i]Far Cry 3[/i] is still a blast.

This game allows you to explore a world that is so ""แถวนี้แม่งเถื่อน ไม่แน่จริง-ึงอยู่ไม่ได้!""

It feels like you were dropped to some island in Thailand, except with aggressive rival crews around you.
Not too realistic to the 'disturbing' level, yet surprisingly startles you sometimes with tough animals 555+
Every task looks easy but you need to proceed with care to succeed (at hardest level)

The game is designed in a way that you won't emotionally invest and get depressed too much
Stop whenever you have to, it's no big deal :)

first time I played this was in 768p medium graphics at 55fps average
not the best game but I loved it
it is kind of repetitive though, to conquer the camps but maybe this time I wont cheat, I mean using the sniper rifle at 1000 miles away is kind of cheating
and once you conquer all the camps theres basically nothing else to do, soooo yeah, not the best game ever but a good one and TOTALLY worth the money if it is on sale at like 85% off

it says 47hrs, that it took me 47hrs to finish the game, notice that maybe it could take you up to 35hrs, I did played the game while I was high maybe that slowed me down
sooo it could take you up to 35hrs to finish this game and maybe if you are in a hurry 25-30hrs

I rate it as 8.5/10
the more you play it the lower the rating
second time maybe 7.0/10 or 7.5/10 I mean the second time that you play the game you spoil yourself with memories, they are kind of nostalgic though

1. It didn't age well. Close to none support for an ultrawide screen, minimap takes way too much screen space because of that and some elements have really BAD resolution. 
2. Bot AI is utter garbage, enemies are as stupid as your average drunk slaver pirate would be but it really doesn't add to the gameplay. Quick example, i cleared out the whole outpost undetected with a .50 cal sniper rifle with explosive rounds without moving from 1 spot.
3. One of the most annoying and stupid things about FC3, effective ranges of weapons are straight up pulled of of the ass. Once something in further than 150 meters you can't hit it even with the most powerful sniper rifle, enemy will not even react to it.
4. It's just too easy, i played on the highest difficulty and didn't die a single time to actual enemy fire, only from fall damage because physics are questionable as well.

Firstly: Story ain't so bad. It's not the most original thing, but it's a pretty decent and consistant narrative, so it's got my vote. The characters range from extremelly interesting (Vaas, Sam) to dull, boring and people i'd happily shoot (Buck, Dennis). Jason's charcter arc is pretty believable, and it does seem like he's made his intended change by the end of it. HOWEVER - The end of Far Cry 3 is utterly pointless. Being given a choice when there's only one ""right"" option is inane and stupid, and I'd much rather not have to choose. in that sense, the whole ""regret"" thing is somewhat ham-fisted towards the end of the narrative, but it's not terrible.

Secondly: Gunplay is good. enemies have weaker heads, gun variety expands early on, and has a good selection to choose from. Signature weapons feel underwhelming, but every weapon aside from those can be unlocked for free, either through story progression or through radio towers. Stealth, however, is a pile of wank.

It works well enough for the first half of the game, but once you see the privateers, all detecions on the enemy part get ramped up ludicrously. You take damage at an insane rate, armor barely helps, enemy detection starts working from 100+ meters away while you're in soft cover, and the entire game feels frustrating as all hell if you want to be sneaky. The only upside is Takedowns, which are varied, interesting and satisfying.

Animals are a mixed bag. Some animals are pointless to kill entirely, mostly birds and rats ect., but also any type of turtle or crocodile as well, and sharks to boot. They just drop low-vendor price selling material. All other animal skins can be used for crafting, and all upgrades to ammo space, storage space ect. can be achieved very quickly if you go after them like I did. However, some animals are despicable to fight. Bears specifically, due to their ability to chain-knock you down and prevent you from healing or running.

Fuck the healing system in this game. Armor only applies to bullets, so goodbye animal protection. Healing can be crafted, which is nice, but the healing animation has a ""cast time"", which can be interrupted both by you and enemies killing your ass while healing. which happens a LOT. Healing without medecine is possible, but don't even try if you're even CLOSE to another foe later on in the game, because that takes even LONGER. 80% of all crafted syringes are useless,
and 90% are useless outside of specific scenarios - the only ones worth crafting are Endorphin Boost, healing and Animal INstinct (with the special ones if you can be bothered to grab the bits).

Thirdly: the optional content. The side ""story"" quests are shallow, short and reward you with cash. The ""kill this dude"" ones are a massive pain in the ass if you want to go full-on sneak with them because of the lame stealth system, but can otherwise be mostly ok - but i'd personally not bother. The ""hunt x with X"" quests start off ok, but can get properly fucking insane (mainly with bears). They are necesary. however, if you want to get the top-tier storage stuffs - though only a select 10 or so. Supply drop quests are quick and easy money and XP, and radio towers are a mix between boring, 
slow and fucking stupidly difficult because it's platforming in a FPS, of course it is.

Finally: Collectibles are rewarding. Relics give XP, and unlock two special weapons and the two special recepies. Lost letters reward you with XP and a unique melee weapon. Memory cards give cash. The economy in the game is very stable for the most part, and the save system is pretty decent most of the time. However, what the worst thing of all is, is the slopes.

I fucking hate the slopes in this game. There are some areas (a lot) that are hilly, and if you spend over a second on them, in ANY WAY, you will slide down. I died more times to bullshit terrain design than I did to ANYTHING ELSE COMBINED. The game's height and depth are awesome, excpet when the game tells you ""fuck yourdecision, you're going this way"" and throws you off a mountain with the force of an angry god. For a game that touts exploration, it's quite annoying how very specific you have to be while exploring, if you want to get to where you want to go.

In conclusion: Far Cry 3 is pretty decent. The game plays well, only very occsionally crashes on selling or loading, Controls very well, the combat is excellent outside of stealth, enemies are varied and fair, though the second island is a pile of wank. Side content is shallow but rewarding and mercifully short, and exploring is a mix of: Getting ambushed by bears, finding something cool, and falling three feet to your death after the game decided your boots were now made of oil and the hillside was ice. Would recommend for a playthrough, would advise against completion due to hill physics and inane object placement.",1509582389,1706910056,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Far Cry 3 is a 2012 first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the third main installment in the Far Cry series. The game takes place on the fictional Rook Islands, a tropical archipelago which can be freely explored by players. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration. Players can use a variety of weapons to defeat human enemies and hostile wildlife, and the game features elements found in role-playing games such as skill trees and experience. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates, and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The tropical island is absolutely stunning, even for a 2012 game it still stands pretty good in today’s standards. The character models still look pretty sharp with great facial animations,and the weapons and vehicles look amazing and still hold up well. The only time this game looks kinda bad is when you are in caves. You get this odd glossy look in some areas and really stands out (note that I was playing on Ultra settings as well).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay is pretty simple, but really fun and engaging. Besides the story, you can clear out outposts, which secures areas of the map from bandits and gives you a sense of progression which was implemented greatly. You can earn perks from traditional gameplay and doing missions. The perk system is simple and easy to understand, so don’t expect bloated and useless perks here which is nice to see. You can also buy guns in this game, but if you’re patient, you can clear towers that make the map more visible and unlock weapons for free. You can add attachments to your weapons, but they are pretty basic (also you can add camo’s which is cool). Hunting also is pretty nice to see and adds purpose, for example if you hunt a specific animal you can improve your ammo capacity or weapon slots (and many more). If I had to find a complaint, the fall damage is absolutely ridiculous here as you can lose a ton of health if you fall like 6 feet, so be careful.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]I felt like the story was actually really good here. You start off by having a blast with your friends and girlfriend, but soon you land on an island filled with pirates. A great villain in the name of Vaas will taunt you and do whatever it takes to k*ll you and your friends. The further you get into the story, the more you see yourself become an absolute killing machine. Vaas was a great villain with amazing writing. The voice actor did an amazing job with him and I would absolutely enjoy seeing him do more voice acting in the future. The boss fights are my biggest complaint here. Honestly it’s a complete joke. The fights are basically a quicktime event and really feels shitty since the villains are actually really good, it just sucks to see that they don’t have a memorable boss fight and it feels lazy. Besides that complaint, the story was really good.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]Focusing mainly on the Story took me around 20+ hours to complete. There are some mini games and side missions you can do that will add some time to maybe 30 hours in total. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The weapons sound incredible here. The voice acting is also really good, although the main protagonist does have some cringy dialogue and some of his lines are pretty bad, but other characters in the game do a really good job here. The music in this game “for the most part” is pretty lame, mostly talking about the action set pieces.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I have encountered some bugs here. Some AI will get stuck, some bodies will float, also some weird graphical bugs (mostly in dark areas or in caves). Besides that, There were no serious bugs that took me out of the experience.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance is pretty solid for the most part. Now it may be on my end, but I did get some lag in certain areas. Streaming the game can cause serious stutters and even caused a crash once. Besides those flaws on the performance, the game ran pretty well if I didn’t stream and was getting almost a solid 60fps through my whole playthrough. It could just be a optimization problem since changing graphics settings didn’t make a difference.[/td]

My answer would be a resounding yes. While it starts out slow, uses a lot of the classic ubisoft level designs, after couple of hours the game clicks and makes the passing hours feel like minutes. 
It has one of the greatest villains in gaming history along with a strong cast of characters supported by a spectacular story.
It has couple of bugs and sometimes the game crashes which normally would drive me mad but Far Cry 3 was so good, i didn't even mind them.

and jason brody ACTUALLY has some character development throughout the game, he starts off by being terrified by the first person he kills in self defense, but soon realizes that in order to save his firends and family that he's going to need to do more than that..and slowly he becomes stronger and braver as he get's further into the island and his Tatau gets bigger and bigger.

Far Cry 3 is often considered a beloved game for several reasons, earning praise from both players and critics. Here are some key factors contributing to its popularity:

1. [b]Engaging Storyline:[/b] Far Cry 3 features a compelling narrative that follows the protagonist, Jason Brody, as he navigates a dangerous and chaotic island filled with pirates and hostile wildlife. The storyline, particularly the character development and the descent of Jason into the world of violence and survival, captivated players.

2. [b]Memorable Characters:[/b] The game introduced memorable characters, including the iconic antagonist Vaas Montenegro. Vaas, in particular, is often cited as one of the most memorable and well-acted characters in gaming, adding depth and intensity to the overall experience.

3. [b]Open-World Exploration:[/b] Far Cry 3 offers a vast and visually stunning open-world environment that encourages exploration. Players can traverse a tropical island filled with diverse landscapes, wildlife, and enemy outposts. The freedom to approach objectives in different ways and the sense of discovery contributed to the game's appeal.

4. [b]Dynamic Gameplay:[/b] The game's first-person shooter mechanics were well-executed, offering a mix of stealth, gunplay, and melee combat. Players could use a variety of weapons, including a wide range of firearms and improvised weapons, to take on enemies and wildlife. The dynamic nature of encounters added to the excitement.

5. [b]Crafting and Progression System:[/b] Far Cry 3 introduced a crafting system where players could gather resources from the environment to craft items, upgrade equipment, and enhance their abilities. This added a layer of depth to the gameplay and gave players a sense of progression.

6. [b]Stunning Visuals and Atmosphere:[/b] The game boasted impressive graphics for its time, with a lush tropical setting and attention to detail in the environment. The atmospheric elements, day-night cycles, and weather effects enhanced the overall immersion.

8. [b]Innovative Multiplayer:[/b] While the single-player campaign received the most acclaim, Far Cry 3's multiplayer mode was praised for its unique take on team-based gameplay, incorporating elements from the single-player experience into competitive matches.

The mod has lots of QOL features, like high FOV, viewmodel, quick loot, press to interact, etc. There are also lots of features that allow you to skip cutscenes, unlock the 2nd island from the beginning, start with more gear, earn money and xp faster, etc. And there are crazy options like allowing you to play as Rex Power Colt from Blood Dragon, sprint speed and lack of fall damage included.

So yeah this is more a review of the Rakyat mod than the game itself, but as you can see by my hours, I have played this game a lot over the last decade. 

Additional note: If you have trouble running the game on modern systems, especially with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you need to lock your FPS (probably to only 60 frames unfortunately) and then set your CPU core affinity to only 4 or 6 cores in task manager.

""Far Cry 3"" stands as a towering achievement in the world of open-world first-person shooters, striking a masterful balance between thrilling gameplay, compelling narrative, and a breathtakingly immersive environment. Set on a lush, yet perilous tropical island, the game plunges players into a harrowing tale of survival, betrayal, and transformation.

The game's protagonist, Jason Brody, is a relatable everyman thrust into extraordinary circumstances. His journey from a terrified tourist to a hardened warrior is both convincing and emotionally resonant, anchored by top-notch voice acting and a well-crafted script. The supporting cast, particularly the antagonist Vaas, portrayed by Michael Mando, brings an intensity and unpredictability that elevates the narrative to memorable heights.

""Far Cry 3"" excels in its gameplay mechanics. The gunplay is tight and satisfying, allowing for a wide range of tactical approaches, from stealthy takedowns to all-out assaults. The game's arsenal is diverse, encouraging players to experiment with different weapons and strategies. The skill progression system is intuitive and rewarding, giving a tangible sense of development and empowerment.

The island itself is a character, teeming with wildlife, hidden treasures, and hostile forces. The attention to detail in the environment, from the lush jungles to the azure seas, is nothing short of astonishing. This vibrant setting is not just a backdrop but an interactive playground that offers a plethora of activities and side missions, which are as engaging as the main story.

The game also addresses mature themes with a thoughtful, if sometimes heavy-handed, approach. The descent into madness, the corrupting influence of power, and the blurred lines between sanity and insanity are themes that resonate throughout the narrative, adding depth to the gaming experience.

In terms of drawbacks, ""Far Cry 3"" occasionally falls into the trap of repetitive side missions, and some players might find certain plot points predictable. However, these are minor blemishes in an otherwise exceptional game.

In conclusion, ""Far Cry 3"" is not just a game; it's an experience. It's a journey into the heart of darkness that challenges both the protagonist and the player. With its captivating story, robust gameplay, and stunning visuals, it sets a high watermark for what an open-world game can achieve and remains a must-play title for any gaming enthusiast.",1705924179,1705924179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This might be a good game, but don't buy because it is an Ubisoft title. 

Ubisoft executives don't believe gamers should own games and don't believe it affects their in-game progress. I don't believe Ubisoft is trustworthy.

Why? When Ubisoft does things like update AC Black Flag on PC to remove fullscreen they break trust completely because the reason Ubisoft removed fullscreen was to invalidate player made mods for AC Black Flag that improved it's performance and graphics. They did this to target and prime gamers like me, who had AC Black Flag already, to want buy an AC Black Flag remaster just to play the good looking version of it and it's a psy-op of sorts. 

This raises many questions. Is Ubisoft is incapable of making a remaster worth buying without making the original game unplayable? Will all my Ubisoft games be updated into invalidation in their pursuit to resell it to me?

I think any modern capitalist worth money knows what that answer is. That is why I am writing this.

Furthermore, there is a quote I've seen tossed around a lot since the news broke that Ubisoft execs don't believe in game ownership. That quote is ""if buying isn't owning then stealing isn't theft"" which while questionably true, is made to be popular when companies like Ubisoft act in bad faith and rub it in to their customer's faces.

Say I say unto everyone reading this that for the greater good, so gamers may own games and so stealing may be unquestionably considered theft, Ubisoft must be cast aside and left behind.

The weapons were all decent, the Bushman is a great rifle, love the GL grenade launcher. The tower puzzles were neat, loved the layout of the camps you take over.  Loved the signature weapons. 

Lot of instant action fairly quickly at times which i find interesting because of the nature of Farcry games and how repetitive you get in doing missions and finding stuff but with way bigger maps in mind.  It was nice to have that repetitiveness but with a smaller map for a change. 

The things i didn't like was falling killed me most of the time, you take ridiculous damage for falling.  The turtle shells and feathers from turtles and birds respectively do not go towards anything to craft which i found weird, despite the $ you get at the store. Would of been cool to craft some armour with the shells.  The takedown skills seemed quite useless to me after you skill the ones with the F key and to take down the Heavy units.  I guess i don't play like some 1337 super leet player gun ho on military commando actions, lol .

The game holds up so well.  I googled what Far Cry is the best to get started with and this is what came up.  Its another one of those games that if I discovered it when it first came out it would have been amazing but due to the age and my backlog I was focusing more on the main missions and not all the side activities.  The graphics were fantastic for the age of the game.  The story was over the top and while it wasn't deep, fairly basic, it was great.  I cant believe they included half the topics they did such as human trafficking, torture, drugs, ect.  It was all done well and made sense.

While I prefer FC2's depressing and isolated atmosphere, FC3 improved on a lot of things that make it extremely fun and addicting. Over a decade old but it still plays exceptionally well with a great story to pair and lots to uncover in the game world.

I experienced more crashes on DX11 than DX9, sometimes at the 15-20 minute mark. Configuring core affinity (1, 3, 5, and 7) and forcing some settings (max 61fps, vsync, and HBAO+ if you want that) through NVIDIA control panel alleviated almost all problems for me. I also advise patching the game with the Mouse Sensitivity Fix mod off the Far Cry 3 Nexus. Low values might still be extremely high for some in the vanilla game and the small patch makes overall better mouse movement improvements.

The themes of drug use and damn near cultism under the veils of a struggle against pirates still rings as strong today as it did back then. The story of Vaass has to be one of the most compelling antagonist stories in a videogame, by the end i just feel bad for him and Citra's manipulation.
Shocking ending no matter which option you pick leaves such a bittersweet taste in my mouth.

However, the PC Port is laughably bad. Playing on a modern system, there are endless texture filtering issues (regardless of quality settings), poor UI scaling on high resolutions to the point where some elements of the interface overlap each other, and consistent crashing that is only redeemed by a somewhat generous autosaving system. In addition to the poor technical state, the Steam version is a glorified shortcut to launching Ubisoft Connect (formerly known as UPlay) which then launches the game itself. As a result, you have to do a mandatory online connection check with Ubisoft's servers, thus eliminating any ability to play the game offline despite the fact that its online content has been shut down.

When it comes to the game itself, it's hard not to like Far Cry 3. It's a fun and decently short action game with a fascinating villain. Vaas is one of the most easily recognizable and iconic game villains of all time, and that title is easily deserved. However, throughout the majority of the game the pacing is inconsistent and some plotpoints are incredibly contrived and convenient making the whole story feel less like something you control, and more like something you watch unfold. The combat can be clunky at times and the hunting and gathering mechanic is more tedious than its worth (primarily due to the limited space in your inventory in tandem with a lack of proper inventory management) however, for a campaign that can be completed in less than a dozen hours, it's worth setting aside a weekend and diving into the island.

In essence, it's hard to not recommend Far Cry 3, however, if you have any other means of playing the game, I would shy away from the Steam and the PC version in general.",1704565224,1704565224,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved the gameplay, story, shooting, 1st person view & all the characters were written so brilliantly that i liked everyone of them. My favourite would be Vaas since his dialogues were pretty good. For eg: 'Do You Know The Definition Of Insanity'. Oh boi, that dialogue keeps coming up my mind everytime i play the game or when he comes in the cutscenes.
The things that i didn't like was the amount of loot chest were there in the game. It was so tiring and repetitive. Driving was like a love/hate type of relationship to me since 50% i liked the driving and 50% i don't sometimes. I don't like that Jason reloads the weapons very very very slowly. Like he takes 6 to 9 sec to reload the RPG's. And the most important thing which i didn't like was that the game crashed non stop in the middle and i always lose some progresses. I lost like so much time getting the collectibles and then re doing it again cause of the game crashing a lot in windows 11. And there are no autosave for picking collectibles as well, so i had to save every 2 mins when am done collecting stuff in houses, mountains, caves etc. 
I don't recommend this game to people who have Windows 11 and have high end PC. But you can buy it for nostalgia purposes and if you have an old PC with the old windows version then you can definitely play the game in peace without crashing.",1704373964,1704373964,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fun:
- completely open world.
- only a few times are you channelled into a single choice.
- So many hours and I'm STILL discovering new things about the islands (new caves, new things to explore).

Top annoyances:
- unskippable cutscenes, even after the first time you've seen them. Developers who create those must hate their audience, or are perhaps TRYING to limit replayability. There's no excuse for them other than a towering sense of sadism on the part of developers. Or perhaps an even larger ego, in that they might believe their cutscenes are so good a person wants to see them over, and over, and over, and over? Nah, they're just sadists.
     My solution: Alt-tab and go do something else while they play out.
- unskippable cutscenes that require user input.
     My solution: grit my teeth and bear it, but each time it happens I want to play the game a 
     little less. Someday I'll just stop playing completely because of these.
- What do you mean I can't look around when driving/boating/flying????? Are you NUTS? Yeah, you can't turn your head when you're in control of a vehicle of any kind. If you want to ""look ahead"" around a corner, or even just look around, you're out of luck. Can't do it. At all. One of the stupidest things I've seen in years.
- Some of them have eagle vision and can see you even if they're so far away they're barely 2 pixels on the screen. Deal with it. 
- Can only climb if there's a pre-determined ledge. Otherwise, you might be almost superman, but you can't even climb a rock that comes up to your waist.
- ""boss"" fights are all quicktime events with minimal user input. Spend hours honing your skills, then don't get to use them. This is almost a game-ender for me. The more I come across these, the more I hate them.

That's all I can think of right now. As a whole, I find that I need some time between replays in order to forget the annoyances. But I still find the game fun on occasion, so... I keep playing.",1535347885,1704162434,True,4,0,0.519324123859405518,0,True,False,False

If your game crashes and you get the error code ""0xc0000005"" in the Applications section of Event Viewer, just try scanning the integrity of the game files via Steam. I did that, and the game stopped crashing. Granted, I was damn near done with it, so I didn't really get the time to verify if it was the right thing to do.

Either way, 89 game files had to be re-downloaded, so it didn't hurt.

P.S.
Play the game if you like princess titties

~~~ Old review ~~~

This game was so much fun when playing on the Xbox 360, but is unstable af on PC.
You cannot save game progress while in a mission, only checkpoints which are temporary (you have to restart the whole mission when the game restarts). This is only a problem when the game crashes all the time. And it crashes ONLY while in a mission.
I get the exception code 0xc0000005 in event viewer when it happens, but I've only seen forums from almost a decade ago talking about disabling an Nvidia setting, but to no avail.

The game has crashed 4 times in the last 4 hours.",1703897092,1704061199,True,0,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

- The map is pleasing, tropical but not oversaturated.
- The driving is incredible, both in the handling and the vehicle damage.
- Guns are satisfying to use, the recoil on each of them is balanced, and you really feel like you're using a powerful killing machines instead of a pea-shooters.
- VA is good, the NPCs are credible for the most part.
- The AI of the enemies is quite good, they are both clever and challenging, without having god-like omniscience.


CONS :
- Used to newer generation of games, the constant sliding on the side of mountains, trying to reach a collectible or an objective is frustrating in the beginning, infuriating after a while.
- I tried to collect a relic while on a side mission. ""Mission failed"" without warning, gotta start ALL OVER AGAIN. I hate the feeling of being tied to an objective and not wandering more than 5m of the authorized path.
- The system of rewards for clearing a radio tower is both unclear at the beginning and useless. By tower 3, you already bought the weapons that caught your eyes, so what's the point of waiting to get it for free ? (And cash is more than abundant to help you with your shopping spree).
- The vehicles despawn if you enter a cutscene/building. Nice, now i'm stranded on top of this mountain for the fifth time.


CONS (TECHNICAL) :
- The game regularly crashes for no reasons. I've a good pc, it's an old game without mods, shouldn't happen.
- The necessity to use Ubisoft's launcher (which doesn't remember your password, gotta type it twice every time) is BS at best, but I'm late to the party to shit on Papa Ubi.
- YES, i know your multiplayer service are offline, stop shoving it in my face every 5 min


CONCLUSION :
Meh. It's good, but not THAT good nowadays. If people say that ""it's the best farcry"", then i won't even bother with the rest of the serie
I know this won't be a popular opinion, but I felt more frustration than enjoyment while playing.

[✔️] ⚙️ Versatile Combat: The combat system strikes a balance between strategy and frenetic action. The array of weapons, explosive devices, and the ability to employ stealth tactics provide players with diverse options for engaging foes.

[✔️] ⏩ Pacing and Exploration: Far Cry 3 masterfully intertwines moments of intense action with serene exploration. The pacing ensures that players feel a sense of urgency in the main narrative while also encouraging the discovery of hidden secrets across the island.

[h2] Story and Narrative [/h2]

[✔️] 👥 Memorable Characters: Vaas, Citra, and the eccentric cast add depth to the narrative. These characters, each with their quirks and motivations, contribute to the overall richness of the storytelling.

[h2] Audio and Sound [/h2]

[✔️] 🎵 Atmospheric Soundtrack: The game's soundtrack complements the tropical setting, enhancing the sense of immersion. From the haunting beats during intense encounters to the serene tunes while exploring, the audio design captures the island's diverse moods.

[h2] Cons and Drawbacks [/h2]

[❌] 💭 A Little Repetitive: Far Cry 3, while captivating, can occasionally feel repetitive, especially in certain mission structures. The formulaic nature of some objectives might be a minor drawback for those seeking constant variety.

[❌] 🚗 Fiddly Driving: The driving mechanics, though functional, can feel fiddly at times. Navigating the varied terrain of the Rook Islands may lead to occasional frustrations, especially during high-speed chases or escapes.

[❌] 🤔 Some Design Quirks: Certain design quirks in the game may lead to minor frustrations, such as navigation issues or AI behavior. These quirks, while not game-breaking, can momentarily detract from the overall experience.

[❌] 🎮 Lackluster Multiplayer Offerings: The multiplayer component of Far Cry 3, while present, doesn't match the excellence of the single-player experience. Lackluster offerings in the multiplayer segment may leave some players wanting more.

[h2] Additional Comments [/h2]

[✔️] 💬 Additional comments: Far Cry 3 excels in delivering an unparalleled open-world experience with its lush tropical setting, memorable characters, and gripping narrative. The game's ability to seamlessly blend intense action with moments of tranquility makes it a standout title in the Far Cry series. While not without its flaws, such as occasional AI quirks and minor graphical glitches, Far Cry 3 remains a benchmark for open-world gaming.

[h2] Why Not 10/10? [/h2]

While Far Cry 3 is undeniably exceptional, it falls just short of perfection due to factors like occasional repetitiveness, fiddly driving mechanics, design quirks causing minor frustrations, and the multiplayer segment lacking the brilliance of the single-player experience. These issues, while present, are outweighed by the game's strengths.

[h2] Overall Summary [/h2]

Far Cry 3 is a magnum opus that combines organic gameplay, a captivating narrative, and a vibrant open-world setting. The Rook Islands serve as a playground for chaos and liberation, where players can experience the unpredictability of survival in a tropical paradise. The game's iconic characters, stunning visuals, and immersive storytelling secure a stellar 9.5/10 rating. It remains a testament to the brilliance of open-world gaming and an unforgettable experience for those seeking chaos and liberation in a lush paradise.

I love this game, I've played hours of it with my friends, and so I decided to purchase a copy on Steam.

Ubisoft Connect is invasive and gets in the way of me trying to play the game I purchased.
Firstly - I dont like that I had to install an application on my computer for 1 game
Secondly - I dont like that I have to enter a password for my Ubisoft Connect Account, even though ive stated its a trusted device
Third - Ubisoft Connect does not sync properly with Steam, so I'm not receiving my achievements
Finally - I've just received an error when trying to play MY game, because Ubisoft Connect didnt even ask me for my password, it just said it could authenticate me. I dont understand what this means, or why i need so many extra steps just to play a game.

I will not be purchasing Ubisoft Games any further if I have to deal with the unnecessary drama that Ubisoft Connect creates. No other gaming company does this?

Please make Ubisoft Connect LESS invasive.

All characters that had my thinking one way or another all the time; always throwing me through loops not too small to be ignored but not too big to be confusing. This game had me going crazy at times, from getting 6 shot at full HP (1 bullet from an enemy doing 1 ENTIRE health bar), to seeing how Jason still loved and cared for his friends and family through everything. This game truly was a great piece of work and I wish I could experience this in a more.... refined way. I'm hoping the next Far Cry game I choose to play is as good, if not better than this one. 

8/10 for me, Vass and Jason Brody MVPs for me but the supporting cast just don't give enough fuel to make me believe their stories and sway my decisions and thoughts behind them.

The save system. The game only allows you to at checkpoints during missions which makes it really annoying when you want to leave and come back where you left off. Sometimes you'll leave at what you think is a checkpoint only to come back and have to start the mission all over again.

Having to login to play the game. It's really annoying to have to login to uplay or whatever it's called every time you want to play. Added to the fact that the ""Remember me on this device"" checkbox doesn't even remember you makes opening the game a drag.

Lastly, Jason Brody (you, the main character) is pretty annoying. He come across as an impatient angsty hero  type of character which grates my ears every time he talks in cutscenes. This is honestly a minor gripe compared to how good the game is but it's so offputting since it contrasts against the other characters more lighthearted demeanors. 

My favourite thing in the game however is attacking outposts. Outposts are fun because they allow you to take them in any manner you choose, guns blazing, melee stealth (hard), or long-range sniping (which I enjoyed the most). One thing to note is that the game lowkey disincentivises going loud since it reduces the exp a lot which I find unfair due to the difficulty being higher than stealth.",1703558829,1703558829,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Need I say more than just Vaas. The setting is amazing and the world is alive. For a game that released in 2012, it really is a game ahead of it's time when you compare to the newer entries to the series.

The story is very cliche, go to a remote island and get captured and basically try to escape all while trying to save your friends and make your way out alive. Even if the story is cliche, the characters are iconic to the series and the roster of weapons and vehicles to use are a huge jump from Far Cry 2.

Just three things about this game that i don't like:

1. You CAN'T replay the mission/quest after it's finished! It's kinda annoying for me, cause i wanna complete most of the main stories/missions perfectly. And i'm not really do manual save in each mission i have done, also a big no for restarting story from the beginning (except maybe i want to do that on harder difficulty in the future).

(Spoiler ALERT!) I missed ""W"" key after Jason stabbed last boss's neck, even though the mission itself completed, but i need to see the bad-ass head-knife stabbing finishing move from Jason.

2. The other big disappointment is you can't skip cut-scenes! Come one bro, it's also annoying to see the same thing after you failed the quest (or if you start over the story, that's also WHY i'm struggling to decide whether i should play this game again for harder difficulty).

3. The last thing is about auto-saves in mission mode, it's kinda sucks at some mission. You can't save manually in mission mode, so if you fail, you need to start over where the last checkpoint is.

It's probably because i usually play the game that published after Far Cry 3, that's why they have more ""advanced"" systems on their game. Although from what i checked from internet, it's still not a thing in Far Cry 6! So i maybe won't play any Far Cry games in the future because of my perfectionism (ha ha).

It's actually simple to fix my problem, just don't make ""holes"" in the story/gameplay, so i don't need to reply the mission! Anyway it's still a good game if you like Far Cry franchises or FPS survival games!",1703097632,1703099644,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It makes you log in every time being a hassle, and making it so there is no way you can play offline, despite the fact that the online isn't even online anymore and playing single player is the only choice now.

The game seemed pretty interesting but I only got through about 10 minutes of gameplay before crashing and returning to the start again with no crash report either. Happened twice more after trying fixes. I can't change any real settings, or at least most of the important ones because the damn game reverts to old ones or whatever it wants suddenly. If I try to change graphic settings from ""optimal"", everything is forced to low and I can't change it again, can't even change back to optimal. If I try to change resolution, it ""changes"" and then after I apply it and accept changes, it reverts once I back out of the settings. Got around that by quitting the game and restarting after pushing the settings in the menu, but then it's stuck in borderless, can't change to full screen.

It also seems changing settings does nothing as I see no real changes in game in terms of quality.

With how ridiculously buggy it is, I can't recommend it to anyone unless  you're on an older computer running at most windows 8, since windows 10 seems extra prone to clashes with this game.  That you're forced to use ubisoft connect and have two clients running at the same time and that in-game overlay from steam doesn't even work properly (can't see the buttons) certainly doesn't help and just sucks.

Ubisoft: uses platforms and services such as steam, xbox and playstation to become a household name
Ubisoft: gets upset that they have to give percentage of profit to said services despite it being absolutely justified
Ubisoft: makes their own launcher to bypass their reliance on the services that gave them their position
People: realise Uplay is scummy, poorly made malware and dont buy their uplay exclusive titles
Ubisoft: WAHHHH nobody uses UPLAY... we're going to FORCE you to open the client even if you didnt want to, we're going to force you to make accounts, we're going to remove achievements and other incentives on steam to discourage its use... childish CEO's dictating very capable and talented development teams.

We're seeing similar disgusting practices being done everywhere. Off the top of my head: the management of ""fallguys"": using steam as an outlet to get a very large audience, and then removing the game from steam to bypass the 20% revenue share after using steam for its purpose ""advertisement.""

The protagonist, Jason Brody, undergoes a transformative journey from an ordinary tourist to a skilled warrior, adding depth to the gameplay and storytelling. The game's antagonist, Vaas Montenegro, remains one of gaming's iconic villains, adding layers of depth and unpredictability to the narrative.

The game's open-world design is a triumph, offering players the freedom to explore the lush and diverse Rook Islands at their own pace. The island's flora and fauna, coupled with dynamic weather and day-night cycles, create an immersive environment ripe for exploration and discovery.

Gameplay-wise, ""Far Cry 3"" excels in providing a wide array of tools and tactics for players to approach combat situations. The freedom to engage enemies stealthily or go in guns blazing, combined with a skill tree that unlocks new abilities, adds depth to gameplay and encourages diverse playstyles.

However, while ""Far Cry 3"" received critical acclaim, some players might find certain aspects of the game formulaic or repetitive, especially when compared to its successors. The game's structure, including the liberation of outposts and the completion of side missions, might feel familiar to fans of the series.

Overall, ""Far Cry 3"" remains a standout title that rejuvenated the franchise. Its compelling narrative, immersive open world, and dynamic gameplay make it a highly recommended game for both fans of the series and newcomers. While later iterations brought enhancements and innovations, ""Far Cry 3"" remains an essential experience, offering a thrilling adventure amidst stunning landscapes and memorable characters.",1702449571,1702449571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

220240,153363057,76561198274889538,0,46,2716,0,2651,1702632900,"Two things coming into this review surprised me, yes as everyone likes to rag on it is the first in a series of identical games *gameplay* wise. Additionally, there is a distinct plot device used in all 4 games up to far cry 6. But what there isn't, are identical themes. Far cry 3 is the weakest in the franchise, while being positioned as the best game for a number of other reasons. The very soul of this game, is a mutation on what could have been a very strong premise, but in order to shoot for prosperity was made juvenile. Immature. This is an MA15 game marketed towards 12 year olds. Every single aspect of this game is a byproduct of an era when marketing was locked into appealing towards schoolchildren. This entire game is marked by that strategy.

The game is fun, in passing. However it is predominately divided by excessive silence. A tiny fraction of my playtime was actually spent in combat related activities, the vast majority was spent just getting around the map in order to do sidequests and other minor objectives. What we call this today is padding, there is an obscene level of padding and we missed it because the idea was relatively new at the time. Nostalga is a deceptive thing. One of my greatest frustrations which ironically kept me playing long after I had grown bored, is the lack of opportunities to explore the open level design when approaching objectives or outposts. There seem to be a lot of outposts and things to do initially, but as the content starts to unfold you find that there are not enough things to really explore all the gear you can unlock and how it feels to use. I find myself testing anything I get on wildlife or in main missions when ideally I should know how it works.

Wrapping this up with the issue of the game's themes, it will only ever throw softballs at you. There is a rock solid set of systems that are genuinely extremely fun to explore, but the game is made trivial in complexity when presenting ways to use them. I know the reasoning for this, it must be intuitive for hormonal teenagers. Did you wonder to yourself about the excessive inclusion of drugs and sex? Maybe brushing it off as just a part of the game. Ubisoft did their jobs well if you thought the latter.  The idea that some guy from California can become a hardened warrior with respect and power because he took drugs and was given a tattoo from some freaky jungle shamans is a juvenile fantasy, yes I am intentionally reinforcing the idea it is juvenile. The weed mission was an egregious example. This was a game made for immature young men, reinforcing their immature young male fantasies. Narrative player growth is superficial (How much the experience can change YOU the player) and the entirety of the game has been molded into this more acceptable angle successfully for immortality of the franchise.

It was a sacrifice of what could have been a story few think to tell, like the tragic setting of the predecessor.  Future installments never again stoop to this depth, mechanically they are inferior to some degree and opinions are somewhat harsh on them for not being the original. But far cry 3 was an adolescent take on what would become a series of somewhat respectable narrative constructs.",1702289105,1702289105,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first thought playing Far Cry 3 after 2 is ""Oh this is fun"". Far Cry 2 is an experience, but 3 is just fun.

Then he dies and you still have half the game to play. I kinda lost steam after that, but damn did I love the last two action pieces. Going on a destruction rampage with a German is so much fun, and the helicopter getaway? Loved it.",1701921924,1701921924,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However, it's worth bearing with it, as once you start developing your skills and abilities the game rapidly becomes compulsive.

Pros:
Organic gameplay
Layered narrative
Fantastic campaign
Satisfying character progression and upgrade system
Ecology and unpredictable creatures make the world come alive
Great story telling, solid driving and moving mechanics, the tattoo system is fun

Cons:
A little repetitive
Fiddly driving. I only hate and love it because it's a realistic game it's funny and sometimes makes me hate it kinda.

Far Cry series is possibly my favorite game series ever to come out.

I've played almost all the Far Cry series, but this one is probably my favorite (downside Vas is just an ultra good character)

Even as a kid I played Far Cry 1 on my old pentium and enjoyed the relaxing game, but where Far Cry has reached today is really amazing how times change in this gaming world :)

I definitely enjoyed a few hours of fun, but the story is really short if you only go through the main missions.

First of all, let me just say that this game is seriously captivating. The open-world environment is absolutely stunning, with lush tropical landscapes that make you feel like you're really there. 🏝️ The attention to detail is mind-blowing, and the graphics are top-notch. 😍

But let's talk about the gameplay, shall we? It's addictive, my friends! The freedom to explore, hunt, and complete missions at your own pace is incredibly satisfying. And the story... oh boy, the story! It's like being in an action-packed movie where you're the star. 🎬🌟

Now, let's get to the juicy part! 😏 The characters in Far Cry® 3 are not only well-developed but also easy on the eyes. 😉 There's a certain allure to the charismatic and mysterious Vaas, and the chemistry between the protagonist and the lovely Citra adds an extra layer of excitement. 😍

However, I must admit, there are a couple of things that didn't quite hit the mark for me. The AI of some non-playable characters could be a bit wonky at times, which took away from the immersion. But hey, that's a small price to pay for the overall awesomeness of the game! 🎮💥

In conclusion, Far Cry® 3 is a game that will keep you hooked from start to finish. It's a thrilling adventure with breathtaking visuals, engaging gameplay, and a story that will leave you wanting more. So, grab your weapons and get ready to embark on an epic journey! 💪🔥""

This starts of as a group of friends, mc and siblings having fun on an island, then they get abducted. His brother dies in front of him then he almost dies and meet a guy. That guy changed his life with the will of the warrior. The mc's development is amazing compared from start to end. In the start he is the scared little guy who depends on his brother. In the end he is the strongest in the whole island and he does not care about the enemy and wants things to get done and do whatever he can to rescue all his friends and siblings. 

I really liked the crafting part of the game it makes this even more fun to play go around and looking for items to use for crafting. I also liked the skill unlocks in this game, after each mission you get skill points and with them you can get really cool skills that will help you in the future missions. Of course you can do the missions without the skills, but it will be much faster and easier with skills. The side quests will also give you some skill points if i am not mistaken.

The graphic is also good considering it came out in 2012 and i really enjoyed the game. The one thing i found a little irritating is that the text often just disappeared then i had to put on Fullscreen/windowed screen to get the text back.

It takes you through the ideas of deception, surviving, and making the best in the reality you are in. I personally think the story is amazing, getting you to kill the antagonist who's killed your brother and then eventually ending the life of the man who's caused the  death and suffering of your friends. I would say the story becomes very confusing at times, and boring but when you first start it out, you've very interested in everything around the world and in the end, you're really enticed on helping the people of the island and allowing them to be free.

In addition to that, I would like to say that I have a low end PC, and running this at low graphics increased performance, but man was it still very beautiful, so, if you fear not being able to run it, I can assure you that you'll be fine. (I have an AMD A9 Chip, and I'm on a desktop with no pc) If you have a GTX or anything very new, then you'll have a very beautiful scenic island you can roam around.

Lastly, the story took me around 5-7 hours to complete in total, however, exploring new outposts and getting new radio towers adds more time to it. I spent like 20 hours in the game total doing all of those things whilst also completing the story.

I have played this game so many times and I truly love and enjoy it, but there are some tedious part to it, but all in all this is my favorite far Cry game  when it comes to the character development.

The character development of Jason Brody his slow  descent from a normal boy to a killer who can't stop. you feel it the same time as he do the joys of killing 10 enemies then thrill of clearing a enemies outpost, taking the drugs to make your Immortal to keep you going just amazing path of the warrior that turns you into a monster.

My favourite story moment is just in an optional conversation with Daisy what Jason tells her of the trill he gets when he kills people and she  just looked shocked at him. He has gone so far gone that instead of feeling terrible for killing people now. He's enjoying it.

 in the beginning You are insanely weak, but the more animals You kill them more enemies you destroy, the better you get them more weapons the more ammunition in the second half of the game you feel like the f** Rambo when you kill people. It's insanely how powerful come in the later half.

The unskippable cut scenes detract from the game alot if you have to rewatch them, and even first time round some are pointless boring and go on too long.

Once you've got through the boring start and rubbish cut scenes (you're not making a film ffs!) it's a fair game with interesting crafting and adventuring about. 

Having completed the game the story is a bit boring and I don't really care about any of the characters, the cinematic cut scenes kind of spoil the game play, and some times your forced to do things rather than doing them when you wish. Also interactive cut scenes are even more annoying, press W while you watch your character move really slowly (get on with it!)

Clearly designed for console muppets and 12 year olds, it was fun though but glad I only paid £5.99 for it, no where near woth £39.99.

And here I do the same. Today is harder to love Far Cry 3.  This game already can't give you sweet aftertaste. Even if you have those nostalgic feelings remembering how you played on release and liked it. They're gonna disappear very fast.
So, this is a typical Ubisoft game. Towers, towers, towers, similar one-minute quests, towers, towers, towers, similar side-activities. Treasure hunting - endless markers on the map. Among that is a story. And that story is wonderful. But our protagonist's characterization is poor. Jason Brody turns into Jason Statham in one moment. A gentle rich boy becomes a killing machine right after he gets a gun.  He is rude with his friends, makes delusional statements about his role on the island, and plays messiah. It's difficult to believe him. 

Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3066240481
Those famous words are Vaas's. Probably one of the best villains in video games. You can play Far Cry 3 only because of him. 

Nowadays the game unoptimized on current generation PCs and OS. All this time, I've been having performance issues while I've been playing the game. Freezes, stutters, FPS drops happened constantly on my setup (RTX 3080 + 11700k in 1080p). Settings changing was breaking resolution and only restart could help.

Every time after the first launch, the game starts Uplay and wants a password. Probably it is a plus, 'cause I finally remembered it. Is it plus, right? Also steam version has no achievements, but they're counted in your Uplay profile.  So trophy hunters can be calm. Or not... If you want platinum here - you have to complete co-op missions, but servers already are down. Anyway, there is mod which can help you to unlock online features, but still...

Long animations made me mad many times, because Jason changed weapon, recharged or healed himself very slow. Enemies prefer to rush you on difficult level without tactics. Or if I can name their outnumbering as advantage and a tactical move.

Bottom line is the game isn't already capable to impress you. Play only story quests and if you're okay with poor performance and annoying Uplay. Anyway the game is not bad and has own remarkable moments as Vaas or burning weed plantation mission.

This is not a negative review, mostly neutral, but I still can't recommend it.

Far cry 3 was the game in the franchise that changed everything from adding wingsuit to better stealth and good gunplay and variety of ways to take down enemies especially in outposts (check clockner channel for creative ways to take down outposts), tho you have to be very precise on stealth becuz most of the time i get somehow spotted no matter where i am hiding which shows the AI is slightly shitty 
but one of the villians of this game VAAS alone is what everybody played this game for...michael mando perfomance was phenomenal aaaand ubisoft tried to continue using this formula of far cry on 4 5 new dawn 6.. so you can basically say this game is peak far cry experience that started everything and perhaps story wise nothing comes close to this entry not even 5 new dawn

- asks for the Ubisoft password every time you want to play it
- dx11 is set by default, even though dx9 looks the same but runs with stable fps without shutter (checked on steam deck and windows pc)
- cloud saves are handled by ubisoft...
- - SD won't sync saves after playing offline if you don't boot the game and wait about 5 minutes (without exaggerating) for the Ubisoft launcher to wake up.
- ubisoft launcher sucks
- ubisoft sucks
- pirated game provides better user experience... Like it's the exact opposite of what the steam revolution brought us 10+ years ago...
- pretty mediocre game full of fetch and assassination quests
Pros:
+ The game is still pretty gorgeous
+ It provides the same experience as Far cry 4-6+. Or so I've been told (I was never interested enough to buy them).
+ Nostalgia for my childhood (still remember how in my final year my classmate was going around installing it on every school computers... It run like shit but was still so much fun xD)
+ The game might not be very good, but it is quite engaging
+ People love this game so much that Ubisoft keeps re-releasing it every few years with a new coat of paint... Or so I've been told (Again, I only saw reviews of the other installments on youtube. I'm not desperate enough to buy them xD)",1699814060,1699814173,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, yes, it uses the Ubisoft launcher. But most importantly, it just does not work in modern hardware. 

I had a couple of issues: 

- Game dropped from ~150fps to <45 if shadows were set to anything but Low;
- Textures flickering so bad I would honestly not recommend anyone with epilepsy to stay away from it, just in case;
- After the mentioned flickering, everything just went black with only the HUD elements visible.

In conclusion, really not worth it. Spent about 2 hours or so file diving and changing a bunch of crap to get it to work but it's just not possible. As usual, Ubisoft couldn't give less of a fuck so, it is what it is.",1699489939,1699490114,False,2,0,0.548022627830505371,0,True,False,False

Ubisoft forces you to have a Ubisoft account, which thankfully I do, and if you for some reason get disconnected from the online Ubisoft services, it just kicks you out of the game! I sure do love spending 30 minutes on a stealth mission to then just have to do it all over again. I hate the fact that this might become the standard for greedy companies like Ubisoft because it puts a lot of unneeded stress on the consumer, when all that should be done on the consumer's part is pay for the product that WE paid for and we should just be allow to enjoy it from there. 

And not to mention, you have to re-enter your Ubisoft login info EVERY TIME you launch the game, even if you clicked the ""remember me"" option.

Also one of the biggest disappointments for me, is there is no more map editor. Because multiplayer isn't supported anymore (which for me is fine, I never played this game for it's multiplayer anyways) but also gutting the amazing map editor also is a cardinal sin. 

Such an embarrassment for Ubisoft to make one of the most iconic games of all time to then just come in 11 years later and ruin it all, it truly is impressive.

The game continues the gameplay concepts introduced in Far Cry 2, whilst at the same time, removing the factors that turned off people from that game (Namely Weapon degradation and the Malaria attacks/missions) and introducing new survival-based features to fit with the new protagonist and storyline. The gunplay itself is as good as ever, with some killer weapons both traditional (rifles and shotguns) and non-traditional (A recurve bow and a flamethrower). The new levelling mechanic feels surprisingly at home, helping to even the odds in your favour, and the missions you get are varied, and pretty enjoyable (except for the Doppelganger mission in the main plot).  The survival mechanics also feel welcome and don't ruin everything, with the crafting system in particular feeling really good.

Finally, there's the story which is really damn good. Easily the best plot of the series, with its themes of brutality, sanity, descent into savagery, and manipulation, all of which are conveyed beautifully throughout. The characters are also well written and pretty likable, even the villains. And although I could say more about it, I feel it's for the best if YOU, the player, delve in for yourself.

All in all, Far Cry 3 wraps up the franchise's golden years with a fluid, satisfying shooter and one of the best games of the golden age of gaming in general. If you're a fan of shooters and looking for an open world affair that's actually good/a game that lets you approach any situation the way you want to, Far Cry 3, and with it, the original Far Cry games in general, just can't be beat.

Game description key-points: a Low Quality Game nowadays, best to avoid

Overview:
graphics quality is bad nowadays and doesn`t present interest looking at it even though the story-line seems interesting.

the Game constantly crashes either before finishing the missing or right after starting... so f. this time wasting annoying behaviour.
Same issue was reported by others and no intent from the developer to look into the problem!

When it comes to gameplay, the Far Cry series has always delivered a fairly strong experience.  The last offering really tried to make the game more of a sandbox and provide more plot, but it often got bogged down in its own features.  Far Cry 3 plays out as a brand-new experience as much as it does as a culmination of the series.  The game is a sandbox shooter filled with options, but for the first time in the franchise, the gameplay feels cohesive.

You play as Jason Brody, a twenty-something on a trip with his friends when it goes horribly wrong.  During a skydive, the group is captured and separated by a band of pirates led by a man named Vaas. Jason wakes up with his brother in a makeshift cage in the middle of a jungle encampment.  Jason escapes and wakes up essentially drafted into the island's rebel forces, who are struggling against the pirates who almost fully control the island.  With their support and guidance, Jason begins to work toward freeing his friends and getting the hell off of the island.

Jason's evolution as a character is particularly noteworthy, as at the outset of the game, he has literally never fired a gun before and nearly loses his wits during his escape.  Over the course of the game, you gain strength in the form of the expected new weapons and abilities, but the narrative also has Jason evolving as he becomes accustomed to his ability to skulk through the jungle and kill.  It's interesting to experience his transition — and equally interesting to see how his friends react to Jason's increasingly flippant nature toward taking lives.

It's not just Jason's character development that experiences a gradual transition.  At the beginning of the game, you barely have any skills, short of sprinting short distances and the basic use of a firearm.  As you kill pirates and complete missions, you gain experience and levels, with each level granting you a skill point to spend in one of three trees.  At the start, skills are basic, like the ability to cook a grenade or slide along the ground.  Later skills are what really increase your feeling of being a badass, such as leaping from a rooftop and taking down someone silently or killing two enemies at once while you swim beneath the dock.

This gradual progression of skills and abilities is arguably more important than increasing your armory.  Early in the game, if you see two guards and want to take out both, you must throw a rock to distract one or use a silenced pistol to shoot one and immediately stab the other.  As you gain skills, your options improve, such as leaping from a rooftop and take out both or killing one and pulling a knife from his belt to throw at the other.  Since the game gradually introduces you to these abilities, you also slowly incorporate them into your gameplay, and you tend to use the majority of them by the end of the game.

That's not to say that your armory's growth is entirely inconsequential.  There's a wide array of options when it comes to arming yourself, from the stealth options of silenced weapons or the compound bow to far more aggressive selections, such as shotguns and assault rifles.  Many of the weapons can also be modified, such as adding the aforementioned silencers, scopes or extended magazines.  However, not all weapons can be modified, and even those that can seem to only have a few no-brainer selections. Some weapons are more based on preference rather than any real benefit.  Still, it allows you to have a bit more ownership of your gear, and you can even personalize them with paint jobs.

The interface that you use to craft items or manage your inventory is quite cumbersome.  Everything is buried in multiple submenus, and while double-clicking them enters, you must click on a button at the bottom to back up a level.  This makes it a pain to quickly jump between different areas, such as when you are taking stock of the pelts needed to make the next batch of upgrades.  Your rucksack inventory is easier to manage, mainly due to the existence of a quick-sell button that immediately sells all junk items.  Selling items that are considered actually useful is far less smooth, as every time you sell an item, the rest of the inventory resorts itself.  If you wanted to sell two dingo pelts, you'll sell the first one and then must find where the other shuffled itself — even if it used to be right next to it.

Using the stealthy approach to the game is just as viable as running into every enemy group with guns blazing, though the former is a lot more entertaining.  Guards actually fan out and try to secure the area when threatened, and you can also use this to your advantage, though it'll be far harder to get the drop on them.  There's a good bonus for doing things stealthily when taking out strongholds, but that's the only area where it matters.  Any other time, you can use shotguns and grenade launchers to your heart's content, and even then, if you use them to wipe out a stronghold, you'll still have plenty of skill points to spend in the areas that you really want.

The plot is pretty straightforward, with Jason slowly becoming assimilated into the rebel culture and losing his grip on his sense of self.  What makes the plot memorable is the voice acting, with virtually every character coming across as either genuinely well grounded or completely insane.  No one carries the latter mantle better than Vaas, and you'll want to catch up to the parts of the game where you encounter him just to listen to his special brand of crazy.  Predictable story or no, it's put together well and delivered in such a way that it doesn't seem to cover overly trodden ground.

Thankfully, the plot isn't the only thread that pulls you back to the game.  Ultimately, the biggest reason for that is because of how well the different aspects are balanced.  You'll break up doing missions by taking over a tower, and then maybe do a spree of stronghold assaults punctuated by hunting feral tigers with little more than a bow and arrow.  All of it is entertaining, and it gives you a sense that the island is little more than your plaything— a feeling that's only emphasized as your skills increase and you become a badass cross between Turok and Rambo.  It's for that reason that Far Cry 3 comes across as a fresh experience and ranks up there as one of the best shooters of 2012.

~

I've always come back to Far Cry 3 after many years.
Played through it twice over on my 360, and thoroughly enjoyed my time with it here on Steam.

The most important thing to know about this game is that it is a cornerstone that changed the trajectory of the gaming landscape.
Far Cry 3 was when Ubisoft truly discovered the power of its core formula and put it to practice in its most pure form.
The world is fresh, alive, and teeming with possibilities.
The scenic vistas of the beautiful islands, the culture of the people, the harrowing dangers of the wilderness, the frantic panic of combat, and the wonder as the secrets of local history unfold before you.
It is truly an immersive experience.

The interesting thing about the franchise is how stale and wayward it has truly became after trying to chase the coat-tail of this installment, which was lightning in a bottle.

The base line that everyone knows and has grown tired of is here: Open world, lots of weapons, upgrades, skill tree, lots of side quests, tons of fetching and hunting down items, outpost liberation, and guerrilla skirmishes - tied with a charismatic antagonist that is clearly insane, poor writing, and a vivid landscape to get lost in between encounters.

The thing that elevates this game over the others is its masterful demonstration of THEME.
The Rook Islands are alive with their own culture, and the aspect of the game where Brody (Snow White) slowly transforms from a city frat boy into a fierce and unstoppable animal with enough PTSD to fund a therapist for life - it's breathing through each and every piece of the world as you explore.

- The setting isn't rural America, cities, or mountains, it is tropical jungle. Instinctual, it is a kill-or-be-killed setting where beauty is only matched by brutality. It fits perfectly.
- The local culture revolves around bestial fetishes and idols that depict hunters, with the player's own exploration of gameplay serving to draw Brody closer to this ideology.
- The accumulation of weapons, abilities, and items allow players to become far more deadly and liberal in their approach, which correlates with the thesis of Brody becoming more deadly.
- Wildlife ranges from lemurs and hogs to sharks and tigers, there is always something to hunt and always something hunting you.
- The desperation of the locals mixed with their muted interactions and the poor writing of other jerky Americans serve to illustrate Brody's separation from civility and society at large and his decline into a feral warrior.
- The villains swap (Unfortunately so) with the insane villain posing an initial threat as Brody has to conquer the chaos and inanity of the wilderness to survive, but transforms into a smart and coordinated outsider... which serves to show that Brody's new enemy is the trappings of civility and higher function.
- The rolling landscape seems daunting at first, but traversal becomes so fluid and easy by the end that, like Brody, players stumble through their opening hours like an infant - but then forge themselves into efficient and ruthless warriors.

The beauty of Far Cry 3 is that Brody is just a catalyst for the player.
YOU start out weak and confused.
YOU start out lost and insufficient.
By the end, YOU are the apex predator.
By the end, YOU have to ask the question if ytou're ready to put the game down and accept that it's over, or keep on playing.

The ending videos themselves are horrible. Very poor options for such a game - but they serve their purpose.

Far Cry 3 is more than a dumb game.
Far Cry 3 is more than Ubisoft finding a formula that works.
Far Cry 3 is more than a fantastical escape.

Far Cry 3 is a philosophical journey that you, the player, is pushed through and molded by.
When you are finished with the game, you will have felt as though you've grown beside it.

Far Cry 3 is an unforgettable experience.

It is the third main installment in the Far Cry series after Far Cry 2. The game takes place on the fictional Rook Islands, a tropical archipelago which can be freely explored by players. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration. Players can use a variety of weapons to defeat human enemies and hostile wildlife, and the game features elements found in role-playing games such as skill trees and experience. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates, and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants.

Ubisoft Montreal collaborated with Ubisoft's global development team, including Massive Entertainment, Ubisoft Shanghai, Ubisoft Bucharest, Ubisoft Reflections and Red Storm Entertainment. The game's development was partially restarted in 2010 after the departure of several key creative staff. The team evaluated the feedback for Far Cry 2 and identified areas that needed to be improved or removed. The team spent considerable time designing the island, which they described as the ""second most important character"" in the game. Inspirations were taken from films and TV shows such as Apocalypse Now and Lost, as well as video games The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption. Michael Mando was hired to portray Vaas Montenegro, an antagonist the team compared to Darth Vader.

The game was announced in June 2011 and Ubisoft promoted the game with various companion apps, webseries and crossover. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2012. The game received critical acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its characters (particularly Vaas), world design, visuals, progression, and gameplay, though the game's multiplayer modes received criticism. Despite weak pre-order sales, the game was a commercial success, selling 10 million copies. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades including Game of the Year and Best Shooter awards by several gaming publications. It has also been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. Ubisoft supported the game with downloadable content and released Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the game's standalone expansion, in 2013. A successor, Far Cry 4 was released in November 2014. The game was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2018.",1697386964,1697386964,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are still great by today's standards, the controls are familiar, and the idea was pretty much the same back in 2012 as it is now: You activate radio towers to open up new map areas, liberate outposts, complete challenges, hunt animals for money or crafting supplies, and complete missions to progress.

Like the other Far Cry games, you start out being captured by the bad guys, and fight against all odds to escape, arm yourself and find your missing friends. You are befriended by the locals, who teach you how to fight, and in turn you become their reluctant hero. 

Far Cry 3 is every bit as immersive and engaging as the newer games in the series. I didn't expect it to be this good, since it's 11 years old, but it has aged well. It's fun, and I'll be completely hooked until I finish it.

For me, the only downside is where animals show up. Tigers, in particular, are EVERYWHERE. There's no rhyme or reason to where they spawn. I haven't seen so many of them since I lived in Detroit. But, unlike the Detroit variety, these Tigers get the job done. Just as in real life, once a tiger gets you just give it up: You're cat food. It happens annoyingly often. Maybe the developers were shooting for reality by randomly placing them everywhere. It could be just a fact of life that tigers wander the back yards in some parts of SE Asia. I'm no world traveler, so I don't know, but I can say that the American equivalent would be getting attacked by mountain lions every single time I run to the grocery store.

Enough about tigers. If you enjoy action, exploration, a few puzzles and shooting bad guys with a variety of modified firearms, I recommend Far Cry 3. You won't be sorry, especially with the 2012 price tag.",1697092504,1697092504,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the most memorable aspects of Far Cry 3 is its captivating storyline. It pulled me into the world of Rook Islands, a lush and dangerous tropical paradise, and kept me engaged from start to finish. The protagonist, Jason Brody, undergoes a remarkable transformation as he fights for survival and seeks to rescue his friends. The characters, including the unforgettable villain Vaas Montenegro, are expertly crafted and bring the story to life in a truly immersive way.

The open-world exploration in Far Cry 3 is a true highlight. The vast and beautifully designed landscape of Rook Islands encourages players to venture off the beaten path, discover hidden treasures, and engage in thrilling encounters with both wildlife and hostile mercenaries. Whether I was navigating dense jungles, scaling cliffs, or liberating outposts, the sense of freedom and discovery was unparalleled.

The gameplay mechanics are solid, and the ability to approach missions and challenges in various ways is a testament to the game's versatility. From stealthy takedowns to all-out gunfights, Far Cry 3 caters to a wide range of playstyles. The progression system and crafting mechanics add depth to the experience, making it feel rewarding to invest time in upgrading equipment and skills.

I also have fond memories of playing Far Cry 3 cooperatively with friends. The ability to explore the island, complete missions, and create our own adventures together added a whole new layer of enjoyment to an already fantastic game.

Years after its release, Far Cry 3 remains my go-to recommendation for anyone looking for a captivating single-player experience with an open-world twist. Its combination of a gripping narrative, stunning visuals, and diverse gameplay options make it a true classic in the gaming world. [/b]",1696794732,1696794732,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked the main story a lot. It was fully of nuanced and interesting characters, strong voice acting and some really interesting cut scenes. Unfortunately it had a noticeable dip in quality towards the end. There was a point earlier in the story where it had made more sense to end the game in my opinion. Even so, I still enjoyed the experience.

Overall game play was very satisfying as well, being able to craft drugs from plants in the ""jungle"" depending on what you needed at the time made it interesting to plan ahead and predict your needs. It also made it slightly more fun to grind all the outposts and radio towers in the game.

On that note, pretty much all side content in terms of quests, challenges, trials etc are very dull and repetitive. I would personally have preferred 2-3 interesting side quests that were a bit longer to the larger amounts of activities that not only were quite boring, but also felt completely out of place.

All in all I still recommend the game, but I would only recommend playing the main story line. Make sure to only craft, grind radio towers and liberate outposts as they are required, any more has no impact whatsoever on the game as a whole.",1696579111,1696579111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How did Jason even manage to kill Hoyt when he had both wrists grabbed and guns pointed at his head? He should have been shot dead right away when he even tried to move. 

And why isn't there an option to kill the Rakyats? They're no different from Vaas or Hoyt. The Rakyats put the tatau on you without your knowledge, and boom, you're now a slave of the tribe, telling you to save their people, find artifacts and claiming territory for them while sitting back watching you do it all. The only time they act on something quickly is when they try to kill you, your family and whoever gets in the way when you don't do what they want.

Vaas and Hoyt pay their men with money; the tribe pays you with poison, saying that's the warrior's way, but none of them drink it themselves. If being a warrior is held in such high regard for the Rakyats, why do they choose to test a foreign white boy instead of their own Rakyats descendants from the original warrior lineage?

The final fight with Vaas was plain and boring. Vaas died way too easily, and why didn't Jason or Vaas say his favourite 'Definition of Insanity' line during their final confrontation? It would have made that scene a hundred times better.


Additionally, the game has crashed more than 30 times. I had to replay the same missions over and over again. The game won't let you manually save during the quests, and the checkpoint auto-save doesn't work when the game crashes.",1696522221,1696523392,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

the writing is at many times cartoonish, nonsensical and even unbearably cringe, but there are some very interesting concepts being worked in the overall narrative and also some really neat and original (for the time) stylistic choices. gameplay is plagued by flawed design decisions, barebones AI, buggy mechanics, sporadic crashing and an endless amount of meaningless busy work that only serves to inflate the amount of optional ""content"" available, but you'll find some really intense and thrilling setpieces across the main story missions, and the feature rich combat can be quite satisfying when it works as intended. there are aggressively frequent texture streaming issues, several comically malfunctioning effects (such as Far Cry 3's infamous ambient occlusion, which generates shadow halos around all objects), a barrage of graphical inconsistencies and glitches, and lots of locations that seem unfinished to say the least, but if you can put up with all that you'll also find plenty of beautiful scenery and cinematic vistas during your exploration sessions.

overall, Far Cry 3 is a very uneven experience, but one that ends up deserving your time investment thanks to the things it manages to get right in very memorable and flamboyant ways. it's definitely not the masterpiece the nostalgia fueled bandwagon would have you think, but it's certainly worth checking out. by the way, the main theme song is an absolute banger.",1696023119,1696023119,True,0,3,0,0,True,False,False

After finishing the game, I was craving for more FC action :-D. So, I started checking out youtube videos and decided to start FC3. I know a lot of people praise FC2, but I just think that the graphic looked outdated. 
So, my second FC game, I take it slowly. I really don't bother with the main quest and I walk most of the time. For me it's fun to approach an enemy base from different angle and taking out every one of them silently. I know this gets repetitive really fast, but I play casually. So, if I'm bored, I just play other games. 
It there's one thing that I dislike, is the kidnapping part. I mean, my approach to the gameplay is stealth, so most of the time I'm really careful not to get caught. So this kidnapping thing is really annoying. good thing it doesn't happen too often.

I tried launching it through Steam and through the Ubisoft software...nothing. Get your act together Ubidoft. If i purchase one of your games through Steam it means it is a legitimate purchase. Why do I need to install your third party licencing software? Huge disappointment. I'm going to request a refund.",1695367536,1695367536,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game loop is same as all other far cry games following it, however it does lack some quality of life improvements established in far cry 4 and 5.
Did experience some optimisation issues despite having a capable pc (I had to run this game at considerably lower settings than I did Cyberpunk 2077 at launch).,
Otherwise, had one crash and no complaints beyond that.
Definitely recommend playing especially if your looking for a slightly smaller open world game to play and enjoy the basic far cry loop.
Did encounter an issue when it can to the pivotal choice at the end of the game, where there was no prompt showing me  how to choose. I ended up getting the ending I did not desire which was disappointing after putting 20 hours into the game.",1695343409,1695343409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like, the ubisoft/uplay drm is really unnecassary, but the game is just bad.

The story is really uninteresting and bad, it's really tedious and that speaks to the whole game - it's jsut over tedious for wrong reasons. There's many bugs like if you walk and there's a board in your way, it will stop you entirely, you can't just step over it. If you use a recurve bow you can't get headshots even though you clearly hit enemies in the head, enemies have really strange movement animations and hitboxes. Like if you just full auto at enemies they would move in a way that made most of the bullets not hit the body because of how they react.. 

Most mechanics in general are broken and while I really enjoyed this game at one point, it's extremely blaring which flaws this has so much to the extent that it's really just not fun at all. I use a trainer ffs, it's still way too tedious and enemies will still detect me even though it's impossible given the cheats im using.",1485372453,1695341921,False,0,1,0.420554190874099731,0,True,False,False

The combat, which I assume is the game's main draw, put me to sleep. The AI is hardly a challenge to fight, and has about the same level of intelligence as Garry's Mod NPCs that you spawn in on gm_flatgrass. There are FPS games older than this with better AI. The ""sneak around or kill everyone right away"" gameplay is just tired and dull. The story really didn't excite me either, but that's probably because I have seen it meme'd to death for the past 11 years. I really don't think it's that deep, and I don't think Ubisoft, or the series, has evolved at all since this game. I think FC3 made Ubisoft fat and lazy.

Definitely not for me, but I can see someone liking it if they enjoy big, Die Hard tier action games. Also fuck the Ubisoft launcher, there is no reason why it needs to exist.",1694981294,1694982247,False,2,0,0.481640130281448364,1,True,False,False

[b]Story[/b]
[Positive] Learned about the definition of insanity!
[Negative] The aforementioned definer of insanity was the only villain this tale needed.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
[Positive] Tower climbing puzzles and map reveal was magical at the time. Exploration was addictive.
[Positive] Outpost battles were tons of fun. Allowed for many varied approaches.
[Positive] Bow and Arrow gameplay. Explosive recurve bow.
[Positive] Fire spread as good as Far Cry 2.
[Positive] Wildlife hunting and skins to upgrades. I did most of these before the majority of the exploration to have a smoother experience.
[Positive] Varied means of transport. 
[Positive] The cementing of the infamous Ubisoft formula.
[Positive] Interesting treasure hunting.
[Positive] Knife throwing mini game!

[Negative] Remember to say no to drug syringes and gambling though.
[Negative] Also no need for quick time events for boss battles.
[Negative] Hang gliders were deadly though. Ziplines were not placed very strategically so never used them much.
[Negative] The famous Burning drug farm with flamethrower section: I got shot at so it wasn’t fun and so I missed the magic of that moment.
[Negative] I bought this game because I enjoyed Far Cry 2. A change from the realism in Far Cry 2 map holding and malaria.

[b]Graphics[/b]
Environments and character graphics were done really well. No complains from me.


[b]Controls[/b]
Played on PC with mouse and keyboard. Gunplay was smooth and responsive. 


[b]Side Missions[/b]
There are a few side missions and challenges in this game. I was able to complete most of them as part of clearing the map. Actually in retrospect clearing the map was the biggest and most enjoyable side quest.


[b]Music/Soundtrack/Voice[/b]
Didn't really notice the soundtrack here much. No complaints here. Decent voice acting by the games characters and excellent voice acting by the definer of insanity.


[b]Performance[/b]
Experienced no crashes and the game ran smoothly on my PC (which is a mid-range PC). It did not cause undue heating of the CPU and GPU.

My all time favourite game... then CSGO (addiction)... then rest  other games like POP... Call of Duty.. battlefield.. GTA .. most wanted.... assassin creed... etc. The most gorgeous thing in this game is animals... when gigantic beast creatures suddenly appear.. then I jump into car (LOL),,,, I always take my car as a protection kit, it is the only game whose animals look real... I don't fight tigers and crocodiles... except for mission because they were too scary... Once I was playing this game and yelled loudly when a black leopard unexpectedly attacked me...
I expected FC4 to be better and more enjoyable... but I was terribly disappointed... due to the limited number of creatures, 1 animal (elephant) has been added, but we can't kill him or we'll lose our xp... FC3 gameplay is superior to all others... Vaas' performance is breathtaking...  FC3 is awesome and close to my haert, I'd really enjoy to express and share my thoughts of this game to others... and when I discovered that a buddy or someone else had played it... I appear to be really cheerful at the time...

""Far Cry 3"" is a game that can only be described as a visceral roller-coaster through the untamed heart of a tropical paradise. From the moment you crash land on the lush Rook Islands, you're thrown headfirst into a world of chaos and survival. This review aims to capture the essence of a game that has left an indelible mark on the open-world genre.

""Far Cry 3's"" game-play is nothing short of exhilarating. The moment you pick up the controller, you're dropped into a massive, open sandbox filled with an abundance of missions, side activities, and wildlife that's just as eager to eat you as it is to be hunted. The seamless blend of first-person shooting, stealth, and exploration is a testament to the game's brilliance. From the intense firefights to silently taking down pirates with your trusty machete, every moment feels like a unique adventure.

The narrative of ""Far Cry 3"" is a masterpiece of psychological thriller meets tropical survival. You play as Jason Brody, a young man who finds himself stranded on the lawless Rook Islands after a skydiving trip goes horribly wrong. As he searches for his kidnapped friends, he's forced to confront the island's twisted inhabitants, especially the unforgettable villain, Vaas Montenegro. Vaas is a character so captivatingly unhinged that he steals every scene he's in.

The story's journey from Jason's initial naivety to his transformation into a true warrior is a captivating one. The game tackles themes of insanity, morality, and the thin line between civilization and savagery. It's a psychological roller-coaster that keeps you engaged from start to finish.

""Far Cry 3's"" visuals were stunning when it first released, and they still hold up remarkably well. The tropical island setting is beautifully rendered, with lush forests, pristine beaches, and underwater caves that beg exploration. The attention to detail is commendable, making the Rook Islands feel alive and dynamic.

The audio design is equally impressive. The hauntingly atmospheric score sets the tone perfectly, while the voice acting, particularly from Michael Mando as Vaas, is nothing short of exceptional. The ambient sounds of the jungle, wildlife, and combat add to the game's immersive quality.

""Far Cry 3"" offers a wealth of content to keep players coming back for more. Side quests, hunting challenges, and collectibles are scattered throughout the island, ensuring that there's always something to do. The freedom to tackle objectives in various ways, whether through stealth, guns blazing, or creative tactics, adds immense replay value.

In addition, the game's robust multiplayer mode allows players to engage in intense matches with friends, from classic death-matches to more unique game modes. The competitive aspect is a welcome addition for those looking to extend their ""Far Cry 3"" experience beyond the single-player campaign.

In the end, ""Far Cry 3"" is a timeless gem in the world of gaming. Its gripping story, outstanding game-play, and immersive world design come together to create an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a first-time player or revisiting the Rook Islands, this game guarantees an adventure like no other. Just remember, insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, and with ""Far Cry 3"", you'll want to experience its madness again and again.",1694274989,1694274989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At its core, FC3 is really good, one of the best Far Cry games no doubt. Unfortunately, it has two major issues which is why I can't recommend it.

First, the multilayer and co-op are no longer functional as Ubisoft killed the online service so you aren't getting the complete package. If you buy the game through Steam you still need the Ubisoft Connect launcher to play the game. This isn't unique to FC3, all Ubisoft games have this requirement now. I also really hate that the achievements are only in the Ubisoft launcher and not on Stream.

Second, the game is a technical mess. When the game came out it had issues and they've only gotten worse. FC3 is horribly optimized for PC, especially modern PCs. By default it has negative mouse acceleration which makes aiming with a m&k practically impossible until you fix it (can't be turned off in-game). It has constant microstutters and frame drops and (at least on my system) it crashes constantly. I beat the game in about 20 hours on the hardest difficulty and in that time it probably crashes at least 50 times, often right before completing a mission. I attempted every fix I could find which did make the game playable at least. Before it would crash 5 minutes into the first mission. But, even after all the fixes it still crashed pretty often. All of this on top of a ton of bugs and glitches throughout the game.

For me at least, I couldn't truly enjoy the game due to all the technical problems. Even gameplay wise I enjoyed FC4 and FC5 more as I feel the gameplay loop is more fleshed out and refined in those games.

Not having played it for a year or three I'm surprised to see that despite having upgraded hardware, it runs worse than it did a couple years back; occasionally crashing in the midst of playing (which is why I'm currently here to write this review...)

On top of that, you have to log in with Ubisoft to play, which is dreadful, and can take several minutes to work if it does at all. Just give us offline gaming without the damn Ubisoft login.
It really makes me miss the days of just booting up a game at getting along with it. 

Love the game, and despite it obviously having aged, it's still a ton of fun.

As someone who does not have the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia and strong memories of playing this game back when it came out, I found this game to be incredibly lacking and unsatisfying gameplay wise. And yes a lot of that you can blame on it just being an older game, so i think it is kinda dumb for me to sit here and compare it to the newer releases in the series.

I tried to play this game with 32GB of RAM, Ryzen9, and a 3060ti but found myself dropping frames and sitting around a varied frame rate anywhere between 20-75 fps on medium settings. also had some strange texture glitches and major shadow glitches that made the game look so janky. On top of this, the UI is horribly clunky with an awful bass heavy drone playing under the menu anytime i have to open my inventory, quests, or map. Every icon in the game looked like it had a distortion filter added to it. I couldn't tell if it was actually how the icons were supposed to look, and if it was then it was definitely the wrong choice since i could not even make out what the icons were trying to portray. 
I think it is also important to note i am playing on an ultra-wide monitor. So that may be the source of many of these issues. SO if you are wanting to play on an UW monitor, I would definitely skip out.

Far Cry 3 differs from practically every other first-person shooter on the market thanks to two crucial components: gameplay and story. I'll begin with the narrative. This game's narrative is wholly original. It starts off as clichéd as your typical B action movie but it eventually changes into something completely unexpected. The game's primary focus in the beginning is to save your friends from some evil pirates but the plot twists about half way through and begins exploring some dark and very uncomfortable realms. Without spoiling anything, you'll want to replay this story due to the sheer amount of possibilities the game allows. That's where the element of gameplay comes in. Far Cry 3 has your standard FPS mechanics and a plethora of weapons and attachments, alongside amazing enemy AI, dangerous wild animals, and a huge tropical island to explore. The missions can all be done in different ways, whether you prefer stealth with silenced weapons, or go in guns blazing with a rocket launcher and grenades, player choice is a key element. Besides the story missions you can also hunt wild animals (deer, buffalo, tigers, boars, pigs, deer, dingos, sharks, and alligators just to name a few), take over enemy pirate bases, engage in side quests for the Rakyat tribe, compete in races, fly on hang gliders, skydive, or just explore the island at your leisure. The only negative aspect about Far Cry 3 is that a couple of the missions drag on at a few points, but that's such a minuscule complaint compared to the greatness of the rest of the game. Far Cry 3's story will really make you think about what you're doing and why you're doing it, the main character delves deeper and deeper into uncomfortable realms and insanity, which I will not go into detail about in this review, but they're definitely worth playing through the game to see. Jason Brody's transformation is one that will leave you questioning yourself at certain points, especially at the game's ending.",1692290202,1692290202,True,13,0,0.675235152244567871,0,True,False,False

• The open-world is a giant island that feels empty with no notable landmarks, and gets repetitive after only a few hours.
• The missions are very linear and uninteresting.
• NPCs are literally the same model with the same voice, who offer hilariously one-dimensional side quests that were only thrown in the game for the sake of it.
• Exploration isn't rewarding in the slightest, with everything you find being a generic loot item that might as well be randomly generated.
• The protagonist is an unlikable piece of shit.

Seriously, I don't understand how this game is so well-received, maybe for its time it could've been fun to play, but it certainly has not aged well at all.

1.  Rook Island is a vast and beautiful location, and there's always something to do, whether you're exploring the jungle, hunting animals, or taking on enemy strongholds.
2. There are a variety of weapons and gadgets to choose from, and you can approach fights in a variety of ways. Whether you prefer to go in guns blazing or take a more stealthy approach, you're sure to find a playstyle that suits you.
3. Jason Brody is a relatable protagonist, and his journey from carefree tourist to hardened survivor is both exciting and emotionally resonant.
4. From Vaas Montenegro, the charismatic and unhinged villain, to Citra Talugmai, the mysterious and alluring leader of the Rakyat, the cast of FarCry 3 is one of the best in the series.
5. The game's setting is incredibly well-realized. Rook Island is a lush and vibrant jungle, and the game does a great job of immersing you in the environment.
6. The game's progression system is well-designed. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new weapons, abilities, and upgrades, which will give you more options for how to approach challenges.",1691310605,1691310605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story and transformation of the MC is pathetic, as he goes from 0 to a one man army of destruction unknown how (tribal magic). The different PoI are a fair distance apart and the map is a living nightmare. Cudos that every tower is unique, but the one thing that can give strategic advantage to someone is, well... not fucking guarded! Want to play stealthy? Tough choice. Only from a certain point on the stealthy approach becomes viable and only to an extent. The rest is shooting bullshit, but if that is the point - OK. There are 2 characters that are worth it in this game and those two are Bambi and Sam. Vaas is OK, but too little interaction with him. Also, EXP progression isn't worth shit, I got all my skills unlocked and had some points left. Without all side missions to boot. The money aren't an issue either, just there to tease you for actually doing something. Once you get a rifle with a scope and silencer - there, it is done. Nobody can stop you. Not to mention that knife strikes do more damage than a sniper rifle. Oh, did I mention the repetitive lines of ALL THE NPCs? It is a nightmare 10 hours in the game. When you stalk a base? ""I should have used a rubber"" When you conquer a base all alone? The Rakyat are all like ""It's all me"". Why does Vaas have a sister? Tribal boobs and exotic butt, that's why! ""She is a great warrior"" my ass, from what I saw she only teased the Rakyat into doing something. The ending(s) are just as STUPID as the rest. Be all tribal or not be all tribal. The strong female character breaking up for the MC? Why not, it's not like they are sexist or anything.
This game is bullshit. Waste of time. First and probably last Far Cry game I am going to play. I learned the valuable lesson - never force yourself to play a game you don't like. Unless it is your job.
UPDATE: 10 years later I sat down to play this game again (highest difficulty this time) in parallel with my GF. While the game has the same drawbacks (voice lines, stealth not up to par, garbage vehicles, mighty whitey, boring side fluff, etc.), my original review was after I beat 3-4 Assassin's Creed games in a row and all of the innovation in this one was just a bad rehash of AC with guns. Vaas is quite memorable, but my fave is still Sam and to an extent Bambi. I appreciated the game mostly as something of a bonding experience and I can recommend it to people that don't have a lot of similar games under their belts. Or people interested in gaming history as FC3 definitely left it's mark on the industry with Michael Mando's Vaas Montenegro.

Even though FC3 was released in 2012, the game's plot is very original, and actually emotional, you will be playing as Jason Brody and you and your friends got kidnapped by (one of the best villains I've ever seen in games) Vaas Montenegro, now to escape this island you'll have to become basically a mass murderer, animal hunter, fuck a hot bitch - if you want it ""), and etc etc, anyway, point is you'll be addicted to this game real fast. The game is a FPS/RPG but since it was from 2012, it does not have a great variety of options but they do have classic RPG elements like crafting, skills that you learn, etc

I was also impressed with the cutscenes and the way that they chose and approach the manner that they tell this story, it affects directly your experience to a point where the graphics don't really matter that much - obv it's not the best in 2023.

I'm not really gonna go in much details about it, it's not super hard to learn the mechanichs, but it is a little hard to master.

Now, despite the fact that the game is really fucking good, I do have to point out that Ubisoft SUCKS INCREDIBLY, I know this is old news and everything but, at one point I couldn't even launch the game via Steam or Ubisoft Connect, which is something I've never seen in any other platform, and that's why my analysis will display something like 4 hours of gameplay. 

I found like two weeks ago the solution and finished most of the game by this point, and reached I would guess at least 40 hrs of gameplay.

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THAT, YOU MAY JUST SKIP TO THIS POINT AS WELL:

In conclusion: is the game worth it? YES, a million times, BUT, you'll probably have to deal with Ubisoft and this will definitely leave you flustered and angry. But also wait for a sale, it will be the best moment to buy FC3.

First, Steam ... c'mon.  This is supposed to be a professional outfit here.  Why do you force people into an all or nothing, completely binary review.  You either thumbs-up the game i.e. you like it 100% or you thumbs-down a game meaning you dislike a game 100%.  Why isn't there a more nuanced rating system like ascribing a number of stars based on how well you like a game.  Instead of forcing people to always put in their comments:  ""Well I have to give the game a thumbs-up because I like it 51% and dislike it 49%""  (or something similar).

Second, as literally everyone can attest to - I cannot stand it when games require you log into a third party program that you, of course, have to download and install onto your computer;  a program that isn't one that just sits in your hard drive but also becomes part of the registry.  Why.  WHY do you do this?  You know we all hate it and your games get much worse reviews than they otherwise would if you stopped this crap.  I don't like my computer being swamped with these stupid little programs one has to keep logging into, for one thing, and secondly, I don't like how it's just another form of control.  It's like you don't actually buy games anymore.  You rent them.  And the company can pull the plug on a game you spent good money for - whenever it wants to.  That's crap.

Third - enough with the security.  I'm sick and tired of programs that have a ""Remember Me?""  checkbox - only for the program to ignore it even when you tick it.  I'm tired of having to enter a password two or three times just to access a game.  My bank doesn't require so many layers of useless security.  

Early in the game, it's annoying doing any of the hunting quests because you MUST use a specific weapon.  When you can only carry one or two guns, having one of them replaced by, say, a sniper rifle, is annoying.  Because whatever weapon you're carrying, you throw on the ground.  And it won't be there when you complete the quest.  Sure, you can go all the way back to town and re-equip it, but it's still annoying.

Enemies will spawn in out of nowhere.  This usually applies to animals, not necessarily pirates.   I guess they hope you'll think you just ""missed"" the sneaky animals in high brush.  But I've been in places where there was nowhere for an animal to hide - and yet there it is, killing me.  Wasn't there 2 seconds ago.  Often it's more than one.  A pack of wild dogs.  Two or three komodo dragons, etc.    I guarantee it - you will be asking repeatedly, ""Where did those things come from?""  Well, they just spawned in.  Poof.  All the sudden - like the transporters from Star Trek.  They're just there.  And they come to attack you.  It happens a lot when you're vulnerable - low on ammo, low on health, need to reload, facing the wrong way, etc.  I shot a goat from a ledge - and when I dropped down to get the skin for crafting, two komodo dragons pounced on me the moment my feet hit the ground.  I would have seen one komodo dragon - much less two of them - because I had a bird's eye view of the area and it was open terrain - no brush, weeds, or places to hide.  Obviously they spawned in.  When the game wants you to die - you'll die - even if it has to spawn 3 or 4 tigers to do it.

This is the kind of game that captures your monitor and won't give it back to you while the game is running.  You have to alt-tab to select the application you want to focus on - and even when you do, the game is always running.  Meaning you cannot minimize it.  Ever.  The result is that you could be adjusting your controls, remapping keys, and things like that - and while the game is running behind your other programs, things can attack you.  Frustrating as hell.

There doesn't seem to be any way to change keyboard binds.  In fact, I had to go to a third party website just to get a list of keyboard ocmmands.  For some bizarre reason, no such option exists under - options.  

I'm not fond of games that try to pad its ""hours of gametime"" numbers by making you repeat things over and over.  Especially if you can't control when and where to save the game.  When you do something significant - like get a radio tower working - the game should save it after you zip line to the ground.  Boom.  Saved.  But no.  So if you get killed 10 minutes later, you end up having to do the tower all over again.  That irritates me to no end - because it goes without saying that ANY gamer would know to save their game after fixing a tower.  But this game doesn't want you to.  Instead, it would rather make you do the tower - again - if you die a little later on.  

I mean - the game is big enough on its own.  There's a lot to do, a lot of places to explore, a lot of collectibles to hunt down, enemies to fight,  quests to do, etc.  There's just no need to send a person back to re-do things they finished half an hour ago.   When completing quests, fixing towers, killing bosses - things like that - the game should immediately autosave.  

In most cases, it's a fun game and worth playing.  But since I can't give like ... 3.5 stars and instead I must recommend or not recommend 100% well ... here we are.  It's a pity.",1687862617,1689932412,False,0,0,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False

As a devoted fan of the Far Cry franchise, I eagerly embarked on my journey into the open world gaming universe with Far Cry 3, and oh boy, what an adventure it has been! This game has not only lived up to my expectations as a Far Cry enthusiast but has also solidified my love for open world exploration and thrilling gameplay.

Right from the moment I stepped into the tropical paradise of Rook Island, I was mesmerized by the breathtaking visuals and the immersive world that lay before me. The lush jungles, crystal-clear waters, and sprawling landscapes create an environment that feels alive and brimming with possibilities. Far Cry 3 has set the bar incredibly high for other open world games, and it remains a true masterpiece in its genre.

The narrative of Far Cry 3 is a gripping rollercoaster of emotions. Taking on the role of Jason Brody, a young man stranded on the hostile island, I found myself on a thrilling quest for survival and redemption. The character development is expertly crafted, and I witnessed Jason's transformation from a naive tourist to a fearless warrior, willing to do whatever it takes to save his friends and take down the menacing pirate leader, Vaas. The compelling storyline was like a magnet, drawing me further into the game, eager to uncover every hidden secret of Rook Island.

What sets Far Cry 3 apart from other games in the series is the unparalleled freedom it offers. As a first-time open world gamer, I was in awe of the vastness of the map and the seemingly endless possibilities at my fingertips. From hunting exotic wildlife to liberating enemy outposts, I was given complete autonomy over how I wanted to approach each objective. The game encourages creativity and strategic thinking, making every playthrough a unique and personalized experience.

The gameplay mechanics are smooth and satisfying, with a wide array of weapons and tools at my disposal. Stealthily eliminating enemies from the shadows or engaging in intense firefights never gets old, and the adrenaline rush is unmatched. The skill tree system allows for character customization, making me feel more connected to Jason's progression as I honed my abilities and unlocked new skills.

Aside from the main campaign, Far Cry 3 also boasts an abundance of side quests, activities, and collectibles to explore. Whether it's participating in thrilling races, undertaking hunting challenges, or diving into hidden underwater caves, there's always something new and exciting to discover around every corner. This depth of content ensures that the game's world remains captivating and keeps me coming back for more.

In conclusion, Far Cry 3 is a game that has left an indelible mark on me as a first-time open world gamer and a die-hard fan of the Far Cry series. Its engaging narrative, stunning visuals, and unparalleled freedom of exploration have set the standard for open world games, and it's a journey I would gladly take again and again. If you're a fan of adventure, action, and the thrill of exploring vast open worlds, Far Cry 3 is an absolute must-play that will leave you craving for more of the Far Cry franchise.",1689787308,1689787308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main story forces you to take drugs to advance. I'm not advocating for these missions to be removed from the game. I respect that some players might use recreational drugs, but I wish there was an optional route to finish the story without them.These drug segments are frustrating and tedious to play. 

There is also a scene where you are sexually assaulted by an ally while you are drugged and unconscious, which is never addressed or condemned in the game. Another scene implies that your friend was repeatedly raped by his kidnapper. These are not acceptable themes for a video game, and they make me question Ubisoft’s ethics as a company. 

The gameplay itself is solid, but it gets repetitive and boring after a while. Many missions are just defending someone from waves of enemies or racing against the clock.

That's annoying enough to taint the experience. I tried to forgive it, but the story is only okay, there is the usual AAA garbage of six zillion side missions and forced sequences where you have to use a skill you have never used before and will never use again, and fail to do it expertly and you are kicked back to a save point ten minutes earlier and before an unskippable cutscene.

But even that wasn't enough for this review. No, basically the combat and movement sucks. There's no feeling of weight, no direct connection. See the ""survivor"" TR series for a game that really feels like you are drawing a bow or swinging a climbing axe. This just feels like hitting a button, with completely arbitrary results whether it works or you die and respawn again.

I just stopped trying. Grabbed all the grenades I could, ran straight for the objective, doing the COD thing where you die a second after completing the objective so you don't have to go back to the previous save point.

The fluid combat system, which combines gunplay, stealth, and explosive action, keeps players engaged and on their toes.

In addition to its stellar single-player campaign, Far Cry 3 also offers a robust multiplayer mode that provides hours of competitive and cooperative gameplay. Whether teaming up with friends to tackle missions or engaging in intense multiplayer battles, the multiplayer component adds significant replay value to the game.

Don't forget to use Reshade for better graphics (and mostly better colorimetry).

It still needs a bit tweaking for modern pc in order to make it run perfectly, and should be fixed at 60fps to avoid bugs, but that's a good game.

ORIGINAL COMMENT BELOW

I can't recommand this game because of how Ubisoft just screwed with it recently.

Since April 25th, they just removed all voices and subtitles languages except english.
It seems that they tried to reduce disk space by letting the game download only expected language + english, but they forgot to bring back the voices files.

I don't understand at all why they have done that since the game is 12GB, and removing voices allows to reduce disk space usage between ~160/200MB which is completely negligeable nowadays and for a game this size.

I opened a ticket with ubisoft support, and will change this bad review with a good one when they will have fixed it.",1684107103,1688508101,True,0,0,0.752207934856414795,0,True,False,False

It really is as great as they say and I strongly recommend anyone to give it an honest try! The characters are soo well written and the world feels as immersive as that of FC2 (which was a masterpiece at that).
I ran into some really bad bugs, which I think at least half of them had to do with the Ubisoft Launcher and newer ports of the game, which I do not think would take Ubisoft long to patch if they wanted to. Every single launch wanted me to reenter my Ubisoft password, which is very very very unnecessary for a single-player offline game, period.
I also had multiple ctds which really broke my experience because the game telling you ""checkpoint reached!"" and the launcher telling ypu ""saving progress..."" are simple lies giving you hope that you do not have to restart a mission from the beginning after watching a minutes-long unskippable cutscene. This was the worst bug I ran into. The actual gameplay is extremely well done and impressed me in a lot of situations where most games would definitely have fallen short.
Another bug is that I could not set my resolution to 4K without really excessive shenanigans, because the game saying ""keep options"" does not mean horseshit, as they immediately turned down my resolution after exiting. I tried all sorts of things until I realised that I had to alt-f4 my game after changing the resolution  fort it to not turn it back down again after saving my changes.

Still, this game has aged incredibly well and its story and gameplay still make some current AAA games look very old. Well done! I wish there were more games like this. Will try FC4 next...",1687686159,1688248315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I feel ashamed I ever spent money on this, it's like finding out I paid someone for painting my house an obnoxious color without my knowledge or approval.

edit: I have since played the game through methods that are legal in france and I'm on the end game island. I usually wait till the end to put my review up, but I don't think they can change my mind with anything new at this point. this game really, really doesn't respect the player's time in the slightest. every fetch quest, every kill quest, every unskippable cutscene, every quest that forces you to use a certain weapon, every quest that railroads you into using stealth, it all adds up to a feeling that these people wanted you to play a diet version of an actual freedom-giving open world game. it's like they desperately wanted to everyone to play the game the same way in a fashion similar to linear games, but people with their head screwed on straight kept forcibly taking them back onto the path of letting people play how they want. 

also again I'm reiterating the cutscenes are unskippable. there's a mod for that now but still, it's an unforgivable sin in my eyes that it needs a mod to fix that in the first place. there's a good game underneath all these horrible design decisions, but for me as an experienced gamer it just feels like I'm playing a version of mercenaries 2 that's bogged down by modern design trends that don't respect the player's time or intelligence and are designed to pad play times instead of give you more content. 

maybe, *hopefully*, the sequels are better but I'm reluctant to try the rest. I'm extra angry I paid for this game now, what the hell was the internet doing getting so hyped over this back in 2012?",1687295848,1687730171,False,0,0,0.470297038555145264,0,True,False,False

After playing later installments it amazes me how they both managed to change so little, yet some annoyances hinder my enjoyment as these things are done better in later installments. Completed the game 100% with stealth only (where possible) on the hardest master difficulty.

Story missions are the easiest in general, solid variety of set-pieces but the meat of the game is the side content. Story is told through brief in-engine cutscenes that are unskippable but do not overstay their welcome. Most of the characters are one-note but fun to interact with. They all have some quotable lines or weird quality in them, except the group you actually supposed to care about. The whole supernatural/spiritual touches with the tribe and tattoo are never really explained but they never purely in the center stage of the plot either, so somehow it works (reminds me of the Indiana Jones movies in that regard). I like how solid they tied the gamey mechanic of a skill tree with the tattoo on your arm. You have 2 endings to pick from depending on a final quest decision.

You dropped into a big island to roam and: 
Hunt animals to skin them and increase your weapon and ammo carry capacity with crafting
There are also specific rule/weapon hunting quests
Activate radio towers with some enjoyable first person platforming to reveal parts of the island map and make weapons free at stores
Do timed race challenges for cash
Clear out enemy outpost by stealth or just going Rambo, they serve as fast travel points afterward
Play some arcade-like, timed, score attack challenge maps where you need to kill infinitely spawning enemies with unique rules/specific weapons and infinite healing/ammo
Do random easy fetch-quests to copy pasted island NPCs where the highlight is usually a silly plot-twist in the end of the scenario
Do stealth/melee kill the specific target missions where the target is usually heavily guarded
Play the f*ckin terrible knife-throwing game to lose a lot of cash
Play poker to waste a lot of time and win back the cash you lost at  the f*ckin knife-throwing game
There are a variety of hidden collectibles you usually have to do some solid platforming to obtain for a small extra xp, these feel like Indiana Jones shorts.

The game pulls a weird ""twist"" of unlocking a second island when you think it's about to end. This is where it starts to drag on a bit. You ditch all the characters you met so far and it is just you and a new fella from here on. Thankfully it is not the second 50% of the game, there are not much to do on this island. It has less missions on it but traversing is way more tedious thanks to the overkill elevation of terrain on the majority of the island. 
You unlock a wingsuit and parachute but that still requires you to climb to a high point before you can efficiently dive and it never feels like a worthy effort. Fall damage is overtuned, especially on the hardest difficulty, using a kite the landing kills you 99% of the time even if you are above water (might be a bug). Going on foot is tedious but driving vehicles is horrible, the FOV is abysmal and you can just drive off a cliff before you realize the pitfall below, like you roleplay Wile Coyote. The camera shake on a bumpy road is quite intense too.

Stealth in the game is canned animation takedowns, body dragging is only possible after a regular takedown and you cannot pick up bodies once dropped. You got an infinite quantity rock throw distraction item. Enemies can be tagged with your camera to see their position clearly with an icon on them all the time. Silenced weapons are overpowered and if you seek challenge not recommended outside of dealing with the occasional guard dog. Weapons are fine but i find the aim down sight difficult to use on medium distance enemies and below. There are some strange engine related anomalies like character models randomly jitter/shake (insert enemy_soldier.exe stopped working meme) or body dragging suddenly slingshots a corpse up in the air and 20 meter away into a patrol group. These are not game breaking but definitely the worst behavior the game offers, outside of the frequent, random crashing that has no definite solution as far as I know. At least the game autosaves rather frequently.

Ubisoft being themselves not giving a f*ck about preserving their legacy the DLC missions from the deluxe edition cannot be legally obtained anymore but they are actually already in the game data and can be unlocked (Google is your friend). If you are tired of the constant server seeking and error message as you open the game menu then the community fixed that for you too with a basic hex edit, again Ubisoft doesn't bother with such things.",1687044311,1687499125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's so fun and full of action. All the cutscenes and the story are very compelling and really suck you in. There is a lot of character development, especially in the main character, Jason, as he becomes more and more one with the jungle. So much change in a character. The main villains are very interesting, especially Vaas, he's sort of like Joker. Truly insane.

If you love blowing stuff up, causing absolute chaos, and being some sort of jungle God, you will like this game.

If you love sneaking in to a base and taking everyone out one by one without being detected, and sabotaging the base, you will like this game.

The guns and gunplay feel very good, although I will say the vanilla optic sights are kind of shitty, the reticle is huge, though there is a mod that makes them better.

All in all, if you want an excellent gameplay experience and you like action and stealth, this game is for you. So much fun.",1687196078,1687196078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Things like fast travel points everywhere, 'claim-it-once-keep-it-forever' pirate outposts scattered everywhere on the map, free guns and equipment, craftable wallets, holsters and bags and many other smaller improvements have ""perfected"" the casual Far Cry gameplay formula.

The writing is very good, however, it isn't without it's merits. Vaas may be a fucking phenomenal villain, but I can't think of anyone praising Hoyt (or the whole Southern Island, if you ask me). 

All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time with this game. It was very innovative for its time and the game has aged very well since its launch almost ten years ago. 

Old review:
This game is in (almost) every way perfect.

The story is incredibly well written as you can really see how Jason changes as a character after being consumed by the constant insanity of the Rook islands. When he killed someone for the first time, he was in shock, but that shock factor is nonexistent after being brainwashed by the Rakyat and that whore Citra.

The factions (except the privateers) are all well written. The Pirates are scum of the island, robbing and ransoming the local population for a quick buck. They're led by Vaas Montenegro, a man similar to Jason by the end of the game as he too has been consumed by the insanity of the Islands. As you go deeper and deeper into the game, you realize he was right about you. You are me, and I am you.

The Rakyat are the (sorta) better option, however, they brainwash Jason with some sort of dumbass warrior culture, making him a murderer only seeking approval from Citra. Citra is not much better than Vaas, she does the same things he does over and over and over again, but with a different coat of paint. 

Apart from the privateers (which just seem like filler content), this game is very, very well written. You can see how much the Island changed Jason from a South Californian rich white boy to a mass murderer with no remorse for killing people who are so similar to him in many ways. 

The gameplay is a major leap forward compared to FC2. It has shaped the future of Far Cry as IV, V and VI have incredibly similar gameplay formats. FC3 implemented a very beginner friendly system into the world of Far Cry 3. You can fast travel to any location which you've ""claimed"", claiming outposts is a new thing, making your own wallets, bags and holsters from materials foraged from the Island is a new thing and you can do side content missions around the Island from bulletin boards, but they're pretty.. fucking boring.

The map is very appealing to the eyes. Compared to the gritty, depressing enviroment of Far Cry II, this is a massive godsend. The map is very saturated, tropical and incredibly beautiful. 

All in all, Far Cry III was a massive leap forward for the Far Cry franchise as it introduced many of the features we enjoy in Far Cry IV, V and VI. This is the shining gem of Ubisoft Montreal. Nothing comes close to it",1683924411,1686518853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a relatively old game, with a great story, that you'll either like or not. The main character to me is great, even if you don't get to see his face very often, I get the feeling that you have grown beside him in your journey to escape the island.

The side characters are great (everyone states this) and it's true. The villains are great too, but come on... I mean Vaas was the epic main villain of the game, everyone knows that.
He's unique among villains. He will stay inside your head when you play the game. Or not. See for yourself.

A lot of people say that this was the last ""good"" Far Cry game. But if you sit down with the ""I don't have any expectations"" attitude, then every Far Cry game is good enough.

10/10 game. Would recommend for everyone. A good killing on an island for your friends never hurt anyone (except the villains).....

For all the faults Ubisoft has this game is easily a gem in their very hit or miss lineup. 
This game does a lot right, the grind feels nonexistent if you don't look for it. If you want to find every collectible and other Open World tropes you will find yourself bored. I cleared every outpost and liberated every base while doing about 4 side missions and a few hunting some assassination missions sprinkled in. I never felt like I was waiting for this game to end, the story is very good and I still enjoyed it after an important character left. The stealth is about as basic as it can get yet it still is rewarding and fun even though the A.I isn't Einstein and the only way of distraction is throwing rocks and sometimes unleashing a animal from a cage. The takedowns are fun to pull off, fun enough for me to clear every base. Ubisoft launcher will cause some negative reviews but I managed to get 60 fps for almost the entire game on steam deck.

Had to format my PC HD.

Reinstalled everything and was able to resume the game from where I previously was.

Good job, Ubisoft! 

Now to relearn the game. Hard to fight pirates with rifles while having just a pistol... 
EDIT 1: I used a little bit of stealth and flanking and managed to complete the mission. Now I´m free to roam and find guns, etc.

EDIT 2: Started to get the hang of the game. Seems to have more crafting that I´d like. But I´m planning on taking my time before diving in the main quests, as advised by many. So looting and crafting for a while is in order.

The game flows very well, very smooth. 

Much as I like riding with the quadricycle, I´ve already realized roaming around is very dangerous. Rebels and wild animals all around.

After playing some linear, hallway games, I´m back at an open world. Not sure I still like them, I fear to spend too much time grinding and not advancing the story, which is something I like (watch the story moving forward).

But if you like Open World and FPS, this seems to be a helluva game.

edit: every time you alert a patrol, they will keep sending endless enemies towards you; very unrealistic.

edit2: they have this old-fashioned ""absolute stealth"" mission, in which if you´re spotted you lose the mission. I hate this kind of mission, so I will set this game aside and go back to it when I have ALL DAY to try to complete an absolute stealth mission.

edit3: the game asks for my password EVERY TIME I start playing it. 

And there´s always a message the ""Far Cry 3 Service is not available"" popping up whenever you pause it. I know, I got it the first time, I already understood the concept.

Pity. This was ragarded as ""the best"" Far Cry. Unfortunately, I cannot play it in its current state.

There's some sort of magic stuff in it that is never really acknowledged by any of the characters, which was jarring after the super grounded-in-reality FC2.  It left me looking up what actually happened in a couple scenes or what the silver dragon knife *was* because the line between reality, magic, and drugs got blurred so often.  I feel like in a lot of cases that was the *point*, but ultimately so little actually made sense together or was explained that when the game just... *ends*... I was left feeling like ""...that's it?"" rather than feeling like I had accomplished any goals or seen the story through to the end.
FC4 also had what felt like a more fleshed-out and less repetitive world, a more interesting and evolving story, and I think was just more enjoyable as a whole.  That's not to say that FC3 is bad in any capacity (other than what I said above), but it's just not as good as it could have been.

If you find yourself out of options as for where to spend your money, then you can buy all possible attachments for all possible guns.

The quest to hunt the critter you need for the largest loot backpack comes from the outpost north of Badtown, if I remember correctly.

Remember to save manually before quitting, in case you had been exploring and not done a mission for a while, which would have autosaved.

There's a skill on the skill tree called Jungle Run that improves your crouched moving speed. Prioritize the stealth skills and health buffs.

It's not explained very well in the game, but use the camera to tag and ""wallhack"" enemies. It has a longer range to do so than other weapons.

Buy the bow. Use the bow. Love the bow. The bow is probably the best early game weapon, it's silent and you can recover your ammo.

When you get rid of outposts enemy respawns more or less disappear in that area forever. You might see a jeep full of pirates if you're lucky, but they're a lot rarer.

There are only two things you can lock yourself out of. There's a relic (spider #1) in the cave under the doctor's house, and there's a skill you can unlock only if you take two outposts without being detected. Don't worry too much about the latter, since the skill unlocks a long ways into the story and by the end of the game taking out outposts without detection is child's play.

I really love one of the main villains / people in this game, Vaas, much like every other player of FC3, but a lot of the rest of the game can be a bit forgettable to me. The main character, Jason, doesn't really stand out that much, or have much character himself. He is mostly just a bravado jackass with lots of guns. The story itself is crazy and outright hilarious at times, and that is definitely part of the charm.

I love the fact that this game has Skrillex music. It is perfectly timeless with how charming and quirky it can be. There is a nice balance of challenge and fun to be had in this game, especially for returning players or people who have enjoyed the newer experiences. Personally, I still prefer Far Cry 4 over this one. It felt a little bit more fleshed out, and I seriously love Pagan Min... lovely character.

There always feels like there is something going on. And the characters and story-lines from the main to side quest are engaging and fun. Even if sometimes they are silly. The characters are honestly kind of shit. But, and this could be a stretch to some... possibly, it fits into the story. Everything is fun and engaging;ridiculous and over the top like a Michael Bay film. 

Visually its a gorgeous game. I feel like from Far Cry; my introduction to the franchise fully. Took a more realistic look visually to their games.

I think that the vibrancy and the overall setting and way the world works is a bit cartoony to me. 

Overall this game is fun. There is a reason why it is so highly thought of and viewed by... GamerZZZZ... sorry for the cringe. Its usually buried by all the shit Far Cry 5 and 6 have given us these past few years, It also doesn't help that it's a Ubisoft license. This game is fun. It does not take itself too serious but it still presents a story in a setting that is fun. And the world itself is a fun one to get lost in by just walking around and coming across different secrets in the world.

It has that perfect blend of setting, characters, theme and story.  All the numbered Far Cry games that followed have just been refinements on what Far Cry 3 accomplished.  Sure Blood Dragon was an amazing 80s-drenched spin-off and we saw excellently portrayed villains in Pagan Min (Far Cry 4) and the Seed siblings (Far Cry 5). But Far Cry 3 set the standard.  The game plays like when Richard gets exiled from the community in the film The Beach but with a strong dose of Alice In Wonderland meets Heart of Darkness.  You, as Jason Brody, find yourself in the unenviable position of being kidnapped along with your friends and brothers by South Pacific pirates.  You're in a remote, forgotten part of the world so there's no cavalry coming to save you.  You must embrace the warrior within you, go native in a drug- and violence-fueled bender and do whatever it takes to save your friends single-handedly. At first, Jason feels in over his head and is just doing whatever he can to survive but as he grows more skilled and accomplished in his feats he begins to embrace and relish in the savagery he visits upon his foes.  You become something of a living legend among the Rakyat people resisting Vaas' pirates but always find yourself on the knife's edge of sanity as you contend with the rogues gallery of colorful characters in your way.  Everyone loves Vaas and Buck as villains though the game's final act feels a little rushed as Hoyt - the final antagonist - is not given the same opportunity to flourish for the audience.  This causes the final act to feel a *slightly* less satisfying though by this point the game has done its level best to give you a memorable story.  Follow up games, notably 4, feel like the ultimate refinement to the mechanics introduced in this game, and Blood Dragon throws out any semblance of realism for the sake of pure fun by eliminating the annoying but realistic mechanics (no more fall damage, super fast running, no drowning), but this is a well-balanced, well-crafted entry and the superior experience in terms of story, locale, and characters.  If you only play one Far Cry game, let it be this one and embrace the savage beauty of the Rook Islands.",1647058394,1684817481,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I loved this game back then, but now I feel pretty lukewarm on it at best.

The open world model in Far Cry 3 has barely changed since this game came out. And much like the games that imitate this formula, good lord there is way too much boring shit to do. And I know exactly why it's all so boring, this game is way too easy. Everything is practically handed to the player on a silver platter which makes pretty much all of the rewards for doing said boring shit basically useless. Even the stuff that starts out fun like clearing strongholds quickly feels like a grind when you already have a bottomless source of weapons and ammo after just playing the game for a few hours.

The only resource that actually does matter is xp. Well that and animal hides, but those end up being a lot easier to find than they should be and are mainly used to craft bigger ammo pouches, weapon slots, loot bags, etc. which trivialize combat with how much shit they let you carry so they end up hurting the overall experience more than they help. Anyway, the xp you get from practically every action you can take in this game allows you to buy skills that will either give you better passive stats like health, weapon accuracy, and speed, or you could get new actions you can do like new takedowns, power slides, or using weapons while ziplining. Unfortunately, the skills that give you more mechanical freedom are usually locked behind missions and/or passive skills that I couldn't give less of a shit about getting. And it's not clear to me if it's a certain number of missions, or specific story missions that have to be completed that unlock them. Either way, it's not ideal.

Ironically, not doing all of the boring grindy shit makes the open world a lot more fun to explore. Not clearing strongholds means you're going to run into enemy patrols frequently and will have to sneak your way around them or fight them to get where you need to go. It also means you have no fast travel points and actually have to navigate the dangerous landscape. Not collecting loot or crafting the pouches that give you bottomless weapons and ammo means you have to think hard about what you're gonna bring with you and forces you to seriously consider the value of each bullet used in an engagement. Not turning on the radio towers means you have to rely on your own memory and landmarks to navigate the island.

However to the game's credit, all of the grinding and shit I just complained about actually reinforces the game's narrative and the protagonist's character development. When Jason Brody (spoilers I guess? The following is pretty common knowledge about this game at this point) rescues his friends and they're all like ""we almost fucking died or became slaves, why are you so chipper?"", it feels believable because all the time I spent before that was crafting weapon holsters out of bear hides and picking off people one-by-one in a jungle like I was Rambo, and I was having fun doing it too. Unfortunately both endings are wet farts to an otherwise pretty decent story with compelling characters even after the best villain is killed off halfway through the game and the primary one after that just appears and doesn't have nearly the charisma.

All this to say, it's fine I guess. This game still looks and sounds pretty and it plays fine. Check it out; or don't if you're not a fan of the formulaic open world games that have been plaguing the industry ever since this game came out because it's patient zero. You have to play through Ubisoft's DRM so you're probably better off getting it through their store, but it's not as intrusive as it used to be from what I remember about trying to play this game when it came out so it isn't the (italics) worst thing in the world to play it through Steam.",1684816021,1684816021,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Two very important elements set Far Cry 3 apart from nearly every other FPS out there, those elements being story and gameplay. I'll start off with the story.

The game's primary focus in the beginning is to guide you with saving your friends from some goofy pirates but the plot thickens as your character begins exploring some dark and very uncomfortable realms. That's where the element of gameplay comes in. The open world game provides the player with a plethora of weapons and tools that can be used to aid with taking out enemies, hunting wild animals, and exploring two beautifully designed tropical islands.

The gameplay is very simple, yet allows for a lot of flexibility for how you approach things. The Master difficulty is difficult (but not overly difficult,), and is my personal preference because it made me actually think about how i'm going to do something before i charge in and make my life 10x harder. It also encourages you to do the side missions to get stronger in order to have an easier time later on down the road. Not to mention the crafting system is really well done, you may not want to spend time crafting wallets, or loot rucksacks, or anything else, but you'll find yourself in a position where you'll be thinking ""hey, before i do this mission i should either A) Craft a bigger thing so i can hold more of that thing, or B) Spend / exhaust this thing so i can pick up / collect more down the road.

The story is very good, but nothing mind-blowing. However, what caught my eye wasn't the story itself but how the protagonist and the people around him react to his actions and his behavior down the road. There are a few well placed jokes / comedic relief moments which is surprisingly fitting when they happen, but overall it's a very well put together game that i highly recommend playing at least once, even if you just speed through the story. It makes you surprisingly engaged, even if you want to just go around slaughtering anyone and everyone

Overall, i'd give this game a strong 9/10, for the time that it was released i'd say it definitely delivered to the players. The graphics are pretty decent, Gameplay can be challenging and rewarding (while also making you do other things to make life easier), and the flexibility in playstyle preference definitely make this game worthy of the rank.",1684629645,1684629645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But now it just crashed on me within 5 minutes of playing...... wtf.

Update: Game has crashed on me 4 times within a half hour of playing. I even lowered my resolution to make sure it wasn't on my end. It's not. Had no problem playing FC5, but this is just trash. DO NOT BUY THIS AT FULL PRICE.

Update: I've finally been able to stabilize the game, to an extent. I had to further lower the resolution as well as lowering the video quality. Even though my gfx card can handle Ultra graphics, it crashes unless I reduce it to Medium. Which is trash, but at least I can play.

As far as the game itself, it holds up over time to an extent, but it's a lot of the same so far, mainly hunting to be able to hold more items in backpacks and more guns/ammo. Someone told me before I played this or Far Cry 5 that it doesn't matter which you play first, and I guess I agree. I liked FC5 quite a bit, so it motivated me to go ahead and binge that game until I beat it, but now coming to a game made 7+ years earlier, it requires a bit more patience to play on. I wonder if I would've enjoyed playing this one first as a result, but I think I would've just gotten bored with it and jumped to FC5 anyway, then not bouncing back to this one. So yeah, for anyone buying the two together in the DLC, I'd start with 5 and, if you like it enough, come back to 3. Hopefully it gets more interesting once the story develops a bit more.

As far as the interface, it's absolutely terrible. Every time you want to craft something new, you have to go to the menu (which has this whole slow animation), then click another 4 more things. Every time you want to USE something you've crafted, same thing (unless it's one of the TWO that you've assigned to a hotkey). It's absurd that the only thing in this game that has a hotkey is 'M' for map. No inventory, no skills, no anything. It's the worst interface that I've seen since probably the 90s. I don't know what they were thinking.

Update: As I near the end of the game, I can say that the story's pretty good, and it has some injected trippy points in the later half that are definitely cool—and considerably trippy considering how long ago it was made—[spoiler]though I guess they weren't sure how to execute boss battles because there basically aren't any. I was disappointed by the ""battle"" with Vaas, even less of a battle with Hoyt. Neither were satisfying at all. I was impressed with FC5's boss battles; they had figured it out by then.[/spoiler] My favorite part of the game winds up being the semi-smart AI enemies, which provides a challenge, especially when you can't kill them and need to sneak around them. I did have to increase the difficulty up to the third level, I think it's called ""Warrior."" Especially in the middle of the game if you have access to the big guns/better items because of more looting (I'm an OCD loot everything freak), it can get pretty easy. Later in the game it does account for the player having better items and picks up in difficulty though. In a good way.

Last Update: Weak ending. Not bad, per se, but not at all the kind of thorough ending you want after putting over 100 hours into a game. Having now beaten it, I'm pretty sure my time could've gone towards something more enjoyable. Oh well.

All in all, if not for the pretty good story and gameplay, I wouldn't be able to play it at all.

Getting damaged barely means a thing aswell as standing out in the open. Enemies can't aim well either, enemy snipers barely represent a challenge since they're always in towers with lazer sights and aren't hostile untill you're 4 feet away from their spots.

I'd have to say that it's still fun but not in the Far Cry kind of way. Story is well written, characters too, gameplay is fun in the rambo kind of way not so much the survival style, story does NOT match the gameplay at all.

for those of you who dont know. Far cry 3 feels like an improved version of the far cry console games, ( instincts/predator) but handled way better...

no it is not the same story, only game play elements are fixed up. such as the ability to craft syringes that do different effects. speed, strength, scent, jump, all that fun stuff.... as well as crafting to make your guy stronger. from crafting more holsters for guns, or ammo pouches to carry more max ammo.

the map is also handled differently. in original far cry, and console versions... its a linear game with multiple pathways to get to the goal..... far cry 3 on the other hand, is open world. you can go where ever you want on the giant north island, taking outposts and the like on your own terms, making the game flow much easier.

lots of side quests, and the one thing its known for........Radio towers. which at the time were new to the far cry series, but also annoying. ( there not that bad, each tower you climb different, and opens up a section of map to view.

sadly, UPlay no longer is active, so there are alot of things missing now. such as the co-op seperate campaign which is interesting.

sadly, where they fell short was multiplayer overall compared to far cry instincts and predator. for example, you can still create custom maps, and move the world terrain however you like..... but the biggest difference is that in far cry 3 multiplayer, there are no vehicles, and thats a real big missed opportunity, the former had all vehicles in multiplayer, making for some real interesting maps and concepts.

this game also was the one to introduce parachutes, and wing suits...... both perks you get way later in the game.

all in all far cry 3 has been a fav of mine for a long time. and if you havnt checked it out, i still strongly suggest doing so. ( or any of the far cry games. ) If you want to experience a different setting if far cry, check out either far cry: primal, or far cry blooddragon.

primal is cave man farcry.... blooddragon however is a farcry in game movie, turned into a video game..... and its ridiculous in all the right ways.",1683130108,1683130317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Occasional crashes to desktop, and every now and then the map screen started behaving buggy

- Story/Characters kinda didn't make sense to me
- There was a lot of  stuff in the game, but most of it you either didn't need or hardly ever used (eg wingsuit).

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The Graphics the setting all still comparable with today's games.
Story, Game mechanics all cool.
THE ONLY REASON, I am giving a Thumbs DOwn is because : It Crashes every now and then. There is nothing i am able to do to fix it...!!!

Edit : I set my graphics to lowest setting then things are working without issue,
My system is i5-10th Gen, 16gb ddr4 Ram, 4gb GTX1660ti. I don't think this is the issue because my system is strong enough to handle most of today's games then why crash this title?

Developers Please take a note many players are having this issue.!!! And there is no fix!!!

I love this game, I 100% it on PS3 (including the annoying co-op achievements) and at the time my 13 year old self enjoyed pretty much every moment of it. The game is gorgeous, I love the unique player progression storytelling with the tattoo changing as you get stronger and Vaas is such a memorable performance

BUT bro... the damage this game has done to the AAA space is unreal. It cemented the worst aspects of ubisoft games and spread them all throughout the industry. It spawned the radio towers that made it into every open world game since (AC started it with the synchronisation zones but FC3 exploded it). The huge world with pointless RPG mechanics etc etc

So funny to think that this game had the ""did I ever tell you the definition of insanity"" line and ubisoft been doing the same game ever since",1682490829,1682508268,False,0,0,0.367769986391067505,0,True,False,False

Huge plus point for both villain Vaas and Hoyt, they were a great villain, Hoyt kinda remind me of Tony from Scarface.
Some things that bother me is that there's not much background story that is explained here, like what happen so that Vaas and Citra separated, i know it's because Hoyt but how and why? They are brother and sister, then why Citra act like it doesn't matter at all. There's also one thing about how Jason take revenge and kill both Vaas and Hoyt, for me it could've been better, showing QTE of Jason killing everyone on Hoyt's poker game could've been awesome instead of showing a dark room with Jason dueling Hoyt alone.

But jokes aside, Ubisoft sometimes can be also praised. For example, this game and famous quote of Vaas - how many people know it even who are not much of gamers? Not to say, that this particular game of Ubisoft is actually one of their best. In Far Cry 3 these famous series basically were given their new image. Also here Ubisoft created their best formula of open-world action games. And they have been trying to repeat and upgrade it up to this day. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it did't. There are many different opinions on Ubisoft games. I basically think there are good and bad sides in them and I enjoy many of their projects overall. So, concluding this review, Far Cry 3 is basically a legend and even if you do not want to play any Far Cry titles released after it, I still did advise you to play Far Cry 3.",1681123281,1681123526,True,2,0,0.54703831672668457,0,True,False,False

FC2 might have the best plot for me. [spoiler] I don't see why everyone liked Vaas so much. Yea, he's insane and he's kinda funny and all but other than that, his performace falls flat in being a villain, probably because he dies way too soon. There's this other guy, Hoyt, who's pulling the strings and also is kinda crazy but he actually shouldn't exist. Vaas should be the one and only villain/antagonist that you meet during the entire game, building this rivalry and fueling Jason's revenge until the very last moment of the game.
Having Hoyt as a mastermind had no effect in me and made that part of the story feel very forced and not that interesting.[/spoiler]

I was expecting so much more from this game, I guess because everyone talked so positively of this game throughout the years which probably hyped my expectations.

1. Ubisoft killed the online support version. They also killed Co-Op system. I purchased the Delux Edition but ubisoft removed that version and also took it out from whom owned the delux edition.  Very Very Very Bad Ubisoft.

Shame on you Ubisoft, the PC version of this game has been left to rot in the desert, after the devs took a huge s*** on it.

By ""horribly wrong,"" I mean he gets kidnapped by a band of pirates, meets a crazy drug lord, and becomes a warrior who can somehow heal bullet wounds by eating a handful of berries.

The real star of the show: Vaas. This guy is like the Joker if he was a drug-addicted pirate with a mohawk. He is the kind of villain who will monologue about the definition of insanity while you are trying to sneak past his goons, and then he will shoot you in the face just for fun.

The gameplay is a blast, too. You can climb radio towers to reveal more of the map, hunt exotic animals to craft better equipment, and liberate enemy outposts to unlock fast travel points. There are also trippy drug sequences that make you feel like you are in a music video.

The game can sometimes take itself a little too seriously. There is a part where you have to burn a field of marijuana plants while Skrillex plays in the background. It is like they are trying to make a statement about the War on Drugs or something.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

+Good graphics
+Good voice acting
+Lots of in-game tutorials and guides
+Tons to do if you're a completionist
+Gunplay is fun
+Minimal opening splash screens
+Fast travel
+Relatively stable (1 softlock in about 50 hours of play)
+DLC integrated into main game
+Save anywhere and no real penalty for dying

[h1]YMMV[/h1]
~Ubisoft open-world repetitive collectathon gameplay

~One villain is occasionally interesting, but disappears too soon

~A few mandatory poker minigames, but they seem to be guaranteed wins

~Alice in Wonderland quotes came off as pretentious

~Not a single likable character in the game for any length of time. When playing FC4, I gave myself whiplash from approval nodding after Willis (himself one of the biggest jerks in the series) called Jason Brody a ""SoCal douchebag"".

~Besides the well-represented first kill, I don't see all the protagonist character development frequently lauded in the game. He's an idiot from start to finish. Further, being KO'd more than a narcoleptic boxer does not constitute character development. It's too bad he didn't stop griping about skinning animals, or that he didn't handle weapons clumsily at the start. These would have fit well into his [spoiler]increased love of violence[/spoiler].

~The game's pretty gritty. Expect foul language, frequent drug use, visceral first-person violence, physical and sexual slavery of all ages and genders, and [spoiler]a crowning rape scene with topless nudity. Now, I know most players won't be offended because, like in Alpha Protocol, the apparent victim is a guy who doesn't complain, and the perp is a busty female. Buuuut, let's be realistic: having sex with someone after drugging them is straight-up nonconsensual. The fact that the perp and her cronies are otherwise grooming the victim for service in a manner very similar to how Hitler groomed the SS just makes it skeezy[/spoiler].

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
-POS Ubisoft Connect launcher and Denuvo
-Store description of purchase options vague. Needlessly hard to set up.
-DLC etc didn't automatically add to my account
-Quicktime events using random buttons was a literal killer on KB&M
-Wingsuit causes death more often than not
-Animals are bullet-sponge, OP jerks that cause more deaths than anything else
-Boar skins are way too hard to find for an essential early crafting recipe
-Menu system is cumbersome at best
-Fall damage very inconsistent, even with skill that reduces it
-Looting items is a chore
-Easy to max out money, making collecting impossible in some cases
-Tons of misspellings and minor to moderate bugs, requiring reloads
-Second half of game in particular is buggy as sh!t

The way in which these games are structured?  Their plots?  Beats me.  But, even though Far Cry 3 was firmly one of those games, it was still OK.  I didn't feel like I was performing tedious repetitive actions over and over and over.  It allowed me to shoot and collect and sneak in equal measures.  It still looks pretty good even though it's about a decade old at this point.  That said, that plot is kinda stupid.  Not in it's silly premise, which I will buy into in spite of its sillyness.  But why does teh game present an antagonist, only to have you kill him 2/3rds of the way through and then BEHOLD his even EVILER Daddy-figure.

Don't know how they managed to fuck up 4 and 5. 4 was ok and had a few improvements over 3, such as the ability to move dead bodies and the mini helicopter. Other than that they shit the bed on 4 and 5, especially 5. Far Cry 3's biggest draw for me was very simple and the same for every game: it was IMMERSIVE; that, coupled with game control, is the most important part of every game. Far Cry 3 was immersive, 4 not as much and 5 not at all. They could have done far cry 3.1 and 3.2 where he returns to the islands for whatever reason and they would have done much better than 4 and 5 did. If you like FPS/Stealth/Action/Adventure/RPG and you haven't played this then you're a tool. Get it you tool!!! You'll friggin love it!So I've changed to not recommended because of the updates and constant game crashes now. I can't play for more than 20 minutes before it hard crashes. A few times the few saves you get, one manual and one auto, they both crashed on loading but finally loaded after many tries.Also, all of my reviews center around what was done wrong, not right. This game is not perfect and has many glaring flaws, all of which could have been overlooked if the game actually ran properly.It starts out with the main character's big brother killing a pirate in a laughable way and says, ""And that's what they teach you in the army."" Yah, ok, sure. Then, they're trying to fix a completely demolished and unfixable boat with coconuts? The boat is in a cave on the top of a hill with no reasonable way of reaching the ocean. All the while the island is teaming with working boats, many of which I've already stolen and were large enough to get us all back to civilization. Really  f u c k i n g  moronic premise. The situation with a responsible capitalist buggerer, Buck, is excruciatingly annoying. There was an obvious trade of his life for your friends but the protagonist, Jason Brody, is too stupid to understand this simple solution and runs around doing the buggerers errands. Then, when Jason shows up to trade for the release of his friend, he just turns his back on Buck and walks into his basement, not knowing what's awaiting him. Just absurd. Dead animals are lost to the jungle constantly, a huge problem they fixed in FC4. And how is killing rabid dogs with an RPG an effective means of control? All the killing animal quests had appropriate weapons to manage the wildlife, but an RPG for dogs was just stupid. I understand they needed a process for the story, but constantly getting caught by Vaas was also ridiculous. They never explained how Jason survives after getting stabbed in the heart. It certainly seemed like a fatal stabbing, but he just walked away from it like it didn't happen. The ubisoft launcher, like every launcher, is a piece of  s h i t  that makes everything more difficult and usually screws up everything after an update, which are frequent. And, as mentioned above, the minimal game files. There are only 3 game files and each one only has 2 saves, one manual and one auto. Only one file can be used per game. Pretty pathetic. Overall a great game and one of my favourites but I can't recommend it anymore because ubisoft hasn't been supporting it or their customers.Also, you are required to download and use Uplay and Ubiconnect, both of which are a fu cking nightmare to use and will fu ck your game every time.

Their refusal to provide any method to download the DLC even for people who did purchased it is inexcusable. In addition they have refused to include a LAN connection feature, completely locking out the multiplayer and co-op modes as well, despite the fact it would have cost them very little to include it. Even though the co-op mode was terrible, it still should be able to exist, such that we can learn from it's failings. This is the only real review of it, but it is excellent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4g8jSTsk1g     It is a real shame because it is an excellent game that is worth playing for reasons that have already been elaborated ad nauseam by hundreds of reviewers. It helped popularize a ton of features that are still in games today. It is one of the best and most interesting examples of an open world, shallow RPG, stealth, action, amalgamation, before this pseudo genera was milked to death.

[h1]How I Found Out About ""Far Cry 3""[/h1]
Well, where to start. To put it simply, I rented Far Cry 3 on the Ps3 a little while after it came out. After it's release, weeks went by, as I heard more and more about Far Cry 3. Nothing was spoiled, but I heard so many good things about it. At the time, I really didn't have the money, so I decided to rent the game, like I use to do back in the day.

After picking up the game, I was able to play through about half of it, before needing to take it back. However, around Christmas, my parents got me Far Cry 3 on the Ps3 and I was able to finish my adventure.

About six months after that, I saw the Deluxe Edition of Far Cry 3 on sale on Steam, and picked it up. Then things became really good. 

[h1]Unfair FIrst Impressions[/h1]
Every game genre gets hate by some people. Mainly because of opinions, which is okay. There are genre' I don't like, and others I do. However, the main thing I see about Far Cry 3 in reviews that give it a low score is.....Uplay. Why, oh why must you give the [b]GAME[/b] a bad score because it uses Uplay? I understand, it's annyoing at times, especially needing to run it through two different clients, but to give the game itself a bad score because it uses Uplay, is very unfair. I have never had any problems running Far Cry 3 through both Steam & Uplay. Basically, when it says someone is playing Far Cry 3 on Steam, they actually have their Uplay open, as the game itself doesn't need to be running to say you're actually in-game.

Not to mention, Far Cry 3 has crafting in it, along with survival tactics. Someone went as far to report the game for being a Minecraft clone because of it. 

[h1]Review Of ""Far Cry 3""[/h1]
Far Cry 3 is an [b]open world[/b], [b]first person shooter[/b], [b]survival type[/b] game. With a very in depth story. Good and memorable characters. Amazing world, and game mechanics. 

The game takes you in the shoes of ""Jason Brody"", a rich kid who takes a vaction to an island with a group of friends. Before having enough time to enjoy themselves, Jason and his friends find themselves captured by pirates ruled by ""Vass"". It's Jason's job to break out of the slave camp and get his friends back. Having never shot or killed anyone, it is up to you to learn how to take down your foe using a wide variety of weapons. Using drugs made off of plants from the jungle, and working alongside people like Denis. Can you make it happen?

Far Cry 3 allows you to form your story. Everyone's playthrough will be different. 

The world of Far Cry 3. The world is massive. In my Just Cause 2 review, I talked about the world being massive, but mostly empty. Here, the world is not only massive, it isn't empty. Everywhere there is something to collect, capture, destroy, hide from, or [b]DIE[/b] from. The world is split between two islands, which take part at different sections of the story. Each lush with plains, jungle's , a lot of killer animals, green, some more green, beautiful oceans and caves. Far Cry 3 is a graphically intense looking game. The views are just amazing. The world is populated by loot, like weapons, money, and relics. There are also deadly animals, like the Tiger, or Cassowary. Not only that, pirates, who only mean to kill you. 

Far Cry 3 does it nicely, where the whole game isn't out to kill you. The pirates will get into fights with the natives. Angry animals will attack civilians, and pirates. You could sit at a far, watching through the scope of a sniper rifle, as a Tiger slips through the enemy defense and takes down a group. 

Thrown about this world are these plants. These plants can be used to craft drugs to help you with many things. Like detecting animals, or increasing maximum health, etc. Along with crafting drugs, you can also craft other items. Like wallets to carry more money, weapon holsters to carry more weapons, or munitions pouch to carry more grenades. One thing that's strange about this is the fact that you must skin animals to craft these. However, for one thing you might need 2 Tiger skin, and the next, 1 Deer skin, see my problem with this?

Scatered around the world are [b]strongholds[/b] or ""outposts"" that are controlled by the pirates. You can take these down by killing all pirates on the inside. By capturing one of these strongholds, it makes the territory around you safe, and creates a fast travel system. Now, how you approach these strongholds to take them down is all up to you. You have full freedom to do what you want. You could run right in with heavy machine guns blazing it out. You sit from a far with a sniper rifle and pick them off. You could sneak in, perform takedowns and use a stealth recurve bow. Or you could lure an animal into the base. There are so many things you could do. 

To take down these strongholds, you need weapons, right? Worry no more. The weapons provided in Far Cry 3 consist of pistols, SMG's, Assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, HMG's, flare gun's, flame throwers, and way more.

Now, while on a mission, though they provide a good story, you are restricted most of the time. Meaning you can't really approach the way you may want to. 

Alongside the main story, you of course have side missions. These are of two types, but work and are fun. The first of them being the Hunter missions. Where you take out an animal for various reasons. The second being the Wanted Dead missions, where it is your job to take down a baddie with your knife/machete. 

You also earn XP for getting kills and completing missions. XP will gain you skill points, which then lead to you choosing a skill you'd like. One problem with this system is, you don't have access to all the skills until you get futher into the story. As the skills move on, they get kind of more useless. However that's just my opinion.

If there is really anything else I don't care about in this game, it's that the second half falls short of the first half. It doesn't really keep the hype going, it kind of dies down. 

[h1]Thoughts (Other)[/h1]
I'd like to post this here. Far Cry 3 is so far my most favorite single player experience of all time. The story was great, the gameplay was great. The soundtrack is amazing, and brings man tears. This was one of the best things I have ever played. Now a days, I use a hardcore mod. Mods are available for Far Cry 3 that can fix things, or make the game more realistic and hard. Now, obviously Far Cry 3 being my favorite, I cannot wait for the release of Far Cry 4 which only comes in a couple weeks. I cannot WAIT.

[h1]Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)[/h1]
Far Cry 3 is a great game that is well worth the time. For the story, the world, and the gameplay. Every piece of this game is full of greatness. You ability to do what you want beings a new level to video games. We need more, like this.

Pro's:
+Amazing story.
+Great memorable characters.
+Beautiful world that's full of life.
+Great weapon mechanics.
+Fantastic gameplay.
+Big populated open world.

Con's:
-Second half of game falls a little short.
-Some of the crafting is strange.
-Skill tree could use a little work.

Overall Rating: About a 14/15 (Must Own!)

I will admit even on the easiest mode in this game, I tended to struggle quite a bit, especially during the last third of the game with the privateers however it did not make this game any less enjoyable. With a skill tree that you can literally see get inked on your arm as you advance through the game and fun side quests, you will not get bored. The Wanted Dead quests are an exception however as they get quite repetitive, something that definitely got improved on in the eye for an eye and assassination missions in Far Cry 4. The story is pretty good up to the point where the [spoiler] point Vaas dies [/spoiler] and now you are after Hoyt. The game honestly loses momentum after that point and you do not even get enough reasons to dislike him before the game wants to finish that storyline too. The ending while 'good' is not really the most logical, however certainly is clever and I do think that both possibilities are realistic and neither are really happy endings for obvious reasons. I certainly enjoyed playing this game as I have with most of the Far Cry games however I didn't bother to platinum because as many know already and I have beat like a dead horse, Ubisoft doesn't add Steam achievements. On a final unrelated note, I like to disagree with the people that say Far Cry 4 is a re-skinned FC3, sure it reuses a lot of stuff, but with many much needed upgrades to gameplay to make the story, outposts, collectibles, side missions, etc etc a lot more enjoyable. The detailed locations and bell towers are definitely a pretty notable improvement.  However that doesn't make this game any less enjoyable especially with possibly one of the most iconic video game villains of all time, Vaas.

This mindset lead me to point out tons of flaws in the game: no auto-drive, grappling hook or wingsuit, parachute (which was how Jason found himself in Rook Island). I had none of the additional stealth options like beehives, throwing knives and only 1 bow. The vehicle handling felt a bit off, with no shooting allowed. With FC3 being set in 2012 (only 2 years before the events of FC4), the lack of a Buzzer or even Hovercraft felt limiting when traversing the world.

Certain quests seemed to ignore some of the ""rules"" that have been set so far; an example being the quest ""A Man Named Hoyt"" where you are tasked to remain undetected, where shooting a lone enemy would instantly fail the mission, but take-downs were allowed.

Of course, this didn't mean that I didn't enjoy many of the other features that the game had to offer.
You have access to one of the strongest sniper rifles in the game pretty early on (the AMR), making it quite easy to stay a safe distance away, whilst picking off even the toughest of enemies.
The threat of falling right off a radio tower often had my heart pounding in my throat, whilst also allowing a little reprieve from the blood-shed
The variety of syringes brought along some neat tactics.
Then there are the animals: RHINOS are gone; eagles... gone; devil fish.. gone. There is also quite a significant variety, making crafting a fun side-quest to pursue and complete quite early on. Even if you don't set out to pursue it, the Path of the Hunter missions line up nicely with completing all inventory packs and holsters.
The open ocean did mean that almost drowned Jason a few times by just trying to explore for a bit and take in the beauty, with turtles and manta rays swimming about.  And let's not forget about sharks.  THERE WERE SHARKS!

When the wingsuit is unlocked, I would specifically run up cliffs just to fly down.
With how little game-time crocodiles had in FC4, seeing a crocodile for the first time sparked some joy. Even though I wouldn't dive into the swampy rivers without using a Hunter's Instinct Syringe.  Even wingsuit-diving into rivers would have my heart racing... Sadly crocs were not done much justice here either.

The first half of the story felt a little dull compared to Sabal's and Amita's struggles in Kyrat, and I would not call the second half a Tim Burton masterpiece either, but the sense of a more personalised story line was a good change of pace compared to fighting in what felt like ""someone else's war"", for a purpose that you are end up feeling guilty for regardless of your choice (Sabal or Amita).
The second half also unlocked a few of those missing features from before, making the final hours a lot of fun, even to a point where that it might be enough motivation that FC5 and after may just be added to my library before long.",1679220452,1679220452,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-Updating everyday

The gameplay is fun, but the story's terribly short and rather mediocre. 

The game's length comes primarily from doing side missions, whereas if you focused on main quests, the game wouldn't be very long really at all. The side missions are also incredibly repetitive too. You only have three: Hunt animal, kill specific person with a knife, and capture outposts.

Capturing outposts is kind of a negative though, because it means the island becomes safer and you are engaging less and less often with the enemy. Plain and simply, it gets boring wandering a vast island with no one to fight at all. You have all these weapons, and the most you'll use them on are the animals around you who target you like you're a big red flag with the words ""kill me"" written on it. 

A thing I don't like about this game is that it rewards you for being stealthy. Like, TOO much. 

Go aggressive, and you get 500 XP. No alarms triggered, you get 550 XP. 
Go stealthy, you get 1500 XP. That's 1k more XP, and the bonus XP you get from headshotting (20) is NEVER going to add up to the amount you get from going purely stealthy. 

Also, takedowns reward LOADS of XP. Kill this big ol' guy here, 750 XP. Chain a few kills, gain hundreds of XP, quickly and easily. It's crazy how much you get. 

Also, I don't really get why, but they let you have access to almost every single craftable item from the start of the game. Right out of the gate, you can go hunt, craft, and upgrade, each and every item in the game to their second-to-highest level, with the only thing stopping you being rare items only found on mission-specific animal hunts. 

The sense of growth and progression is ruined for the entirety of the rest of the game. You've already gotten pretty much as strong as you can possibly get, there's nothing the game can do anymore to make you actively feel like you're progressing toward anything at all. 

Also, I hate how the game handled its weapons. 

There are just ""best weapons"", in each category. There's no reason to use X, Y, or Z weapon, when W (or T) weapon, does the exact same thing but better in every way. I don't even understand why this is a problem games have to begin with, stop putting all of these weapons in the game if they're completely and utterly useless against its competition with zero special case uses to justify even having it in the first place.

Vaas is a great villain, and a great character, but the protagonist becomes a pretty unlikable character quickly. He's turning insane, but it's done in just such an unlikable manner that he seems more like an @sshole than an insane person. The rate at which he turns insane is unnaturally fast too, which makes it weird and awkward that over the course of a few days he just suddenly barely gives a single shit about any of his friends and just wants to kill people.",1679176283,1679176283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story - You play as a college student who finds himself in a very bad situation, has absolutely no military training but still manages to use every single weapon he encounters, cracks a thumb and is healed back to full health, fights tigers, cougars and sharks on a daily basis and is high. The main antagonists are Vaas and some dude named Hoyt who has too little screen time but becomes irrelevant after a poker game. In my opinion Vaas was the real main antagonist because of the impact he had for the main character.

Gameplay - Amazing, the game is open world. It doesn't force the player to do the main quests one after the other and even tells the player that they can explore the island, exploration can't be done 100% without doing some quests because of lore reasons. You have a lot of activities besides the main quests such as assassinations, hunting trips, side quests, etc.

Music - Fitting, nothing out of the ordinary... SIKE, you listen to Skrillex while burning down crops and Richard Wagner - Ride of The Valkyries while escaping in a black hawk.

The game still stands today and has a lot of content, the only downside is that you have to log into uPlay every single time you start the game.",1678979641,1678979641,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The combat in Far Cry 3 is fast-paced and intense, with a wide range of weapons and tactics available to players. The game's skill tree system allows players to customize their character's abilities, making it possible to tailor their gameplay experience to their personal preferences. The game's AI is also impressive, with enemies reacting realistically to the player's actions and tactics.

The story in Far Cry 3 is well-written and engaging, with memorable characters and a compelling narrative. The game's themes of survival, revenge and redemption add depth and emotional weight to the gameplay, making it a satisfying and fulfilling experience from beginning to end.

Terrible optimization. Even on modern devices there are freezes and frame drops.
Horrible gameplay. There are a lot of flaws in it. A lot of monotonous missions. It's just not interesting to play. For the whole game did not use injectors. Their use is long and not dynamic, as in Far Cry 4.

The main antagonists like Vaas and Hoyt are probably for me ones of the best characters in video game history.

I love Michael Mando from Better Call Saul, and what little time we got to spend with him in-game as Vaas is actually quite compelling, but he is literally the only interesting character. (SPOILER) You'd think with his face plastered on every piece of marketing material, you'd at least get to fight the guy for real, not another damned QTE.

For a game that prides itself in the transformation of its protagonist, Jason Brody's journey lacks subtlety, compounded by lackluster voice acting.

The gameplay doesn't age well. It's the progenitor of all the ""Ubisoft's open-world problems"": padding, rule-of-three, outposts, rinse and repeat a million times...at least the side quests aren't pointless because you at least get stronger for doing those.  

Worse, this game makes me feel like I need to take a shower afterwards. Half way into it, suddenly it tried to be Uncharted (the mission design also sucks) only for that quest line to be capped off with an absolutely DISGUSTING ""revelation"" (like...yeah, like I couldn't pick up that the guy was a predator, huergggh...!).

Well, you can privateer the original weird monster/alien game. It's really good, but also very old and not for sale on steam or uplay, hence why you would want to privateer it.

FarCry 2, very gritty, story is a bit unclear but that's part of the charm, you feel lost in the middle of Africa with nothing but your gun and your medicine to keep you alive. Still kinda old and mostly experimental in the series.

FarCry 3... Captivating story good gunplay, good character development (even if it does lack a slow ramp from innocent party guy to murderous machine), good villains, fantastic acting, enough freedom in the story and gameplay that you can actually have fun your way (use the environment against the enemy, stealth everything or be the most badass-rambo-like version of the main character).

And although it's many years old, it was a buggy mess compared to the other two.
They weren't perfect, but at least they tried.

Issues
- Ubisoft Connect requiring me to sign in EVERY TIME I want to play.
- Far Cry 3 Online trying to connect, failing, and interrupting everytime I press pause on reload.
- Hard crashes mid mission causing me to have to redo it all
- No saving mid mission
- Using the Loot button to be the same as replace weapon
- Weird Zoom bug 
- Switching to the sniper rifle after planting a bomb in a mission, even though I had another weapon equipped

Additionally, some questionable design decisions (I played in Hard Mode, so take it with a grain of salt)
- Predator animals hanging around RIGHT OUTSIDE a safe area, causing you to get instantly mobbed
- No indication of more unlockable weapons coming up, causing one to perhaps waste money after unlocking everything mid game
- Awkward fade to black between cutscenes
- Field of view not kept in ingame cutscenes and climbing ladders, causing a nauseating zoom out effect at the end of these

And many more small irritations.

I ended up finishing the game due to sunk cost fallacy and because it is still a fun experience, but I expected much more, and I can't understand how this game was so successful.

Do not recommend. Not buying Ubisoft games ever again. Painful.

Far Cry 3 is an open world first person shooter game developed and published by ubisoft released in 2012 the game recieved critical acclaim prasing its island setting amount of content gameplay and story
in my opinion this game is one the best games i ever played 

Visuals :the game looks great with great lighting great foliage design and the enviroments are bright vibrant hiding the terrible things that is going on in the islands and they immerse me in the world

Sound : the sound is great with a great sundtrack and some absolutely fantastic voice acting from michael mandos performance as vaas who truly feels insane 

gameplay the game is designed as a first person shooter set in an open world called the rook islands the islands are beautiful with so much wildlife the wildlife has everything from crocodiles sharks to deer tigers and monkeys the world truly feels alive and the animals act extremely realistically and aggresively the animals hunt other animals and it feels like every animal is going to attack you it really boosts the tension because you dont know whats gonna happen next the 2nd island doesnt unlock until you get further the story missions are linear with only one way to complete the only choices is during the ending there is a lot of side activities 

1-Outposts: outposts are territories that you can take over from enemy soldiers the outposts are all non linear with lots of ways to go through them you can do assault or go stealth once you takeover an outpost it becomes a fast travel point once you takeover all of the outposts you can restart the outposts and do them all over again

2-supply drop: you must drive through markers on a quad bike to deliver medical supllies

3-Path of the Hunter: a poth quest is unlocked after taking over an outpost you have to hunt a rare animal and skin it to unlock the highest tiers of crafting equipment

4-trials of the rakyat: you have to gun through waves of enemy troops within a time limit with a fixed set of weapons

5-wanted dead: find a pirate commander and take him out with a 
specific kind of weapon

6-poker: just straight up poker

7-radio towers: climb all of the radio towers and make the map more visible climbing radio towers also gives you free weapons making you want to climb all of them

8-map editor: there is a map editor for far cry 3 and its not as complex as later entries map editors but you can still make really cool maps with it but the map editor is not available on the ps4 and xbox one versions

pros 
1-great visuals
2-fun and challenging combat
3-lots of activities
4- awesome story and characters
5- great soundtrack and voice acting 
6- awesome world to explore
7- lots of awesome guns 

cons
1- the framerate on ps3 and xbox 360 is not that good it runs at 25 fps mostly but on ps3 its incredibly laggy after a patch its still laggy this game is really pushing these consoles to the limit 
2- there is no map editor or multiplayer on xbox one and ps4

this game is great with lots of content beautiful visuals and an indepth storyline 

THIS GAME GETS A 10/10

[/b]The Story[b]
I quite enjoyed the story of FC3. I did not come into this game blind, I knew the over arching plot of the game but I was still nicely entertained by the cutscenes and some fun bombastic moments. 
Vass is a pretty nice villain and is probably One of the most iconic in this series. The secondary villain though, was a dissapointment, he's not bad but he doesn't have the same presence and character entertainment value that Vass does.
The cutscenes are very well animated with good voice acting to support. A change from the previous entry is the fact that the cutscenes are actual cutscenes and not just the characters simply facing in your general direction and sound coming out.
It's not the most complex story, the characters start off a little dumb, but I found it quite enjoyable in the end.


[/b]The Graphics:[b]
Far Cry 3 looks decent, there’s a definite upgrade in lighting and texture quality over the Far Cry 2. The only problems I had with the presentation of the game is that the far blur and the ambient occlusion effects are too strong. Other than that the game looks great for what it is. 
I used the Far Cry 3 Redux mod to remove the far blur and change the ambient occlusion effect. It also changed some of the UI to make it less cluttery, which I found to be a nice change.
I also used reshade.
Optimization wise, the game ran well on max settings both unmoded and moded.

[/b]The Audio:[b]
The audio is fine. Generally, I found the soundtrack to not be particularly memorable (I had to reinstall the game just to remember what it sounded like).  Character audio though sounds great and the voice acters do a good job. Gun sounds are also nice and since audio is important in gameplay to find enemies the mixing is also good.
[/b]The Gameplay:[b]
Far Cry 3 is imo, the first game in this series that feels and plays like the stereotypical Ubisoft open world; the towers, the map revealing, the outposts, its all there but its not as boring as it sounds because a lot of the busy work is optional but the map revealing and the towers actually provide a benefit in revealing the map and reducing the amount of enemies so that you can focus on the main campaign or whatever else you want to do.
My playstyle for this game was stealth backed up by fire as the fire spreading in this game is great and a little bit op.
I did only about 3 of the side missions but focused mainly on the campaign missions.

[/b]Overall:[b]
I liked Far Cry 3, the game was pretty fun and the story kept me going without much trouble or loss of interest. Game still looks pretty decent and hasn’t aged too badly in 2022. 

[/b]Tips:[b]
-	Fire is friend
-	Far Cry 3 Redux mod is pretty good.

All the Far Cry games are first person shooters set in an open world.  I also loved how they themed each one based on a classic novel.  I'm actually going to rate all of them and list the books, I think they are inspired by:
2004 - Far Cry (The Island of Doctor Moreau, 1896, H. G. Wells) - VERY GOOD
2008 - Far Cry 2 (Heart of Darkness, 1899, Joseph Conrad) - BETTER
2012 - Far Cry 3 (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, 1865, Lewis Carroll) - BEST!
2014 - Far Cry 4 (At first I thought maybe The Man Who Would Be King, 1888, Rudyard Kipling, but now I don't have a clue.) - SECOND BEST
2018 - Far Cry 5 (Don't think it took any book as it's theme) - Disappointing
2021 - Far Cry 6 - haven't played

Bottom Line:  Far Cry 3 used to be the best of the whole lot then Ubisoft stopped supporting the server.  Which means it will constantly try to log on but be unable so you've got that constant delay.  Worst of all, the some of the best parts of the DLC for this game are no longer available as they were accessed on the server.  So I've paid for them but no longer have access to them.  I originally recommended this one but now I recommend you just forget about it and play FarCry 4 instead.  Beautiful setting, engaging protagonist, best ever antagonist.  Great story and excellent characters you meet along the way.  The problem is this game has an expiration date and it has expired. Super disappointing.

The game starts off strong story-wise with a great hook and plot setup. 
This is also where you meet Vaas for the first time, played by Michael Mando who is a terrific actor.
Vaas is the leader of a pirate cartel that is in control of the island and you will have multiple encounters with him throughout a playthrough where his mentally insane and psychotic actions are on full display.

These moments are without a doubt this game's biggest strength.

now for the bad stuff, the story is super linear. the main goal is to rescue your captured friends and escape the island. 
I feel like the open world would be a great way to make a personal choice on who to rescue first but that's not possible unfortunately. The island itself is uninteresting to look at and lacks any meaningful landmarks to peak my interest in exploring. There are no meaningful rewards for exploration, the best guns can be bought from a merchant, and animal locations are shown on the map. the whole island has these copy and pasted favelas, radio towers and bunkers that all look the same. The same 2 side missions are copy and pasted everywhere ( hunt animal & kill commander). Guns feel pretty basic and the enemies will sometimes dodge incoming bullets in unrealistic manners just to artificially inflate your engagement with them.

two thirds through the game you ""take care"" of Vaas but with the main antagonist missing the last portion of the game becomes a real letdown.

At the end of the story, there is a choice to make; stay on the island with the locals or escape from the island with your friends. This choice feels unwarranted with the way the story is presented.",1675871617,1675871959,False,1,1,0.450704246759414673,0,True,False,False

I first played this game when I was about 16. I used to work at our family's tiny convenience store. I had a PC with a Pentium processor, 4 GB of ram, and gt 730 2 GB DDR3. This was my first own PC that I built with my own money, I did not have a lot of money back then.

So anyways I had nothing to do and my parents forced me to work then, not that I was against it. I was okay with it because it was summer, and I would be even more bored alone at home watching anime. So, one day I went to buy a new game at our local pirate SD store that had everything, Movies, Games, Music, and Anime. I remember from the internet and some people that this game was good and that it had a very good crazy villain, I remember exactly what I said to the store guy ""I want a game with a crazy villain"" the store guy found this game for me and I bought it.

This game was perfect for me because I could pause it at any time and help the customers when they entered our store. I paused this game more than 1000 times because whenever I played, a customer would enter, and I would pause. Then they would leave, then another would enter. So I would play for about 5 minutes until the next customer) Of course, there were 1 hour non-stop plays because nobody would enter sometimes.

But this never ruined my experience. It would end up just extending my enjoyment of the game. So there it was a game that had everything I wanted, exploration, fucking amazing story, replayability, and life lessons. This was it, I found the game I would play for 4 months. I found my masterpiece, FARCRY 3. 
This game changed my whole life. This is not an oversaturation, I will explain shortly. First of all, This helped me to move away from the suicidal thoughts I had back then which were very frequent. I was distracted from my problems and I was excited about something in my life again, even if my excitement was just a game. FARCRY gave me a reason to wake up every morning with the only goal to go to work so I can play this game. I consider it a great help to my life. 
Secondly, some lessons from the game were very helpful to me at that time, especially Dennises words:
""We spend our whole lives holding back. Imagine you can succeed if you just take what you want""
This fucking blew my mind, It cut me soo deep that holy shit it was something so deeply personal to me. This, later on, would help me to start learning the English language. Yes, I played FARCRY 3 in Russian first time. But it does change anything. Anyways, those powerful words were an inspiration for me to finally act on the problems and causes of stress in my life at the time. I finally did something I was thinking of doing a long time ago but was afraid of doing. I do that to this day. But I will not tell what exactly, this is the thing only I must know. 
So yes this game is something  I will never forget, It's a good memory and good inspiration, and because of that, I bought it on steam once I could afford it. Thank you to all the wonderful people who worked to create this masterpiece.

Regardless of how many hours it shows I played on steam. My actual hours are much greater. You can just add +800 hours to the current one and it would be more or less correct.

This is it for me. I wrote it mostly for myself so one day my future self might revisit this game and this review)

This game is just the golden treasure of oldschool days and making Far Cry 3 the biggest pot out there. Gunplay, the feeling of wandering around the tropical island full of dangerous animals to hunt which never gets old with its exotic and fun activities, the beautiful scenery and gazes to glance upon. But we all know the main star here is the antagonist none other than Vaas himself. I'll get to that in a moment- but pretty much the game ages well with the only exception of few things.

Screw. Ubisoft launcher. Seriously. Additionally it's odd how achievements from Xbox version didn't make it into here other than existing inside Ubisoft system itself but nobody honestly cares about the launcher other than knowing it's exhausts you very fast from mentioning non-stop how you're not connected to the servers.
Now there are few bugs and glitches here and there especially how enemies penetrate you through some obstacles or even from losing sight from an enemy Sniper but still shoots you behind an object or so. And more to say that exist but it's still doable to ignore these on hardest difficulty for preference being.
I feel like the biggest and yet saddest part is that when Vaas is out of the way, the game feels... boring without him. I'm not saying other antagonists and all were bad or anything it's just the pizzazz and feel wears off. I mean Vaas himself is everywhere especially on the cover of the game. The finale part is boring as it goes. And sad to say that I stopped caring afterwards for the plot being linear and main protagonist being as boring as it can be... not to mention ending choices being extremely stale. I mean heck, even the collectibles just give you tropes and info about the island but no rewards to reap other than for cash and XP boost for starting levels. 

But everything else was enjoyable. If you want to hunt animals, glide, drive, assassinate pirates, customize cool looking guns and all. Then this is still worthy of a buy. On sales it's very cheap so give it a shot.",1675268871,1675268871,True,17,0,0.67244488000869751,0,True,False,False

The visuals are very amazing, and the locations have a lot of attention to detail; as a result, the experience is quite immersive. Players must travel the island, accomplish tasks, and improve their weapons and abilities in order to make progress in the game, which makes for a difficult yet gratifying gaming experience. The narrative of the game is intriguing, and its progression will keep players interested right up until the credits roll.

Preciso começar esse review dizendo que é impressionante O ABISMO DE QUALIDADE de FAR CRY 3 comparado ao seu péssimo título anterior FAR CRY 2, Far Cry 3 é um avanço GIGANTESCO. O jogo possui um enredo que realmente é interessante, você consegue se importar com os personagens coadjuvantes, que tem cada um sua própria personalidade e traumas. Jason Brody é um personagem o qual a trama explora não só o seu passado mas também um lado filosófico de quem o protagonista é ou está se tornando.

No jogo você tem uma variedade de armas considerável ( dentre elas: pistolas, arcos-flecha, submetraladoras, machine guns, rocket laucher, lança granadas, etc ), com um destaque em especial para armas de assinatura que são armas TUNADAS e únicas. Um DESTAQUE NO JOGO É A MECÂNICA DE SERINGAS, esse sistema realmente me surpreendeu no jogo, você tem VÁRIOS TIPOS DE SERINGAS para serem criadas e cada uma delas tem seu efeito ÚNICO ( cura, à prova de fogo, percepção aguçada, corrida aprimorada, aprimoramento de fôlego debaixo d'àgua, invencibilidade, etc ) é realmente impressionante a quantidade de efeitos que elas te concedem, te aconselho à olhar com bons olhos para esse sistema, pode te salvar.

Não poderia de mencionar que uma das coisas que mais traz a fama que Far Cry 3 ainda tem nos dias de hoje é sem sombra de dúvidas, o seu vilão Vaz. O cara é realmente a definição de INSANIDADE, o tipo de vilão que você ama odiar, um DESTAQUE no jogo. Hoyt também tem o seu charme, tão doido quanto, porém não tem tanto tempo de tela para ser explorado com tanta profundidade igual a Vaz, fica aqui a menção honrosa pelo menos.

A VIDA NÃO É UM MORANDO, NÃO É MESMO? Então preciso te avisar que, caso você como eu, tenha intenção de platinar esse título, terá que instalar alguns MODS para poder adquirir as conquistas do modo COOP ( jájá eu falo desse encosto, sim eu odiei ). Vamos lá, Far Cry 3 tem pontos negativos também, um deles afirmo ser o modo cooperativo, além do mesmo não estar disponível devido ao desligamento feito pela Ubisoft no final de  2022 ( impossibilitando que mesmo as pessoas que compraram as DLC's possam baixá-las para jogar ), sua dificuldade ( mesmo no CASUAL, na minha opinião é desleal, os inimigos são uma esponja de balas e você morre fácil nesse modo, não tendo nem ao menos a opção de se curar quando quiser, você só pode se curar quando estiver A BEIRA DA MORTE ), realmente achei a pior coisa do jogo, que TIROU TODO O BRILHO que eu vi enquanto jogava a campanha. Se você quiser platinar infelizmente terá que se submeter a umas 6h ( aproximadamente ) para completar todos os mapas que precisa para as conquistas.

Outra coisa que notei ao longo das minhas 56-57h de jogo, foi que ÀS VEZES, quando você segura o botão para realizar alguma ação ( curar ou interagir ) o jogo simplesmente manda um FODA-SE MERMÃO, e você morre ou não consegue realizar a ação, isso é bem irritante. No geral Far Cry 3 é um jogo muito bom, com um enredo e personagens cativantes, uma história interessante e mecânicas ANOS LUZ na frente de seu antecessor: Far Cry 2. Um jogo extremamente divertido ( com excessão do seu modo coop ), o qual eu fico feliz em te recomendar. Tem uma comunidade muito legal que irá te ajudar com MODS para conseguir acessar o modo coop e DLC's ( então dê uma olhada na aba Guides da Steam ) No fim a escolha é sua, espero que eu tenha ajudado e bom jogo!",1674840015,1674840015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although this is still an interesting game to play, it's showing its age compared to even games like Farcry 5 or Farcry Primal. There are a lot of odd bugs and glitches, mostly technical ones, and design flaws. For example, not being able to change to output for sound while the game is running. If you want to use headphones, you'd better be using them when you start the game.

The main issue is the online aspect of it; I think they call it 'game as a service'? The part where they want you to log in to play the game through Connect, but Farcry 3 online service is long discontinued. The game still almost constantly checks for connection to this nonexistent service, which wastes a lot of time while playing and breaks any immersion you might have been experiencing. You'd think they would have patched that out when they discontinued the services, but you'd be WRONG.

Still it has held up pretty well and has been fun to play, so there's that. a decent game.",1674351583,1674351583,True,1,0,0.512593269348144531,0,True,False,False

I would honestly say that this game is my own personal Game Of The Year of 2012. It is quite fantastic and where Far Cry 2 failed with weak story and annoying malaria surges, this one is very well made! You do have lots of stuff to do. While it be some side missions, races, unlock new guns, hunt wild animals and use their skins to craft better gear, outpost clearing and Towers of ""unfogging map"", many collectibles.


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Massive world to explore and impressive visuals (neat graphics too!)
+Decent soundtrack throughout the whole game
+Addictive hunting, gathering, and crafting
+Lots of weapons and customizatioins
+Fantastic twisted villains (Vaas, Hoyt) and allies (Willis, Hurk)
+And best PRO, the moral of the game that tries to teach YOU, the gamer (IF YOU DO GET IT)[/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-Generic pointless multiplayer
-Linear story (but it is to be expected!)
-Scripted story levels that you don't have control over your actions
-Forced QTE 
-""Hold KEY"" to interact (very annoying and take's long to activate); 
-Voice acting of NPC are as worst as Far Cry 2 ""answering machines""
-Nothing noteworthy mentioned about Far Cry 1 aside from the Japanese Lost Letters and the geographical location of Rook Island.[/b]

They made some vast improvements to general gameplay, especially to fixing stealth, and character story and development, it feels like a much fuller game.  This was a step in the right direction.  It could have been harder on Master difficulty for my tastes, and certainly not as bad as malaria.

For the first time in the series, we see the hero is invested in the outcome, he has a horse in the race, and the game stays faithful to that pursuit to the end.  You're given quite a lot to do, if you like to string the game along and not rush through the main story too quickly.  The voice acting, particularly the villains, was really outstanding and the cinematics with Vaas in particular were crazy good.  The amount of personality he has was a lot of fun, in an evil way, and I found myself really looking forward to the next encounter. Quality stuff.  It almost made me root for him.  Maybe, a little bit I did.  

A couple things to note, keep an eye on your difficulty level, one or two times, it got bumped down for some reason.  I am adamant about playing the hardest difficulty whenever possible, and that really irked me, so watch out for that.   There is a ""secret"" quicksave on PC, F9 to quicksave, F11 to load the save.  For some reason, this is no where in the control mapping and it's not in the  tutorial sequence.  You can use it when you are not on a mission and in the mission area, but all other times, it can be very useful.  Otherwise, I did not encounter bugs that I can even recall.

I'll focus on the negatives and annoyances in this game since everyone already knows how Ubisoft games play.

The games full of technical problems of all types. I'll list some here:
1. Even though the game was ahead of its time visually, there's still visual faults and inconsistencies. The infamous SSAO options look really bad and almost make the game look like Borderlands because of that eyeliner look.
And indirectly lit scenes look weird.


2. The performance is awful on PC and the game's barely optimized. At 4k, the game only utilizes 60% of my GPU while being a micro-stuttering mess and consuming way too much power. 

3. The controls can be really annoying because there's many moments where your input gets ignored, or there's huge latency between you pressing something and the game responding. This can really ruin the combat.


The issues related to the mouse are the worst. 
First you'll notice that the game's sensitivty must be tweaked by modyfing the config files. Fair enough, tweaking configs is nothing new to people on PC. But the real pain starts once you realize that there's tons of options that must be edited outside of the game, including the graphics. 

The worst offender is the negative mouse acceleration, which in order to be disabled, requires you to download a packer/repacker program for the game's files. Something akin to winrar.

There's still more techincal problems to be mentioned, by I think you get the idea by now.

The rest of the problems lie in the gameplay itself.

The side activites feel like chores, with most of them being fetch missions. The voice acting accompanying them is ok at best.

The main missions feel unfairly difficult, since you mostly fight with the game's aforementioned techincal problems and not the enemies.

One of the unfair things that gets me is getting shot while stuck in animatons. There's so many moments where you're stuck in a healing animation where you still take full damage while it plays out. They should've made it so you take 90% less damage while healing basically.


Basically, a mostly fun, well thought out, mostly fair game, but one full of techincal problems.",1673790170,1673790288,True,3,0,0.561403512954711914,0,True,False,False

The game is set on a tropical island, and the players take on the role of Jason, a young man who is stranded on the island after a vacation gone wrong. The game has received critical acclaim for its immersive open-world gameplay, compelling story, and memorable characters. —Which is why I bought it on PC to relive and experience the fun and chaos that is, Far Cry 3 (With better graphics and a frame rate higher than 30)

One of the key elements that set Far Cry 3 apart from Ubisoft's other open-world games is its vast and diverse environment. The island is full of lush jungles, sandy beaches, and towering mountains that players can explore to their heart's content. The island is also home to a wide variety of wildlife, including lions, bears, and even elephants! 

Another aspect that makes Far Cry 3 stand out is its engaging story and characters. Players will find themselves drawn into the story as they strive to rescue their friends from the island's ruthless pirates, led by Vaas. Vaas, who is voiced by Michael Mando, is widely considered to be one of the most memorable and iconic video game villains of all time, thanks to his sadistic and unhinged nature. ( ""Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?"")

Far Cry 3 also offers a wide range of gameplay options, from stealthy and strategic to fast-paced and action-packed. Players can take on missions in a number of ways, whether that be by sneaking around and taking out enemies quietly, or by going in guns blazing. Additionally, players can also upgrade their skills and weapons, which allows them to take on tougher challenges and enemies as they progressed through the game.

Furthermore, Far Cry 3 also offers a wide range of side content. Players can take on various side missions, hunt for collectibles, etc. (That's how I got the Platnum Trophy lol). This allows players to enjoy their time on the island even more, and keep playing long after the main story.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Far Cry 3 to fans of the open-world genre. It offers a vast and diverse environment, a compelling story, memorable characters, and a wide range of gameplay options. It's considered one of the best games in the franchise. It's a game that anyone who enjoys open-world games, shooters, or a strong plot will appreciate. —If only Ubi made more games like this :(

Sure, like any game (especially a first person shooter) - it's got its flaws and weaknesses, but also a lot of strengths. For the era, this was a true gem, and a good balance between action and comedy in its play style. FC3 had a sorta ""Just Cause"" feeling, as you go through the jungle either stealthily or chaotically leaving all who dare oppose you dead. You trade realism for comedic moments and a mostly casual experience.

- one of the best stories in any fps game

- every time i tab out of the game it switches to windowed mode and i have to manually go to the pause menu to switch it back
- pause menu (which contains many essential gameplay features like crafting and skill trees) sometimes takes upwards of 10 seconds to load and half of the time i have to click out of a dialogue box informing me for the 30th time today that the far cry 3 servers are down

PROS:

- gameplay loop of outposts, looting and side missions is generally fun and satisfying
- environment is nice, I think the graphics still hold up for a game this old
- great antagonist with superb voice acting
- main story is interesting enough, even if it's too stretched out imo

CONS:
- random crashes sometimes
- single player DLC as well as the entire coop campaign is no longer available to play thanks to Ubisoft shutting down the servers
- protagonist is boring and annoying as well as his friends
- gunplay feels a bit janky and outdated
- syringe crafting works only in the menu and is awkward to use
- uninteresting and repetitive side content

It has a different feel than 1, 2 and 4 but imo Far Cry 5, if it didn't have such a horrible story and that silly ""get shot to death and dragged off somewhere"" mechanic for it, THAT game would rival this in terms of gameplay (not story). There's just more hashed out gameplay mechanics at use in Far Cry 5 but the story ruins that game, unlike with Far Cry 3.

Story and characters is where Far Cry 3 really excels, along with the ""Blood Dragon"" expansion witch could have been a new release all on it's own. That unfortunately wasn't purchased through Steam though so I can't review that, although it's just as good as FC3 imo.

If you are into the FC series and want to play one that has a great story with great acting then this title is for you. It has the infancy of all the great mechanics that came into the other games but also has obvious work into a great story, which the other Far Cry (2, 4, 5 , 6) games seemed to completely forget to do. Note: I haven't played FC6 I've just heard that story is non-existent in that title also.

So typical Ubisoft, not a big fan of that company - they find out a gameplay loop that people enjoy and they barely do anything to it except change up locations and some mechanics here and there. After awhile that loop is so bored into your mind that you become bored with it (hehe, pun...). Also they are horrific at optimization. I fully expected I wouldn't have those problems due to how old it was. Unfortunately I was wrong. There was a crashing issue that I had to find a fix for through the community forums which for a game this late? Omg how incredibly lame. I had to edit game files in Notepad++ and debug the issue on my own. Many ppl couldn't even get this fix to work so imagine getting this game, playing for about 4 or 5 hours in (that's when the crash happens) and then it crashes and there's nothing you can do about it.

This EXACT SAME PROBLEM happened with Assassin's Creed: Origins. I got up to the point where my kid is stolen by Amun or whatever and the game crashed. Another time I had to find a fix by scouring the internet. If i wasn't so tech savvy I'm sure many don't find the fix at all and it ruins the game experience. The fix for Assassin's Creed: Origins? I had to DOWNGRADE my graphics card driver to play the game. So in other words, I just stopped playing it bc it made all my other games look like S***. Ubisoft isn't really worth it anymore due to these horrible optimization issues. I try hard to avoid their games just because of this one problem.

So, if you do decide to get this game then try and play as much as possible before the 2 hr. mark to see if you can get a return. I did this with Assassin's Creed: Origin's and it was the first time ever Steam couldn't give me a refund. After arguing with them long enough I found that it wasn't in their hands but Ubisoft. So tbh I had fun with this game but it also once again made me lose faith in Ubisoft and I'm weary of getting there games in the future.

Altogether I'd give it a 7.5/10. 

Worth playing if you are into FPS's and the Far Cry series but I wouldn't go out of your way like I did to check it out unless you really feel like you'd enjoy even MORE Far Cry but with a decent story.",1672320166,1672320166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Fun gunplay 
-Interesting story, the Rakyat as well
-The development of the main character throughout the game is quite interesting and cool (though has flaws I'll come back to)
-A big and vast open world that's actually quite awesome

Cons:
-Keeps trying to connect you to the servers when you pause, even though the servers are down, annoying af
-THE FALL DAMAGE, OH MY GOD (If you fall like 2 meters, be prepared to say goodbye to half your health)
-The dialogue is so awful at times
-All the characters are lame and at the end of the game I only remembered the name of like 4 of them
-Vaas is apparently one of the best villains somehow, idk how because he has like no screen time and is disposed of mid game. He has some cool dialogue whenever you DO see him though, but he stands no chance against some of the other Far Cry villains
-The game tries to have emotional events with the main character but at the same time rush through because they don't have time for this shit, his brother literally dies in the beginning of the game and he's like ""NOOO"" then immediately gets over it and starts joking, like seriously, how do people consider this the best game?????

6.5/10 overrated as hell, but still a game I would recommend even with its colossal issues, because while the bad is bad and cringe is cringe, the good, is actually pretty god damn good",1672154672,1672154672,True,2,0,0.501061618328094482,0,True,False,False

One gripe I have with this game is how clunky the controls are considering it's a game that's been released a decade ago. I'm using a controller so for instance - the button for heal is same with swapping weapons so sometimes I fumble over switching to secondary weapon when I really mean is to heal. Reload is also same with interacting with objects (car, loots, etc) so like when I want a fast and easy escape with a vehicle under fire sometimes I get reload animations instead of getting inside the car.

The positives

+Great story and some great characters
+Some great voice acting
+Some pretty fun and creative side activities, and there aren't too few of them
+Combat is okay and varied for its time
+Stealth can be creative and fun
+Pretty good progression
+Good animations
+Great and memorable soundtrack

The negatives

-Too much repetition in side activities in the form of camps and towers
-The open world isn't very pretty
-The endgame after Vaas dies is kinda boring story wise
-Not much in the way of customization
-Bad optimization

But the stuff ubisoft wants you to do to just play it is absolutely insane. 
I've got a Uplay from way back when I first bought the game, I install it after 2 years and in that time a COMPLETELY NEW ACCOUNT for Ubisoft connect is required to even launch the game via steam.
I'm seriously considering just getting a torrent of this game to avoid all the unnecessary accounts they want me to create. Not to mention the absurd password creation. You can't have your nick or even a part of it in your password, you must have a ""special character"" whatever that means, (it doesn't take € as a special character wtf?), but you can't exceed 16 characters. Can someone at UBI tell me how the fuck am I supposed to fit all of that in a memorable password that I won't have to reset every time I want to actually use your apps?

As stated above: I like the game itself a lot and it has actually been the first game I bought on this account like 5 years ago, but ubisoft needs to get their shit together with the mandatory apps.

The first Far Cry in the series that is actually good too and well worth investing the time into...FC1 just didn't make any sense and FC2 was kinda boring and super repetitive, so I was initially worried this would suck too...but hey there are like, a million games in the series now, they had to get good eventually. This has so much more going for it, hunting, wanted posters, racing, weapon trials, poker the list goes on, and that's just side activities! Unfortunately the online servers for this are gone, so taking part in leaderboards is impossible, no multiplayer pvp stuff either, and unless you use a mod to play the coop stuff offline, you won't get to see any of that either! They did us a little dirty with any purchased DLC due to them been connected to the online services, essentially meaning you cant access them by normal means, thankfully there's a guide somewhere on here you can find that gives you a 100% safe work around to activate DLC for you to enjoy without the need for ubisoft online activation!

The story stays fairly engaging throughout the entire game and constantly introduced you to new and interesting characters all the time, along with some pretty good story and character developments. By the time you find yourself about halfway through, it all starts to get a bit crazy with psychedelic trips and explosive shootouts. What was most interesting was Jason's changes in his personality, how he becomes intoxicated and consumed by the ways of the Island both mentally and physically, really interesting stuff.

Gunplay feels solid and there's s great selection of guns, as well as a list of what they call ""Signature"" guns, a short list of unique versions of some of the guns but with unique stats and attachments you cant get on the basic models. The sights weren't great I have to be honest, in fact most of them barring the red dot sight and the sniper rifle scopes were all blurry and thick, made it borderline impossible to see where I was aiming most of the time, not a major issue for me since I'm usually a close to mid-range type so I use red dot or iron sights, but could be problematic for mid to long-range types.

Now i'm a sucker for RPG games, so when a game with RPG elements comes around I can't help but fall in love. Been able to develop yourself and become faster, stronger, more resilient, more stealthy, better with weapons is something I appreciate, because it somewhat breaks up the monotony of a game just going ""here's a gun, off you go"" and FC3 does it better by adding that visual element of every upgrade been represented by another part of his tattoo been filled in on his arm. You really FEEL like you've grown over time, as if your time is been rewarded with strength.

Considering the location, its kinda hard to NOT make the map just look the same everywhere you go...its a Caribbean island full of shanty towns and militia, mountains and dirt roads from one end to the other...but the numerous ways of been able to travel around and the abundance of fast travel locations makes it a forgivable sin, especially once you get the glider suit...mobility is just so fun in FC3 and it feels smooth and so well implemented. The cars were, for the most part, fine though REALLY fucking slidey, I ended up ditching the car and just running most of the time, it was like I was playing 'Colin Mcrae Rally'...it wasn't an issue at first but eventually cars started to annoy me, but also they became rare to find by the second half of the game.

General pacing of the game is great, nothing feels like its too long so you get those little dopamine hits when you're rapidly ticking things off the list to hit that sweet sweet 100% mark.

Really good game, glad I finally got round to playing and finishing it, fully recommend!",1671667616,1671667616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gizlilik ve sıcak çatışma. Bu ikisi arasında sürekli gidip gelmeler yaşıyorsunuz. Ama oyun gizlilik temeli üzerine yapılmış. Ama sıcak çatışmalar da hissiyatını çok iyi veriyor. Oynanış olarak klasik FPS oyunlarındaki gibi bir oynanışı var. Öğrenmesi kolay, ustalaşması orta düzeyde.

Oyunu bir marka yapan kısım burada. Oyunda adam öldürüp görev kastıkça deneyim puanları kazanıyorsunuz. Her kilometre taşında 1 yetenek puanı alıyorsunuz. Bu yetenek puanları ile kendinize geliştirmeler alabiliyorsunuz. Peki nedir bu geliştirmeler? Genelleme yaparsak, yeni öldürme teknikleri, gizlilik adına geliştirmeler, silahları daha iyi kullanabilme ve bunların türevleri şeklindeki geliştirmeleri karakterimize sağlayabiliyoruz. Bu yetenekleri yaptıkça sol kolumuzda bir dövme çıkıyor.

ilah olarak çeşitli silahlar mevcut. Tabancalar, hafif makineliler, av tüfekleri, saldırı tüfekleri, keskin nişancı tüfekleri ve özel silahlar olmak üzere 6 kategorimiz var. Her kategorideki silahlar çok az. Bu azlık oyun için kötü olmuş. Sadece 3 av tüfeği çeşidi var oyunda. Ben av tüfeği hastası olarak bu azlığı hoş karşılamadım. Saldırı tüfeklerinin maşallahı var. 7 tane saldırı tüfeği mevcut. Ben sadece tamam kullandığım için bunlara pek yanaşmadım. Tamam demişken özel kısmındaki alev silahı, roketatar, gibi değişik silahlar da mevcut. Silah özelleştirme olayı da var.

the story is nice even though it doesnt make much sense (there are a lot of boats on the island, you can leave at any time)
the experience was getting killed by dinosaur birds and being a badass,
the takedowns make you feel like an epic assassin and the knife takedown is just amazing.
and not to forget about the map editor.

the multiplayer just sucks i cant say much nice about it. it has some interesting mechanics but thats about it.

Replaying this game for the sixth time, but on PC for the first time. 

I am instantly transported back to my twelve year old self. Whilst the graphics don't hold up too well these days, the story and game play is timeless. I was glad to see the FC3 story revisited in the FC6 DLC. 

There is very little to not love about this game. The characters are rich and believable, the story and setting and gritty and truly convey a feeling of being a ""far cry"" away from home. The game play and wide array of weapons are also to be commended, truly pushed the limits for a game of the era. 

At the time of release (2012), Far Cry 3 was part of a relatively underground series from a big studio. Everyone knew Assassins Creed, but Far Cry was one of Ubisoft's more hidden gems. This game changed that forever. 2012 was a year of massive releases such as Black Ops 2, Mass Effect 3, Halo 4, Borderlands 2, and Diablo 3, yet Far Cry 3 held its own, winning game of the year. 

A true classic, remembered forever by me and many others.

Jason's drive into madness is illustrated very clearly for all audiences and is akin to the themes circulating in the public eye as of writing this in 2022, which include the lack of self-expression men have in contemporary oppressive corporate life, illustrated by Liza in the game and Jason's friends talking careers, which men like Jason break out of through escapist means, now turned literal.  
Like American Psycho, Jason's murder spree and enjoyment of such liberates him, and the island strips everyone of status and hones in on the primal instincts of hunt, survive, and ""you versus them.""  

The guns handle well, but everything's pretty slow to use.  It takes a solid 2 seconds to swap guns, reloading medium size guns like rifles at max speed still takes at least 3 seconds, and crafting things on the fly isn't a thing - you have to go into the menu to do that.  It might seem small, but this means that the speed of combat is limited.   
The melee kills are sleek and stylish - very nice to drop on two guys, stab both, then run up on a guy, stab him, and use his knife to throw at another guy.
I don't like this port to PC because the slots still assume you're on console.  You can only have enough slots as you have slots on a d-pad, and everything is inaccessible through number keys - you have to use a weapon wheel for things like C4 and mines.  

Ubisoft, ubisoft, ubisoft.  
This is one of the OGs so I can't fault it, but it's Ubisoft so you know what you're signing up for: go, climb tower, complete checklist missions, clear outposts, repeat.  Granted, clearing outposts are fun, but everything in this game besides the story is repeated for too long and it gets really sickening to have to play through it all.

I'm probably one of the few people who actually never played an M rated game until he was old enough. Yet I subconsciously remembered this game, not by watching or recommendation, but one little radio song...

It was around 2018, I found a mashup on SoundCloud of ""Tide is High"" by Blondie, mashed up with Charles Brotman & Jim Wolfe's ""Ukulele Girl"". Sadly I can't seem to find the mashup anywhere online anymore, but believe me when I say it was beautiful- unbridled joy & harmony. Listening to that on the bus rides to and from school in my senior year, it was a real vibe. Stuck with me forever as a real standout memory. I'd then look up each song individually after listening so much, and searching Ukulele girl on YouTube- that's when I heard the name Far Cry 3. The comments section was full of fans shouting out the game, and their memories driving through the jungle. It really is just a beautiful song, and it, along with those comments, stuck with me.

Years later, 2022: I'm going through a weird patch of my life, but at least I've got more times to play games. In fact, after playing so much TF2, I was actually craving a singleplayer FPS. One that was like a laid-back open world sandbox. That's when I remembered, that ukulele game... Far Cry 3! Oh hey whaddo ya know, an open world sandbox FPS! I mean yeah it sucked that UPlay was gone as of buying it, but it wasn't gonna put down my intrinsic interest over the course of years. So I picked it up on a Black Friday sale and...

Wow... What a hallmark of a video game.

When I finally played it, I couldn't believe how iconic this game was. From all the Vaas cutscenes I've seen ages ago through memes but repressed in my memory, to the many staple open world mechanics I've seen elsewhere. I had no clue it all traced back to Far Cry 3. But even then, this game seriously surprised me in so many ways, and really hit me in a way it only could today, after what I've been through in my recent life.

As I write this review, it is Far Cry 3's 10th anniversary, and also the day I completed the game. Like so many others years ago, I've become a lifelong fan. In the 5 days I played it straight, I thank this game dearly for cheering me up from my sadness with its good fun, for some amazing memories with some spectacular missions, and for helping me reflect on my own life thanks to the stellar character writing. It's not too late for a Game of the Year, is it? Game of the Decade??

Again, I never played many FPS games, and had no idea what Far Cry 3 was about even before buying it. I went in knowing nearly nothing. I certainly never expected to find one of my favorite games ever through a single song. Guess that's the staying power of music, right? All these years later, I wanna say...

Если вы смотрите эту запись, я, вероятно, мертв, убит моим зятем Хэнком Шрейдером. Хэнк уже больше года строит метамфетаминовую империю и использует меня в качестве своего химика. Вскоре после моего 50-летия Хэнк пришел ко мне с довольно шокирующим предложением. Он попросил меня использовать свои знания в области химии для приготовления метамфетамина, который он затем будет продавать, используя свои связи в мире наркотиков. Связи, которые он установил за свою карьеру в Управлении по борьбе с наркотиками. Я был... поражен, я... я всегда думал, что Хэнк был очень нравственным человеком, а я был... сбит с толку, сбит с толку, но я также был особенно уязвим в то время, что он знал и этим воспользовался. Я был в шоке от диагноза рака, который был готов разорить мою семью. Хэнк взял меня с собой и показал, сколько денег может принести даже небольшое производство метамфетамина. И я был слаб. Я не хотел, чтобы моя семья столкнулась с финансовым крахом, поэтому я согласилась. Каждый день я с сожалением вспоминаю тот момент. Я быстро понял, что был выше моих сил, а у Хэнка был партнер, человек по имени Густаво Фринг, бизнесмен. Хэнк фактически продал меня в рабство этому человеку, и когда я попытался бросить курить, Фринг угрожал моей семье. Я не знал, куда обратиться. В конце концов, Хэнк и Фринг поссорились. Из того, что я могу понять, Хэнк всегда настаивал на большей доле бизнеса, которую Фринг категорически отказывался дать ему, и дела обострились. Фринг смог устроить, э-э, я думаю, вы называете это «ударом» по моему зятю, и потерпел неудачу, но Хэнк был серьезно ранен, и я в конечном итоге оплатил его медицинские счета, которые составили немногим более 177 000 долларов. . После выздоровления Хэнк был настроен отомстить, работая с человеком по имени Гектор Саламанка. Он замышлял убить Фринга и сделал это. На самом деле, бомба, которую он использовал, была сделана мной, и он не оставил мне выбора. Я часто думал о самоубийстве, но я трус.Я хотел пойти в полицию, но испугался. Хэнк поднялся по служебной лестнице и стал главой Управления по борьбе с наркотиками в Альбукерке, и примерно в то же время, чтобы держать меня в узде, он забрал у меня детей. 3 месяца он их держал. Моя жена, которая до этого момента не знала о моей преступной деятельности, пришла в ужас, узнав, что я сделал, почему Хэнк забрал наших детей. Мы были напуганы. Я был в аду, я ненавидел себя за то, что навлек на свою семью. Недавно я в очередной раз попыталась бросить, покончить с этим кошмаром, а в ответ он дал мне вот это. Я больше не могу этого терпеть. Я каждый день живу в страхе, что Хэнк убьет меня или, что еще хуже, навредит моей семье. Я... Все, о чем я мог думать, это снять это видео в надежде, что мир наконец-то увидит этого человека таким, какой он есть на самом деле.",1668798439,1668798439,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I love playing timeless, classic games like these, but not when they're locked behind an entirely different launcher that I have to make a new account for just to play. I understand this doesn't just apply to Ubisoft, but it's a little disappointing that there are no achievements, at least for Steam. Achievements are locked behind Uplay, which... I don't know a single person in this world who actively seeks Uplay achievements. I would probably be a lot more inclined to put more hours into this game otherwise. But as of now, it's definitely just a one time experience for me.

Ubisoft aside, this game is pretty fun. You can finish all the missions in two days, which is what I did. It's a very fast-moving game. The pacing is weird, but it's a Ubisoft game made in 2012, so... Certain missions were absolutely tedious, but Vaas is such a captivating antagonist that his few minutes of screen time makes up for some of the more lackluster parts of the experience.

The game gives you an option to buy any unlocked gun in store, but you could just get these weapons for free by activating radio towers anyway. Some of these guns are absurdly overpowered when it comes to upgrades, though. The most powerful sniper rifle in this game is able to support three attachments, so, if you have a Z93 with a silencer, extended mag, and a high power scope, you’re pretty much set in terms of hunting and stealth kills. Foliage in the north island is ample, so there is a lot of room for those things.

The driving in this game is kinda weird. It's very quick and spastic, but some places just will not let you drive uphill. Navigation is otherwise super simplistic. The map will pretty much do all your work for you. It automatically marks locations of animals, outposts, story missions, side missions, etc. For the campaign, you’re given 38 story missions. Everything else – the outposts, the bulletin board, the supply drops – is completely optional. The story is only linear until the very end. If you’re looking to play casually, I would just play on standard difficulty. It's not that hard of a game to beat, especially when most of it is optionally a stealth game.

I'm a bit mad I bought this game at full price a month before the Far Cry sale, but I still enjoyed it. It's a 10/10 experience in my eyes.",1652047527,1668642168,True,15,0,0.677187323570251465,0,True,False,False

The world is not too large neither too small. Getting from point A to point B without fast travel should not take more than 5 minutes by vehicles. Still, the option of fast travel is a boon.
The exploration feels very balanced as the rewards for exploring are useful but not a mandatory grind.
The same can be said for levelling up your skill set and character. (Higher levels are obviously required later on in the endgame)

The plot isn't too rushed neither does it drag on for ages. The side quests are just short enough and varied enough to keep the player engaged. The collectibles are abundant and it may take a while to gather all of them. But for the completionist in me, it is just the right amount to not put me off from the grind.

The character development arcs for a lot of the main characters are really well thought out and the voice acting is spot on for certain characters. The protagonist, Vaas, Sam, Hoyt, Citra, Ernhardt all have a certain charm to them and definitely contribute to making this game memorable.

[hr][/hr]

Of course with the level of detail added to the open world i would expect to find some weird graphics knick knacks here and there. For example, waterfalls don't blend smoothly into the water body below them.  Viewing far away sceneries through your camera shows some random light flashes (don't know if its intentional).
I had a few major bugs too where the game would suddenly crash out of nowhere and i would have to start over from my last autosaved checkpoint or save state. This did get on my nerves too as it happened a handful of times, but i wouldn't hold it against the game itself and more against the developers not providing support for this game anymore. 

[hr][/hr]

All in all, taking all the positive things about the game (of which there is a lot), and the negative things about the game (crashes, extremely minor graphics bugs and some game startup issues) i would give the steam copy of this game a solid [h3]9.3/10[/h3].

You wake up a captive of some pirates on a tropical island. You escape and become Rambo within the first hour of the game. You must rescue your friends from the pirates, who are actually drug lords. It's really not gripping me. It's like it was written by an adolescent boy. The cut-scenes are frequent, long, and un-skippable. 

---{ Gameplay }---
It's unforgiving. Big game will survive point blank shotgun blasts to the face, and can two-shot you. Human enemies have superhuman powers of observation, and their aim is impeccable. Stealth is problematic. Enemies will spot you from a mile away, and will then be able to track you no matter what. On the other hand, you can Quake into enemy encampments, just keep running and gunning, and brute force your way through the task. They were trying for realism, but... in reality a stealth sniper would survive, Rambo wouldn't. The whole experience was immersion-breaking for me. It feels like the AI is cheating, and yet still losing. Cheap deaths just waste one's time. I feel like Ubisoft tried to imitate games like Half-Life (and 2), and F.E.A.R., but just stuffed it all up. The driving isn't as bad as everyone says, it's the roads that suck. Way too many QTEs. 

---{ Graphics }---
They are undeniably pretty for a ten year old game. The lighting and reflection especially are done very well. 

---{ Audio }---
Average. The voice-acting is bad. The music is great. 

---{ Difficulty }---
I don't know. Not so much difficult, just annoying. I get the sense that everything is do-able if you just push through it, but it's a chore. Feels like luck is more important than skill or strategy. 

---{ Grind }---
It's Ubisoft, most of this game is busy-work.

---{ Bugs }---
Oh yes. It keeps wanting to connect to the online servers every time i go to the menu. The map is bugged out. Sometimes i'll accidentally vault over a stationary object and take damage for no reason. Sustaining fall damage for no reason. 

---{ PC Requirements }---
Max settings on an i5-9600K and an RTX 2070 = consistent 60fps.

Far Cry 2 is too niche and weird for most people. Far Cry 3 hits that sweet spot of mass appeal, while being tight, focused, and enjoyable game with interesting story and mechanics. 

The story of the game follows Jason Brody, a rich white kid that picked a bad place for a vacation. He and his friends are now victims of pirates of the Rook Island. Thankfully Jason is holding the power of the protagonist, which gives him the impervious plot armor. With his badass abilities and natural inclanation to kil people, Jason will save his friends and destroy evil pirates. In all serioussness, the story is actually pretty interesting. Jason is really just a kid that got in trouble in the wrong place at the wrong time. His story is the one of transformation and losing his humanity. While he is in a horrible situation, he treats it all like a game, the Rook Island is just a giant amusement park, while very real suffering of the indigenous people of the island, reakyat, are just the set dressing and the outlet for his fantasies. Everything is elevated further with a strong supporting cast. The main star, is, of course, Vaas, the main villain of the first part of the story. His incredible monologues paired with superb acting from Michael Mando make him steal the scene every time he's on screen. 

The graphics hold up in the game pretty well. The move from dusty African savanna back into tropical island was a very solid choice on the developers part. Everything is so fulll of life and color, really sells the idea of tropical paradise. There are trade offs, of course. every character model that is not a named character looks fromw weird to downright bad. Not to mention copypasted NPCs that do nothing and just walk around in the neverending loop. There is also weird texture popping, I'm not really sure what was causing it, but some stuff was just rendering itself in front camera, which wasn't supposed to happen. But overall, the game is stable and free from major bugs.

The gameplay is really simple. Take the blueprint of FC2, remove most of the annoying stuff from it, apply Assassin's Creed formula on top, and in the result we get a very nice open-world shooter. While the shootuots are way less chaotic due to the absense of weapon degradation, we get much more new features here. The towers, that Jason has to climb to unlock more of the visible map, while become pretty much a joke in Ubisoft titles, are a pretty easy way to incentify exploration and give players meaningful rewards if the form of weapon unlocks. Jason starts the game really weak, and first few hours could be a struggle without unlocks, but you get strong really quickly with the hunting and leveling up. Leveling up is represented with the tatau, a religious tattoo of the rakyat people. The upgrades are small increments, but add to make Jason a perful warrior really quickly. the side activities are varied and can be interesting, like the trials of rakyat thwhere you have to get high scores by killing enemies with certain weapons, or very boring, like the supply drops, where you have to make a delivery in time. And like in a true ubisoft fashion, there are five billion of useless collectibles that give you pretty much nothing but bragging rights. Okay, not that many, but they are still pretty useless. 
The shooting is still pretty good, the enemies react to your actions in mostly reasonable ways, the arsenal is big and satisfying, made even better with the so-called ""signature"" weapons, with more attachments and improvements to stats. The big improvement this time is stealth, where you have much more information about the location and abilities of your enemies, as well as how well you hide from them. The new one button takedowns are a big feature that should be utilised in every opportunity, and allow you to kill entire camps unnoticed. The outposts from FC2 are back as well, but this time they don't work like instant cloning stations that dispense enemies every five minutes. Now outposts could be taken for the rakyat warriors and taking the outpotsts will liberate the region from pirates, allowing friendly rakyat warriors to spawn and help you in fights. To unfortunate downsideto this system is that there will be no further interactions with the piretes in the open worldoutside of smissions, since when you liberate every outpost, the pirates will stop spawning and only will be an issue in story missions.

While Far Cry 3 isn't as dark, chaoutic, or hardcore as FC2, it's still a very enjoyable game. The improvements to the gameplay make the game much more approachable and interesting, the story is surpisingly great, and the graphics do hold  up even almost 10 years later. The issues are few and far between, and the only true sin of this game is that it made us notice Ubisoft's copy-pasted bullshit in their open-world titles. While formulaic and mainstream, FC3 is great for what it is.",1666711117,1666711117,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

While Steam Deck is now in stock and shipping, our production, processing, and shipping bandwidth is still finite. If order volume for a specific model of Steam Deck grows higher than our ability to ship it in a timely manner, delivery estimates will lengthen, and at a certain point we’ll flip back into reservation mode until we’re able to catch up.

Why is there a reservation fee?
The main reason for reservations is to ensure an orderly and fair ordering process for customers when Steam Deck inventory becomes available. The additional fee gives us a clearer signal of intent to purchase, which gives us better data to balance supply chain, inventory, and regional distribution.

How does the reservation system work?
When you submit a reservation, you will be put in a queue. Once inventory is available, you will be emailed in the order the reservations were made.

When will I be able to order?
Once you receive your order invitation you will have 72 hours to complete your purchase - if you do not complete your purchase or cancel your reservation, your reservation slot will pass to the next person in the queue.

Can I cancel my reservation?
Yes, you can cancel your reservation on this page. If you cancel within 30 days, you will be refunded to whatever payment method you used. If you cancel after 30 days, your reservation fee will be refunded to your Steam Wallet.

What regions can I reserve Steam Deck from?
Customers in the United States, Canada, European Union, and the United Kingdom can reserve a Steam Deck from this page. Customers in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong can reserve a Steam Deck by visiting Komodo at steamdeck.komodo.jp

How many Steam Decks can I reserve?
One Steam account can have one active Steam Deck reservation at a time.

What happens to my reservation fee if I do not order my Steam Deck in time?
Your reservation fee will be refunded in full. If your refund occurs within 30 days of your initial reservation, you will be refunded to whatever payment method you used. If your refund occurs after 30 days of your initial reservation, you will be refunded to your Steam Wallet.

Are there any restrictions on users that can reserve the Steam Deck?
Your Steam account must be in a valid country.

Do I need a Steam account to use Steam Deck?
The default Steam Deck experience requires a Steam account (it's free!). Games are purchased and downloaded using the Steam Store. That said, Steam Deck is a PC so you can install third party software and operating systems.

What if I'm not able to reserve right now and would like to purchase a Steam Deck in the future?
You may add Steam Deck to your wishlist and we will notify you when it is available for general purchase.

Is the reservation queue regional?
Yes, the reservation queue and expected order availability times are specific to each region.

Can I change which Steam Deck I purchase once I'm able to order?
Once you're able to order, you can only purchase the Steam Deck model that you reserved.

When will I be charged in full for Steam Deck?
Once your reserved Steam Deck is available and you complete your purchase, you will be charged.

Does the reservation fee count towards my Steam Deck purchase price?
Yes.",1665888222,1665888222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly, the game does get significantly weaker in the 2nd half and by then you have already seen the best the game had to offer and Tower climbing gets repetitive. 

The best thing about Far Cry 3 is slowly watching the protagonist turn from a civilised bloke, into a master hunter. Some games make you O.P too quickly, but this game does it just right.

It features a large tropical island full of pirates to fight off and wildlife to hunt, upgradable gear and different tactical skills to progress through the story… Er, once you actually play it.

It’s an easy recommended game, even though it’s a bit old and the franchise has come a long way since it came out. Thus, I’ll go through the worst parts first.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that, although it features a truly open world, the greatest focus of the main game and most of the side content is combat. This is, there is no real “exploration” (most things that you might want to discover can be pinpointed through the purchase of maps), all the obstacle courses seem to be more of a mandatory procedure than something they really wanted to exploit (Ubisoft and their obsession with climbing up towers), there are no interesting characters outside of the main story. 

Collectibles, although easy to acquire, are way too numerous and don’t really serve a greater purpose besides just playing into completionist’s OCD. As I said, they aren’t an actual challenge to get and although a couple unlock recipes or a couple weapons, the game would work basically the same without them.

Also, the first half of the game is AWESOME. The second half is a bit disappointing. In the game there are two islands, each one with their part of the story (although the second part is slightly shorter) and side content. Well, in the second part the side content feels really pointless and tiresome by that point (on early playthroughs I would always collect everything on the first island and just rush through the second one without picking a single collectible), and the story is only saved by one good character, feeling the rest of it, again, pointless.

Last, but not least, be warned that this game is cursed with Ubisoft Connect, to be able to run it. And I’m gonna dedicate a couple of lines to this launcher: If you are gonna force it on people, at least show the store properly (it allegedly hides it if you only have Steam-owned games ???) and don’t allow me to create a password that goes over the character limit the first time the account is created.

Now, with that aside, how well does this game hold nowadays?

Well, I’ve played the game back in the day very little after launch. Then I played it many times afterwards… Then I played through it again recently, completing all the side content, and somehow it still manages to be a lot of fun.

Few games come close to the joy I get whenever I want to play this game again. Far Cry 4, for instance, didn’t manage to even catch my attention for more than a couple hours.

The gameplay in this shooter is just one of the best. The guns feel alright, are distinctive enough in feel and only a few of them seem useless. Yes, you’ll eventually just choose your favorite 4 and blast through the rest of the game with them, but in the meantime, most of them hold on their own.

You have many choices of pistols, assault rifles, LMG and SMG… Besides powerful (and kinda game breaking) sniper rifles. You get your classic RPG, a grenade launcher… And of course a flammenwerfer. And finally, the almighty bow, which can use special arrows to set stuff on fire or just blow it all up, if you are not a fan of its inherent stealthiness. Add to this C4, landmines, molotov and your good old frag grenade… And you get many choices to take it out to the pirates for kidnaping your friends.

Most of them are customizable to slightly change their stats or usage (nothing crazy, but useful things like supresors or larger magazines) and give them a paint coat (still nothing crazy, 6 choices per gun, patterns of one-two colors or a texture coating like wood).

Besides that, you get a set of upgradable abilities that increase your tactical choices. Many related to the melee-instant-kill ability that you have (which include special death abilities like chaining insta kills or using your enemies’ grenades or pistols against them), which greatly rewards stealthy approaches (and I say this despite really disliking stealth in games), plus enhanced healing, speed, resistances…

By themselves, the abilities aren’t that interesting, but given the “open feel” for combat in this game, the many approaches you can take, the different weapons that you’ll be using and your needs in each situation… They manage to give an interesting and noticeable edge as you acquire them.

To this, you can add the crafting system. Lots of gun-related upgrades are obtained by hunting animals, skinning them (some you’ll only face in special hunts) and crafting upgrades: New holsters, greater ammo bags… And the same system is used with plants that you can gather around the island to get special abilities.

These go from almost anecdotal given how contextual they are (longer underwater “breathing”, an aid to find plants despite the fact that they are EVERYWHERE)... To be really useful: Immunity to fire, being able to sense wildlife for hunting… And all the way up to being stupidly overpowered (one hit kills with weapons or straight up IMMORTALITY).

This just adds to the tactical depth that this game achieves with just a few well made mechanics.

And how is this exploited?

Well, besides the main story, which contains many fights to test all these mechanics out, there is a particular part of the side content that usually is people’s favorite: Outposts. These are enemy bases that you have to free by killing everyone posted. Usually they have set patrols that you can exploit to eliminate them silently and prevent them from triggering the alarm and calling reinforcements in. But hell, it’s also just as enjoyable when everything goes wrong and you have to run around the base trying to save yourself. It’s only a shame that this mechanic ties into the enemy’s presence in the surrounding region, meaning that as you complete this the territory becomes more secure (meaning you won’t meet enemies on the road). Still, a worthy and really nice mechanic.

Besides that you have the aforementioned hunt of wildlife for crafting materials, as a secondary mission or just for the kick of it, plus hunting enemy’s officials. Also some special “arena” missions where you face many enemies at once while being restricted to a special rule: Being able to use only grenades, or only an RPG, or even being able to only run them over.

Besides these combat-focused activities, you have some others like poker, racing or knife throwing. These unfortunately don’t seem that interesting to me, that’s why I say that most of this game is focused on combat. This includes secondary missions, which strangely almost never exploit combat and are focused on fetching quests (guess it’s an attempt to bring variety but)... Although, a couple of them are interesting and may have a somewhat funny plot twist.

Finally, I would like to talk about the story. Of course, the best part of it is whatever focuses on FC3’s poster boy: Vaas Montenegro. It’s always a show when he’s around (you will notices this literally the first 5 minutes of game) and makes up for an interesting, intimidating and hateable antagonist, whose purpose is questioned to go beyond what is directly shown (for me the character works even without these “higher purposes” people talk about, so I’m reluctant to give Ubisoft more credit than they deserve). Still, although I agree that it’s a really good character, it feels like it overshadows other characters that have their own thing going on. There are many characters (all but one in the first half of the game) that are worthwhile meeting and many tense and action packed situations in the game. 

If you are looking for a short FPS experience which doesn’t have a right way to be played, and as long as you aren’t looking for an open world with anything to do besides combat, this game is for you. Really fair price on sales, it’s a great bridge between classic and modern FPS",1665173292,1665568508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes. Many times. Too many times.

Considering how many people quote this, I expected Vaas to be some legendary figure. Instead, I ended up rushing through the story because of how bored with the game I was, and I still felt that Vaas barely had any presence.

From what I heard about the story, I also expected it to be way smarter than it actually turned out to be. Instead, Jason just does a complete 180 with his personality at some point, and the game repeatedly REALLY wants you to know. Super uninteresting.

The open world is also insulting. I always make it a point to never use fast-travel in open-world games if fast-traveling is just done directly from the map screen, but Far Cry 3 broke me. You go from outpost to outpost and the only thing between is some road and grass. This game has only reinforced my prejudices about how most open-world games are just a waste of time.

This is a game that made me so bored that I said to myself: ""There are so many other things I could do that would be more beneficial than playing Far Cry 3.""",1665233707,1665233707,False,1,0,0.439999997615814209,0,True,False,False

I AM UPSET THAT NOW the game hangs at startup and about every other time I go into the SAVE or OPTIONS menus to tell me that the servers are not available and I have to wait for the amount of time it spends searching for the servers (2-5 seconds just sitting waiting - quite often) just to tell me that the game cannot communicate with the servers or the servers are off line.

REALLY?  At this point the game should be free for the lack of support and lack of care given to anyone foolish enough to legally buy it now.  What a great example of a company that doesn't care at all about its customers.

I will NEVER pay full price for an UBI-SOFT game again.  It will have to be deeply discounted or Humble Bundle or GOG for me to buy an UBI game.  What a crappy company. 

EVERY SINGLE TIME - EVERY TIME I PLAY FAR CRY 3 I HAVE TO SIGN IN!!! Click TRUSTED MACHINE? Doesn't matter. Choose to stay signed in - Doesn't matter. NO MATTER WHAT I DO, I HAVE TO SIGN IN EVERY TIME I PLAY AGAIN!

Does a bug cause a crash?  Sign back in!  Insane!!!!

I'm having fun with this game, but the UBI-SOFT garbage that requires me to log into my account is annoying which wouldn't be enough to NOT RECOMMEND it - however the removal of the DLC and my having to jump through hoops to try and get it with some sort of keygen and I cannot tell that it even worked, that's super crappy.

And apparently if you don't get it before Sep 22 2022 (which I am fast running out of time and so far I haven't been able to see if I activated the extra DLC or not - which probably means NOT) is infuriating to know that I am basically without that stuff which is ALREADY IN THE GAME and I cannot access it because they are shutting down the servers that activate stuff or something I don't really understand and didn't want to just to come play a cool game.

Great game, ruined by greedy people who couldn't be content to sit back and take easy money from something created decades ago - no, they have to screw us now too.  Infinitely frustrating. I LOVE CAPITALISM - seriously. But GREED sucks. And this is GREED.

The only reason you aren't seeing ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" in the review area is because of the company behind the game, Ubisoft.

Ubisoft, while doing amazingly with the actual content of this game, has done a few key things externally that impact the experience. For one, you need to install and use UPlay to play this game. Additionally, achievements are only available through UPlay, not through Steam. And probably my biggest issue at this time is that I felt I had to rush through my experience of the game. This is because on September 1st, 2022, Ubisoft will be disabling all DLC and Co-op services for this game, even if you bought them. If you want to experience this game with the DLC, you already have to purchase the CD key from a third-party site just to play it, and now they're deleting it entirely. If you want to get 100% achievements good luck, as within a few months of me writing this it will be impossible.

Apart from all of the bullshit Ubisoft is pulling, the game itself is awesome. Go play it now, while you have the chance to experience all of it.",1658063899,1664537257,True,6,0,0.595480799674987793,0,True,False,False

You can't give people a month to activate the DLC they already purchased before taking it away forever. This is hardly a solution. Validate the dlc yourself, you can see who bought it. I will also not be satisfied until everyone can get the DLC legit, and won't have to resort to pirated versions of the game to get the definitive experience. Whether they have to buy it, or if you update the base game to automatically include all the DLC. If you take that route, make sure it still counts as DLC and is listed as such on steam and/or in game, so people can verify they got the DLC.

They never even clarify what ""activating it"" means. What does this mean? Are you referring to redeeming any codes I might have? Do you mean, download the game AND dlc? Start the game? Make sure that it is listed in your DLC section under properties in your library? What do you mean by ""activating"" it? Even being upper-moderate tech savvy I have no definitive conclusion what you mean by this, only guesses. You don't tell me exactly what to do to ""activate it,"" even though that is an incredibly commonplace practice. You don't provide pictures and a guide, let alone a brief description of the process.
It boggles my mind how you are legally able to do this, but also how you can give such absolutely useless instructions to those who want to keep what they have already purchased. 

As for the Ubisoft connect rewards, put them into the base game. Simply update the game to automatically include them. No connection required, you can then leave the game forever, unless you cause another issue of course. If you're going to abandon your products, do it right.

220240,122924416,76561198148676717,0,541,133,0,124,1664299641,"For me this is the best Far Cry game. Kind of a master piece. Though Far Cry 2 is also a masterpiece, this game took the franchise to the next level. Now we have a living breathing world with animals, both human and otherwise. Kill animals and use their parts to upgrade your gear. You can even kill sharks. Explore a lush world. Use tons of weapons and vehicles to take over a wide variety of enemy targets. Find treasures and collectibles. Pick from a skill tree that allows you to specialize in range, melee, or stealth playing styles. All of these are executed to perfectly. When this game came out it looked stunningly good. Today it still looks decent.

But like all things south of heaven, this game has flaws. For many one of the highlights of the game was the main villain. I found him a joke, like one of those melodramatic campy Batman villains. Luckily I easily avoided him by not doing much of the main quest. 

Unfortunately the main quest proved to be a problem as well. This game touts freedom of choice but violates this expressed ideal by making you do some of the quests in an exact way. One quest stopped my progress dead by demanding I follow a specific sequence of steps exactly as the developers wanted. When I failed, I had to replay that 5 minutes all over again. Which made the game a Ground Hogs Day simulator, where I played the same 5 minutes over a dozen times. If the game wasn't using an auto-save or save-point feature, this tedium could have been avoided. For me this was almost a game breaker. 

For those of us playing on Steam, there is the added problem of Ubisoft. For some reason the developers insist that we log into their launcher. The console did this too, but it did it less evasively. This feature is unavoidable if you plan on playing any Far Cry games. So deal with it or don't buy the game.

The landscape doesn't repeat and you can tell that every inch of the island had a lot of thought put into it.

Maybe if there was some more opportunities for air travel, it wouldn't be such a big deal. But, on the other hand, the vehicles you use drive fast enough on the road so that it becomes a small matter after all. I'm also not crazy about the missions where you have to climb not one, but eighteen, creaking, dilapidated radio towers to reactivate them. They're way too difficult.

[b]Comment:[/b]
After a breakthrough first game and a unevenly received second game Ubisoft struck gold with the third title. It had just the right amount of fun with bits from the previous games and good new additions. Game is most fun when it does not force you into stealth or using a specific weapon. When you have freedom to do stuff how you like it is immense fun. Possibly the strongest part of the game. Liberating camps highlights this the most. Don't get me wrong, stealth parts and weapon challenges are good too but getting to choose how you approach is where FC3 shines. Campaign limits you in this regard as it forces you into scenarios, with the late missions just rushing you with endless enemy soldiers. I found enjoyment here too (despite the wild voice acting for Jason) with Vaas of course being the best part of it by a lot. All of this is done with a big variety of weapons that sound and behave great. Further adding their usefulness by modifying them. To bolster the playtime they added TONS of collectibles - relics, letters and loot chests. Normally it's tedious but finding ways to get to some is an interesting challenge. Although the amount of loot chests is a bit much. There are also other parts to love (like crafting) or hate (like a damn tiger ambushing you for the fifth time). Now for the final point - this game is great and you should try it. But giving money to Ubisoft, when they are removing access to the full experience (DLC, uPlay unlocks, multiplayer), feels wrong. Twelve years ago people were making concerns this might happen and Ubi said it wouldn't and yet come 10/2022 it is happening. Play it if you have it already, but I cannot recommend supporting this publisher with your money...

[b]P.S.:[/b] [strike]There are some DLCs available for this game that are not part of the standard installation. [u]Deluxe Edition DLCs:[/u] The Lost Expedition (2 missions), The Monkey Business Pack (4 missions), The Warrior Pack (dagger), The Predator Pack (sniper rifle), artwork & soundtrack; [u]High Tides DLC Pack[/u] 2 coop maps & 4 new skins (made part of standard edition later); [u]uPlay unlockable DLCs:[/u] Original Track - Far Cry 3 (soundtrack), Exclusive Assignment (mission), Revolving gift (revolver), Tattoo Pack (multiplayer skins).[/strike] [u]You have to go to Options and then Downloadable Content and type in the key.

I do not think I progressed to fast, nor to slow, and I never lost interest. I also really enjoyed the gameplay. The stealth is what you would expect from a Far Cry game. Sneaking up behind enemies and stabbing them through the chest with a machete. Also hunting for animal skins to upgrade for example the amount of healing you can carry. The gunplay I found to be decent. The variation of guns was good, but i will say many of the guns lacked recoil, and felt very light. I would have liked a bit more weightiness to the guns. There is some gun customization, like different scopes and mags, but it could have been a bit more fleshed out. The soundtrack is an absolute masterpiece.

When I originally played it on 360 back in 2013 It was in my top 3 of games even. The world felt massive and there was so much to do (still is, just seems repetitive now that I've matured/ played other open world games). Playing it now, I've realized how clunky things can be, mainly the shooting aspect. I'm playing on the hardest setting and it seems like there's no difference between an appendage, body or headshot. I just unloaded a pistol magazine on a Heavy Enemy and he didn't die, He shot me 3 times and I ate dirt. I understand he was a heavy but at minimum 3 of my 8 bullets hit him square in the head. The other main issue is sensitivity, its entirely too high (no aim down sight sensitivity option) I'm playing with it turned ALL the way down and still had to lower the DPI on my mouse because the difference between looking around and ADS is zero. ADS even feels faster than normal looking around somehow (maybe because you're in a more crucial spot). Still a fun game overall and like I stated, Best story of a FC to date IMO.

Far Cry 3 is a ubisoft game, now when it comes to ubisoft games, there are moments where you go ""woah, this is the worst game ever"" to ""woah, he's a dinosaur now""  Particularly in this game, ubisoft really wanted you to feel like you're working at ubisoft. Repetitive side quests, dinosaur graphics, a story that rarely makes you feel that you're playing a character. I mean ubisoft really hit it out of the park with Close Happy 3. The mechanics of Guy Cry 3 is to that of a ubisoft type game, You can be spider-man, Joe biden, Donald Trump, and pretty much be anyone in this game. I once heard a quote from Abe Lincoln.

[b]Performance:[/b] - 50-60 FPS on average and roughly under 10 second load times

[b]Technical Condition:[/b] - One big game launch error that was an easy fix (Somewhat common with Ubisoft games) and no other real issues

[b]Gameplay:[/b] - Fresh for it's time but now in 2022 is a very cliche and overdone formula

[b]Story:[/b] - One of if not Ubisoft's best story with a charismatic and terrifying side villain and complex themes of trauma making the player question our own characters actions

        [td][i]Far Cry 3's graphics and look for the time was incredibly nice to look at. However today it looks a little bit dated and the raised saturation to me can somewhat look a little much. Thankfully though despite its dated look, it's still an amazing game to look at.[/i][/td]

        [td][i][b]9 / 10[/b][/i][/td]
        [td][i]Throughout my experience with Far Cry 3 so far, I've had mostly smooth and tolerable framerates averaging roughly 50-60 FPS. This allows the game to run very smoothly and not make for any performance frustrations. (Graphics settings can be turned down in the settings menu). Load times are also quite fast and last usually under 10 seconds.[/i][/td]

        [td][i]Throughout my time with Ubisoft's games. I've had a lot of run-ins with MAJOR technical issues, some of which can brick your game. Far Cry 3 however has had no such occurrences, and even though I had one biggish issue launching the game, it was fixed with a simple Google search. Gameplay wise I have had no real game breaking experiences.[/i][/td]

        [td][b][i]7 / 10[/i][/b][/td]
        [td][i]For it's time, Far Cry 3's gameplay was an incredibly fresh and pioneering change for open world games in 2012. However for those familiar with its design.

- Collectibles
- Perk System / Level Up System
- Side Missions
- Fast Travel
- Outpost Liberation
- Basic Crafting and Foraging

It may feel like a non-unique experience as this was made during this gameplay formulas infancy. Thankfully though even after 100% completion, the player can still fight off pirates and reset all outposts littering pirates all over the games 2 islands again giving an incentive to use weapons and have fun with its experimental type gameplay.[/i][/td]

        [td][i][b]Story[/b][/i][/td]
        [td][i][b]9 / 10[/b][/i][/td]
        [td][i]Far Cry 3 holds one of if not the best Ubisoft game story to date. The game's secondary antagonist Vaas is an incredibly terrifying yet tragic and charismatic character who's presence always brings tension to whatever scene he's in. On the other hand, the main character Jason who we follow throughout the game slowly descends into the madness of the jungle and becomes more animalistic and psychologically scarred as the game goes on. 

The story also deals with the complex theme of trauma in a very believable and scarily true way making us question whether our main character is no better than the islands mostly savage inhabitants. There are also 2 different endings which can be obtained in the game.[/i][/td]

It is an action flick in video game form, meant to appeal to your average dudebro gamer while actually retaining a semblance of quality, y'know, back when video games were meant to be fun?

The gameplay is solid, but somewhat repetitive, especially if you're going for 100% upgrades or progression as a whole, (Rest your soul, you're in for tedium galore in that front) but it's still good overall. There's not much to say about it besides simplified open world FPS shenanigans with stealth because why not.

The storytelling, however, is simultaneously impactful and stilted, falling to the wayside at times for the sake of the gameplay being able to hold up, and the plotline to be cohesive enough for things to actually happen, If it sounds like a strange thing to say, it's only because of the fact that there are times where the cinematics will lampshade impossible situations away via misdirection through major story beats. If you play the game, you'll know what I mean when you see it.
There's also a sex scene for some reason.

Like Assassin's Creed there are plenty of sidequests and adventures to be had on the island in addition to the main storyline.  Not quite as much fun as AC, though as they are mostly finding chests or relics, doing some stupidax job for a local islander, or running medicine over an insane terrain on a vehicle with poor handling.  This last one is made fun by being able to kill the doctor to whom you are delivering the medicine (not in the game, I just made that adventure up).  The stealth hunts are pretty good and I enjoyed both liberating outposts and hunting down ne'erdowells.  Hunting animals is meh.  As for the main story line it is both unbelievable and annoying.  The protagonist is a whiny little cuss with whiny little teenage friends so you almost want to spoiler them all in the spoiler, but of course if you do then spoiler even though you get to spoiler with the skanky heroin addict island queen.  The gameplay was generally fun, but the betatesters could have done more to fix some of the glitches; doorways difficult to enter, jumps and climbs hard to stick, enemies attacking you from inside a rock?  These made the gameplay a little on the annoying/tedious side.  Overall, it was an amusing little slaughter fest that pitted a scrawny teenage wimp against hardened mercenaries, tigers, and annoying jump scareagators, but I could take it or leave it.  Not much on the replay value & without any achievements it hardly seemed worth it to complete the quests after I toasted off the main storyline and watched el skankeroona get a knife in the spoiler.

This has been happening for years now apparently (at least 2015) and there is nothing that can fix it other than re-launching, replay the same segments and hope that it doesn't crash this time or before next autosave (and yes, I've tried all known fixes for this without any luck).

Read on and I'll help you understand why.

Okay. Let's do this. You don't know until the combat starts - but your character actually has X-Ray vision!
Yes... Really...

Once you shoot an enemy all his movements and location are forever highlighted to you without any explanation as to why. Meaning that if the enemy runs away to hide behind a brick wall - who cares! You can still clearly see him highlighted anyway.

The game has no immersion what so ever -  Allow me another example to explain it to you:

It's a Sandbox Game that isn't a Sandbox Game at all.
This is not Skyrim with guns.

The game presents a huge island to explore. That is, unless you have a mission to do.
If your character leaves the mission area the game will force you to teleport you back to the start of the mission area. How immersive.

This and many other annoyances leaves the player feeling like the game is constantly slapping you on the wrist and saying ""Bad player. Play how we say!!""

The game is way too easy and running in shooting has almost no downsides whatsoever as landing a head shot rewards just as much XP as a stealth kill, despite requiring less set up and less skill. 

This game treats the player as an idiot in many different ways. As far as I can tell after a few hours, so far it's impossible to fail a mission.

Not skilled enough to stealth into a camp? - Who cares, just carry on!
You can't fail the missions!! This game treats the player like an idiot.

All the bad guys use the AK47, which means after you pick one up you're never worrying about ammo ever again. Non of the guns seem to have any recoil mechanics.

The game looks very impressive - but a quarter of the screen is taken up by a Mini Map you can never toggle off and if you're on a mission you better believe the missions paragraph long description takes up the left hand side of your HUD too.

Farcry 3 cleverly tricks the player by using what I can only describe as a 'fake distance'. 
Meaning although you can clearly see mountains and such in the background the actual local area visible is only ever quite limited but disguised in quite a clever way, even on Ultra graphics settings.

As a console port the FOV is a decent 110, along with Direct X11 and Ultra graphic settings do make the game look very nice. However in the middle of a thick jungle at night time without lamps or fire  it isn't actually dark.

Aside from some good visuals and good characters (the main bad guy is actually really decent and interesting) the game is weak in so many areas. I'm glad i picked it up for £3.75 last Christmas.
I would have been devastated to pay full price for this effort.

Avoid it and play one of the much better shooters out there -  unless you're after an easy no brainer FPS, to hold your hand as you play.",1416264481,1661932849,False,2,0,0.518248140811920166,2,True,False,False

Schöne Inseln, lustige und abwechslungsreiche Missionen. Sam. :D
Gute Story und Umsetzung.

Negativ: 
-Minimap lässt sich leider nicht abschalten (habe das Ding einfach auf dem Monitor überklebt) und die Piraten laufen alle in roten Klamotten rum - quasi wandelnde Zielscheiben, was öfters die Spannung raus nimmt.
-Heavy Gunner - einfach nervige RPG-Einheiten, die zwar eine gewisse Hürde bieten, aber naja... Geschmackssache.
-Die Tierwelt ist teils etwas überaggressiv, bzw. eigenartig robust. Wenn Horden von Kasuaren wie Raptoren über einen herfallen, weil man einfach im Gebüsch hockt, dann ist das schon etwas lästig. :D


Alles in Allem hat das Spiel echt Spaß gemacht und wenn man Lust hat, kann man sich auch nach der Story noch gut die Zeit damit vertreiben. Die Rollenspielelemente (""Crafting"", etc.) sind eher gering gehalten, wodurch man sich nicht unnötig damit quälen muss, Jagen, Angriffe, etc. aber einen Sinn bekommen. Die Außenposten werden nicht einfach neu besetzt, wenn man zwei Meter weiter läuft, sondern können erobert werden, wodurch das ganze einen Vorteil gegenüber dem zweiten Teil hat und die Missionen sind wieder etwas ausgefeilter, was mehr an den ersten Teil erinnert.

Angenehm dosiertes Open-World-Feeling mit Fokus auf die Gefechte.

The beginning is awesome.
You're being chased in the jungle and somehow escape alone without guns.

[u]I thought it's the game I always wanted:[/u]
Let's take this rusty gun with one bullet and try to somehow make it. Hardcore style!

[u]Reality:[/u]
You find a whole village full of friendlies who have enough guns (and people) to start a war and you are supposed to single-handedly save the island. What?
The first thing they want you to do is to go pick some flowers, that would be the most important thing to do right now.

Good thing is that you don't even need to farm for all the silly upgrades cause the game is really easy (which is also a bad thing), it might be better not to get them for a bit of a challenge.

Sneaking and the machete feel overpowered, you can clear out whole camps without being spotted.
The dude is facing you with a gun, you press a button and an animation begins where you slaughter the defenseless dude by charging at him.
In other games you have to sneak from behind, here you can always instakill.
And that could be cool if he at least gets a shot at you wounding you, depending on how long the delay was, so on low health it would be risky.

Hardest difficulty is not that hard at all.
Many (cool) skills seem like you probably never going to get a chance to use them cause they're very situation based.

Biggest minus point: Uplay required.

This game is great but after 80 hours on it (outside of Steam), I must say it's boring and there's nothing really to do anymore except if you start a new game from scratch.
I would give it a 8/10 but the multiplayer/coop is and always was buggy, it's almost impossible to join servers some times and now i think the multiplayer is dead so don't bother buying it for the multiplayer.

It is fun to come back after a while to play a new game from scratch even after having beaten the game a couple of times.
I have everything unlocked in Uplay, but I still come back for more some times, It's a fun game, really, but it needs more things to do, once you're done with the crafting, there's nothing to do anymore, you should always have something to with the crafting stuff.

Because of its problems it always had, I'll give it a 7/10.
If it would have a bit more content, a (better) working co-op/multiplayer (plus AI/bots), I'd give it 8/10.


Edit 2022: As of now, Ubisoft wants to go full illegal, worthless and a***ole.
They will remove the online element and the access to the DLCs, removing online is one thing but the access to the DLCs we paid for? That's illegal, no matter what an EULA says, it cannot go above the laws, and for this, Ubisoft should go bankrupt and to never be seen again, it's nothing new though, Ubisoft has been a cancer for a long time now so i doubt that anything will happen to them even though they are evil and worthless but that's just how it is, in a good World where common sense and goodwill would exist, Ubisoft wouldn't.
Simply do not pay for their stuff, it's not even worth for free at this point.
If Ubisoft does such thing, it will passes, but they will go after you if you get their stuff for free, that's a company that you should simply not encourage at all, let them die.

The game is pretty good, but Ubisoft evidently does not care about players being able to access   and play their older games. They want you to spend money under the illusion that you'll be able to play. No matter your rig, you can expect choppy, unimpressive performance and lots of stuttering and frame drops. This game should run easily at ultra settings given its age and mediocre appearance, but poor optimization makes this impossible. There are a number of potential solutions to Ubisoft's optimization failures available online with varying impacts on performance, but none of them bring this game remotely close to the performance that one should expect from this decade old title.
Attempting to get this game to a playable state is accompanied by additional headaches in the form of an intrusive and buggy Uplay (that is required to run any Ubisoft game). Currently I'm stuck in a loop where, whenever I want to start the game, I get a message that they're unable to verify my ownership of the game product. The solution to this is to sign out, and then sign back into Uplay. Logging back in requires a mandatory two-step verification to my email. To start the game from here, I have to, for a third time, enter my password to play the game I already paid for, from 2012, that struggles to achieve even choppy inconsistent 40 fps on hardware that plays Witcher 3 at 60fps on high. It's almost like a slap in the face.
The most depressing aspect of Ubisoft's negligence is that it is most likely intentional, so that they can keep the door open for any potential remakes or remasters of this game in the future. This is supported by the fact that Ubi will be removing many of these ""potentially remaster worthy"" titles off of the storefront soon. I can't imagine that sending out a small update improving compatibility would be difficult, but Ubi would rather chase short-term profits on their latest titles (which are also not great. FC6 is full of bullet sponges, disgustingly bad writing, and bad game design decisions that could have only come from the mind of an out-of-touch, lead-paint-addled moron - which seems like it would be an accurate descriptor for all of  Ubisoft's current writing staff). 
Ubi would be able to garner a lot of public goodwill and appreciation if they devoted a team to maintaining playability/optimization for their older games and keeping them available on the storefront, but that will never happen. All I can hope for is that a natural disaster will hit every Ubisoft location and destroy all their servers in some kind of divine act of justice.

Despite that, Far Cry 3 is one of the most unpleasant gaming experiences I've ever seen through to the end. 

The game itself is mediocre, adding stealth mechanics which actually reduce the potential for stealth relative to Far Cry 2, while constantly forcing you into big gunfights near the end despite the subpar and unsatisfying gunplay. The UI is incredibly cluttered and drops all of the good ideas from Far Cry 2, which had a barebones HUD and gave you a physical item to use as your in-game map to increase immersion. In contrast to Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 constantly distracts you with pop-ups and alerts, has an unpleasantly cluttered menu, and arbitrarily locks down various weapons and abilities, all of which make the experience just a little bit less pleasant. I had to download a mod just to make the pop-ups tolerable. The radio towers are at best annoying to climb, and at worst a nightmare as the game triggers jump animations that send you right off the side. Overall, a mediocre game.

The story, on the other hand, isn't mediocre: it's horrible. Major spoilers follow, obviously.

Jason Brody is the worst protagonist I've ever had to embody in a video game. His voice actor is BAD. Everything he says sounds childish. He goes from being (understandably) terrified to trying to sound threatening in about an hour of gameplay, and it is hilarious how bad at it he is. Brody's character just sucks, and so do those of all of his friends. They're all rich Californians with little to no personality. No one has any good motivations for their actions whatsoever. Brody starts out trying to save his friends, and quickly """"goes native"""" and becomes violent and bent on vengeance. It appears to take no push whatsoever do this to him. He starts going crazy and rejecting his friends within a few days of being on the island, presumably because he wants to fuck Citra just that badly.

Speaking of """"going native,"""" holy shit this game is racist. Brody is a typical white savior archetype who is instantly hailed as the hero of the Rakyat despite having arrived on the island 30 minutes ago. He is regularly held up as the only hope of the Rakyat, who have been fighting a guerrilla war without his help for years at this point. There is no explanation given for why the Rakyat cannot retake the utterly unguarded radio towers or the sparsely defended northern outposts. Despite the natives technically being /your/ faction in the game, there are no major native characters except for Citra and Vaas, both of whom are insane villains. Most of the native women npcs are prostitutes, and you often find them dead and littered around the island, which would be fine in this setting if there were some native women npcs who were anything else, but there aren't. In fact, none of the Rakyat ever seem to do anything useful without Jason Brody around. The game is also filled with lines saying the jungle makes you violent and crazy, and this type of violence is just inherent to the setting, despite the fact that all of the Rakyat live here and they seem just fine when they're not fighting off pirates. They use hallucinogenic drugs which give you literal visions of the future, and you get magic tattoos which make you a member of the tribe despite the fact that you never actually have to talk to any of its members. And I almost forgot to mention the character of Dennis the Magical Negro, who gives you your tattoo and appears to induct you into the Rakyat at the beginning of the game. He apparently went through the same process as you and plays the role of a stereotypical Magical Negro until the game discards him.

Citra, again, one of only two named natives in the main story, is a stereotype to her core with little to no depth. An ""indian princess""-style temptress who encourages Jason to help the Rakyat with her wiles, the entirety of her personality is ""I'm hot and I want to fuck you, the player."" She pretends to fall in love with you after a grand total of two interactions, which Jason buys completely. Her motivations are never explained. Her leadership of the Rakyat? Never explained. 

Beyond the racism and bad voice acting, the story has more holes than swiss cheese. There is a magic Chinese knife which, for some reason, inserts itself into the story for a grand total of 3 pointless and nonsensical fetch quests, and is not seen again until the end. How did Vaas's men get into the ancient ruins you needed a magical compass to find? Why did Buck need your help getting any of the compass pieces when he already knew where the knife was? What was the point of Buck's character? He comes in for two hours of play time to lead you to this knife, he makes cryptic comments at each point, the reason he wants the knife or knows what it is is never given, and then you kill him in one of the hallucination knife fights reserved for major bosses like Vaas and Hoyt. In fact, no one ever explains why they want the knife. They never even explain how they know it exists. All of a sudden, a third of the way through game, everyone and their mother is searching for the knife and then it just ceases to be relevant at all. It appears to be sacred to the Rakyat somehow, judging by its usage in rituals once Citra gets it, which makes no sense, since the knife is repeatedly stated to be a not-that-old Chinese artifact, even by Citra!

Last but certainly not least, Vaas. There is nothing more disappointing in this game than Vaas. Vaas is the only character in this game with a good voice actor. He was interesting because he seemed to be a non-native (he turned out to be a native), because he might have been a good foil for Brody (this was never explored), because he didn't seem motivated by drugs and money like the pirates he worked with (but it turned out he was), and because he was clever and outsmarted you repeatedly (though the ""Surprise, Vaas is Behind You!"" trick did get old. Jason needs to learn to check his corners). His compound looked fantastic on the inside (though you only see that style once), and generally Vaas had the potential to be a good villain. Except you kill him, halfway through the game, and he is replaced by his incredibly boring boss, Hoyt. He is also, again, the only other named native in the main story. His backstory? Handwaved away in one line.
