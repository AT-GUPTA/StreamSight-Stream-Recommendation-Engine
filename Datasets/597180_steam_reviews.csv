In the menu, there is weird (couple seconds) lag when choosing a new option, as if it preloads the entire thing in the background, badly programmed. 

Unit symbols are very small and hard to distinguish from all the background clutter. So in war (episode5 of the scripted tutorials) it's hard to know which of you units have already attacked and which havent, for example). By simply cycling through them (idles, i.e. with actions left) all, this isn't a big problem, but I dont like it.

Now that I've finished the tutorial, I don't know which game is the 'real' game, or which is suited for a bloody beginner like myself.
Also, given the tutorial is far beyond 2 hours, I reckon they wouldnt allow a refund at this point, so be aware of that.

A reluctant recommend, since theres no bad writing, spelling or grammar mistakes, bugs, etc. so far. Not much fun either, but maybe that comes with the actual game freedom, I hope.

But the thing that really pulls me away from loving this game is the combat system.  It might be the worst combat in any 4X/ Civ-like game I have ever played.  It actually makes Victoria 3's combat seem reasonably passable.  

All they needed to do was allow players to stack units into actual armies (similar to Civ 4 or Humankind or Age of Wonders, etc). Then have characters command ARMIES instead of just single units.  That way you are spending your orders moving entire stacks of units instead of having to micromanage hordes of little units all over the damned place.  It's just... tedious... and also it doesn't make sense because the scale of everything just seems so off.  Slingers throw rocks over the Acropolis and hit people on a hill on the other side.

I do recommend Old World but there are a couple of things which I find annoying but first I'll say what works brilliantly - Orders, Events, how great the game looks, the ability to buy and sell goods.

It is extremely frustrating to play an otherwise great game and have a major part be almost incomprehensible unless you're prepared to spent hundreds of hours playing and studying the game. I really hope that if there is ever an Old World 2 that Religion is simplified but if the Civ franchise is anything to go by, it'll all get even more complicated at the expense of enjoyable gameplay but I live in hope. My second gripe is that I think that each turn should be a quarter of a year. Not only would this feel more realistic - sending a message to ancient Babylon to ancient Memphis and receiving a reply would have take about three months not a year, moving an army from one side of you empire to the other would have take 6-9 months not 3-4 years, basic training of a military unit, even today, take about a year, not 4 or 5 years - it would also allow for seasonal Events which would be add to one of the great features of this game.

Old world is a mix of games from the 4x genre and games like Crusader Kings: There is a slight role play element, but it is mostly 4x as far as unit control, tech tree, game board etc are concerned. Rather than spanning through whole of human history like Civilization, you lead your nation through antiquity. You role play as the leader of your nation and get events every now and then, and these events shape your nation and your play style going forward. 

I especially like the ""ambitions"" mechanic. These are missions/ambitions that your character gets, and wants to fulfill (for example capture an enemy capital). Fulfill enough of these ambitions and you win the game! Ambition victory is not the only way to win the game, as there are many ""categories"" of win. 

Oh, and talking of things I especially like: the undo button! If you mis-click or something you can undo an action! 

The only real negative thing I can mention is that the AI is very unit-spammy. Meaning that in war they have what feels like endless amounts of units to throw at you. Luckily they are kinda dumb so with even a little strategy you can take these out rather quickly. Invest in unit tech and at least on mid-tier difficulty this is not really a problem. For some reason the AI also spreads out their units on the map in peace, but they are not generally a problem.

The game is polished, and I've encountered only maybe two or three bugs with fog of war and a handful of crashes to the desktop in my nearly 300 hours of game play at the time of writing this review. 

If you feel burnt out on Civilization (or even grand strategy games) I recommend you check Old World out.

I can see what they were trying to do. From one of the designers of Civilization, the gold standard of turn based 4x games, Old World attempts to hone in on a specific period of time and create a more story driven experience that amounts to more meaningful gameplay than Civ’s infamous “rush to gunpowder” meta. But ultimately it creates something that’s extremely micromanagement heavy, slow moving, overcomplicated choice laden, and not original enough to make all that worth it. 

The game attempts to streamline what I call the “on map play.” Your workers don’t die after 3 builds like in civ 6. You can automate them if you don’t want to manage 18 builders when you have 9 cities. You don’t need to have ships to carry units across the water. City cites take the guesswork out of city placement and create straightforward areas of importance in the world. And all that is well and good. I like simplified on map play. Age of Wonders 3 and Total War are great examples of 4x games that have relatively simple on map play. But this game takes all that and throws it out the window with a overabundance amount of decision making and micromanagement. 

Without writing an essay on the subject, suffice to say that there is a TON of little decisions to make when playing. What to build on the map, managing cities, managing religion, keeping important people happy, sending important people on missions, balancing resources, a myriad of story decision pop ups, keeping the families happy, technology, etc etc. It all VERY micromanage heavy. If youre playing the game and controlling things to the fullest, like managing every builder, utilizing every important character, moving every scout and military unit, making every story decision, I can see there being almost 50 actions per turn in the mid-late game. I found that to be too much. I want things to move faster. I wanted to fight the next battle, settle the next city, pass the year so I could get the new technology. I felt bogged down and guilty on turns that I wasn't utilizing everything. 

But I get the appeal of micromanagement games done right. I LIKE micromanagement heavy games is the game is original or novel enough conceptually to make it worth it. I really enjoyed Stellaris for example, because if offered micromanaging gameplay that is so unique from other 4x games. Old World is, I’m almost sad to say this, another ancient world 4x games and really didn’t capture my attention enough to make dealing with it all worth it.

Old World is not a bad game. Its just not for me and I found myself pushing through it to make it worth my previously invested time. I’ll keep my eye on it and try and keep playing, but I would not be surprised if I fire up other 4x games instead.",1707251667,1707690263,False,24,0,0.718776464462280273,0,True,False,False

I started my first game and stopped after 35 turns not understanding one thing I did right or wrong. Then I played second and a third and two more games after that where I stopped each time because I could never figure out what I did wrong.
I finally felt I knew enough about the mechanics to play a whole game. During that final game I just realised that I was not having fun. The 10 ish hours I spent learning the game was me trying to figure what the hell the game wanted me to do. When I stop focusing on learning the game and just trying to have fun is when I realised I was not having fun with it.
The pros:
- The AI is one of the best (if not the best) I have ever seen. The AI makes very city planning and war strategy decisions. Top notch.
- The order system (actions) is really great. You have to choose what to prioritise or not each year;
- The game settings let's you choose how YOU want to play the game;
- Exploring the map and harvesting resources at the beginning of the game is fun and exciting.

The cons:
(Short version)
Frustrating UI
Extremely steep learning curve
Characters (dynasties/family/diplomacy),  city management and war do not interact well enough
There is just too much stuff going on...

(Long version)
The character system is not well meshed. There are so many characters to interact with and the game UI makes it extremely hard to engaged with;
The families just add more characters and nonsense to the other already confusing mechanics;
The events are so random and mostly not engaging;
The AI simply cheats. Even on the lowest difficulty, the AI pumps out units, orders and improvements that you simply cannot compete with;
The city sites rush at the beginning of every game is BS. The AI covers half the map to secure cities next to you. It happens every game.

There is too much happening and too much thrown at your face at the same time.
The only game I had fun was with the No characters option and it removed half of the games features. You get my point.

Unfortunately, I did not really enjoy the game. The most tedious part of it was warfare. I dislike 4x games that require you to micro warfare extensively (Age of Wonders, I'm looking at you), and was disappointed to see such micro required here.

I was intrigued by the city specialization mechanics, but even after a few playthroughs and manual reading, did not really understand them or how to exploit them very well. 

In general it seems like this game gives you many levers to pull in running your empire, but most of them are of unclear significance.

I am giving this game a recommendation because I think objectively it is well-done and intriguing, but I am simply not the target audience for the game.

It truly immerses you in the world and time period allowing you to role-play a leader of your choosing.  You get married, have children (or start with them as history had written them) and mold an empire that feels alive, cared for, symbiotic... it feels like there is a purpose besides gaining points, researching, dictating or conquering.  It's like you're writing your story of the lineage of Julius Casaer (or whom ever)... you're writing history (but playing it instead).  And notttttt to take away anything from the Civ franchise (that ive been playing since 1992 with Civ 2) but building your 2nd and 3rd city in Civ is like a frantic strategic necessity... One that requires you to end turn, end turn and then END TURN to acquire.  Inevitably it becomes a rinse repeat cycle that can be exciting tho, Old World makes this feeling more nuanced rather a chore.  It's a different type of exciting that only people who've played thru it can describe:  That third city, tho exciting, has meaning... for the families who settle it to its purpose in your story.
As your story progresses it becomes clear very early that you need to play the game to win, a certain way, its not as simple as just expanding your army and sitting them in strategic locations... if you wish to fight a large scale assault:  good luck... just like it would be back in that era: infrastructure, diplomacy, economy and science will take a dip unless you manage your resources appropriately.  This is due to the mechanic called 'orders'... By expending all your 'orders' on military: the player will be inhibited in expansion, trade, diplomacy  or tile improvements across their empire.  This could lead to their downfall...

WRONG. This is most assuredly a classic that will be fondly remembered in the 4X Hall of Fame like Colonization and Alpha Centauri.

Soren Johnson (of Civ 4 fame) and his team have taken the best ideas from many other games, and woven them into a compelling tapestry full of historical immersion, tactical conquest, strategic planning, political scheming, and economic management.

The three aspects of empire, 人天地，(or People, Heaven, and Earth) are put in perfect balance, as you try to wrangle your ruling families, unforeseen events, and the territory you are trying to settle. This is even before you meet the AI empires, who actually perform quite well tactically in war, at least better than in Civ.

The game is obviously developed with lots of love: I was blown away when I realised they show the actual cuneiform names for some leaders (I actually thought it was a corrupted string as first!). The UI in general is top notch, with modern nested tooltips that let you refer to things as you dive into the thick of things. The Undo button (don't judge!) is a respectful nod to us armchair rulers and our precious time.

That aside, the game systems are deceptively very different from Civ. I'd even say it's more similar to turn based strategy games(TBS) like Baldur's Gate 3 or XCOM 2: order(stamina) management. Alpha strike and overwhelm tactics since units don't usually counterattack. 

I'm 50/50 on the event and character system. While they do have meaningful impact and offer a good balance between gameplay and roleplay, they don't blend in well with the rest of the game and feels off. 

Orders system is great. Best resource system in 4Xs I've played, though it takes a while to get used to. 

Because of the smaller scope(200 turn games, mostly decided by T100, only covering the ancient era) the game is very well balanced even with a smaller roster, you can get some fun games in struggling to get better.

Focusing on a shorter time frame and the character development of your court members is what makes this game shine. The early game is always the best part of these games, Old World manages to hold that level of enjoyment for the entire playthrough.

The story events and having strong and varied NPC type characters as your court of ministers enables you to gain a very real attachment to what your Civ is doing. Every little bit of detail of your history weaves into every decision you make. Whether it's conquering the local barbarians, or finding a wife for your son and heir - every choice you make feels Epic and meaningful, whilst still allowing for flexibility and creative choice.

This is an excellent take on the 4x genre with a deceptive level of depth that has felt deeply rewarding to engage with. Things like the action economy have been reexamined from the ground up in a way that prevents late game tedium and always leaves you feeling like you wish you could do a little more every turn, which I think is a great balance for a strategy game to strike. Warfare is excellent, with ranged units not being strictly better than melee and units having plenty of unique attributes to make things like Spearmen and Axemen feel different as well as units like Ballistae playing different to Onagers. Production has been broken down and reworked in a way that makes it so it feels valuable to diversify what you build in cities based on what you need and their resources. The role playing aspects are also surprisingly flushed out and I am constantly floored by the sheer variety of events. I have many more hours in this game than what is on steam and I started out thinking ""yeah this is pretty good"" to now where it is definitively my favorite 4x game. 
[h1]Its not for everyone[/h1]
It isn't for everyone however, and I think the following few points might disappoint some players. The first is that nations don't play significantly different to one another. They can have some decent bonuses that set them apart, but the playstyles don't really change much from say Persia to Greece. You'll still prioritize most things about the same and the differences are felt mostly in the early game. Another thing people might not like is the drastically larger focus on warfare. Some might love this, but if your favorite part of a 4X game is building up your cities to see really big numbers, you're going to be dismayed when your neighbor forces you into a brutal war, which the AI is often quite aggressive about and many in game events will nudge you toward conflict. 

Overall, I highly recommend this game to 4X veterans because few other games in the genre feel so rewarding to engage with.",1706045049,1706045049,True,24,0,0.729531824588775635,0,True,False,False

Pro's:
- Character-driven game play adds an interesting dimension to the experience. Moreso, it feels more life-like, in that one's cities and other nations are managed by characters whose opinion of the leader influences their effectiveness and behavior. Seems correct!
- There're a number of resources to juggle, but it doesn't feel overwhelming even to someone only casually familiar with the genre. Three quarters of the way through my first play through, I was comfortable with the majority of them. Optimization then naturally follows, and it feels very rewarding as things begin to 'click'.
- The orders system prevents the game from becoming a slog in the late game, which is a core problem for this genre. Here it's remedied.
- Fighting is a lot of fun, but the AI isn't dumb! If not taken seriously, it will sting.

Con's:
- I've had some serious stability issues, with the game crashing more frequently than it should. I'm re-installing as we speak, so hopefully either that or future patch will fix that.
- Some of the city yield information is displayed in like size 7 font when playing on 1920 x 1080. Having to squint to see some of it can be a little annoying.

I've been playing them since the beginning, and this is one of the absolute best the genre has to offer. Don't let its un-googleable title and limited scope dissuade you. OW has far more depth and variability than the previous two iterations of Civ. It's 1UPT done right.

OW fights back against an obnoxious trend in recent games. Instead of stacking one (barely related) subsystem on top of another, it actually integrates them! Each piece is part of the larger whole, combining to play off each other and create interesting trade-offs, dynamic decisions, and satisfying gameplay. And even though it's a single era, the mechanics and character events combine to create much more variation than you might expect. You'll be reacting to the world instead of blindly following a build order to victory -- and you'll have to earn it against an AI that WILL kick your butt. 

The bad? You'll stay up later than you want. The Hall of Fame screen sucks. The AI will demoralize you the first few games. That's it. That's all I got.

So, if you like Civ --particularly Civ4 -- and you want to see 1UPT actually work, Old World is your game. Go buy it. Support the developers. They're nice and awesome and responsive. And join the discord community! We're friendly and fun!

First off, if you are interested in the game, play the demo.  It goes through the tutorial as well two different nation and map starts of about 40 turns.  I believe I put like 8 to 10 hours in the demo, so it is very fleshed out.  Take you time with the free demo too, this game can be more challenging thus isn't for everyone.

This game gets compared to the more well known and popular Civilization series, but I will say it is distinct and unique enough that saying it is like Civilization is a bit of a disservice.  This game fixes most of the gripes I've had with the Civilization games.  The AI is quite competent and the combat is far more dynamic.  Put ranged units on a hill, and you get more range.  Different infantry units have different attacks which means they can hit multiple units at the same time.  Units will inevitably be lost in war, therefore you need to prepared to continuously building and replenishing your armies while at war.  Movement range can be quite far, thus you will likely need scouts quite far ahead hiding in trees to get a good idea what the enemy is bringing to the fight.  You will also likely need probably three to four more times of units to go to war in this game compared to Civ, which can lead to some surprisingly epic battles for a turn based game.  Diplomacy is also vitally important in this game.  Relationships with foreign dynasty leaders can dramatically impact the relations with the country itself.  Religion isn't just something to give bonus resources, it has effects on relationships with leaders both outside and inside your country.  Trust me, the families under your rule rather than the empire next door is the biggest threat to you.

The game has a lot of depth, and will require playing though several games to truly learn and understand.  While I hate the analogy, it is somewhat like Dark Souls in that you will have to learn through failure and challenge, but that makes victory taste even sweeter.  Civilization has a fair bit of hand-holding, and allows you to ignore many systems with little consequences.  Here, there are consequences, therefore you will need to learn.  Yes, it took me 47.5 hours to finally win on ""the Just"" difficulty and even that one has a minor nerf to the AI.  I lost the two previous games by the skin of my teeth, but even when loosing, I was still having fun.  I carried my the lessons to the next game and kept on, and that's how I like my games to be.

Many describe it as a mix of Civ and Crusader Kings, and I'd say that is pretty accurate.  It is a bit more complicated and less intuitive than civ.  However with the complexity comes some great mechanics that I haven't seen present in many other 4X games.  

Having three different types of production means that you can really specialize your cities for specific tasks and in general makes more sense than just having one universal production resource.  The orders system, while making decision-making during your turn more laborious than other games, forces you to make interesting choices and sacrifice actions in some areas to gain them in others.

The game is pretty slow and war-heavy, and turns can be pretty draining at times, so this game is rather niche.  It's not for everyone.  But it definitely brings something special to the 4X genre that I really like!

Anyone who's played Civilization will probably pick up on this pretty quickly.  It's also fun how you have to manager leaders, succession, generals, etc.  It's not as in depth as something like Crusader Kings, but it's a welcome addition.  Some of the key differences from Civ that I really enjoy are as follows:
- Almost everything you do in a turn costs Orders.  As your empire develops and grows you will produce more orders.  It's a very interesting mechanic that you have to seriously consider when going to war.  Every unit movement and attack costs an order, but it also costs orders to move workers and have them construct improvements.  You'll often have to sacrifice economic improvement to be able to win a war.
- Restricted city placement and ease of expanding city borders.  There are only specific 3-6 tile areas where you can place cities scattered over the map.  I like that you don't have to worry too much about screwing yourself over with city placement.  And even if you do make a mistake, it's very easy to expand city borders by building improvements and specialists on those improvements.
- Random events as you explore the map, interact with prominent figures in your empire, or go to war also help spice things up and give you opportunities to make interesting decisions that can benefit your empire.
- Easy undo/redo buttons! I love being able to un-do a move I made!  It's so wonderful for fixing misclicks and managing your turn.
- Win Conditions - This game as a system called Ambitions.  Ambitions are basically quests that pop up throughout your leader's reign depending on what they are doing or what is going on around them.  I like that one of the ways to win is to accomplish a certain number of ambitions.

Dislikes:
- I wish there were more random events.  After playing a few games with a favorite nation some of them can end up repeating.  Especially the exploration events.
- There could also be more character portraits.  I wish there were a lot more of these so I would be less likely to get repeat portraits even in the same game.  Fortunately I don't think I've seen a portrait repeat while the original character was alive.  But after a character dies, I think it frees up their portrait to be used again.

Additionally, Old World brings some new mechanics which I think are very interesting and fun to play with, including the leader and events system, where you play a specific character, have a finite life span, and have offspring that you train up and eventually play as when your leader dies. The events add a lot of complexity and intrigue to the game play, as you never know what is coming.

I was very disappointed in 'Humankind' though (Amplitudes attempt at 4x historical game) as it made the managing of cities feel like a chore and that the constant shifting of cultures made the historical context feel messy. Old World does the opposite and focuses on the Antique Era and Mediterranean Area exclusively. I love that focused approach. Time and technologies paces slowly so you truly can play out the era without tech-rushing past it like in similar games.

I could never really like Civilization VI: Cartoony graphic design, a lot of boring leaders and a truly incompetent AI, it cannot compete without getting ridiculous amounts of handicap. Old World shines here also, The AI can really handle the mechanics and put up a hard fight.

The city and global resources is a fresh take in this game and you may want to look at a Youtube tutorial breaking down how it works. I find it to be an innovative system that reduces the 'chore feeling' of  micromanagement. The game also has a global 'orders'-pool that you work to increase throughout the course of a game. It's basically a bottleneck so you can't just rush huge armies because moving those armies requires orders. I think it's an interesting mechanic to get the player to coordinate attacks and other actions. I recommend limiting the ""force marsh"" in the pre-game setting though, it let's people with much orders swarm you easily and you can also use it as an unfair advantage.

You must strike a delicate balance of managing diplomatic relations within your civilization and with other nations, expanding your industrial base, developing your culture and keeping your populace happy, maintaining your military (even if only as a deterrent against invasion), and investing in research in order to steward your nation to victory.

All the systems mentioned above are thoughtfully implemented and tied together with the orders system which essentially simulates the concept of administrative burden, something I don't think I have ever encountered in a game before. 

I recommend this game if you feel you have the capacity to learn, fail, and push through your mistakes. Many times I have wanted to give up a match to try again with a more perfect start, but I discovered there will always be surprises. 

It has lots of replayability with the number of factions and leaders. I also see it as a positive that they've confined the game to a specific historical window in terms of technology available, so you'll never have spearmen fighting against tanks.

From the moment I opened it up and started exploring the game options, to playing through my first game, I could see the countless places where the developers of this game clearly saw some of the deepest design flaws of Civilization and came up with clever ways to remedy them. There are some real clever ideas here; this game has more novel ideas than Civilization has had in at least a decade, and I think the developers really genuinely cared about trying to create a game fundamentally more interesting than Civ.

But the sum total of all those ideas is, unfortunately, just not very fun. As the game goes on it gets more and more nightmarishly micromanagement-heavy. Some of the strategy games I love most are [i]filled[/i] with micromanagement -- I'm someone who [i]enjoys[/i] Hearts of Iron and Victoria -- but the micro here ends up turning into a draining chore. Old World presents me with a dizzying array of choices, but almost none of them actually matter that much, so it doesn't feel at all [i]satisfying[/i] that I made them.

The later-game balance feels particularly all over the place; because cities just keep expanding (not to mention the option to buy tiles), even a small number of workers easily turns into incomes of 100-200+ per turn of the core resources, to the point where none of them even matter anymore. And some of the late-game stuff like buying and selling orders, combined with the law that lets you buy at the same price you sell... it feels like the whole economy just starts to fall apart as all the game's various Numbers balloon.

In the end, Old World has a crisis of identity that it never really solves. It asks you to manage a micro-heavy Civ-like where your empire gets more grindy to manage every turn (the enormous number of tiles cities cover exacerbates this), while at the same time optimizing an ever-increasing array of courtiers and heirs. Both of these things sound like they should be fun, but somehow as the game goes on they turn into a chore instead.

I can't even imagine how one would ""fix"" this game; it just seems fundamentally frustrating to play at its core, despite being built out of a whole pile of rather good ideas.",1702209350,1703992954,False,266,12,0.857540369033813477,0,True,False,False

Best approach is to play the game relaxed, slowly enjoying reading events and immersing yourself. Once you get impatient you'll start hating the game and may not let it fully develop and grow on you.
Another thing has to be said about ""correct development with MP-first approach"". This is definetely just a joke, game is clearly a single player focused with lots of randomness.
And after all of this, you get a pretty original and deep game for at least 3 playthroughs until you optimize everything. Design is also great - everthing is very pleasant, so the price is justified.",1703338543,1703338543,True,106,0,0.904503703117370605,1,True,False,False

Founded by former Firaxis employees, Old World is Civilization, but limited to the Ancient and Classical eras. It adds elements from other games, like Crusader Kings, giving personalities to leaders. Each nation builds its cities, settlers, workers, buildings, and armies like in a Civilization game. Nations research technology. They fight barbarians and conduct diplomacy. Unlike Civilization, where time seems to pass due to technological development, time passes in Old World as leaders age and pass away. Children rise to succeed their parents. Other nobles form factions, pressuring the ruler to complete specific objectives. Another significant development is the limit on actions. In Civilization players can move every unit and build in every city. Old World gives the player a limited number of actions determined by the nation's number of cities, the skill of leaders, and the value of technologies.

I played Old World for one and a half nations with a friend. My friend and I stopped playing to try Crusader Kings III. I don't think we will return. Old World feels too similar to Civilization with minor tweaks. I'm currently not a fan of the Civilization series, and prefer Paradox's style of historical strategy games.

The game focuses on a specific area of history so doesn't take you up to the modern day, but as a result, it focuses more deeply on that older/ancient time period. The added focus on your leader (and family, and well, really everyone in your civilization) where they accrue experience and you can augment their stats and traits over time, is a neat dynamic. You can focus people to be more war-like for battles, or focus on science, or politics, etc. and with each change generation adjust to where you're falling behind. The game uses the concept of ""orders"" to limit how many things you can do in a turn. In the early stages, with a low order count, this can feel artificially stifling, but it's still a neat dynamic to force you to prioritize what you do. The development team has done an outstanding job augmenting the game since it's release with numerous releases, sometimes with new features, but often just nuanced changes to balance the game play or make certain previously unused features more worthwhile to use. I only wish other games (I'm thinking you Firaxis) would do that with their games. My only complaint is that this refinement has continuously made the game harder -- the AI, to an extent, plays its moves perfectly particularly when at war. Their troops are always in prime locations, just slightly out of range of where you can cause the most damage. They claim ideal defensive territory for each of their units and often times they can kill any one of my units using two or three of their units where it takes me 5 of mine to kill one of theirs. It can be frustrating. Instead of having difficulty only affect resource availability or happiness, I think games should also adjust AI competence -- at lower ratings, the AI should make mistakes whereas at highest levels, the AI plays a perfect game.",1703173464,1703173464,True,227,2,0.922335922718048096,0,True,False,False

This game did exactly what it claimed to in the marketing.  It is basically a Civilisation game.  I would still be playing CIV 6 except for some reason, they never supported some of the resolutions I most play at. This does. 

Looks perfectly fine at my favoured resolution of 5120x1440

It is so like Civilisation, you will occasionally be a bit confused.  All the core aspects are there. However, the devil is in the detail and there are some very clever differences.  In my case, I am not sure if they are things I do or do not like. But they do work. 

This game is civilisation but with a very much greater focus on relationships.  Relationships with your family, relationships with the families in your kingdom and of course, relationships with other states.  Initially it felt a bit cartoonish and dumbed down but that was a misconstrued assessment on my part. However, it is disappointing that some of the added depth does not add to actual enjoyment of the game as they just do not seem to work very well.  

The thing I like least of all in the game is the way families in your nation work which is extremely tedious at best.  It seems to be an attempt to add depth and a new facet to a familiar genre but for me, it really does not work and is more off putting that value adding. 

The way orders are generated / managed is also quite irritating in the main and both of these factors are often less than logical in the way they seem to work.
The UI is okay but not very friendly in some aspects.  Certain things which should be straight forward and more visual are less so.  For example, managing luxury resources between you and a family could be far better.  Also the information provided to you in many ways. 


I didn't like the map sizes originally but as ever, modders came to the rescue to make things a bit more awesome with super huge maps choices etc.  In fact, one thing that stands out about this game and puts it head and shoulders above many other games of the kind is the way in which modding has been integrated into the core systems of the game. It is fantastic to have a mod manager inside the game itself.  

Why  on earth do other folks not get that this is a great feature?   So, if you feel limited by something, or want something done differently, you can often just mod it.  It is literally at the click of a button. That is a fantastic addition.

The graphic style is not the most detailed I have ever seen but because that is because I am always looking for more and more in this regard and have machines to do it. But this is perfectly fine.  However, I do notice a bit of a lack of detail and feedback in some ways.  For example, I don't yet see a view that really makes it clear what resources I am getting from a particular hex without hovering over it. Hardly a game breaking problem.
As usual with these games.  The wait time between taking your turn, waiting for the AI to play its turn before you can take the next turn is really irritating. Even on a 32 core cpu. 

They have done a good job.  If I was directing the making of a game like this I would be satisfied but it would probably bug me that these things which stop of being a classic still get in the way. 

Supports all resolutions I could come up with.  Runs very well with no bugs I have seen so far.  

Looking forward to seeing some new content and DLCs for this one. 

Despite some big irritations this is one of my  strongest recommendations . Someone actually cared about PC games and gamers when they made this.  

A really good way to get your genre fix of this sort of game in a genre that has been lacking a really good title with longevity instead of rather shallow clones.

""The joy of learning is a big reason why games are fun, but no one wants to study for a test which doesn’t exist."" - Civ 4 and Old World Lead Designer, Soren Johnson.

I intentionally waited until I overcame this phenomenon before making this review. I made sure that I've fully understood all the mechanics. While not fully solving this phenomenon, Old World has mitigated a lot of it. Some of it is due to the AI being better at combat compared to other 4X, but there are other factors that I didn't expect would curb this phenomenon such as the scenarios.

Usually, you don't play 4X for its scenarios. In Old World, it's highly recommended to do so. Not only that it does a terrific job at explaining the mechanics as you play them, it also offers plenty of challenges that you may not achieve on your first playthrough, but you can come back later to ace it. 

The base game offers a series of scripted scenarios of Carthage from its fledgling. Historically, Carthage was destroyed by the Roman Empire. But you can prevent that. In the scenarios, you are challenged to fight on your bitter end and defeat Rome, not only once but twice.

I didn't expect to enjoy scripted 4X content, but these scenarios put me up on the benchmark. They offer challenges that 4X games often don't. I'm excited that Mohawk also made DLC for new scenarios (Heroes of Aegean), and I enjoyed that DLC also. I hope they keep making these challenging scripted scenarios in the future. 

The core mechanics of the game are really solid. I enjoyed the order system, it allows for limited but unconstrained movement (I know it sounds like an oxymoron, but bear with me). While in Civ you're only allowed to move maybe 2-5 hex at most, in Old World you can move a single unit 200 hex if you can afford the order costs. This allows a plethora of tactical movement such as, ambushing from behind fog of war and decimating half of their army in a turn, enveloping enemy formations, or retreating your key important units in midst of losing battle to the nearest safe location. There are a limited number of orders. One unit action is potentially at the cost of another unit action. This in turn also helps minimize the amount of bloat unit actions you had to do in mid-late game.

Unlike Civ, most units don't counter attack. The best defense is to attack, make actions. The combat felt great with this system. Moving and making action is a lot more fun than fortifying then healing in a hill behind a river a la Civ.

Old World has a lot of game customization. You don't care about character events? You can turn that off. Tired of unexpected critical hit chances? You can make it that the game will show you if your unit will land a crit. The game telegraphs a lot of the combat nicely. You can look ahead at what damage a unit will do before you make a move. This game has practically unlimited undo and redo action which should be mandatory to all 4X after this (You can also turn this off if you don't want this). I can't count how many times I used it because of misclick or that I want to quickly try other sequences of unit actions in battle.

The game is not perfect, it has obvious flaws. I missed the intuitive and beautiful Civ resource icons. Old World doesn't have that. This game has a rudimentary overlay above the resource with really small icons and text on them. The overlay will also block units on top of the hex while also removing other usable overlays.

While being the star of the feature, I find the character's events to be lacking. It is far from the level of CK and mostly there for your character's stats. There are limited amounts of events and they don’t have the grandeur scale or as impactful to your character as CK games.

The game has some bugs. Sometimes minor but sometimes really annoying. One time, I had a bug where some left clicks are not registering for selecting units or cities. I had to restart the game to fix that.

All in all, Old World is a 4X game that has stood out. While it has its drawbacks, it is far from holding it out as one of the better 4X games out there. It checked a lot of the checkboxes that I wished Civ had done better: Challenging for experienced player, less actions bloats, better combat system, better AI, more customization (modularity).",1690296599,1701073629,True,22,0,0.719991683959960938,0,True,False,False

- Deeper story: For me, the Dynasty mechanics and the deep story work very, very well (This is the #1 strong point of this game, being so story-rich, which is rather unusual for a turn-based strategy game);
- Building and resource management: it all makes sense, and it is more engaging;
- Diplomacy and Espionage make sense.

I recently gave up on this game after realising that it is really more of a chore than a pleasure. It is the least transparent game I have ever played. Even after 80 hours I hadn't figured out how everything works, and I didn't really care enough about the game to take the trouble to find out. And I have played some pretty complicated strategy games, like all the Victorias, Hearts of Iron series, etc. This game taught me to appreciate just how user-friendly and well designed games like Rome Total War are, or other 4X games like Endless Legend, Stars in Shadow etc. This game is neither.

The game is historically ludicrous. You can build any wonder anywhere. Starting rulers are from different millenia (or mythical figues like Dido). You can appoint 18 year old girls as generals or govenors. There is a mod that restricts gender roles, but then you don't have enough generals. You never have enough generals because, unlike RTW where you move around a small number of armies, here you have to shift around dozens of units, which cannot be combined into armies or garrisoned in towns, the just stand around messing up the townscape. But the worst design feature is the totally and utterly counter-intuitive order system. It makes no sense. Orders increase dramatically over th course of the game, so you end up in the ridiculous situation that a large empire with lots of units can actually be easier to run than a small one was. 

The game is also repetitive. The same events requiring the same decisions, turn up again and again. Each campaign plays in pretty much the same way, clear the barbarian sites, set up cities, keep the tribes happy until you can canquer them etc. It just gets stale after a while.

Anyway, enough of this game. I just wanted to write a warning that this game delivers a lot less than it promises, and unless you have money to burn you should think carefully before buying it.",1700480388,1700480388,False,17,3,0.573388755321502686,0,True,False,False

Suggestions for a little extra drama in your game:
1- Set event rate to maximum in pre-game settings and make sure all barbarians are replaced with tribes.
2- Start as a Schemer archetype and adopt as many heirs as you can.
3- Marry them all off to surrounding tribal chiefs, neighbouring royalty, and your own nobles.

Original review post (with NOT Recommended)

I like this game, but, after 96 hours, I just can't win, or find a strategy that puts me on a path to winning, my last game was the furthest I had gotten until a bigger rival power picked a fight with me and just overwhelmed me. Not matter the size of force I try to build in anticipation of being attacked for a solid defence and possible counter to gain enemy cities (whilst building my empire economically or culturally), the enemy power is just to big and too relentless. The AI is too smart and the wave of units concentrate all their hits in turn on one of your units, and they have sooooo more units, that even if you survive that first wave, in a few turns with there's another wave to face your depleted remaining units that hasn't been replenished close to what it was previously, cos you just can't build units as fast as the enemy can. And get this.... I'm playing on the easiest setting! 
I've play'd a lot of CIV, ever since CIV 1, not at level deity, I might get up to King level there at best (I'm not a 4x dunce - I've won plenty of civ games), but at least I can play, lose and learn, and then win on CIV. With Old World it's just; play, lose, play, lose, it's too hard.

It is deep and complex but hugely satisfying and rewarding to play. I admire the clever design of the game, in particular how all the different gameplay concepts inter-relate; if you don't pay enough attention to one area of the game it will come back to bite you in another. It's also very polished and in the 470+ hours I've played it, I haven't once encountered any technical problems.
The game set-up options are comprehensive and genuinely allow you to play the game how it suits you. E.g. you can change how many character events that will appear, with an option to turn off altogether if you so wish although I find that having some awkward customers to keep happy helps to bring a bit more purpose and realism to the decisions that you have to make throughout each game.
Combat is well thought out and fun and offers several layers of complexity over the usual rock, paper, scissors mechanics. It takes a while to get proficient at it but practice makes perfect. The game's ""undo"" feature is a huge help here. This allows you to undo the last move you made and can be applied multiple times even allowing you to back out your whole turn if you need to. It's a very useful learning tool especially for combat where it allows you to have another go if your first attempt didn't go to plan, and another, and another.......
It offers huge replay-ability value and even if you play the same nation all the time each game will play out differently each game thanks to the character events and the excellent map generator. I can see myself playing another 470 hours, and beyond.
The game is well supported by the dev team with regular updates still being applied and there is, imho, a sensible approach to dlc.
In summary, I can't praise this game enough. It takes a while to learn and you will only pick up on the more subtle aspects of it after many hours of gameplay. And that's exactly how a grand strategy game should be.",1699370019,1699370019,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the family thing is interesting, but maybe too involved. Having to think through tutoring, influencing, intercessions, etc. really starts to be a drag on the gameplay.

Second, units move way too quickly across the board. You can carefully plan the assault of a city and within a turn there are a bunch of units from the other side of that civilization there to defend it.

Third, land unit movement on water is weird. Moving on water is faster, that makes sense. There is no boarding/disembarking costs, that makes no sense. Units will cross a two tile lake instead of taking the road next to the lake because the lake is faster.

This game scratches the itch of ""I want to play something like Civ V, with the fluidity of Civ 6, and throw in some Crusader Kings-esque events and decisions that positively impact the game"". If you enjoyed Civ 5, Civ 6 and/or crusader kings, this is worth picking up.

The game plays very well, performance wise. I've had a few hiccups with highly developed cities in the late game, but that's just in between turns. Oddly enough tuning the settings down didn't improve performance. I presume it's a CPU bound limitation, as I have a laptop and my desktop does not have the issue.

One particular nuance that I really enjoyed, albeit a small feature, is that in game music doesn't play until you research drama. It seems like such a small ""thing"", but it really impressed me, for whatever reason. I've not played a game that did this.

This games' tutorial is fan-freaking-tastic. It breaks down all of the elements that are vital to playing the game, walks you through the systems, provides you with goals that you must meet prior to pressing forward, and then even provides a guided game where tutorial suggestions pop up when the game believes you need direction. A very very well implemented feature of this title, and newcomers should absolutely play the tutorial through (there are 5 ""Do X, Y, Z"" and 5 ""put on your big boi panties"" choices).

My only gripe is that the leader pool is somewhat limited, coming from fully DLC'd out Civ games, but they've already added some through DLC, and they are actively working toward making the game very mod friendly.

Where other games tend to go into auto-pilot pretty quickly, this game adds a ton of meaningful choices throughout the game.  The AI is very competent, combat requires positioning, flanking, and logistics to be able to win any battles and the AI will use any opening you let it.  You will need to use bait and accept that losses are inevitable.  No single unit is win-all, they all have their uses!  Oh and sea-combat that actually matters! (you need to setup ships anchorages that allow you to ferry units around, even if just along the coast for extra speed).

Then you have the order system that requires that you focus on certain aspects, which means other will suffer (if you're in a war, your orders will be going into that, and your workers will be idle or you may lose!   Or you can (try) andtech your way out of that.  Laws are also pretty interesting and the events keep every game fresh!

Even diplomacy is interesting because of the many personalities and the events that form them!  And diplomacy is not just against the other nations.  Tribes and families need to be managed and can be an asset or a detriment.  

Only thing I will say is take the mod (by the devs)  that allows for the turn lengths to be seasons rather than semesters or years.  Because otherwise your leaders go by so fast there's not enough interesting things that happen to them to make it memorable.

Old World brings turnbased 4X game set only in the ancient ages, while also maintaining a scientific progress throughout the game (tech tree). You can spot great management requirements / balance of the game just by the way you are forced to try to do everything at once – support economy, prepare logistics, build army, fend off raiders and suppress rebels, maintain good relations inward (families, characters) and outward of your empire (another empires, independent nations), maintain religious relationships or convert characters and cities, keep cities happy, and the best thing about this game is that you are simply not able to do it all – [b]orders limit is what it makes so fun, you have to choose what is the most important at the moment and think of the consequences. [/b] 

[h1] Summary [/h1]

[b]Pros[/b]

✪ [i]Ancient Times[/i] – Even though the game is all set in the ancient times it is not missing the diversity and progress. Well-constructed.

✪ [i]Events[/i] – hundreds and hundreds of interesting (storylike) events influencing the game.

✪ [i]Orders limit[/i] - there is only so much you can do in one year (turn), you can’t have it all.

✪ [i]Production[/i] – different products require different inputs, city focusing only on one thing is very unproductive in other departments, this forces you to make cities somewhat general. 

✪ [i]Characters[/i] – the game have different characters having a role in your empire, their skills and your (as a ruler) relationships with them influences your overall performance. Unruly families tend to rebel, generals with bad relationships can switch sides etc. 

✪ [i] City Sites[/i] – new cities cannot be anywhere, this keeps the game balanced.

✪ [i] UnDo Button[/i] – you can undo your last action! Breakthrough in this genre. 

✪ [i] Border expansion system [/i] – borders can be expanded by new buildings or hiring specialists working on the current borders, system makes sense, larger cities get larger territory. On the other hand there are some option to buy land, but you need either laws or technologies to do that.

✪ [i]Laws & Technology tree [/i] – two separate system influencing the game are very elaborate and gives depth to the game. 

[b]Cons[/b]

✪ [i]Difficulty[/i] – higher difficulties seems to be unplayable, AI does not have the same limits as player, or it seems that AI have unlimited resources. 

✪ [i]Performance[/i] – the game is really hardware demanding, larger maps are unplayable even with high-end computer.

This game has way more depth than it looks. If you are just used to press turn on auto mode, you are bound to fail. In every turn you have to consider carefully what to do and adapt your strategy. One of its greatest innovations is the use or orders. You use orders for any game action, from moving a unit to marry your son. If you are out of them you can't do anything , so they are vital. But you also may end up with too many and lack of resources/units instead, so balance is required

There is a family/event layer over the game. It is light, but full of flavour. The events are relevant and insteresting to read.

The tactical AI in this game is amazing, one of the best I have seen in a 4x game. It will only attack you if it can win, and it will attack with all its units as a group. They will attack weakest units first and will finish any unit. It will retreat damaged units and use the right promotions in the units. It is less smart on city building but still be a challenge. The bonus it gets at the highest difficulty levels are not so absurd like in other games for this reason

For deity level players, the top difficulty ""The Great""(although there is another extra one in advanced setup) plays very nicely. Feeling like an immense challenge but fair. It has a lot of vibes from civ5 actually, and apparently they got some people in the studio who did work on civ5.

The city building is a lot of fun. The worker mechanic is spot on, with modern placement of improvements. I like the wonder system. It is difficult to build a wonder, but if you start it, it is yours and can't be finished earlier by somebody else

I wish the tech tree was a bit bigger and some of the laws are a bit useless. There is also a limited amount of units. But overall the balance is really really good

To make things even better, it is set in one of my favourites periods of history, the ancient period. The tech finishes around middle ages approximately. The game could use a bit more lore, but the one it has is impressive. With very nice art , portraits and details like happing your leader name in its original name (for egypt using hieroglyphs!)

All in all a must for any 4x lover and even able to trade blows with heavy weights like civ5 or alpha centauri

The orders mechanic which limits how much you can do in each turn is absolutely idiotic. Want to move your army? You cant, not all of it anyhow. This makes every turn bite sized, frustrating and completely illogical. Nations cant multi task? Ridiculous.

Key information is presented in the smallest possible font or icon sizes. At 1440p you'll struggle to notice the tiniest of icons somewhere on the screen that tells you why your unit cannot move (stunned). The bar on top showing you resources and income, all of which is absolutely critical, uses a font size that I just cannot imagine being readable if someone were to play on a 4K resolution. None of this would be a problem if there was a UI scale option which, unless it exists somewhere I just entirely missed, doesnt exist

You will have endless popups with family events. Your son needs this. Your daughter did that. Something happened last turn in your war, units were lost etc, but before you get to see all that you need to wade through sometimes 3+ popups. Every turn. GTFO devs, this is NOT fun.

Imagine my surprise when, without any intervention from Kush at all, Pieface the Drunk shortly returned with an army.

In the interim, Prince Alexander -- whose character sheet helpfully notes he is Bisexual -- got married to the court poetess Sappho. There are plenty of ways to bring in an heir other than having a baby, and I can only assume they're covering for each other in a wacky comedy of errors. Sadly, Alexander was too far away and neck deep in dead Scythians, so he couldn't save our border city from the rampaging hordes of Pieface the Drunk. Pieface has declared himself true king of the Greeks after running my militia out of town.

In my second game, King Romulus of Rome immediately married the first female general he laid eyes on, a ""Hero"" of the family line of Champions. Shortly thereafter, he came across an outpost of Vandals. The local tribesmen insisted he marry the chief's daughter on the spot to secure peace. Romulus' Jewish court advisors warned against this temptation, but nonetheless, he consented, ending up with two wives on his status screen.

Soon afterwards, a second female general confessed her love for him by sending him an explicit letter from the front lines of the war against the Danes, where she was serving side by side with his first wife. Romulus encouraged her advances, and when the affair was discovered about five years later, he named her his third wife. Meanwhile, he's fathered two heirs with his original wife, who has become ""Bitter."" I can't imagine why. 

Previously, a vision showed him he is ""Divine."" An Egyptian diplomat offended him, so he built the Pyramids outside Rome. In about two years he is going to found Christianity. This is all going to happen while doing a middling job at best of actually leading Rome.

I haven't actually been developing my cities or anything because Romulus is so busy with his polycule. The game was setting up some kind of uprising led by his brother, but then Remus suddenly got sick and died. Remus' daughter is now studying commerce under the tutelage of an actual wizard I found stashed in a goody hut. His son has not aged since his father's death.

The good news is that Old World has that special something.  Old World combines the extremely addictive explore, expand and prosper vibes with a captivating dynastic mechanic.

I recently invested heavily in my heir.  The 15 year old Prince was wise, charming and courageous - just 3 years (turns) away from leading my most professional Legionary into battle against the pesky Thracians to the North.  A disgruntled brother-in-law decided he would kidnap the Prince and flee to Persia.  Now I´m left with a foolish and wanton half-sister as the next to inherit the throne.  Which she does inevitably do.

Sure, my empire now suffers from a decrease in science output but boy does she throw one helluva party.
In the meantime, I´m managing irate religious leaders, placating neighboring Greece and pushing back aggressive tribes on three fronts.  And I love every single bit of it.

You really feel the pressure of leadership in this game.  The brilliant order mechanic Old World utilizes means you don´t have the logistics to send armies in every direction simultaneously.  You really want to build odeons, hamlets and temples for your cities, but at what cost?  Is it at the cost of allowing repetitive incursions into one or more of your border cities?  Maybe an upset house (another super cool mechanic) needs some attention, but solving their problems is yet another mediocre priority.

Despite these challenges Old World rewards the player well.  A devout or pious leader has the option of a  great solution that´s unique to them when faced with a dilemma.  Your charismatic new Queen can talk her way out of a potentially humiliating situation.  You´ve diligently made sure your economy keeps the nation´s coffers full when you´re offered a chance to invest in a timely boon.

I could go on but this is time I´d rather spend playing the game.  So I´ll end it on this final note:  In the 20 plus years of playing Civ games (yup 1 to 6), this is the one that is the closest to scratching that itch, and I feel I´m only just beginning to appreciate this therapeutic masterpiece.",1697297621,1697297621,True,8,0,0.637806177139282227,0,True,False,False

This combined with the lead game designer having a following within the 4X genre  (He was the lead game designer on Civ IV) means that most of the game's sales happened on Epic, not steam.  Initially, Old World didn't grab me because I failed to grasp the nuance in it's mechanics and how intertwined every aspect of the game is.  I highly recommend playing a few tutorial scenarios while also going through the game manual which can be launched directly from the game.  Do this, even if you have prior experience with 4X/Grand Strategy Games or you will probably bounce off of Old World.  Once you understand how most of the game mechanics work, and interact with each other, you start to really feel the tension of every turn as you weigh how to spend your limited actions.  Each event carries weight as maintaining positive opinion with your family, religion, and neighboring factions becomes a delicate balancing act to ensure you don't get war declared on you by a much more powerful nation and you can keep the peace domestically.  

My only real criticism is that the game manual is absolutely necessary as the in game resources/UI don't do a great job of conveying the impact of different decisions you make throughout the game.  When you are new to the game, you can lose the match pretty early on without realizing it.  The city improvements are difficult to visually identify and the build menu is awkward because you have to be on an eligible tile to see what is possible to build on it.  I would prefer to see all of the building I can build, regardless of where I'm standing or what my culture level is.

Aside from those minor complaints, the game is really well executed.  Every turn is a trade-off where you try to weight the opportunity cost of every decision, which keeps the strategy fresh.  The events add a lot of flavor while still having impact, an improvement over CK3 on both fronts.",1696921721,1696921721,True,61,1,0.824427783489227295,2,True,False,False

Actual thought has been put into evolving the genre, and the design decisions are compelling and transparent enough to be easily understandable. The more i play it, the more it grows on me, and there is a very organic feeling to developing and running your empire. There is a temptation to compare this with Civ/Crusader Kings as it appears to have systems that resemble those games, but this game deserves more than superficial analysis, as whether or not it draws inspiration from other titles, it assumes its design decisions, and its systems are its own through implementation as well as flavor.

Very, very good tentatively exploratory step forward for a genre that has been stagnant for a long time. Judge it on its own merit, and you won't be disappointed.

P.S. Regarding a popular (negative) review right now, i'm not sure what that person has been doing for 9 hours, but clearly paying attention to the game isn't the case, as units DO in fact get counterattack damage when attacking an enemy unit. This information is present in the attack breakdown when mousing over the enemy unit prior to launching the attack. 

Good stuff, Mohawk Games. Please let your inspiration run wild some more.

P.S. Do the tutorials.

Love this game. It sits at the top of my list for Civilization-style games, title which it has completely surpassed for me.

Every system here feels like it was carefully designed and integrated. The mechanical attention to detail is second to none. Not only is there a very satisfying level of depth, but it is easy and intuitive to explore it. 

This is one of the most immersive 4X games i have ever played, and it really makes you feel like the ruler of your nation

If you're in the mood for a classic feeling 4X that lets you sit at the top of a nation's court, strategically and tactically manage a beautifully integrated simulation of the systems and characters that make it tick, you cannot go wrong with Old World, the new standard for the genre and style as far as i am concerned.",1653225296,1696851743,True,1,0,0.477441459894180298,0,True,False,False

I'm a long time 4X fan and I'd agree this game shares very similar mechanics and feels a bit like a hybrid of both The Crusader Kings games and CIV, but Old World is much superior in it's design. 
Many problems i had with both these games are ironed out with Old World & there's a little more planning and thought/decisions involved during your different campaigns.  
Old worlds historical timeline/period and the eras you cover don't burn you out like Civ, the micromanagement of your cities just makes so much sense. 
The choices, character interactions and events make the RPG elements more fun than I ever found CK.
The in-game tutorial and community give you everything you need to learn to play this Game and fully enjoy it for hours.

In the very long time that I've been playing video games, Old World has, hands down, the absolute worst save/load game interface I've ever been subjected to. For some reason, Mohawk Games thinks average players have either a need or desire to interact with the actual game files in a clunky interface instead of the streamlined save/load interfaces that have been a staple of good video game design for over 30 years. I don't understand how someone who worked on  Civilization IV could look at the UI of the saving/loading screen and think ""good enough"". The symbols don't even tell you what they do when you hover over them. I clicked on one and it took me to directories for OTHER GAMES on my hard drive. Why I would ever need to access anything other than this game's files while trying to find a way to mass delete Old World manual saves is beyond me.

There are two more annoyances that, for me, take away from the fun. The first is war. The enemy nations seem to have unlimited orders (a resource needed for absolutely everything), unlimited units in reserve, and the ability to basically teleport around the map. It was very annoying when I had a Babylonian archer with one promotion sniping my units from 7 tiles away, something my Carthaginian archers can't do after 3-4 promotions. When I tried to close in on him, he would move farther than my chariots could travel. Was he a wizard or is the AI programmed to cheat during combat? I don't know but it was so annoying that I paid them for a truce. The other big annoyance is severe late game lag. I'm not sure if it's a memory leak or just poor optimization but after turn 100 you'll likely have time to use the bathroom and have a snack before your turn ever loads. At turn 117, I have time to do that and more.

On the bland side are the interactions with other nations. Trade deals aren't dynamic and you just pick the best of three options or none at all. Foreign leaders will come to your court and start events but you don't have the option, that I've found, to do the same. They can make offers of gold or resources for your technological advancements but if there's any way to get their technological advancements other than spying, I haven't found it. The trading feels much like a heavily watered down version of Civilization V.

There's some fun to be had here since Old World mixes many of the 4X mechanics that made the Civilization series the gold standard with family dynamics and politics. But I can no longer sit here and pretend that the glaring issues this game has don't make it more frustration than fun.",1695821443,1696461697,False,50,5,0.68460690975189209,0,True,False,False

As a most of the reviews focus on the general gameplay and novelties, I just talk about some “historic” events that happened during my Greek campaign:

[list]
    [*]Alexander got ill five years after getting to the throne, so he is remembered as Alexander the New forever lol.
    [*]Rome declared war on me when I had a weak army. I stopped them by marrying my heir with an Egyptian noble and securing an alliance, thus going to war together.
    [*]I took my heir to hunt with some Danes and performed their sacred rituals. Eventually, that led to integrating all their territory into my empire. Peacefully!
    [*]When I was close to wiping out Rome (50 turns later or so), an Assirian king insulted me on his coronation because he was that type of guy. So I insulted him back. A couple of turns later I saw that he was amassing troops near my borders and almost all of my army was finishing the Romans on the other side of the map. So I tried to improve my relations with Assyria by blatantly bribing them: luxury resources, trade treaties, marriage proposals, etc. So the guy declares war regardless and come to my capital personally to insult me again. He was too proud to be bribed. But, as he was in my capital, I just murdered him! His heir was weak and ended the war the next turn, giving me time to crush the Romans and move my trusty hoplites to the Assirian frontier.

But to see like Babylon or Egypt with these VERY Roman-looking buildings next to their Babylonian / Egyptian towns & units was very strange.

Cons:
- Tech tree is entirely set within the ancient world (while I deeply appreciate this game's loving focus on classical civilization, it sure would be nice to be able to take these civilizations past their historical times and develop higher tech).
- World Religion mechanic is irritating if you don't want those religions. If you want your civilization to retain its pagan religion you can do so, but you won't get the full religion mechanics and your play priorities have to be skewed a bit.
- I want even more events & more portraits! You start to recognize most of them if you play repeatedly.

Pros:
- Everything else. The orders system is brilliant, the dynasty management is great, the events are beautifully done, and the balance between the various resources, aspects of gameplay, etc. is pretty much perfect. The game is crafted more carefully and intelligently than Civ, has more depth, and has better style & a more genuine appreciation for history. There are even lots of little-known classical anecdotes reproduced as events!
- Warfare is more balanced than in Civ, or pretty much any strategy game. The units don't die as easily, so that battles are much more strategic and drawn out and much less ""maximum firepower, full speed ahead!"". Likewise empires are more resilient, causing a much more realistic ""slowly-starts-to-matter-then-dominates-the-picture"" pattern for how important your economy's unit production speed and supporting elements are, as opposed to the strength of your standing army at the beginning of the war. It is actually possible--common, in fact--to fight wars where you have the power to win and achieve a strategic goal, and the power to defend against the enemy, but NOT the power to annihilate the enemy's entire civilization. That's very rare in this genre and indicative of extremely well-designed, exquisitely balanced mechanics.
- The use of different city resources to produce different classes of things is awesome. It makes your production choices in your cities impactful in nontrivial ways, and it improves, relative to similar games, phenomena like the way your economy behaves when strained by war production etc.",1694242367,1694242367,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Civ meets crusader kings; if you were to box this game in that is. It has resource management, empire buildings, politics, family lines, and more importantly war. This game is challenging, and the AI are no breeze from my first couple games on NORMAL. The random events, coupled with the engaging empire building makes this game super addicting. It truly captures that 'One more turn...' aspect of the civ series. I will say though, despite it's wealth of features, there are only a handful of empires to play as and some of the UI could use a little bit of work. The game plays entirely in the ancient era, which in my books is honestly a plus.

However, one of my by far favourite things about this game is the ORDERS mechanic. You see, in civ you could move every unit once a turn without any bother. NOT in old world. You have limited orders which for bigger empires can limit your agency greatly if you aren't careful. This makes every move critical from my own experience and requires you to play cautiously once you are a large empire. Too many enemies, and well you might be left as nothing but a myth.

Finally, I could really go on and on about how this game creates such a unique spin on an ageing formula but I suggest you just give it a shot yourself. So long as the devs continue to update and expand the content with dlcs I think this game has my attention.

I resisted purchasing it at first because I thought it was going to be a Civilization rip off, but it turns out it's so much more.

This game is what would happen if civilization only focused on ancient civilizations around the cradle of life, and got rid of the grind, and replaced it with stories.  

Stories are the backbone of old world.  Your leader (and their family) might stumble upon ancient ruins with ""secrets,"" might take a lover (to the fallout of the existing wive/husband), might sneak away and elope (bring them back!  we need rulers!), or any number of fun things.

I thought it was well done and is a good game in it's own right.  I will even say that -- after decades of playing civ -- I actually prefer this game.

This is my first Steam review. I've loved 4X and similar strategy games ever since the day I bought Civilization 4 at Gamestop in 2005. While Civilization 4 ended up being one of my favorite games of all time, I eventually put it down and began exploring other 4X games such as Civilization 5 and 6, Endless Legend, and Humankind. For me Old World is the only game I've played that has really captured the charm and appeal of Civilization 4, with some immediate improvements:
[olist]
    [*]The orders feature serves as a resource for how many actions each player can take per turn, which is actually a good thing; because [i]everyone[/i] is forced to decide where and what they want to prioritize, you don't feel pressured to manage every unit on every turn. Of course there are many ways to increase your order rate, and even outright buy orders in late game.
    [*]The undo button is a huge quality of life improvement, meaning I don't have to reload a save just because I mis-clicked and sent a unit to the wrong tile.
    [*] The characters system adds an engaging story element that I never quite felt as I researched Agriculture under the leadership of Queen Elizabeth in 4000 BC...
[/olist]

One of the things I love most about Old World is the way characters' stories evolve and unfold, often somewhat out of your control. When it comes to responding to random events, sometimes there is no ""perfect"" response. I find this more realistic and challenging than enacting a perfect game where there are never any downsides and everything always goes your way. On the other hand, the course of the game's progression might radically change if you go ahead with a certain decision even after being warned that it might lead to an unfavorable outcome. For example, one young Queen Agripinna of Rome, who happened to be gay, became insane due to an unsuitable education. She later began eating live bees and became doomed before dying at the age of 36. Her daughter took the throne at the mere age of 10, but she was determined in her education, married well, and led Rome to greatness before its final victory.

The learning curve in this game is very satisfying. At first it can be difficult to keep track of all the different modifiers and resources, but with time and experience it becomes easier to plan out your empire's progression in advance. Although the mechanics are all there from the beginning, it takes a while to see how all the pieces fit together like an intricately designed puzzle. In one early game I played, Ptolemy of Greece carelessly married off his daughter Arsinoe to an older man who was terrible with money. After Ptolemy died and Arsinoe took the throne, Greece began hemorrhaging money due to the King Consort's undisciplined ways, so it was finally decided that he would be assassinated. Before the assassination could be carried out, however, he unexpectedly became severely ill and perished, thus freeing the nation of its drain on money. From this episode I learned to be very careful about marrying off heirs! At other times events are quite humorous and entertaining, especially with the Sacred and Profane DLC. One specific example: [spoiler]what a pleasant surprise to find the kneeling Prophet Jonah come forth from the chaos of a besieged city, and an even greater delight to see him denounce the wicked ways of the Hittite ruler after he joined the court at Hattusa! Despite his outburst of fiery prophecy, he soon befriended the noble Queen of Hatti, and even served as her grandson's sole tutor. [/spoiler]

Old World offers many options to customize your game-play experience. If you'd like, you can turn off characters and story events entirely and play the game more in the style of Civilization. Event frequency can be also modified. If you want to respond to random events by following your intuition instead of knowing the exact bonuses and penalties in advance, you can enable role playing; and if you really can't stand the outcome, just use the undo button - unless you choose to disable that too. You can decide whether characters tend to live lengthy, standard, or ""realistic"" (i.e. nasty, short, and brutish) lifespans that you can experience in years or in semesters. You can also decide what level of development other civilizations start the game with, so your competitors can start with multiple cities or none. A new, recently added option that takes the game to another level is the ability to customize your starting leader. With this option you can select your first ruler's name, age, sex, family, portrait, archetype, and initial trait. This option alone offers nearly endless variety, although I enjoy playing as the preset leaders too.

Other pros:
[list]
    [*]Excellent music with the option to find and enable/disable specific tracks
    [*]Beautiful graphics
    [*]Well programmed AI that plays reasonably and efficiently at all difficulty levels
    [*]Multiple victory types which cater to a wide variety of play styles
    [*]Historical scenarios involving Carthage and Rome, Greece and Persia (DLC), and more
    [*]Excellent pre-made maps including Imperium Romanum and The Middle East
    [*]The incorporation of historical people, locations, and events, with clickable Wiki links to learn more about real world parallels
[/list]

Downsides:
[list]
    [*]Certain commonly-occurring events can get old after they occur in a dozen different games
    [*]It can be difficult to keep track of characters as a whole, for example trying to find all exiled or imprisoned characters at a glance
[/list]

I own and recommend both DLC's, and I look forward to purchasing more in the future. The devs are active on Discord, where they have personally responded to some of my questions and feedback.

The options to name features is good too. Combat is the right balance of being challenging but not tedious, so it's not stupid like some 4X games (cough cough Humankind) or too easy like in Civ VI. Interactions with other AI players isn't just diplomacy but has personal interactions too. Old World also has enough options to choose a city spot you like balancing between scenic and output, so I don't find myself restarting the game multiple times to find a starting spot I like, like in Civ VI.

Incense is burning and the palm trees are swaying outside your mud-brick ziggaraut.  There are many things occupying your attention... There is a mob gathering in your capital, demanding the temple doors be opened, there is an invasion force massing many miles to the west, your own soldiers are hungry for battle, but your best general recently died and your inexperienced nephew has taken his place. Your step-mother schemes and plots in the shadows of the palace, still resentful that the throne went to you and not your stepbrother. Your late father made many mistakes, and now you must pay for them. Your son has been acting out during his studies... perhaps philosophy was not the best choice for the boy, the army may have knocked some sense into him. But now instead of studying battle planning and logistics, he has taken on a pet monkey that he takes everywhere he goes. It's frankly an embarrasment. You take another bite of your glazed date and look out the stone crenelation at the azure-green river lazily drifting below you, slave barges carrying stone upriver to the monument your father ordered built, it's construction carrying on apace even as the man who ordered its erection lies rotting in the family crypt. He may have ordered it, but YOU will get the credit for its completion... if you live long enough to see it done, that is. 

You are not without friends. Your spymaster is still loyal... building spy networks in far off Egypt. The priest of the pagan religion of your ancestors still loves you as one of the true believers, but your father encouraged the spread of Zoroastrianism, and the followers of Ahura Mahzda are relentless, begging you convert to the new creed. You've thought about it on many occasions, the mystic teachings of Zoroaster resonate deep in your heart, but to convert would be to alienate hundreds of thousands of your most loyal supporters... And then there's your wife: a foreigner from the lands you are now at war with. Your father thought a marriage would strengthen the bonds between your kingdoms, but even he could not foresee the ambition in the hearts of the young. The old king died, and his son and heir bore no love for you, nor his sister, your wife. Though the bonds between husband and wife are unbreakable, your people distrust her immensely, given her heritage. And deep down, you wonder if even you do. Your loyal spymaster surely doesn't. Of course, you've taken a concubine, what ruler doesn't once in a while? And perhaps one of your other generals harbors unrequited feelings for you, bringing complications all its own. But surely your wife understands all this? Surely it wouldn't put her in a foul temper... after all, she was the daughter of a king. She knows what burdens and pleasures come with the crown. At least, she should.

You return to the map laid out before you as the smell of salt and fire gently drifts in through the window, mingling with the incense. The sound of saws and hammers ring out; aural proof of the mighty navy you are constructing in your capital. And you will need it. Your eyes scan the mass of blue in the center of the map. The Carthaginians you're at war with have the strongest navy in the Central Sea, and your fathers army will mean nothing on the water. Scribes and priests, astromancers and astrologers are all scribbling away and consulting the ancient texts, as well as the tea leaves, desperately trying to find a technology that will give you the edge in the coming campaign. Once the sea is taken, the assault on their homeland can begin. 

You trace your finger on the papyri map, drawing a straight line up from the sea. The barbarians in the north are as yet an unknown factor. They could be a great friend, or a powerful enemy. If your son would only lose the pet monkey, perhaps he could be married with the chiefs young daughter, and an alliance could still be struck. With their support a two pronged attack could squeeze the Carthaginian homeland. You close your eyes, a plan forming in your mind. 

People will die no matter the choices you make; but you were prepared for this. You knew from the moment you were born you would be king. Now you need to rule.",1693191804,1693191804,True,25,0,0.726152539253234863,0,True,False,False

It's hard to overstate what RNG can do to you in this game. Your leaders can die, your units can be one-shot, your army can double in size or you can obtain expensive technology for free, your most loyal family members can be abruptly turned against you, your once-safe city swarmed by rebels because of that random tribal foreigner your exiled 20 turns ago. Random events are so supreme and all-powerful that most of the learning curve involves memorizing them and their specific triggers.

That ""one more turn"" addiction in a 4x usually comes from watching your strategies unfold and wanting to see them through, but during the higher difficulty campaigns Old World's random events will constantly flip the table over and force you to scrap your plans for new ones that will soon enough be made obsolete just the same. I've had THREE leaders be killed or exiled in a mere five turns, I've had long peaceful nations whom I'd spent countless resources building a rapport with suddenly declare war on me because my third cousin twice removed shagged their nephew-in-law, I've had my king married to three different 20 year old wives and not produce a single child.

No matter how well you manage these crises the raw volume of dice rolls ensures at least one of them will blow up in your face. After a while you become desensitized to it all and realize you're watching the game play itself.

All that to say: my first 30 hours spent learning and getting deep into this game feel like they've been wasted, with one major caveat: there are ""competitive"" modes with reduced RNG. The AI is not very smart and despite initial appearances the game's mechanics are not very deep or complicated so I'm skeptical this mode has offline value — but maybe I'll try it and be blown away and update this review. 

In the meantime I only see two good ways to approach Old World: get sweaty in competitive multiplayer, or be very casual and play single player to experience it as more of a story generator than a strategy game.

Random Notes: Religion and Tribal Mechanics are cool, but can get annoying if you don't keep them happy. I still don't understand the court specialist roles, I think they just add to your yields in exchange for gold. The lineage and different governmental systems is cool with you being able to play as one line or being able to switch heirs to get better stats (The latter may just be an Assyria trait though) You aren't able to automate workers until you research a certain tech so it might get tedious micromanaging them all.

**Thoughts on the game
To me, Old World feels deeper than the Civilization Series. I definitely had to tone down the difficulty for several sessions until I understood the mechanics well enough. 

The AI overall seems to be pretty competent and doesn't seem to rely on cheating. 

There were small details that showed that the devs care about their game being polished. 

I enjoyed the events and the way character attributes provide benefits makes a big difference in the gameplay. It caused a bit of an ebb and flow to strength. For example, you can have a period with a very good leader and good governors where progress and production is quick. Then as that group ages and dies the new leaders aren't as good potentially causing things to worsen. Of course, it is possible that you have a terrible leader, and they die giving way to a much better one.

Compared to most other games in the genre, the games are shorter, the AI plays better, the matches are less static and predictable, units are more mobile, there's a more diplomacy options, and the pacing is faster.

While the game looks a lot like Civ 5, the gameplay is very different, so the game feels like its own thing rather than a clone. The biggest difference are the characters. I was worried that they would make the game too complicated, but the notification system does a great job of showing your important options each turn, so the system is easier to use than it looks.

The events do a great job of improving the game's atmosphere and making it more varied, without the randomness adding too much of a luck element. The writing and art in the events are top notch.

The only thing I really dislike is the performance. The game runs well at first, but around turn 80, the game starts having slowdown. On around turn 100, the AI turns start taking annoyingly long to play its turns and the FPS gets low enough that the UI can be unresponsive. Thankfully, my games usually end in about 120-140 turns, so the performance is good through most of the matches.

It feels Old World takes the best bits of Civ - and adds much more! Old World also takes some bits of Crusader Kings, but not that deeply. Only the main aspects (families, marry, heir, etc.)

In the strategical layer, Old World feels very good. You don't spam same things in your every city, but you specialize them accordingly based on the family that is controlling the city (science family mainly science stuff, military family military stuff, etc.)

I was surprised how well the end game was done in Old World. You are definetly not supposed to paint the map in higher difficulty at the start of the game, but more like surviving till the end by finishing 10 ambitions (""quests""). You need to make good diplomacy so your rival neighbour doesn't declare war on you. And AI handles diplomacy very well to my mind - it doesn't randomly attack you if you are a friend with them. AI also attacks quite smartly - usually focusing on killing one unit if it's possible.

There are many resources in the game. Some of it stays in the city, but if your city isn't using ""civic"" resource, then it goes to your global pool. So you have to really think about it how you control your cities.

All in all, I would prefer Old World to Civs because it feels more mature and challenging in a patient way. You don't necessarily rush with wars of declarations, but instead you try to make your empire last as long as possible.

Be prepared to struggle at first and even to dislike some of the differences in this game --- initially.  Once you figure this game out, it's competitive, balanced, and addictive.  Just one more turn.

I'm a longtime Civ fan who especially loves playing tall and peacefully, but  also enjoys curb-stomping AI's that mess with me.   Have long looked for that 'Civ killer' that would replace the excitement that Civ VI lost.  This may well be it.  It took me a while, but I find I'm now hooked, and I really look forward to games.  OW is challenging, but not impossible.  It's long and involved, but not too long or involved.  It's light on micromanaging: Specifically, it doesn't have Civ VI's ridiculous tile placement requirements.  Also, the foreign leaders aren't nearly as capricious and illogical as in Civ VI.  Their decisions about when and whether to attack, for example, are fairly sane, rational decisions.  Pretty much, they don't like me.  OK with me, as I don't much like them either.  Less futzing around trying to make them happy right up to the moment that they try to attack.  Oh, and no longer do I have to deal with highly unrealistic border gore and city spamming.  All in all, give it a try... and give it time to grow on you.

Followup after even more time playing: Buy this, try this.  It has proven to be deeper and more engaging than I even suspected.  It has layers of complexity, and I feel like each time I figure one out is like one more layer of an onion, with more fun to come.  Recent discoveries: 

1) The AI is a better fighter than in Civ or similar games.  As in all games, a human can overcome all but the most overwhelming offense, but at least in OW I have to work a bit harder against a more capable foe.

2)  Promotions and generals matter.  You need them, whether playing offensively or defensively.  The AI is good enough that you need to pay attention to your armies' and generals' capabilities, and be sure you have a well-trained, capably led army.  Otherwise, you'll find yourself looking good on paper and by sheer numbers, sort of like the RuZZian army currently in Ukraine, a paper tiger.  I was used to spamming troops when needed in defense but neglecting my defenses a bit.  Can't do that in OW.

3) The family system has finally started to make sense.  At first, it was a bit of a nuisance that I ignored until it became an unavoidable problem.  But now I see that the families are both a challenge and an opportunity.  Used properly, an opportunity to strengthen my empire.  (Used improperly, families can weaken my empire.)  Families are a challenge to manage diplomatically, not a huge one requiring micromanagement, but not something you can just selfishly ignore.  While the diplomacy is nowhere near as deep as, say, CK2 or CK3, it's a worthwhile layer to master.  The sheer number of events that present choices with positive and negative trade-offs means no two games are exactly alike: much less repetitive, and each game can vary depending upon so many different variables, some of which are random.  (I also enjoy that I've seen NO stupid game-destroying random events that cause me to rage quit.)

4)  Diplomacy with foreign leaders is also a bit more nuanced than I'd first thought.  Again, nowhere near like CK games, but more like Civ VI.  At this point, I'm no longer ignoring foreign civs' leaders and their opinions, as I see that being a little flexible and accepting a short term disadvantage can work out better in the long run by keeping powerful neighbors less angry at me.

5) I enjoy the ability to fine-tune Victory Conditions.  I can set these to avoid cheesy outcomes (for me or against me) that I simply don't like (looking at you, Ambitions Victory).  In one game, a weekly scenario, I got lucky, played better, and faced only two foes on a continents map, all at a level below my ability.  Rather than dragging things out to a slog at the end or me just quitting in advance of my inevitable victory, I played to the merciful end: A sort of mercy rule that gives a victory if a player does snowball way ahead of others --- (1/2 the Victory Points & more than double any other player).  Similarly, I enjoy being able to set up in advanced settings how high those victory points need to be.  I don't like the end slog of most 4X games, so I set the points needed for a victory low, which means a more challenging campaign while I scramble to catch up with the AI players and a shorter or no slog once I get ahead.  While I generally don't love point victories in 4X games, the points system in OW does generally seem to reflect which civ is the largest, most advanced.  I haven't tried it yet (I'm not yet good enough), but I'm curious to play a future game where the AI is set up in advanced settings to gang up ruthlessly on any civ that is approaching victory.   That could be even more exciting (nervous about it!). [EDIT: I've now tried that 'ruthless' option in advanced settings.  It made victory more difficult, thus all the sweeter in the end.  Difficult, but hardly impossible.  Basically, it meant AI's were much more likely to declare war on me, and wouldn't make peace.  Realistic.  That's what a good human opponent would do, too.] 


[EDIT: 5 1/2)  I particularly enjoy the fine, detailed granularity of the advanced settings.  I can set up a game that is competitive for me at my level.  Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose.  But I don't end up being bored because victory is either too difficult or too easy.  As said above, while I don't love points victories, I don't think of points as points, but instead as a ranking of the grandeur and achievements and depth/breadth of my empire vs. the others.  That makes point victories really just grandeur victories.  I'm down with that.]

6)  AI players don't overreact to my actions.  Although I prefer building glorious civs/empires, sometimes an opponent needs to be contained or even eliminated militarily.  In other games, when I do this, all the other civs suddenly hate and denounce me and refuse to deal with me for the rest of the game, even though I was often simply forced to respond to dickish moves by the AI I beat.  In OW, taking a city or 2 or 3 is certainly not going to win you friends, but it doesn't make you a pariah forevermore.

I strongly suggest you play the tutorials.  All of them.  If you lose, try again and be prepared to struggle, both to win AND to figure things out.  OW takes a good while before it becomes natural, especially if you're a Civ player.  Once you start to feel somewhat comfortable, try a few short games just to apply what you learned, using the somewhat imperfect in-game encyclopedia.  THEN, armed with some background knowledge, read the User Manual: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hb4dmDKxpf3pJJtpdFA4y4OOY-d2yrz1/view 

The more you play, the more sense the Users Manual will make.  Don't expect to master OW in one go.  It's a journey, not an event.  The fun is in the journey.

Forget surrounding these guys, their units have a completely different movement per turn that your identical units.  Its like playing with someone who always cheats.

Tutorials are bizarre (and timewasting - undoutably designed to get you to waste time - to get you over 2 hours).  Of course you don't find this out until way beyond 2 hours.  Tutorial number 5 for example has you playing all innocent like and enjoying it, and lo one of your tasks is to scout out the enemy without them seeing you.  Now you'd expect it was if one of their units spots you, close up? Yeah.  No, that's not it, a unit doesn't have to spot you, you can be 4 or more points away from their territory, with none of their units in sight and poof, magically your scout is spotted and immediately that's the end of game.  More than four times I tried it to find its utter BS.  It doesn't actually show you that nothing actually spotted you (it doesn't let you see) because it doesn't want you to know its actually totally illogical.

I thought this scouting nonsense meant that if one of their units spotted mine, but no its if any of their territory is highlighted at the end of your turn, meaning its actually completely impossible to tell.  I mean wtf - another instance of the game designed so the AI actually cheats, always.  It tells you everything you need to know if a game is designed, on the easiest level to the hardest, is that the AI cheats as a matter of course.

If a ""game"" is meant to be ""fun"", and this is classed as a game, why is it no fun?  I would suggest something fun like a spreadsheet simulator.  Or a paint drying simulator.

Old civs used to be about wars and battle, not about sitting idly at peace going through a long winded textathon, which this game certainly is.  I wished I'd not wasted the time getting to know how the game works as its set for uninstall.

I'd buy it for a fiver, nothing more.  Like a poorly coded civ knockoff (but not the old ones (Civ <4) that encouraged fighting, the new ones where everything is a chore and you can go through 6000 years without fighting a single battle, then when you do you find the AI is ridiculous (it also knows where all of your units are without actually being able to see them).  If you liked the mindless tedium that was Master of Orion 3, then this game is for you.

At first the dynasty is good, but soon text after text after text becomes so so dull & boring.  Yawn.

I just recently discovered that the game is very addictive too, with tactical layers of city building, slightly random technology development, wars, and most crucially, superb diplomatic game at home and towards foreign powers. Solid DLCs and some of the workshop subscriptions make the game even longer, more replayable and interesting.

In comparison to Humankind, where cultural choices are the most important decision to make, and Civilization, where the cultural/technological card system plays a crucial role, Old World's most important tactical element is the character development of many members of your royal court and aristocratic families supporting you (or not). This adds a whole new level of complexity and strategy to the game, which I find both challenging and rewarding. If you like high-quality turn-based strategies with plenty of constant and very consequential decision making, then I highly recommend Old World. Basically, Civ, Humankind, and Old World are the turn-based holy trinity right now and as an expert, you need to master all three of them.

I really like the amount of options available when setting up a new game as well as it allows you to play multiple ways to keep things fresh.

The family dynamics seem really well thought out and while not overly complex they do provide enough engagement that your decisions do seem to make a difference in game and no single game will play the same way.

The devs are supporting the game with various updates, improvements, and additional content. The attention to detail in this game is amazing. The individual characters feel unique. In my first game, Queen Dido married someone with the ""Romantic"" character trait and with each of the events in the first few years and options for how to respond it felt like a romantic movie playing out in the game between the two (mostly based on the decisions I made for the ruler). There were three back-to-back decisions I had to make for the queen in how she responded. There were lots of options, intentional decisions, and also guesses, but also random events that prompt you to make decisions that sometimes you do not have much control over (which made the game more realistic, to an extent). It's  fun to see how each of the characters interact with each other and you have just enough influence on the ruler's decisions that you can steer things in a certain direction but sometimes things don't turn out the way you hoped (maybe another character starts trouble, for example, you weren't expecting or you lost track of a random minor noble who starting talking with another nation's courtier that then affects your standing in their court) and sometimes they do any number of other things that affect your ruler and nation or individual characters for better or worse. It's detailed, rich content, not always predictable, though characters' opinion of your leader is a good indicator of which characters to keep an eye on and maybe have a courtier send them a gift or intercede on your ruler's behalf to put in a good word. 

This game is very dynamic and throws in lots of different events that can completely shift your strategy. My second and third games were very different. For one thing, I had different starting characters (I played with a different nation each of my first three games) with a different inheritance law enacted (e.g., seniority primogeniture, or absolute cognatic primogeniture, for example). But even if I didn't, there are so many different ways the games would have been different (leader character traits, for example, random at the start of each game). In one of the games, there was an event that gave me several decisions, one of which was to change the inheritance law (which I decided to do) so this changed things in that game quickly. There are a lot of other examples, but that gets the idea across that no two games are the same.

The ruler, their spouse(s), heir(s), the court, appointing ministers, influencing individual characters (the rulers, house leaders, governors, generals, diplomats, chancellor, courtiers, etc., your ruler's children growing up and all the decisions that go into that, who the nobles marry, random events that affect character's traits (there are a lot!), health, wisdom, courage, and on and on the details go. It's got a lot of depth, dynamics, and complexity. The diplomacy feels really well integrated into everything; again, each character is unique and the way they interact is great to interact with in the details.

This game was made by a former Civ dev. One of it's biggest selling points is that while Civ was always a singleplayer game with multiplayer tacked on as almost an afterthought, this was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind. As such, it is more balanced and a more rewarding multiplayer experience as a result.

It has light elements of Crusader Kings in it, with regards to managing your dynasty, having characters which impact your empire, as well as random events. If you come from CK, you need to know right away that it's not as in depth in this aspect.

Warfare is more heavily emphasised compared to Civ. Not only is warfare much better balanced and nuanced, the nature of how settlements work and how there are barbarian tribes which are often an obstacle to your expansion, mean that you will be doing a fair amount of warfare, and having a solid standing army is important. You can still play peacefully, but if your military does not keep up, you will be rolled by any opponent who is looking for a fight.

Speaking of Barbarians, they're actually a much better integrated and interesting part of the game, and this is reflective of better AI in general. Opponents, both AI players and Barbarians, will put up a solid fight, compared to Civ where militarily they were punching bags who could only win if you were bad or playing at extreme difficulty levels where they had near infinite resources.

It may not yet have the depth of content as Civ, but I can confidently say it was built with multiplayer and balance in mind, with mechanics to support that. As such if you're someone interested in a better multiplayer experience, or someone looking for more solid AI to challenge them in singleplayer, you should definitely give this a go.",1688440842,1688440915,True,18,0,0.680838167667388916,0,True,False,False

This to me is more fun than the recent Civs and more intuitive than Crusader Kings, and it just so happens to combine what I like from both of the games. 

Dynasty builder? Check. Historically accurate emergent storytelling? Check (and it's leagues better than CK's tongue-in-cheek version). City-building, resource balancing, war? Check, check, check. 

It still has a few things I nitpick about the strategy genre in general: moving around armies is boring. I mean if you like war games (I don't), it's prolly not tedious, but I just get bored of not being able to mass-move my armies. Same thing with traversing over water. The anchorage system is not intuitive and is a bit more of a chore, but it creates more strategy than the standard ""pile your guys in a boat."" Still, I prefer CK3's streamlined hey-your-unit-turns-into-a-boat-and-you're-good-to-go.

The ""undo move"" button is an absolute blessing so I don't have to load a scum-save when I accidentally click the wrong way.

It's not Civ and it's not CK, even though that's how it gets described. This is a pure design, with many elements from Civ4 now fully fleshed out and running flawlessly. That care in design itself makes the game one of the most immersive I've played in quite a while. I hesitated at first on trying it out, but after Victoria 3 kinda imploded with the recent DLC (and I have hopes that game gets better over time), I felt I should give Old World a try. I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS GAME!

It's sad that it's not getting the play and attention that the Big Names of 4K/Grand Strategy are getting, because it's a masterpiece. I've been playing games like this since before there were PCs, back in 1976, and I know a great game design. This is it.

If you came to this page out of interest in Civ/4x or Crusader Kings type games, stop right now and [b]DOWNLOAD THE DEMO. PLEASE[/b] at least give this a try, it is my honest opinion that this game is being slept on by many who would love it and that makes me sad.

For reference - experienced Civ gamer since III, never played Crusader Kings but have played modded Civ games with events before. I believe this game to be something of a love letter to the 4x genre - most every mechanic that annoys you about 4x games has been attempted to be reworked/re-balanced here and it is so strategically satisfying.

The 200 year span might be a turnoff to some, I know it was (initially) to me who has always been drawn to the appeal of playing a full scope of history. In a perfect world, this game gets expanded somehow to offer more of the same great gameplay on an even grander scale (imo). But this is the the real world, and what this means is the devs (led by industry veteran Soren Johnson, who knows all the best and worst parts of the 4x genre) were able to hyper focus on one era of history and make it incredibly fleshed out and balanced. These devs are very literally aware that, if not properly balanced, players will optimize the fun out of a game/mechanic, and the game design shows.

I could say so much about this game and am starting to get wordy, so a list:

[b]PROS[/b]:
[b]Character system[/b] - feels more like moving through history and improves variability/replayability
[b]Order system[/b] - annoyed me until I got the hang of balancing resources, but KEY in preventing things from feeling bogged down especially late game
[b]Well-balanced resources[/b] - There is never a game where production, food, science alone is key. Your empire needs several resources to grow and expand, and your needs will change as the map/events unfold around you. No easy fix if you completely neglect a resource
[b]Granular production[/b] - There is no single hammer/shield resource to 'build stuff', military needs training production, projects/specialist needs civics production, settlers/builders need growth production. Strategical improvement over other 4x
[b]Undo button[/b] - LOVE this as QoL for any 4x game really, but especially this game with the inter-working resources/mechanics and more importantly order system
[b]Good AI[/b] - imo I don't find Civ 5 or 6 challenging on the highest setting unless I mod the difficulty further, but no such issue with Old World. Difficulty is both very granular (big win! won't complain for even more though) and puts up a good fight as the mechanics/orders are well balanced (preventing player cheese) and the AI can be VERY dangerous on the battlefield
[b]Many more I won't enumerate now, but maybe I come back and expand on this[/b]

[b]MIXED[/b]:
[b]Combat[/b] - Personally, I find it much improved over Civ as the AI puts up a challenge, you WILL need to maintain an army, characters/generals MATTER, and units feel very mobile. However, the unit mobility can be jarring for some used to the easy Civ combat from AI players, and the AI can wipe you out with units you didn't even see if you haven't scouted.

I find this a fun, welcome challenge but I suppose it's not for everybody. More interesting to me is the decision to make combat offense-only - you do not deal damage as a defender without special promotions. I still have mixed feelings about that piece (especially since units are so mobile), so in this category it goes.

[b]CONS[/b]:
[b]Limited nations[/b] - There are 8 currently, so you get most of the same AIs in every game. Not a dealbreaker especially with the character/event system, but I would like more variety
[b]Smaller community/mod scene[/b] - This is a nitpick and nothing to do with the game itself, but if you're coming from Civ you won't see the same robust mod pool and community content as the game is smaller and less-known, but it does exist


Really, a giant thank you to Soren and the team if anyone reads this. I truly hope a lot of the philosophy/design decisions are incorporated into the 4x genre for years to come. Please try this game.",1687897319,1687898051,True,134,1,0.906486392021179199,0,True,False,False

-A rival family started turning my child and heir against me in a chain of events
-I traded honey to Rome and finally got them on friendly status, improving diplomacy and trade between our nations. One turn later and their leader died, with their heir being not so friendly towards me anymore
-I held Greek paganism as my state religion, but with the rise of Judaism and Christianity in my cities, there were only so many turns and events I could take until I finally grew tolerant to the other faiths; juggling all these interests at once actually wore me down as a player

Like- I have never been more immersed in a game. In a perfect world this franchise would take over as head of all civ games, and hopefully we see more development, nations, etc. All I know is I'm loyal for lifeeee.

Edit: And another event that occurred that just...pure madness in Rome.
-A rival family didn't like my leader, and began plotting. They assassinated my leader, and their heir took the throne. My heir was hellbent on avenging his mother's death, and relentlessly pursued the initial plotter. Well, their family didn't like that, and another member plotted against my current leader, and- you guessed it, they got assassinated.

Where its similar to CK is its role-playing. Its not as in-depth as CK but it is still deep compared to other games in the 4x genre. There are plenty of text events like CK that feel reactionary to your decisions. It has that 'roll with the punches' vibe that CK has where 'bad things' throwing off your long-term plans are part of the fun. Like grooming the perfect heir with military traits to play one way only for a successful coup to place your unheard of scheming nephew who was aided by your sister who you snubbed once as a child and thought nothing of it but turns out she held a lifetime grudge and woah turns out the usurper is actually a good leader and now your playing the game way differently than you planned but its still works kind of fun. A small but significant difference is there are no inheritable traits like in CK. On one hand its kinda a bummer but on the other its a little ridiculous how valuable inheritable traits are. It kinda ruins the immersiveness when every playthrough involves a medieval breeding program... In Old World, aside from producing children, marriages are just used for improving internal or foreign relationships and gaining a specific type of governor/general.

Where its similar to some Civ games is its turn based, hex grid, city and tile management. These are all comparable in quality though its closer to Civ 4 than 6 which was my favorite Civ game anyway so its a win for me. The combat is where it completely beats Civ though. The order system in Old World allows for combat to happen quicker as opposed to the meme worthy hundreds of years it takes to move your armies in Civ games. Scouts and vision are important in any strategy game, but in Old World its especially important as whole armies can seemingly appear from thin air by using multiple orders on a single military unit to move it multiple times in one turn. Though this comes at a cost, as orders are used between military units, worker units, and political interactions such as educating a child or negotiating peace (which takes 2 turns too!). Managing orders is a fun mechanic and it even helps the late game micromanagement bloat that Civ suffers from (though orders are a resource you can increase quite a bit).

I play CK3 when I want a deep role-playing strategy game. But if I want a turn-based 4x game I choose Old World over Civilization now. This is my favorite era as well in Civilization, and Old World feels like a marathan length Civ game focused just on this time period. This game deserves way more attention, its a 10/10 for me.

As a strategy, it is better than  what modern civ has to offer (although it is not a high standard) and has a lot of original ideas like different types of leaders, order system etc. This is what I expected Humankind to be. 

Here are the +:

+It  solves long-term problems of Civlization 5-6  which I am already sick of such as  having only one type of production (as a result in civ if you do not have hills/production related resources you are pretty much screwed, since you cannot produce anything). In Old World, there are different types of points for different units and you can establish production of  specific units anywhere you want, you just need buildings. 

+You are not super reliant on landscape although some kingdoms might do better with particular types of resources, like Persia will benefit from pastures etc. Some places are better than others but it is not as drastic as in the case of civ or even endless legends. 

+ It also prevents the issue of the player being overloaded by the amount of micro control thanks to its order system. In Paradox and Civ games you need to make dozens of actions per minute to stay somewhat competetive instead of actually thinking strategically.

+ The game is also quite dynamic  in a sense that you can lose  or regain your top position thanks to character system, although it might be a bit random , so if you have 100 % competetive mindset, it might piss you off.   

+ Rather  good combat system, the AI even builds fortifications  which is unheard of.

+  Solid AI which does things that make sense most of the time,   if you compare it to  civ , it is  pretty much Hannibal Barca  of 4x games.

The issues:

- Trade system is rather convoluted , feels unimpactful and extremely reactive , also it  does not have actual caravans going between the cities which is a great miss in my opinion. You cannot raid caravans of a  trading nation, you cannot pirate, you cannot establish your own trade route. Civ 5 is way  better in this regard (sorry for such a vulgar comparison)

-  Underwhelming music

+- It does not have as much content as bigger competitors but it is on the decent  level. You will have enough to deal with and not feel bored but do not expect the epicness of Paradox or endless hoards of gimmicks in civ.

But old world has serious balance issues.  It appears as if it has good flexibility of the settings, but when you get into it, not really.  For example, the volume of events is off by 2 levels:  the default setting of moderate events, is overwhelming.  You will spend close to 1/2 of your turn reading the fine print of 6 or so important dialogs, that will often put you in war if you don't read them carefully.  That can be lowered to what someone refers to as ""minimal"", of which I seriously disagree with.
And perhaps it is the nature of the events, how you are forced into bad positions, just to preserve your hard earned orders.  I get it, it is to simulate the old world, I just find it more frustrating than interesting.
To that point, the tech tree:
They have an ""interesting"" card system, that means you draw 4 cards and select from those which tech you are researching.  Which means you can only choose from 1/2 of the real options.  So 1/2 the time, you can't research the tech you want.  Which means you will be more flat, instead of researching to advanced techs to get a real advantage.  Which I get, is to make it more interesting.  But again, I just find it frustrating.  I want axes, I have the iron all stocked up, ready to go.  But the techs to get there just don't come up.
Overall disappointed again.  really looking forward to the developer who can get the hex map limited stack of units combat system to work really well in a turn based 4x game.

I am disappointed in this one. It has the shell of an older Civilization game with a husk of a Crusader Kings game. It does not excel at either, rather it patches pieces of them together to form a disfigured amalgam.

Gameplay
-There are only specific locations on the map that you can settle your cities. You cannot settle where ever you want like in the Civ games.
-The units such as warriors and workers are essentially civ clones.
-There are no internal buildings for a city, only projects.
-The dynastic features are OK... but very limited. You have a lineage to consider but has very little depth of play when compared to other dynastic games.

Graphics
-The visuals are outdated and similar to an older civ game from several years back.

One of the best 4x of all time. Great AI (as far as these things go), interesting mechanics, good music.

Unfortunately the game does have pretty poor performance, but apart from that I am pretty disappointed in how misunderstood the game is, both by the steam legions and ""professional"" reviewers.

No it is not ""ck2 + civilization"". It takes ideas from both, but is its own, incredibly cohesive, system. It also handles many flaws present in most 4x. For example the game does a great job of creating an immersive narrative. This extends even to games youre losing. The narrative gives a reason to continue, even when victory is unlikely, unlike in civilisation. 

Some comments are saying that the events are tedious and meaningless. I dont really get where that is coming from. Events tend to be legitimately difficult decisions with pros and cons that require careful weighing. To be fair that in and of itself can feel tedious, as you really can often walk away with a feeling of annoyance due to all options pissing you off in one way or another. But thats precisely what the game is trying to do, make you feel like a ruler.

There is a distinct euro-board game feel to the resource management in the game but it meshes so well with the event system that it rarely interferes with the immersion that this game does so well at.

I wish the game would do better sales wise, as I can only imagine the amazing mods the community could come up with. Dune in particular springs to mind.

The Orders System: no more stupid 2 hex moves inching across the map. You can actually make long tactical sweeps depending on the situation, thanks to an overall orders system. But each unit has fatigue so can only move so far unless you spend other military currency. 

Diplomacy. Seems to have more options and balances. You are not only managing 3 noble families in your civilization but also the opinion of other nations. You can only do certain actions when you have a high enough opinion. The council and jobs are nice and Crusader Kings like but streamlined in a nice way.

Building. Building is awesome. It's the old Civ4 way of doing it where your builder is there and that's it. You don't just lose him after three builds like civ6. Nice adjacency modifiers and variety.

Graphics. It's perfect. Perfect texture, perfect colour, everything perfect. And it runs amazing. I'm getting no stutter and each turn takes 2 seconds to load. Even up to turn 100. That's on a Asus 3700x 16gb ram for reference.

Because the characters at your court (including your ruler) modify your resources output, and the random events that affect these characters, means that each game will play out slightly differently.  

At higher difficulties, be prepared for a challenge. Not primarily because AI gets stats boost, but because the AI actually knows how to play the game

The game tends to skew alittle towards using war to win the game. Not a negative, just something to be aware of.
Even if you want to play a peaceful game, where you dont declare war, it is important to have a strong military, so that you wont get obliterated at the first few turns of war being declared. Realistic, in a sense.

- The complexity of the family system keeps things fresh and adds a very much needed layer of difficulty. 
- The religious system is thought out and can be actually useful.

The dynasty mechanics and events are cool features that should be in all games of this sort, and they are done pretty well. After a couple of short games, the events became repetitive, though. More are needed to keep each play through feeling distinct.

The diplomacy is just meh. It really needs something more to keep this aspect of the game interesting. The events interconnect with diplomacy to add a little flavor, but they don't really matter or change things overly much. It just feels flat.

Overall, the game is just different enough to be interesting, similar enough to be easily picked up, yet it still feels like its missing something. It can get a bit boring pretty quickly reminding me of Civ V before all the DLC - once the big DLC came out, eventually Civ V became great.

Giving this a thumbs up, but would prefer something neutral. It does enough differently and is a well made game. It just feels like it's missing something to make it the sort of game I would play again and again.

The only thing you can do is marriage your heir, select governors from a list, select general, and send missions to keep everyone happy (family, other countries) or to do some spionage.

More points:
They try to do new things. New buildings and city management. It is ok!
Now you have 'orders', It is like a limited number or moves and attacks, I think it is for balancing the game, but it has problems, like other review points out: in a war against two it is impossible.
In this game is very easy lost armies, So why bother to set a name and grow in buffs?

After 2000 hours gameplay and maintenance for the Faith aspect, it's harder to get my grips on all those different beliefs, and families and playing as Carthage also the Tribes.

- Order system and movement: Most of the units on the map use ""order points"" to make any kind of action, you get a non-storable amount of orders per turn for your whole empire (these can can be increased), your units movements use 1 orders to gain 3 to 4 movements depending on the unit. a unit however, can use up to 3 orders per turn, meaning that you can move about 9 tiles with a single unit. There's more, you (and the IA) can ""force march"" to reset all movement points and get a movement point equivalent of 3 more orders, meaning a unit can potentially move over 18 tiles in a single turn...
All that means that enemy units can come across huge distants to yoink one of your weaker units... you can pretty much paint the rest of the picture from here...
- Aging system + political: All characters play a big role on your society and you need to pay lots of attention to them as they can have great influence over the overall income of your society. One issue arise though: 1 turn = 1 year, meaning that all that huge political system gets rehashed with new figures constantly, and it gets tiring REALLY fast...
- City founding: Feels great when you find the perfect spot for a city in a civ game, right? Feel no more, as this game has prefixed founding sites...

Each turn you have finite amount of moves you can make which really makes you think and prioritize what is important.

- Embedded Tooltips: 
Makes for a fantastic UI.

- Limited City Sites Location: 
Takes away from the intense min-maxing of similar games where cities must be placed perfectly so that every square millimeter of land is exploited to its fullest. I much prefer this style of expansion which leads to more natural city placements. 

- Tile Improvements: 
This is akin to the Civ 6 system, but actually done right. You can either make urban or rural improvements, with most urban ones having the requirement to be placed adjacent to two other urban tiles. Very interesting decisions to be made as you need to consider future placement of later urban improvements (as well as adjacency bonuses) coming from future techs. Making too many rural improvements near the core of your city can lead to constricting your urban space. The best part of this system is that improvements automatically provide their yields. This system is dissimilar to Civ 6 where a citizen is needed to get yields, which in my opinion, places too much importance on growth to make cities feel useful.

- Boarder Expansion: 
Your cities have unlimited potential when it comes to boarder expansion. You can expand your boarder as much as you like by making an improvement on the edge and having a specialist work it. This makes for OCC (one city challenge) gameplay much more interesting as you can have a giga city nation.

- Tech Card System: 
Like in Stellaris, you get a random selection of available techs to choose from, but there is actually a tech tree and techs unlock special one-time projects granting free resources or units. These need to be undertaken immediately once they show up as a tech option or are lost forever.

- Characters: 
I usually dislike games that have many people (personalities/stats) and events to manage (like some of Paradox's games) because of the tedium involved. However, I'm once again impressed that Old World manages to get this right. Although there are many characters, you (the player) play as the leader of your civilization, so you mostly need to account for your own stats which affect global yields (and to an extend those of your Court, but in a lesser way). If you are not interested in reading events every turn, you can avoid it by simply hovering over the choices - this shows you exactly what impact, gameplay wise, your choice will have. E.g. if your leader gets to choose between bumping his Discipline +1 or Wisdom +1, you will see exactly what that provides such as X increase to money per turn for Discipline or X increase to science for Wisdom.

- Cognomen: 
As your leader accomplishes goals, the greater his title becomes bestowing you with commensurate rewards. Slay many military units in battle, your leader will become known as NAME, ""The Warrior"", or build many improvements/Wonders and become ""The Architect"".

- Victory Conditions: 
You can always win the game in the traditional way of conquering the other nations, but Old World offers interesting alternatives. Inspired by modern ""Euro"" style boardgames, you can win the game by reaching enough victory points which requires building culturally strong cities and wonders, or researching repeatable end game techs. The other way involves accomplishing 10 ambitions which are random goals (such as ""found four cities"" or ""kill 10 military units""). These are provided to you periodically via events and become more challenging the farther you are in the game.",1677970822,1677970822,True,21,0,0.721488356590270996,0,True,False,False

This game is mechanically richer in several ways, which has its downsides. Many concepts are especially vague at first, and you're flooded with them right from the first 3 turns. What are experience points doing for my leader? I really have to deal with arranging marriages & grooming a dynasty? Will making my leader a governor cause me to lose their leadership perks? There's other families running my cities, and their opinion of me matters how?

But some of the key concepts of the game are staggeringly new, simple, and refreshing! The orders mechanic is really making me rethink my unit production.
The game now feels a lot more deliberate -- guns vs butter isn't just a matter of moving sliders, it's a day-to-day choice on how you want to issue out your precious orders. Telling a city whether to build a worker or a warrior feels so thoughtful -- will you even be able to boss around what you've produced?

Obviously, there's a huge difference from Sid Meier's Civilization that won't be for everyone. This game is solidly set just past the iron age, and guards its era jealously. You won't see your nation progress through the ages in this game, and you'll miss out on ever seeing the hilarious occasion where an lucky bronze-age spearman defeats a Challenger-class tank.

1) I want to build and manage some kind of big, somewhat self-sustaining city/colony/business/what-have-you

2) I want to roleplay Machiavelli's Prince, being a sneaky cutthroat, spreading lies, and generally being the reason people hate politicians.

I've found lots of games that do one, but not the other, [i]Civilization[/i] is always good for watching your influence grow, but diplomacy is basically a numbers game. I tried Crusader Kings 3 on Gamepass which gets good marks for it's character stories, but once I got through that game's tutorial I was completely lost at what to actually [i]do[/i], so when I saw that [i]Old World[/i] combines both, I was instantly intrigued. What I got what not only what I wanted, but so much more and solves a lot of issues with the long-standing [i]Civilization[/i] formula.

To start with, my favorite thing about [i]Old World[/i] is that every turn [i]matters[/i]. This isn't like CIV where you're just idly clicking through the ""next turn"" button waiting for something to happen. You have a finite number of orders you can give to your units and you can't just do everything with every unit. Units in general move a lot farther in one turn than in CIV too, so while you still have the benefits of ""one unit per tile"" in combat, you don't get nearly as much of the congestion or traffic jams that system can cause. The difference that these changes alone make is incredible, and even previously boring units such as Scouts are fun to engage with, as scouts can not only harvest resources while out on their journeys, but you get more influence (which leads to more orders) for discovering more of the world before your rivals. Later on, scouts can also set up spy networks which work and play out much more organically than collecting a nebulous amount of ""Spy Points"" and using them for things like in [i]Civilization[/i].

The cities themselves have always been my favorite part of CIV and since you have fewer of them, managing them becomes a much bigger part of [i]Old World[/i]. You can only start cities at certain sites, so land is tight and racing for those precious sites actually encourages you to go wide early instead of messing around with one and building out later. Instead of assigning workers to a tile and working it for that tile's yields, any yield within a city is harvested, which avoids the problem CIV cities can have of having a bunch of good improvements, but nobody to harvest them. If you build an improvement, you just get that bonus, but you can still add a specialist to get even more from it. The end effect of this is that cities are actually fun to expand and you don't have that CIV issue of a city becoming too unwieldy or slipping out of your control. If you end to boost a particular resource, there are short-term projects that can give you a permanent boost, and in generally it feels like you're far less ""locked-in"" to one purpose than in CIV and can pivot if you need too. My favorite CIV game for Citybuilding was [i]CIvilization 4[/i] and given that [i]Old World[/i] has the same lead designer, it makes sense that it feels a lot like [i]Civ 4[/i] city management but with the rough edges smoothed out.

Yet the complexity that may have been smoothed out of cities has been added in the characters and politics system and this is where [i]Old World[/i] really starts to stand out from the crowd. You've got a whole kingdom of actual characters, and their opinions and personality traits will affect not only your yields, but also a variety of events that can shape your kingdom, and this is where you need to maintain things so you don't start slipping. Do you share the same religion with this person? The same ideas? Have something they want? Will you spread lies about someone or execute a potential rival? DId you hear about this guy who's scheming against you but if you execute him you'll annoy this family and they'll start sowing unrest in your city... it's massive. I haven't even begun to fathom the full implications of the character system, but it's juicy stuff to think about, and doing something morally abhorrent for that sweet, sweet research yield is just the kind of cutthroat politicking I was itching for. Depending on your actions, random story events can also occur and the outcomes of these can have pretty huge implications on what kind of resources you get, and it's nice that the roleplaying element can have just as big an impact on your outcome as the number-crunching, city-building, and war-waging.

Beyond that there's a ton of smaller aspects that are just refreshing. The fact that the techs available to you at any one time are randomized to an extent may ruffle some hardcore gamer's feathers, but I feel like it does a great job at mitigating dominant strategies. There is no ""well you always want to take [i]this[/i] first or you'll get behind"", you just have to look at your situation in the moment and try to decide what's best. The combat is also a blast, it's been described as being chess-like and I definitely feel that, as things like positioning and the direction you attack from can make a big difference on your outcome.

The fact that the game's scope is limited to a fairly narrow range also has some benefits. While you don't get the same awe-inspiring epic of mankind's ascent from the caves into the stars as in [i]Civilization[/i], I've always found my aesthetic interest in any given [i]Civ[/i] match tends to drop off around the time my guys start wearing WWII uniforms. There's also a gameplay benefit to this however, which is that you don't have to bankrupt yourself updating your army or worry about your massive horde of troops suddenly being outmoded. There are unit upgrades, but they're all pretty reasonable and accessible, and even the earlier units seem to retain some usefulness.

Visually, the game also looks better than Civ 5 or 6 ever did, which might be an unfair comparison since both games are quite old now, but it's nice to look at while still having that historic style. That the soundtrack was nominated for a Grammy should say it all, Christopher Tin of Civ 4's [i]Baba Yetu [/i] fame is back and while none of the tracks have the [i]massive[/i] heft of that classic, it's all great stuff that fits the mood beautifully. At one point I heard this violin piece during a rather heated battle and I thought ""Wow, that sounds a lot like [i]Pruit Igoe and Prophecies[/i] and sure enough I mouse over the music player and it's a [i]different[/i] piece of music but by the [i]actual[/i] Philip Glass which kind of blew my mind.

[i]Old World[/i] is the real deal. While I don't have the most experience with the 4X genre outside of CIV and I've never been particularly good at these games, I know what kinds of things I enjoy and [i]Old World[/i] provides those things while trimming, streamlining, or otherwise improving areas that were tedious or un-fun in [i]Civlization[/i]. I [i]really[/i] hope this game catches on, I fear it's Epic exclusivity may have hurt it, but hopefully that period was enough to work out the kinks and it can grow a devoted fanbase on Steam. I completely agree with the critics saying this should be the next evolution in 4X and I hope we can see more out of [i]Old World[/i] for years to come.",1677096307,1677096307,True,17,0,0.695404350757598877,0,True,False,False

Though initially it seems heavily disguised as a version of Civ, it quickly distinguishes itself with its various systems - including the way its resources work and orders.  These systems, once you get used to them, just seem to make heaps of sense.  The diplomacy is a great leap forward in this game also.  

On top of this, it is the year-by-year growth and development of your leader, your council and your governors that truly make this game stand out.  When leaders last, they can exact great change as their skills and characteristics develop.  In reflection of real life: some of your leaders you love, and some you can't wait to lose.  Playing Egypt, my old leader's 5 year-old daughter took the throne.  Surviving a coup attempt from her uncle she became my greatest leader, governing for around 50 years (turns) and overseeing my greatest period of growth and development.  I felt proud to throw her a parade when she died.  Her son died only five years later from disease.  Two new leaders in such a short span suddenly added layers of political change and challenge to the game.  It was fantastic.  This is something you never get from Civ.

I think I found it.  This game is worth your time.

I'm one of those players that finds the ancient and classical eras the most enjoyable. 
With this game well focused on that time span, progress feels natural and well paced as a result of not having to cram too many eras in to a single game.

While battles are a bit different, and there are some behaviors I might like to see tweaked, I can't put my finger on what those tweaks would be.  You get used to how battles break down (or triumph)  This isn't one of those games where your army gets out unscathed.   

Even the weakest units have surprising effect for a decent amount of time.

Okay, I slept on this game for a long while because honestly I loathe the epic store exclusivity thing. But in my heart I knew these developers were quality and I'd massively enjoyed their previous stuff (like Offworld Trading Company) and I had a lot of respect for the thoughtful development approach by the designers and transparency of intentions in trying to improve the civilisation game formula. 

The Old World is an amazing gem of a game. Something that immediately strikes is the depth of thoughtful quality in the UI and the creative iterations on the 4x strategy concept. It oozes polish and has immense confidence in the historical period its portraying. 

Essentially its the ancient world from the rise of Babylon and Egypt and powers of the Mediterranean and Middle East up to the heights of Greek and middle Roman civilisation. Its based in a very definite historical theme but with the emergent storytelling variety of paradox games (crusader kings etc) you have family politics and events, internal national scheming and a range of historical and thematic personalities involved in building your power base and ambitions. It all hangs together incredibly well. 

Its also a masterclass in dealing with typical 4x game annoyances and weaknesses. Everything is worthwhile, it doesn't punish you with negative modifiers and fiddly debuffs - but does award thought play and positioning and clever usage of limited resources. 

The orders system for example is fantastic - regardless of how big your empire might grow you have a limited number of orders to use on a turn and can use them as you please (between military movement, civil organisation, family politics, negotiations or whatever.) You can even use the same units multiple times with force marches and emergency actions etc. 

Similar brilliant innovation with the cities and improvement building concepts - cities can specialise to producing growth, training or civil based resources that are great at making the relevant type of units - workers build stuff on larger map independent of the city build queues, and governors have significant impacts on the stuff you can based on personality and family politics and all kinds of events and specialisation.

The military system is back to the 1 unit per hex system of older civilisations - but the specific focus on the ancient world means each of the units is a lot more flavourful and have abilities abstracted out onto the wider battle map. (Spear units do damage to one unit and the unit behind) Cavalry and Chariots can rout targets and get multiple attacks when they overrun. Artillery (catapults etc) do AOE attacks. Each of the couple of dozen discrete units do interesting things in the combat metagame and the unit classes remain relevant through the time period of the game. 

Its incredibly deep and yet straightforward to manage. It plays brilliantly and in my opinion is far superior to the basic gameplay of recent civilisation titles.  

And the payoff is that multiplayer works incredibly too. Because of the thoughtful design and limits on micromanagement through the order system - it never becomes too complicated and cumbersome. Simultaneous network or server play works splendidly - pbem by cloud server works flawlessly - and the win conditions and map generation are thoughtful and atmospheric. 

I could write a lot more but this is an absolute gem of a game still in active development and support from the developers. 

(We had an issue with a bug stopping our simultaneous dedicated server game after a patch for example. One of our players asked for help from the devs on their discord and they worked with him to discover the issue and then rolled out a mini patch 8 hours later to let us continue with our game. - that's pretty impressive commitment tbh!)

In conclusion. 

This is an incredible game. Its brilliantly written, has a wealth of interesting historical anecdote and storytelling - and develops some genuine innovation on the civilisation formula. 

TLDR is gonna be a cross between civilisation and crusader kings 2 set in the ancient world by devs that obviously dig the historical epics of Christian Cameron (Long War, Tyrant etc.) and its been developed with beautiful attention to detail and a robust and capable multiplayer infrastructure. PVP is not an afterthought bolted on to a single player game - but clearly developed from the beginning as a fully realised and integrated part of the experience.

It's fiddly, and it has a lot of moving parts. It doesn't exactly hide things from you, but it's easy to miss that something is there. For example, the tutorials teach you to use your King's ""influence"" action on members of your court to improve their opinion of your king, but I didn't realize you could use Influence missions directly on foreign kings until I'd finished 5 games.

The game has two main parts: city building / empire building, and managing members of your court. Court members provide passive bonuses just for having stats, and they improve city output and military unit performance if they're assigned as governors or generals. They also influence random events that come up fairly frequently, usually several per turn.  Some events only come up if a court member has a particular trait or a high-enough stat, like 2+ Wisdom.

City development mostly takes place on the map, by using Workers to improve tiles. Cities have very few improvements that are inside the city dialog, like city walls and a treasury. Cities mostly build military units or train Specialists to work in improved city tiles, like Farmers, Miners, Poets, and Officers.

Unlike most Civ games, you can only build cities on certain very specific tiles. The early game is largely about grabbing these city sites. Some of which are going to be occupied by Barbarians to tribes which you'll have to defeat before you can use the city site.

City building isn't that complex. Most of the complexity of the game comes from managing the characters, and the events that pop up each turn. The events can feel random, but they're heavily dependent on circumstances. For example, if a neighbor has a stronger military than you, sooner or later you're going to get an event where they demand tribute. If a court member has the ""Plotting Against You"" status, sooner or later you're going to get a coup or assassination event.

You have to be pretty active diplomatically to keep your neighbors from attacking. This means regularly marrying foreign nobles, sending trade missions to them, and influence missions.

The game has a variety of resources, including money, food, growth, iron, stone, wood, civics, training, and orders. There's enough going on that it can be quite overwhelming when you're first learning the game.

The most obvious new concept is orders. This is a lot like having a limited number of actions in a board game. Most things you do have an order cost. In particular, moving military units around costs orders, so no matter how large your army, you generally can only move a fraction of it each turn. A war can be a huge drag on your empire's development because you don't have enough orders left over to move workers around or take political actions.

Combat can feel pretty screwy, because each unit, even infantry, can move long distances each turn. There's no real concept of a ""back line"" protecting your ranged troops, because a determined melee unit can usually run around your battle line and attack units in the rear. Combat's usually about groups of 3-4 units concentrating attacks on a single target to kill it, so it can feel pretty chaotic and un-intuitive.

As I said, the learning curve is steep, and that can lead to frustration. I don't think I really starting enjoying the game until I'd put about 20 hours into it, mainly because I kept getting blindsided by the mechanics.",1676067129,1676067129,True,2,0,0.539380431175231934,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros:[/b] This game is awesome. Buy it. They truly love the historical 4X genre and play tested their game.

[b]Characters\RPG:[/b] The character and event mechanics add so much flavor and uniqueness to each run I can't imagine not having them now. Your choices directly shape your empire over time as those character's abilities really affect global stats. Going for domination? Then send every generation to tactics training and choose bold options in events. You can add generals to your veteran units that you've molded for decades which really invests you in each battle. Or, you can be King David and send the lover of your wife Bathsheba to the front to die ;) 

[b]Diplomacy:[/b] It's next level compared to the other games. You can marry the daughters of other nations to secure peace or send your boosted characters on missions. Your relationships with other nations mature or degrade sensibly. It feels real. 

[b]War:[/b] There's no arbitrary BS hindering total war or conquering. The unit costs and upkeep make sense. No war weariness, happiness, or UN referees stopping you from conquering your foes - just the reality of infrastructure and your skill (I'm looking at you Humankind!). They even have a ""chess mode"" for PvP play that removes random events.
NOTE: Coming from Civ you're gonna get humbled the first couple of battles due to the order system (below). Since troops can move 4x and even be force-marched expect some serious flank maneuvers so keep your units together, dress those lines, and field more men than you would have in Civ.

[b]Orders System:[/b] They're basically action points that can be increased a number of ways and it fixes a reality-breaking issue in other turn based games like Civ. If each turn is a year\semester and a unit only move 2 hexes a turn =  moving a unit to the front can take multiple decades in Civ. This system allows you to burn all your points and get that army across your lands in a single turn or two. The downside is that if you're deep in battle with lots of actions you wont have the orders to micro your workers or characters at home. It all balances out and the benefits outweigh the setbacks. It also speeds up turns between players.

[b]Victory[/b] Conquest is default (Roma Victa!) unless you toggle the various victory point options. I'd like to see an auto-adjustment of points based on map size but it works and covers peaceful culture\science strategies if you're looking for that.

[b]Cons:[/b] No much. Just nit-picky things.

[b]Naval Troop Movement:[/b] It's a little wonky. I see what they're going for with the anchor system but miss a standard ""troops auto-embark"" or ""ships that carry troops"" system. With this system you end up with a line of stationary ships forming a bridge across long distances. And your boys just cant cross lakes. I miss being able to pick off vulnerable troop carriers as they reach shore. It works though.

[b]Marsh:[/b] I'm down with HP drain in swamps as it's realistic and creates interesting battlefields. But we should be able to clear them with a late tech + worker. I had one that really jammed up my trade and roads.

[b]Music:[/b] It's very realistic to the period and cultures. However, I'd pay for a DLC with some more epic pieces.",1675370135,1675795759,True,37,0,0.795618593692779541,3,True,False,False

Then get this immediately.

If you said no to either or both of the above, maybe you just want to know why you should play 'this' one. Here's why;

-After the first several hours or so you might say oh wow, there's some variety in these CK2-like events that had me hooked but they start repeating themselves after a while.
-^The developers just keep adding more.
-You might say some of the consequences of the events are janky and/or unrealistic, such as when a family member plots your downfall without even a personality trait that would telegraph it.
-^This is what makes it fun as hell.

So if my points that 'they keep adding more' and 'the jank is fun' seem like cop-outs, that's only because they accompany all the other top-notch aspects of the game. The utility of all the resources, the unique civ specs, the emergent gameplay, managing orders, the music (my god the MUSIC). 

Some more seasoned types would say well the game would be mundane without events throwing wrenches in your strategy. If you turn the events off (which you can), you're basically getting a better looking Civ game in a specific 2000 year time period.

It is similar to CIV and Humankind without the age progression.  
It is long stretched out version of one age in particular.
It is a mixing of stories and decisions and such could change the course of your tribe.

It is NOT much of a detailed research tree, all leads to 3 victory points.
It is NOT much of uniqueness in units, they all seems similar at the end game.
It is NOT much of a ""huge"" map when you could fit 20 cities on a continent.  Just imagine the European continent and how many cities are on it....

I set everything to extreme hard mode or in this case ""Great"" mode, minus giving the other tribes unfair advantages like advance tech and super power units.  It was a challenge, you are not able to just steam roll them and diplomacy with minor tribes helps a lot.  Even with these settings at the end game (total victory), there was really nothing to do.  No research left to discover and is missing components that made Crusader Kings III worth playing long term.  I did not need to build much of forts, which seems pointless, not unless you going to wait around for your enemies to steam roll you.  Rebellion or discontent is a simple mechanic that is either negative or not.  Feels like a cut and paste of other games, minus some of the mechanics that makes the other games much more appealing.  All I could say is that if you have a CIV itch, than all means, it will satisfy your itch until the next, so only get it when it is on sale.

I might give it 9/10 - and really, the only knock is due to the lack of additional peoples and historic maps from the time.

It's not perfect - nothing ever is - in terms of game-balance - which is totally subjective anyway.  But it's very rare in my games not to have a vast surplus of money, and that's just not a thing - and of food.  Many thousands just magically accumulated for decades.

That said, the actual game play is exciting with a very fun and dynamic event system, keeping you more interested in the fates of your family members and of the events in the world around you on a more political and social level.

This fills the niche for me left voided for decades since Total War: Rome.  No tactical battles, of course, but enough of a challenge with the AIs and barbarians and mechanics of hex based unit warfare - with some surprising and clever twists from generals special abilities and unit upgrade paths, so as to make it challenging and rewarding!

Steep learning curve in terms of game-setup options to find a configuration that is genuinely fun and challenging w/o being overwhelming.  Some combinations of choices will lead to unplayable games, or unplayable in the later game where you're trying to deal with your wars but it wants to give you a dozen family events per turn (that could be improved to scale DOWN as your empire grows, so as not to become an un-fun mechanic in the game -- once you have a clue - set events to minimum - there's still plenty).

This is much more of a 'roguelike' than other 4x games because random events, especially early ones, can significantly affect how your playthrough goes. This means that some civs have really strong starts, but may be more prone to negative random events that will nerf them throughout the game while others have weaker stats/abilities, but tend to have more positive random rolls early on.

This makes every play through feel fresh. It means you're not just going to stick to one strategy with the same civ, You will bend to the will of the RNG and try to snowball by balancing your military, economy, diplomacy, and technology to best the other teams.

You get the feeling the game was created by people who love these types of games (I think some of the devs used to be designers of CIV 4?). 

I feel they created their dream game and then decided to put it on steam. Rather then the crap you get from publisher/company trying to design something based on random player feedback, in which eventually everyone looses interest after one week. 

The developers of Old World set out to create their favorite game, perfected it from lessons learned and then put it on steam. 

They listen to feedback in a smart way because they have their own vision of what the game should be. They are veterans of these types of games.

The Good:

It's obvious that a lot of love went into the game and it's setting. It looks great and the music is implemented in really fun ways. Although I personally think some of the tracks are subpar, the music can be chosen freely through an integrated media player. 

The order mechanic and character interactions are fun and once the initial hurdles are overcome they flow well into the gameplay loop. Every run is also highly customizable. 

This game is a gem for min-maxers and number-crunchers, as it's AI and combat mechanics can be absolutely ruthless, especially on higher difficulties. Warfare especially is a madhouse in which potentially dozens of units die each turn, a very drastic departure from the combat gameplay in the Civ series. 

The bad:

The negatives start to come up once you are done playing through one or two victories. The game does not have enough depht or variation in playstyles to give meaningful flavour to different runs when played casually. Hardcore players have plenty of content through difficulty settings and min-maxing, but for the avarage 4x player that doesn't crunch every number and mostly looks for new ways to experience the game it quickly flatlines in terms of content. 

The tech tree is pretty streamlined and while the different leaders and nations that are available do have their quirks and unique unit, they do not meaningfully alter gameplay. It is easy to spot which nation is suited for what type of victory condition (Peaceful Growth through culture, Warfare/Domination, Outscaling through production) although the 4 potential families that each nation can found cities with do give it some variation. 

Conclusion: 

A great game for 4x lovers and definitely a cool proof of concept for expanding the genre. A few expansions could honestly transform this into something great, not merely decent. I also hope that a potential sequel will learn into the unique mechanics more and give the game more depth. I recommend buying it, since it has nothing that really dissapoints, but in return also nothing that will blow you away.

There is almost no diplomacy unless an event is triggered, so basically this game is only about world domination and nothing else, you only set up cities to build a bigger army. Oh I almost forgot, expect everyone to hate you, even your children and you will have no idea why, the decisions you make when a event happens are very limited so no matter what you choose it will be bad and sometimes everyone in your court and governors will die all at one time and your children will kill each other (or randomly die) so you might end up with a useless heir. you and your children and members of your court will pick up positive and negative traits which happen for no apparent reason, these traits will effect their ability to rule or govern, all -in -all its not a bad game but it does get boring, regardless of what civ you choose the events are the same, currently there are 6 civs to choose from; Rome, Persia, Greece, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, I think its only 6, but hopefully the Devs will add more in the future, each Civ has its own special units and beginning tech.

I like the leaders and families. The idea is there's events, making each game unique. Your leader dies, you need to prepare an heir, there's events around that, and you end up getting a more personal story.
Good idea, initial release did not seem bug ridden for me, which nowadays, is worth mentioning.
I played it on recommendation of friends, who were very excited about it. Personally, I find the game too shallow in terms of the strategy - splattering cities and units is pretty much it IME. Find out how not to let all of your economy collapse doing that, and you're good - there's not a lot of interesting decisions in the game in my opinion.
The events are what give it flavour. However, there aren't that many, really. I ended up clicking through them after a game or two, and have seen very few I wasn't familiar with since.
Not started the game up after the initial surge of playing with friends. I strongly suspect we'll now see a number of DLCs (just saw the first: adding events. Good idea. If the main game had had more, I would probably have played it again).
I would recommend waiting until 2 or 3 of those are out. For me, the game was spoiled by not having them, making it repetitive and boring fairly quickly. I do think it has promise.
There's no ""mixed"" thumb sideways, so I've downvoted - I think it depends on the price you're getting - I wouldn't spend the original price at this point. I may check in again when enough DLCs are out, for now, it unfortunately enters the ranks of those games that simply weren't quite round and complete when released.

Expect hoplites, spartans, and phalanxes rather than Shermans dueling Crossbowmen.

The recent religion DLC also expands pretty significantly upon a base game system and adds a bunch of new narrative content for just five bucks, which is refreshing in the age of predatory DLC.

Wtf? I run my own business and I'm pretty sure the occasional white lies I've told to family members haven't affected my income.

Rulers (including the powerful one you've bulit up) die, and much of your strength goes to heck. Random events pop up and hamper (and occasionally help) your empire. Intra-empire diplomacy demands resources. The AI doesn't cheat (much unless on the highest difficulty levels). The AI is also combat capable. 

The game is kind of (to very) hard, and expects you to learn its own systems, which are significantly different from your average 4X. Realistically, this game appeals most to those who enjoy and are familiar with strategy games. It challenges assumptions, provides extensively for replayabilty, and forces decisions while trying (largely successfully) to reduce unnecessary micro. In many ways, it's a veteran strategy gamer's dream. 

Before I go further, I should note the manual. Don't google strategy or tips or whatnot, google the manual, which is a godsend of a 175 page PDF that is so good I've reread it multiple times. 

In some ways, I feel inadequate to pass judgement on the game. I'm not that great at it. I'm certain that there's ways to exploit the game I haven't figured out, I know I lose focus on what is important for victory conditions (which are limited, but clever), and I still feel kind of lost even when I'm winning. But that's good. It keeps it interesting.

I would unremittingly recommended the game to anyone who's gotten bored of any staid 4X. I'd likely not recommend it to anyone without experience in the genre.

If you are a fan of the genre, this is the auteur piece you can't miss. Sleek design, heavy replayability, and interwoven consequences make this possibly the best designed 4X game on the market. 


That said, if you want to play a game where yields go BRR (and I often do), it's not ideal. I play the game maybe bi-yearly, love and admire it, but it is not a full time hobby for  me. 

Buy it (immediately) if the previous text appeals to you. It is (in my mind) a quintessential cult classic of 4X (behind only Alpha Centauri, because that's ART). If you have enjoyed, but gotten bored of, Endless Legend, Civ games, or AOW, this is where you should end up.",1674033368,1674033368,True,143,1,0.915472030639648438,0,True,False,False

This game is neither Civilization nor Crusader Kings, but clearly is influenced by both games. Without question, the most important unique quality that Old World brings to the table is the orders system. Orders are a resource of sorts, and after short period of time, you'll find it is the most important resource. There are many decisions you'll make throughout a game on how best to utilize your orders, which adds an interesting strategic dynamic. There must have been extensive play testing to integrate the system, because it feels so well adapted to the game. 

The combat is also kind of unique. Your units will essentially only be capable of doing damage on your turn. This makes it more challenging to defend when compared to a game like Civilization 5 and 6, where you basically get free hits on defense. At first I found the combat system jarring, but after learning it and planning with the new system in mind I definitely like Old World combat better than the Civilization combat in 5 and 6.

Some other interesting features are the characters, family and line of succession. These features you might think would feel tacked on and weird for a turned based game if you've played Crusader Kings, but again these systems are very well integrated and work well with the game design. I also found the building aspect of the game very rewarding for some reason, not sure why it just feels right.

Old World focuses specifically on the middle-east, the ""cradle of human civilization"". I would love to see a similar take on other areas of the globe.

A positive that I don't think will be mentioned a lot:  The settlement locations remove the grind of building unmanageable amounts of cities and also adds a different flavor to the explore and defeat barbarians portion of the Civilization games. 

A negative, it wasn't abundently clear when a unit on a city was giving the bonus to reduce discontent. I also, coming from Civ wasn't sure about fortifying a city or just leaving a unit on the city. This is really a minor negative.

Worst part it would take so little to make it a good game but the developer cheaped out and instead of doing just a little more programming just made things stupid.

Raiders aren't raiders - they are terrorists.  They don't grab and leave; they stay, destroy, and then die there.  The definition of a terrorist.  Fix this and make them actual raiders.  Come in, pillage a farm and leave.  You know actually gain something for risking death.

Regardless of level of relationship you have with another power they will declare war on you, just because.  Twice I had over +200 relationship and intermarriages, nope war for no reason.  I hate it when Canada declares war on the US all the time just because.  Add a subroutine that just makes war have a good reason.

Tribes will say we are coming to attack you and then slam themselves into 5-6 spearman, just to die.  They gain nothing but death.  Once again what do they gain from attacking?  Give them a goal.

Wonders are neat and all but since war is the only thing that matters at all, why are they there?

Hurrying troops once in a city okay.  Every round?  Um after the first you should just be pumping out Militia.  You know like Russia is doing right now.

Thish as everything I felt some Civ games were lacking (I played probably 500h of Civ 5 and 350 of Civ 6).
The AI, like in any game, does dumb things, but overall, I feel like I always have to stay on my toes on the last 3 difficulty levels.
The last difficulty is very hard and I failed 2-3 times before getting it right (and that was with abundant resources ;-) )
Diplomacy feels useful, the events system is random and nice, and the dynasty clearly ads to the game.
The dynasty aspect isn't so deep later in the game (it was never the goal that this was as complex as CK3 so please stop comparing the 2 games like crazy) but is very important early on.

I love how you need manage your resources well in the early game, how aggressive the AI is so you can't just be chilling next to a friendly nation for 50 turns and forget to build an army cause you feel safe like in Civ5-6.

I wish that the later game was more exciting though. Once you have an army, money, resources and are on par points wise with the Ai or 7-8 ambitions deep, you know you can't loose really.
Also, I got to say that the AI isn't the best when it comes to sea heavy maps and by focusing on controlling the sea, you literally can't loose 99% of the time.

- overall, my playthroughs tend to be like, initial expansion, economy development while trying to remain peaceful, and then all crowned by a big last war, which could be expansive to finish the last ambition and/or gain the last few points needed for victory, or defensive to maintain my achiements while building that last wonder or that last cult levels for my cities (so that all feels a bit like Colonization with that one crowning war of independence in the end)

I play on High ""points to win"" setting, as well as Ruthless AI, which means the game lasts longer, and it's also impossible to stay friendly with AI nations as I approach the winning score. I am often at war with 3-4 nations, who wouldn't accept truce no matter how many units they lose.

The character system is limited. It's OK to have and it's clearly inspired by CK2, but It doesn't turn the game into an ancient-world kindergarden simulation, like CK2 becomes after a few centuries of gameplay if you take the education part seriously. I can see in the starting options it can be turned off too.

Overall good game. My possible concern at this stage is that I can see it getting repetitive once I figure out how to do things efficiently and at higher difficulties too, but there is still way to go before that. If it's worth buying depends on your gaming budget, but I can say I didn't regret.

EDIT: Let me add, I really like the city spots system, as opposed to being able to settle anywhere. I found the old Civ way very frustrating, how you would settle in a great place, only to find out two moves later the AI settled right outside your borders, and already started claiming your tiles, and oh look at that, another ten moves along the line, another AI city equally close. And all of a sudden, you have to divert all of your empire's resources to support the cultural war there, or be forced into an actual, offensive war you aren't ready for, or forget that city and that great place. It was very frustrating and I'm glad no such thing here.",1672607868,1672610134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A shift from the universalist point of view means that the game diverges a lot from the very very western-centric, often supremacist historical materialism of, for example, Humankind which roots tribal, capitalists, feudal, communal, communists, nomadic... entities into the same hotpot thus completely invisibilizing the less common socities, for exemple the Zulus in the Industrial Era are... lost... in time and space. 
This game has other historical issue but they are not gameplay-bound and are way less critical, for exempel ""Greece"" being a contemporary of ""Assyria"" which is eeeeeeeh. But ""Greece"" could be ""Mycenean Greece"" etc.. 
This less production based and more societal based gameplay is, in my opinion, a weird as hell canvas that is a boon to reunderstanding historical gameplay without the ""productionproductionproductionproductionproduction"" lens we always have

after playing a bit, and a bit more, I couldn't figure why I wouldn't replay the game. The issue is twofold ; units simply zoom accross a battlefield consequence free and will completely ignore any sort of formation ; leading to chaotic, ahistorical, uninteresting, frustrating combat. The dynasty RPG aspect isn't fleshed out enough. It really should receive massive love - after all for example, Assyria was home to kings cursed to depression (most likely genetic depression) whom erected stelae to say how unhappy they were. Those buggers also put litteral gods into litteral trial. That's ONLY Assyria other nations especially Egypt & Babylon have their lot of buckwild leaders too. This should be way more represented imo

The many types of resources introduce many things to balance and adds to a strategic approach element as well as differentiation in styles of play.

The relationships aspect adds an element of long term strategy that underpins all of your macro level movements.  It can act as a fire alarm when you are in trouble if you can get a rival nation to declare war on the nation banging down your door.  Manipulating who is in power can act as a lifeline or a buffer between forces.

Paying attention to your heirs will help you maintain a strategy for a  while - i.e. fostering relationships through diplomacy, or bolstering military units.  I like the fact you can appoint your leaders as generals and have sort of ""hero units"" running around.

The orders system limits zerging.  Instead of each unit having an amount of moves, you have a global unit move system through orders.  Having limited orders forces you to think before you act, before you move, and when to focus on homesteading and when to focus on war as well as exploration.

The RNG if you will of some events adds an element of chaos and unpredictability, which I like.  I think the unpredictability prevents people from MIN/MAXing which is huge.  I always felt deflated knowing there was just one meta build strategy that becomes cookie cutter.  The random factor adds a HUGE element of replayabillty.

Having the era limited to 200 years always solved the later ""futuristic"" stages of CIV that I didn't like - when a Cruise Missile took out that barbarian hut, I kind of lost interest in playing.  The other thing about CIV I didn't like was the sudden victory or defeat elements.  You would think you were doing pretty good and then you didn't realize your opponent was converting your population and then won by religious zealotry.

The early game is fantastic and balanced impressively well. Every decision can make a difference and it's very engaging.

The family mechanic is built really well but it is vulnerable to management tedium if you develop your power curve early in the game. Once you develop irreversible momentum, the game can become a bit of a UX notification grind and the longer you stay in that mode, the more your memory consists of the management and less about the early game engagement.  

Sometimes I wonder if I got a prompt to end the game with a victory condition due to a sizable lead, if that would keep me playing over and over and over. It's a very difficult problem to manage and I'm not sure there is a 4X out there that has succeeded in solving that dynamic. 

Would recommend but if this sounds like an experience you'd relate with, maybe expect ~80hrs for your money.

As I've played, I definitely have found I have favorite rulers- kings or queens that had unique events happen to them that actually made their passing and subsequent succession a little sad for me. The very first king I started with was embroiled in scandal because he lent a dress of the queen's to a courtier who said he was not good with fashion and wanted to impress a consort..... the consort wore the dress to a court function which enraged the queen who subsequently began to plot my downfall even though I had previously commanded to give her the title of Venerable (out of love in my mind), but I had to imprison her, then eventually assassinate her for her actions against me. On a different leader, I had a queen who had five different husbands that just kept dying of illness through no machinations of mine.

The order system is really good at forcing you to make decisions because in war you will have to chose who moves and does what. Not the typical move every unit, attack with every unit and build everything. IMO this makes the game much more involved unlike in most 4x game where i move on autopilot.
The whole game centers on a specific age and not true the whole life span of humanity, hence the name. This might sound boring and dull at first but in reality this make for more interesting and balanced game. With the combination of limited order you can't just rush science and win or get that one more advanced unit and just steam roll with it. Also the typical problem of 4x of early and mid game being interesting and late game being slow and kinda boring is not as big in this game.
This game does have a few issues. The simple on being you have there is not enough pictures for the royal characters. If the families grow big enough you might just get 4-5 same looking guys but who are complete different stat wise and also relationship wise. You might just get confused and think you are fine while one of the 4 is making a rebellion against you.
The 2 worse problems are the discontent and character traits. Discontent is not global. Its local to each city and does not really depend on you leader (except like one trait). This make for kinda dumb scenarios were you are x the beloved and yet every city is rebelling against you. Further more the solution to this are higher on the tech tree unless you are going all in into religion. Traits are also weird.

You can even repeat songs, skip tracks and control it like a playlist easily which is a nice little touch.  I only have a couple minor gripes which are the tooltips occasionally being buggy and some sidebar menus cluttering the screen a bit.  I'm not gonna lie but I wish these games would go a little forward with graphics.  I like as much detail as possible.  Well, I'm off to start my next campaign.  Highly recommend.

This is especially worse when you know you'll win and just getting the final victory points; and the lag really kills my entire desire to do any late-game wars.

Other than that, the movement/combat system is busted. 
Since units in this game can travel massive distance and attack within 1 turn, there is literally no way for you to micromanage your unit and get rewarded for keeping your veteran units alive, because your enemies (or you also) can march their entire army from the fog of war up to your face within a turn, focus fire on your units and wipe a few FULL HEALTH units off the map.
And for some mysterious reason, attacker (even with melee unit) deal much more damage to the defender compared to how much damage it can take in return - essentially it forces you to always attack and wipe units in battles.
Maybe this is done intentionally as unit veterancy can be purchased, but that beats the point of veterancy and UNIT PRESERVATION (an important aspect in RTS/Strategy games)

Any war with the AI becomes a VERY TEDIOUS war of attrition -  every turn you wipe 3-4 enemy units, they wipe 2-3 of your units, and you both keep spamming to replenish losses...
Can you win? YES
Do you want to sit here endlessly repeating building, moving stuff across the map in an effort to conquer an AI? NO.

Edit: OK, I gave it another try. I discovered that it is possible to set events to low, which improves things somewhat. But the events and all the other stuff you have to decide on still makes it more like filling in a questionaire than playing a game.

I think this is the best 4x that I've played, it is very well put together and feels a lot more like running a cohesive empire than micromanaging a bunch of disjointed cities/planets/provinces. 

The need to generate global resources like orders, civics, and training work to make it feel like you're devloping your empire as a whole. Just building a large army or lot of workers doesn't mean you can employ them effectively, you have to have a functioning society. The RP elements, events, and need to manage relationships with your major families add a layer of dealing with personalities. Development of cities and land is also well thought-out, cities are distinct but don't need to be micro-managed and production has interesting tradeoffs. Even exploration is deeper than just sending a few scouts around and automating them later - you have to use orders to move scouts, but discovering new landmarks increases your legitimacy so is worth doing all through the game.

The one-unit-per hex map is very similar to civ5/6, but is way less prone to traffic jams and feels a lot less clunky. Combat has a tactical feel where units control areas, but there's enough movement, range, and zoc-ignoring units that it doesn't feel like a static grind slugfest. It's balanced so that you're probably going to lose some units when fighting a peer, and you need a good number of units to win fights - you don't just build a few units and keep them alive indefinitely. The AI is quite competent at the game, while it isn't at the level of a good human player, it's not a pushover. The AI will concentrate forces, rush in to kill some units then pull injured units back to heal, wait for you to make the first move if you're stronger, and generally make you work to win a war.

There's a lot of thought put into the UI, it takes some getting used to but it gives you a lot of information really easily and once you're used to it it makes a lot of sense. I keep finding myself saying something like ""I wish there was a way to do all of my builder moves before my army movies instead of just clicking next until I get to them"", then I'll find that there is a convenient button to pick which class of units to start moving. There's also a lot of attention put onto avoiding 'gotcha' moments, it's easy to undo misclicks and you can easily preview movement, attacks, and builds. They also got rid of annoyances - one common to 4X games is getting stuck dealing with a bunch of events decisions or city build alerts when you really want to respond to the attacks your enemy did last turn, here you can put aside any of the alerts, decisions, or moves and handle the ones you want in the order you want.

Anyway, that's enough writing for now. Again, I highly recommend this game, it is extremely well put together and while complicated is also a game you can just jump into and learn.

EDIT: One complaint I've seen in other reviews that I'd like to address is that barbarians or AIs are too aggressive early on. This game has extensive customization options for difficulty when starting a game, so you can easily set barbarians, tribes, and empires to have whatever level of aggression and power works for you, you're not stuck with just a few broad difficulty settings or forced to mod the game to change those settings.

EDIT2: After playing for a while, there is a lot of depth to the game and a variety of ways to approach playing. Each of the different nations plays really differently without feeling like you've changed games - they all have strengths and weaknesses, and there's a lot of little benefits that are easy to overlook. I've seen guides that try to give a static ranking, but I think the difference in play style or map type is bigger than something you can statically measure.",1667958280,1669574770,True,44,0,0.81231921911239624,0,True,False,False

Wish list:
Wish that dynasties were multi-generational. Most games are completed with only two or three rulers leading a nation.  Has the Sid Meiers God King feel when a leader can start in the Stone Age and be developing Crossbowman by the time they finally die in their 60's.
Wish there was a way to initiate court intrigue instead of just responding to it. Maxed out intrigue level and still doesn't happen often enough.
With there were way more independent tribes then the 6 the games has. They have the feel of City States from Civ 6, just wish there were more of them.
Wish revolts were more consequential than just one to three barbarian units spawning near a city, akin to how in Europa Universalis 4 revolts can result in entire new nations. Would incentivize actually trying to keep the various families happy before late game.

This is a phenomenal game, not perfect mind you, but brilliant. There are so many things you can do in a round that can improve your chances of winning/surviving just a few more turns.

Please note that the AI is pretty damn brutal and if you get in a fight, it will actually be a proper battle, not the civilisation method of throwing weak individual soldiers one at a time into bristling defences. NOPE! What you get if you are of a similar strength level is hordes of soldiers that are very aware of their own strengths and weaknesses attacking you with every intention of taking cities from you, killing your hard built soldiers, and occasionally ruining your property by plundering, if they've got nothing better do. This is really refreshing in a genre that has slowly given up the extermination part of 4x. It brings a tear to my eye it really does. Oh and don't get too attached to your soldiers, they will die, think of them as chequers (draughts) pieces, and not rooks or queens in chess, even when you 'King' them by promoting or adding a general they can still be sacrificed to put you in a better position. Keep churning them out and if you use the 'vassalage' Law, it aint gonna cost much to have a large standing army 

Building up your empire (I almost wrote civ) is a lot of fun too and it is worth checking out adjacency bonuses as these will be critical to growth, here is one example: Linking garrisons, stongholds and citadels with barracks and ranges. I use a 2 sided hex formation. I used to build the garrison to citadel in a line and then put the barracks and ranges on the outside, but now I put the garrison to citadels on 3 corners and put a barracks in the middle. this ekes out a few extra military training and a decent fraction extra orders. Before you know it, you'll be cranking out archers in 2 turns and be able to do something with them

Citizens! I love my peeps, I really do. There is so much depth to this game it makes me hap hap happy. I only occasionaly use citizens to boost basic resources, I save them for military, civics, culture and yes even orders

 Have i mentioned orders? I have very rarely played a game where I had enough orders. But I'm still learning and tweaking and trying out new things, and while it can be frustrating to decide whether to bring up more troops or fight whats in front of you with the troops you have, I think that this is a brilliant addition to the game. In early game wars its better to stop building stuff with workers to eke out 10 extra orders. and not using training at all gives you a boost in orders with everything over 2000. Having an Orator leader is fantastic when you can keep the families in line as they give a MASSIVE boost to orders. 

Civics...Didnt really interest me except to pick laws, but at higher difficulties civics is a must. Pacifying cities, marrying off wayward children before they go off and do something stupid like elope with their teachers or commoners. schmoozing with the main religions to keep them happy via the high synod, choosing Laws obviously, Influencing your council etc and of course building really useful civic buildings and character/empire/family specific projects like decrees for an order boost
or a great hunt to gather food

Gold...money...wonga, I actually find that it is quite easy to have lots and tend to spend it like water for silly things like buying up every space on the map for farm compl-hexes next to rivers (6 farms surrounding 1 granary) Gotta max that adjacency bonus lol! Or watermill and lumbermill compl-hex in a forest with a river...I think you get it 

Families...Theyre a lot of work, in RL as well as in the game, But happy families means that you can tell them to STFU when they try to get you into a corner. Early game, its a mixture of pushing for high legitimacy and throwing luxuries at them, but by mid game if you keep cities happy then you can keep the families happy. Pacify them, throw luxuries at them, build shrines and temples/monasteries. NEVER EVER choose a foreign leader over the families....I swear its only supposed to be like for 40 years or whatever, but its like they still hate you till the end of the game. kiss my feet?!? eat my shorts mofo!

Religion....still working on it, but high synod is pretty badass to keep them scripture bashers from hating on you. temples add 0.5 orders (increased to 1 with revelation) and sitting a disciple on a cathedral gives a whole order, but you can have at most 6 cathedrals (2 per family) I do feel there's more to it...

The empires: At the minute the choices are fairly limited and I cant wait for more options. Rome was quite fun, with Babylon you can research like a god and their archers FANTASTIC. Greece was boring despite getting rave reviews, same with Egypt.  I'm currently using Carthage and the research is really slow, but you can literally buy an army of savages which are, once upgraded, as good as mid-tier standard units. Please note: Barbarian units DO NOT fully upgrade. Also all savages only have 2 movement points

The dynasty! This really feels like an RPG element which i love, building up your leader is awesome and also heart wrenching when you lose them. I once made the mistake of not imprisoning a princess Id bypassed as heir twice (she was proper rubbish) she killed the king and his heirs and made herself queen and crippled the kingdom for 2 decades ( Ive set it up for semesters so thats 60 turns) until I could build her up...TBH, by the end of her reign she wasn't too bad and gave me a decent heir. I am so so so so glad sorens team decided to spend time on the aspects of leadership then throwing resources into making 3D animated leaders that make blah blah sounds.

The council:

Diplomat....As diplomacy overall is not as polished and straightforward as other leading games, I don't tend to use this councillor much. I suppose an improvement would be to set the diplomat key goals to aim at and maybe a general idea regarding what I'm willing to give away. BUT the diplomat can do the high synod which keeps those pesky religions off my back

Chancellor. i love the chancellor, they keep the hoi polloi, the seething masses, the plebians in line....god love them. I keep my chancellor BUSY.

Spymaster. very useful, whether its finding out what your opponents are up to or even where they've got their cities and you can steal tech and sometimes they bring you back goodies like free troops. 

I try to have 1 councillor from each family, they get quite put out if they're not represented, even if they aren't the best candidate.

to really get the most out of the council ya need civics, those lovely little hammers of justice and like gold it seems there is more than enough of it, but you can go through your entire allowance in one turn if youre passing a law or 2 and youre making the Councillors do lots of stuff.

I'm going to end on Laws and I think its a high note. Laws are brilliant and you can change the direction the empire is going by changing a few at the right time. You want a big cheap army? choose vassalage. if you're dripping in cash and want to speed up the build queue choose Holy war. this is so much better than anything I've seen before. LOVE IT!

so....As you guessed: I'm a fan, I really enjoy this game, its got some meat to it and is not easy to beat. There is so much to do and so many tweaks and tricks and stratagems to work on. 

Currently playing at magnificent, but with a minor negative tweak to the AI, its my second game at this level so I'll remove this on the next game. No starting bonus for the AI. Set at peaceful but I plan to push this into a more aggressive stance next game...will probably get battered senseless and crying for mommy...OK maybe the game after that lol

Semesters and long life so I can really savour my leader.

3 tribes and the level below raging barbarians, I like my natives restless.

     The game is very engaging and versatile and has may ways to play with much options for customization to TRULY make a UNIQUE game of your own.

     Although I have only played nearly 100 hours of Old World I am always up for another challenge to Defend and Conquer

     Therefore I give Old World an 8 out of 10 with favorable enjoyment and excitement and 7 out of 10 on Battle War Interaction with the A.I. gameplay  and a 9 out of 10 on Game Customization and Ease of Gameplay.

It's a perfectly viable 4x game and shares elements of the Civ series and other 4x games.  So far pretty cool.  Then, out of left field, the designers paint the game with two elements that have no historical basis, and they don't seem to realize they're doing so.  This creates a frankenstein's monster of a game, half of which abides by rational principles and half of which is a flight of fancy no less inconsistent than placing alien monoliths that bestow magical technologies around the map.  

The first is their concept of Discontent.  In this game, all cities are time-bombs, on a trip toward rebellion.  DIscontent grows relentlessly.  The masses cry out in a self-contradictory anarchist unity, ""We hate government and living in cities!""  Ironically, they are not envious of other cultures in the world.  All commoners exist in a shared mindset of rebellion that is the same across all belief and government types.

The second is the outlandish collection of personal traits that your noble characters collect.  As with the game Surviving Mars, the designers take a very rational baseline and then decorate with random and flamboyant personality events.  As they age, your leadership acquires more of these foibles.  Greed, villany, and all kinds of immorality grow upon them.  The nobility at large and the head of state are oblivious of these realities; they can exert no control.  So your dynasty becomes a soap opera of undisciplined actors incapable of subordinating their personal desires to the needs of the state.  

Again, the rub is that Old World presents itself as very serious (too serious), and significant research was clearly done regarding the practicing of ancient peoples and religions.  But then, on a whim, the game world is soaked in mysterious, smoldering rebellion and parodies of human conduct.  ""Play as one of the great ancient civilizations!"" echoes in one ear, while ""Ancient civilizations were frauds run by charlatans"" echoes in the other.  Without realizing it, the designers imposed a circus of imaginative modern disillusionment on an innocent and otherwise very well made and serious 4x game.",1668190149,1668190149,False,169,16,0.723809242248535156,0,True,False,False

Even if you abandon any other play style and stick with the militar one that you are forced to, you just can't manage the battles cause you'll be always outnumbered.

It adds some thoughtful strategic depth while reducing the tedious micromanagement that I've found tends to pad out the play time and reduce the enjoyment of other games in the genre. The events system keeps things fresh and the AI is challenging but fair. Well worth checking out if you're into 4X games. 

The long: Old world introduces a few new mechanics as a departure from the Civ series. First is the orders system where your workers and military units must expend orders to take actions (building, moving, attacking, harvesting etc.) each turn. Orders don't carry over from turn to turn. During peace time you'll usually have enough orders to keep your workers busy and your scouts moving. But during wartime you'll likely be forced the focus your orders on military action rather than your economy. This makes you prioritise and strategize. It takes few orders to mount a defence compared to going on the attack which provides a natural defenders advantage. It also caps the number of actions you can make per turn which keeps your turns short even as your nation grows.

The second big departure is the use of city sites. Unlike civ where you can found a city anywhere each Old World map has a limited number of locations where cities can be founded. At the start of the game a good portion of these are occupied by hostile barbarians or neutral tribal factions. This means you'll typically have fewer cities, but that those cities are more important as there are a limited number of sites on the map. This again keeps down the micromanagement and prevents the infinite city sprawling strategy. It also means you've always got room to manoeuvre during military operations as the cities are reasonably spaced apart. 

Those are the biggest changes and a lot of polish has been put into making them work effectively. Units have more moves and greater line of sight to let you move around and strategize on how to best make use of your orders. City growth and economics is more centred on worker actions which requires spending orders and some light planning and optimisation challenges. There is no war wariness and growth penalties (for having a lot of cities) are very light and easily compensated for. 

This doesn't even cover the laws, religions, events, families, luxuries or any of the other mechanics. But these all have the same polish, depth and thoughfulness put into them. 

Just a few other points if you decide to pick up Old World:
* The game is fundamentally a war game, you'll likely have to get your hands dirty instead of riding out an economic victory like in civ
* The AI is challenging but fair. If they go on the offensive they will prioritize killing off your units completely and hitting you where you're weakest. If you end up in a war you can also expect the other AI players to capitalize on the situation by either getting involved or asking for a bribe to stay out.
* The cost of settlers goes up in a city each time a settler is produced. It will likely prove better to spread your settler production around.
* Workers take an extra turn to complete an improvement in a city that does not belong to their family. Generally it's better to keep your workers in cities that match their family.
* Every city produces growth, training and civics each turn. If the city doesn't spend them on something, the growth will go to growing the number of citizens, and the training and civics will go to your nation's stockpile.
* The game is stable. I've played solo and multiplayer and haven't run into any technical issues.",1666937181,1666937181,True,44,0,0.815661430358886719,0,True,False,False

My original review for the game was negative. My main gripe was addressed by a developer responding to my review, and through an exchange of comments and emails, it was established that the extent to which my games were affected by this annoyance seems to have been a bug they're planning on handling in a patch in the near future. Plus, a timely and helpful response despite my somewhat impolite wording of the original review earned them some goodwill from me.

Now, for the revised review:
The game is a fun amalgamation of Sid Meier's Civilization mechanics with those of Crusader Kings, limited in its scope to the ancient and classical period. The concept is interesting enough, and I was quite impatient for the timed exclusivity on Epic to end.

I found I rather enjoyed one gameplay system in particular: having orders as a limited resource/currency. Most actions and decisions (ordering units, appointing governors, sending diplomatic missions, etc.) use up ""orders"", so you have to prioritize, especially while at war, since troop movements will eat up your supply of orders before you know it. I found it to be a cool representation of the limit to the ruler's and the administration's divided attentions.

I haven't experienced quite enough to judge the gameplay in general with any degree of confidence, other than saying that of the three popular history-themed 4X games on Steam - Old World, Humankind and Sid Meier's Civilization VI - this one's AI seems to be the most eager to go to war or threaten to do so (granted, not by much, since Civ's AI will basically always pounce on you if it smells weakness). It's the ultimatum events that led me to give Old World a negative review previously. Apparently, it's enough to go for the second lowest difficulty setting (or the second lowest aggression setting in custom/fine-tuned difficulty) to start receiving not infrequent demands you e.g., hand over a resource or a city under a threat of war. I wish there were more diplomatic solutions/answers to those, since they really messed with my plans as a mostly peaceful ruler trying to play tall, limited by my skill level of a filthy casual.

The soundtrack had a few particularly memorable tracks, especially the Bulgarian choir ones. Surprisingly for this genre, the UI has a dedicated button to show information on the song playing at that time. I ended up using it quite a few times, and wish more games had that feature for game soundtrack enthusiasts such as myself. Sadly, sometimes I'd blindly click the button to its left (one bearing the standard ""play"" triangle symbol), instead triggering a re-run of all the unit movements on that turn thus far, wasting a little bit of time whenever that happened.

The performance on my low-end machine wasn't great at launch, but has since improved as a result of optimization updates after the game's Steam release.

If there are any plans for future content for the game, I hope to see mechanics for character interactions fleshed out more and/or plenty of new events added. It should help bring more storytelling/story-making enjoyment to the game, more in line with what many play the Crusader Kings series for. For now, I just ended up thinking of the characters too much in terms of modifiers/bonuses to be managed rather than seeing them as family, vassals, rivals, etc. On the other hand, perhaps this kind of emergent narrative focus would clash too much with the boardgame-y feel of 4X games.",1665600454,1665904866,True,31,0,0.750936031341552734,5,True,False,False

They did fix the huge problem that was performance. Didn't really notice other changes. But the performance was literally the lynch pin of my review, so I've removed that mention and left the rest in here.

-
But let's assume you've got a couple super computers wired together, or they finally bring this out of... oh it's not early access? Well... um... they'll definitely fix simple technical problems. They won't fully simulate the AI characters, in a couple months. I'm sure.
Anyway! What about this do I like and not like?

Pros:
+An interesting take on the civ formula with the addition of designated city spots.
+Production is separated into Civics, military, and pop growth. And there are a lot of ways to spend them, which make for relatively interesting decisions.
+A neat skeleton idea for adding characters as a core part of the game 
+Relatively compelling progression from rural resource gathering to thriving metropli of doctors and philosophers.
+Very impressive geography generation that makes relatively reasonable sense. I've never seen a randomly generated world map that has such flow to it. It feels rather natural and that it follows consistent rules.

Cons:
-Bad UI. You've got a picture of your ruler right underneath the screen for your workers' buildings. So, even if you figure out that holding CTRL while hovering over different tiles lets you see what you can build there... you can't even see half of your options.
-Underdeveloped character system. A few events here or there. They are early game stats (particularly research)... and are otherwise completely forgettable. Occasionally you throw in a not-terrible governor here or there. Maybe toss on a general. There's almost nothing to invest you in the characters. 
-There are outright wrong ways to play. In fact, the seeming only right way to play is to get out a bunch of workers, and improve absolutely everything as a top priority, while sniping city spots as quick as possible. Early conquest is straight up not possible, even on default difficulty, due to AI starting with 2-3 cities, plus units, and have substantial production bonuses. Granted, if they didn't, they AI just can't keep up. They still can't, if you simply pick off the tribes for their city spots and improve your cities.
-All cities end up the same. At least, once they begin going from rural outbacks to actually urban cities. The only specialization you have is simply the order you build stuff in. Granted, that's meaningful, but despite having a military family own a city with all the military buildings... it doesn't produce units more quickly than your capital which simply built the military buildings because there was nothing else to build.
-Bad UI Choices. Did you know the end turn button is the same button as ""skip the 5 hours of animations"" button? Yeah. And there is no confirmation when you just skip the turn after taking 0 actions. Whose idea was that?
-Not saving your mods. Yeah. I know right? What's that even mean? Well, you download mods through an in-game browser, and you add them per game. Neat! Some integration. That's nice! Except... then suddenly some of the mods disappear and you can't play any of your games. Yes, even though you downloaded the mods, and used them yesterday, if someone takes down their mod, you can't play your game that used it. I have never seen a system so idiotic before.

In essence, imagine CIV (without era progression) but with a much more in-depth diplomacy system and a lineage system on top.
The game itself is more so about managing your nation's needs and resources while balancing individuals in your family and court, rather than purely focusing on a single aspect.
It truly makes up for a wonderful experience with lots of replay value.
And once again, as someone who utterly loves the time period and sees how under-represented it is in gaming, it makes me ecstatic. 

There are issues, and they come in two forms.
First off is bugs. The game has a tendency to lock up on clicking 'End Turn'. It's nothing what CIV6 does, where it outright crashes onto the desktop, but it's annoying. Requiring you to press ESC, do a quick save and a quick load. That would need to be ironed out.
Second issue is unit variety-- I believe apart from the two unique units each nation holds, different units for different empires should be incorporated to give each their own ""flavour"". I believe things as simple as different models and names would go a big way.

[b]Verdict: highly recommended!!![/b]

[i]Updated review as at ~100+ hours. Full review at link above; summary and key points are listed below.[/i]

[u]Introduction[/u]
I've noticed a frequent complaint and framing regarding ""what does Old World have that Civ doesn't?"" and ""why should I play OW instead of Civ?"". Frequently the framing is around: [i]what does it do differently?[/i]

I do not see Old World bringing many revolutionary things to the table, or many outrageously unique innovations. Pretty much most of what it does, has been done elsewhere. But that shouldn't be a detractor!! The greatest (and most popular) things are seldom the first version or the prototype, and more often a derivative released years later, once all the elements have been tweaked considerably. For example, the iPad, Microsoft Windows, Toyota Corolla, the Star Wars franchise, etc... none of these were the first to do what they did; but they were perhaps the first to do it right, or to do it best (and let's set aside what our personal opinions may be on any particular one of these products; it is inescapable that they were indeed successful, which is the point here).

I believe Old World is like that, but pertaining to a turn-based strategy game of empire building. What it excels at is exactly taking things that have already been ""invented"", taking things that already exist in other games, and changing and combining them in ways to achieve the ideal balance of game mechanics and design. I'd like to go through a few to highlight how Old World ""recycles"" a lot of game content and why that is not a problem, but something to be valued and celebrated, especially in the way it's delivered within the game.

[u]1 Unit per Tile[/u]
Arguably people will think that this was invented or at least popularized with Civ5. There are also realism considerations. But despite all of that, having 1 unit per tile is just more fun for tactical play. Old World has latched onto this innovation and uses it to make for fun gameplay. Furthermore, OW has leaned into this further by allowing units to cause all manner of extra/splash damage, like the spearman hitting for minor damage the unit directly behind its target. This allows the player to arrange all manner of fun tactical exploits.

[u]Settling Cities[/u]
Obviously being a civilization game with the ability to settle new cities is nothing new. Likewise, having restrictions on where cities can be placed, and outright restrictions of exclusive city locations, is likely not new either. OW strikes the balance here of restricting city site locations, with some minor tweaking (you can settle on the site or any of its attached urban tiles).

In my opinion, this is an excellent design choice because it eliminates the extremely large degrees of freedom to making decisions regarding where to place cities, or strategizing thereon. Now you just need to choose which city site to go for, and which tile of them you wish to settle (which then highlights what the borders would be).

Furthermore, OW leans into this further by allowing city borders to expand indefinitely. This again removes non-value-added player analysis and agonizing over individual tile details by allowing just about any resource to be reachable with some work.

[u]Dynastic Components and Relationships[/u]
As it's well-known, the game Crusader Kings is focused heavily on building your dynasty and on maintaining relationships with the various nobility around you. In fact, CK does this much better if that's the only set of game elements that interests you.

But what OW does is that it still produces these elements in an immersive way - you get to roleplay as your leader, you get to roleplay your nation better (as opposed to Civ where you're some immortal ghost ruler telling all the people what to do), and it's more historically immersive (nobility was in charge back then)... yet OW does this without making the system as incredibly complicated as CK2. Obviously from a meta-development perspective, they shouldn't, because CK2 has already done it. And from a personal gaming perspective, if this is what you seek, you can just play CK2.

What OW brings to the table is a lighter version of that so that you get most of those benefits (e.g. roleplaying and immersion), while precluding inordinate complexity.

[u]Orders[/u]
Arguably one of the genuinely novel things OW brings to the table is the concept of ""orders"" being limitations to how much you can control all your units. The purpose behind this design choice is present elsewhere - preventing the player from being overwhelmed with the amount of available command decisions by creating limitations such as ""supply limits"" (think in StarCraft where you need more Supply Depots to build more units, and even then there's a hard max).

Like the limited city sites, this at first sounds like something that isn't that great for the player, but it turns out to be fantastic. It prevents the player from being incentivized to build such enormous amounts of units that they become bogged down with decision fatigue and so overwhelmed it starts to feel like a chore. And it does it in a way that is manageable and allows the player to improve upon as the game goes on (i.e. you can increase how many orders you get per turn through your various player choices).

[u]Undo Functionality[/u]
With the introduction of such an orders system, the game incorporates an ""undo"" button, allowing you to take back any orders you issue. I see this undo feature as [i]emergent[/i] from the orders system; with limited capacity to issue orders, it is only natural that one may fall short of one's grand designs for a turn, and may wish to undo some orders and do certain things differently (there is even an option to undo an entire turn). This does open the door to potential exploits, but it is the player's choice as to whether to use this feature or not. The feature can even be disabled permanently for a game within the game setup options.

However, this undo functionality reveals a quality-of-life feature that is so invaluable, it's difficult to return to other games that lack it. Sometimes we misclick, or remember a plan that would have needed a different sequence of orders, or have just plain changed our minds regarding what we want to accomplish in a turn. This will occur in all manner of turn-based strategy games and will be difficult to address. To have the ability to undo is extremely helpful and enjoyable, allowing players to correct those mistakes or change those actions without having to reload a previous save.

[u][b]In Closing[/b][/u]
I could probably go on and on about all the things Old World does that are nothing new, and that have been done elsewhere, and in some cases, done better. But as you peer into what makes OW so enjoyable, you feel it's almost like the game designers of OW have looked into ""what is it that players enjoy when playing a game"", picking those out and including them; and also looked into ""what is something tedious or unfun that players are stuck having to do in such games"", picking those out and finding ways to remove them from the game. For example the tedium of multi-factor dynamic city site selection (eliminated via select city sites). For another example, managing countless units (eliminated via limited orders).

[b]What OW brings to gaming is tying in all these game mechanics and elements in a way that optimizes player enjoyment based on its game design choices. While that's ultimately a subjective assessment, for players like myself, I think it's pretty much the perfect balance of having good mechanics that are enjoyable while excluding tedious and otherwise uninteresting elements.[/b]",1656952405,1665006440,True,35,0,0.77778160572052002,4,True,False,False

In some areas yes, in others no.

One area that they clearly have taken is the way the AI does things. Its doesnt ""think"" it just responds to your input in the game. You declare war on a tribe and guess what, next turn so do they. Why? so its limits the player taking city sites. Were not stupid devs! weve been seening that kind of sneaky programming from civ for years and years.

Also some of the units are so unbalanced its incredible. Javelin guys, from barbarians have to be hands down the best unit in the game. 3 of them are enough to ransack a whole area.

You can definetly tell this game was made by someone from the Civ 4 dev team, fighting, as in going to war and invading is heavily discouraged in the game. Which makes playing as a civ based on that premise (like the romans) a complete waste of time.

I don't like the weird thing that melee units don't usually get hurt when attacking, like every other game in the genre, or in real ancient warfare.  The growth system is weird, but actually more realistic so I'm ok with it; just having lots of food doesn't grow populations alone.

There doesn't seem to be a good rational for this, other than design/balance reasons; its immersion breaking to have to settle in sub-part locations and avoid superior locations because the game arbitrarily designated those spots as the city placement spots.

Also wish there were more nations. Originally it seemed like there was a robust amount of mods with almost 100 in the first couple of weeks... but not many more now, months later, and it seemed like they were relying on people creation their own nations to expand the list.

I'm almost tempted to make the mods I want myself, but the no-settler spot ultimately just makes the game kinda meh, and the appearance of the tiles feels... drab and depressing.

597180,122519091,76561197992356648,0,21,1822,0,1822,1663638183,"It seems to me the historical 4x genre has been in decline for the past decade, even as the 4x genre as a whole has seen a major revival. Civilization V was the last major landmark work in the genre, whereas Civ 6 is comparatively reviled. Humankind, Iceberg's effort, seems to be a middling effort, a B where the subgenre really needed an A+ (this is just anecdotally, I have not played it yet). So, the historical 4x really needs a kick in the butt. Is that Old World?

Old World is a pretty good game, and very polished for a single developer effort. As far as the art, the tiles are beautifully made and very distinct. Units look lovely, and the developers made the decision (probably by necessity) to have units represented by a single model rather than a small group, as is the current trend with bigger developers. I prefer it this way, although it would be a good idea to have a floating health bar or some other visual state to show the condition of the unit on the map. The art is one of several areas where I feel Old World really shines.

The UI is simple, almost to a fault, with important menus hidden behind tiny icons that reveal just barely enough to suggest their purpose. One of the things that I do not like about the UI (as a frontend developer myself) is how much action is concentrated in the lower left hand corner. You will most often find yourself clicking tiny icons there to perform game actions that could have been spread across the rest of the screen. It is also here that you will often find yourself railroaded into some pointless actions each turn, unless you get into the habit of ending the turn yourself. A simple tweak to solve this would be to remove units with actions from the queue here once the action budget has been used up. Long term, I would like to see unit actions in floating buttons near the unit itself, and event notifications placed somewhere else. On the whole, I would say the UI is probably the weakest point for the game.

The second weakest point, I think, is the dynasty simulation. Like one of the other games that had me really excited for this mechanic, Star Dynasties, I just don't feel like the social element has much effect on how I play the game. While character dislikes can snowball into faction rebellions, and that's pretty cool, I often find it easier to ignore them and manage their opinions through other game actions and event responses. Interacting with individual characters can be confusing or at times impossible, considering it's often locked behind civics, technologies, or relationships with key players. There are a ton of characters, but none of them seem to actually be doing anything, they are not plotting, they are not building, they are not waging war. Most of them are just names that can pop up in events and clutter the right side of the screen. There are only a few people that will matter at any one time. That being said, I do like having them around as it feels that my empire is at least populated with names, and having my own dynasty tree helps the game feel lived-in and historical as well.

The limited scope of the game might be a sticking point for some players. The selection of starting empires is quite limited compared to established titles out there now by established developers. Since a lot of the content consists of in-game events, looking at the ""new game"" screen one might assume there is very little content for their dollar. The seven empires that are playable do offer enough variation between and within them to support multiple playthroughs. The scope of the game being limited to the bronze and classical ages, the tech tree is rather short, and an ""advanced technology"" would probably be the equivalent of medieval tech. Personally, I think this limited scope was a good way for the developers to focus on the systems they built and release a game that constituted a complete set of features and a realized vision. Although I'm not exactly sure what content was added in the most recent DLC, hopefully more content will be added to give the game more variety within the scope it currently has including new empires, new events, new units, new wonders, new technologies, etcetera. 

Old World introduces several new mechanics to the historical 4x genre besides the dynasty system, though, and many of them are challenging and successful. One of these is the ""orders"" mechanic. Basically, your empire produces its available actions per turn as a resource. Character skills, technologies, and buildings can affect output of this resource, and thus exactly how much you are able to do on any given turn. The great Sid Meier defined a game as ""a series of interesting choices"" and the scarcity of actions makes the turn-to-turn choices more scarce and interesting. I find myself planning my actions each year much more carefully than in any other turn based 4x game. Often I have had to reload because an invasion was stalled when I used my workers or moved up reinforcements first, but I find myself being angry more at me for this than the game. Contrast this to the dynasty mechanic, where I am frequently enraged that my lack of order resource prevents me from doing social actions. I would heavily advise the developer to divorce the social from the strategic elements by doing away with order costs for social actions. Other than that, this is a fantastic system that makes me feel excited for the future of the genre.

Another mechanic that is new to the game that I feel was done well is the faction system. While I feel that character opinions are mostly inconsequential, faction opinions (which I think are tied to the individual that leads the faction, modified by some external faction variables) are quite important. A faction rebellion will place several ""barbarian units"" on the map which will at minimum cause a headache and at maximum ruin your day. There are 3000 events in the base game, many of which will influence the happiness of these factions as well as in-game actions such as enacting civics and building cities. I do really enjoy managing the factions in my empire and look forward to seeing more ways for them to impact the game world and act more independently.

My absolute favorite part of the game, though, is the music. The soundtrack is superb, pulling from balkan, middle eastern, and north african folk traditions as well as western modernist composers such as Phillip Glass. While there are a couple tracks that are a bit annoying to my taste, I find all of the choices to be very expressive of the theme without falling back on musical tropes, as the ever-present repetitive medleys of the later Civilization games do. There are dozens of tracks, and even after thirty hours in-game I am still hearing new things. If you don't have an open mind to non-western folk music including alternate scales and vocal styles, you may not be able to appreciate this excellent facet of the game but I highly recommend you open your ears and heart to this lovingly curated selection.

So is Old World the game that's going to save historical 4x? Not really, but it has made several incremental steps in the right direction. Mohawk Games has aggregated several recent trends in the subgenre and added in several experimental touches, going much farther than others have. I can see myself putting a lot more time into this game as it is and eagerly await further updates and DLC to expand the amount of content. With a few tweaks to the UI and dynasty system as well, I feel this will become a beloved title in the genre that could get a lot of people into historical 4x. Hopefully the developers will hold off adding any more ambitious additions for a sequel and focus on improving what they have. Either way, I'm really excited to have something new and interesting on the scene.",1663638333,1663825245,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

The order system is such a cool feature which ultimately forces you to plan a strategy and focus on it rather than just constantly build up your whole empire like you do in Civ. There are times during war that your army sucks all of your orders so that you really can't do anything else (pretty realistic).

And if fending of an infinite army isn't enough, you have to do it while getting attacked by a ridiculous amount of raiders attacking your cities, making them unhappy, which means you'll have to defend against rebels too.

The events are varied and interesting. The economy is very complex, but not in a way that it is unapproachable. You don't HAVE TO think about everything just to get a decent civ going, but if you can learn the ins and outs, you are rewarded. 

The BIG selling point for me though? The AI isn't completely stupid. This is Civ's greatest weakness, IMO. I was so used to enemy AI players just using the worst strategies that when I finally went to war in OW, I had a** handed to me. Not by overwhelming force as would be the case in Civilization and AI getting huge production bonuses, but by good use of units and tactics on the AI's part.

Programming is solid - no bugs or crashes for me, although I noticed my computer (mid range) borders on overdrive. The OW team is very caring, which results in a continuous spray of updates.
AI is more than adequate - I'm having a hard time to win on the 2nd lowest level, on strategic and most certainly tactical level.
Graphics are very nice. When you zoom in, there's a lot of detail to enjoy. However, roads and rivers are difficult to discern.
Old World's city representation of cities is just right - no disjointed science or commercial districts a la Civ 6 or infinite industrial quarter spam a la HK, but organic city spreading.
Your familie (and the ruling class) and their endeavours give flavour and can tip the balance in your favour when used right.
Orders system is logical and makes you think twice.

Only gripe I've got (I get that in this time period women are equal to men, so yeah, there are competent female generals to attach to your elite swordsmen) is the religious system.
While it works logically and meaningful, I still HATE it that polytheism has about the same date of origin as monotheism. This should not be the case, monotheism arived late in the classical age (apart from that Egyptian sun woreshipper (but he was avantgarde or an anomaly)) .

IF you like the idea of a highly tactical turn-based strategy game focused on the Classical era of Western (read: Mediterranean) Civiliation, with some light RPG elements, I think you would absolutely love this game.  (I have also only played about 24 hours of it at time of writing, so take my recommendation with that grain of salt as well.  I feel I've delved into it enough that I have a solid feel for what it offers, but I've had to go back and amend recommendations before.)

So I am a huge Civilization fan--I believe that at time of this writing I have a combined 2974 hours played in Civ V, Civ VI, and Civ: Beyond Earth.  I have also put in a decent 60 hours in CKIII.  So when people said it's those two combined, I bit.

I would say the CK-like RPG elements are similar, but less than.  Your relationships with factions and individuals matter far less than they do in Crusader Kings, but you do a lot more managing of the individuals.  In Old World, it's more about the mechanical bonuses or negatives they give you, and you can go multiple turns without thinking much about the RPG element.  It definitely adds something to the game, but I'm not sure comparing it to Crusader Kings does either game justice.  I honestly feel it's more akin to the characters such as family members, generals, priests, etc. in later iterations of Total War games, but with decision points that can affect their stats.  (Individuals are less dynamic and you have a lot more control over them and what they do, while in CK it feels more like you only really have control over your monarch.)

In terms of it being like Civilization, YES.  Very familiar mechanics.  BUT, you'll find that there's a bit of a learning curve.  One element I found fascinating yet challenging is the Orders mechanic.  Every turn--based on your prestige, cities, governors, techs, and certain improved tiles--you produce a certain amount of Orders.  Every action you command any unit to do, be it moving, attacking, pillaging, building, etc., takes an Order.  So unlike Civ, where you have to give every unit something to do every turn, in Old World you often have to carefully choose where to spend your Orders.  During a war, for example, you rarely have orders to spare to give your workers tasks, so improving your cities often grinds to a halt.  ALSO, you can spend Training points (which can be also used to promote units without them gaining experience, among other things) to Force March a unit, which allows it to move further than its movement points normally allow, but applying a level of fatigue (and combat negatives) for each extra move it makes.  The Orders and Forced March elements make how you choose to move units around much more strategic than in any 4X game I've ever played.

Combat is very dynamic and tactical in a way that Civ has never been in my experience.  In Civ, battle pretty much goes to the Biggest Stick.  If you have a tech advantage, you win, period.  In Old World, tactics can win the day.  Characters can be attached to units as Generals, making them dramatically tougher and giving them special abilities.  Different units have special powers (War Elephants, for example, have a chance to Panic enemy units, causing them to flee, while Cavalry units can keep attacking if they kill a unit, and Axemen attack the unit you specify AND the two hexes to either side).  When you're not at war, units can be parked on top of certain tiles (like a Barracks) and gain a small amount of experience every turn.  The promotion trees are randomized and highly variable, giving every unit a unique feel and flavor.  That said, there's a huge combat learning curve.  I lost the first war I fought so badly that I had to pay a tribute to the AI for peace, and then all the other AI's declared war on me and killed me.  It was brutal, but I learned a great deal about waging war.  (For one thing, you will not capture a city without siege units.  Trying to do it with archers and melee is just a good way to get your troops killed, 'cause they'll be vulnerable to counter-attack by cavalry and ranged units.)

So honestly, what this game feels like to me is if someone took Civilization, cut out all but the ancient/classical eras, and tried to make it hyper-realistic.  Wars are brutal, bloody, and require great tactical skill to win.  Politics is a little more simplistic, and religion is far less under your control.  Building buildings and wonders is time-consuming and expensive, but highly worthwhile.  Rather than ""Great People"", you have people who may or may not be Great who are the movers and shakers in your world.  Religion is a lot more amorphous and realistic--no faction ""owns"" a religion so much as they choose to adopt it and foster it.  It's a really solid classical civilization sim.

I have to give it solid marks on its Tutorials, which do a better-than-decent job of teaching you the specific game mechanics through a series of short scenarios.  (Have to say though, the one where you are supposed to send your scout to locate the Roman army without being spotted is BRUTAL until you learn that units in forests are invisible unless an enemy unit moves right next to them.  I must have failed and restarted it 10 times before I figured that out.)

For me, it's a little too crunchy.  I don't enjoy the level of micro-management and deep thought put into every unit's moves required to succeed at this game.  The UI isn't as user-friendly as modern Civ games--for example, you only see the attack range of ranged units if you mouse over them while they're selected, and it's an extremely faint red line that is easy to miss if you aren't looking for it.  BUT, for all that, it's a solid, enjoyable game.  I expect I will continue to dive into it and play it from time to time when I have a hankering for what it offers.  But I think this game is much more niche than Civilization because of the level of intensity and the specific focus on Classical Mediterranean civilizations, and so it's probably never going to be a go-to 4X game for me personally.

If you've ever been playing a game of Civilization and been frustrated that the early eras are over too quickly, wishing that you didn't have Musketmen wandering around so early in the game, this game might be just for you.  Rather than the focus being on advancing your civilization through the eras, the focus is on accomplishing your leader's goals and on scoring enough points to win.  Largely this is accomplished via politics and war, and mastering the tactics of the age is key to success.  I know of at least one of my Civilization buddies who will ADORE this game.

SO, my rating is 7/10 because while I don't personally love it, I think it's does an AMAZING job of accomplishing exactly what it intends--it is a 4X Classical Era geopolitical turn-based strategy game with RPG elements and highly tactical combat.  It checks a lot of boxes for me, but I don't see myself dumping hours of my life into it like I do with Civilization.  Despite that, I believe it's worth a look if what I've described sounds like something you'd enjoy.",1662441680,1662441680,True,232,0,0.943956255912780762,0,True,False,False

It's a solid B, 8/10. It's a bit pricey, but you get a complete game instead of having to pay for 2-3 expansions, nation packs, map packs, scenario packs and whatever else Civ now charges that used to be included. Way way way cheaper than Civ.

I get the ""One more turn"" feeling, the graphics are good and the game is very mature, it has been post development for over a year.

There's some very good mechanics that I wish future Civ games would have:
-Free units as a tech option
-Generals increasing the power of units in various ways
-Wide open spaces between cities for combat and no more cities instantly nuking your units
-Event system that adds more flavor and tells a story
-Orders system adds flexibility and speeds up the boring early game
-City sites that removes settler spam and ends oddly and annoyingly placed cities. 
-Anchoring system for crossing oceans
-No pollution/corruption/unhappiness mechanics that place hard limits on you

The game is great but the play-style of nations are too similar. Winning by turtling is too easy.

I find myself wishing that Civilization would use this engine and its various mechanics, that would be a 10/10

Civ set exclusively in the ancient era, but with the addition of Crusader Kings-like dynasties, character interactions/opinions, events and a unique system called Houses that abstractifies the labyrinthine dynasties of CK down into something that works far better with this quicker-playing, more boardgame-like experience.

City-building is incredibly satisfying, some of the best boardgamey citybuilding I've experienced in recent years. Orders are a double-edged sword for you, the player, but overall they're a genius bit of design that really make you think about what you want to do on your turn. They can be a bit TOO hard to come by in the early game, forcing you to randomly declare war on tribes because that, for some reason, increases your legitimacy. I would like it if there was a bit more nuance.

Flaws:
Despite claiming to have over 3000 events, it doesn't feel like it at times. Roughly half the time another leader dies, I get the same ""They want to build a statue in your city"" event. I get this event multiple times [i]per campaign[/i]. Maybe these certain specific triggers need more associated events. Even just a handful would do. Or maybe it's a bug. Either way, it takes me out of the experience when every fresh leader is obsessed with having a statue of their dad in one of my cities. Especially because the event states ""This is highly unusual!""

A big, big flaw for new players is: the tutorial is a chore. I wish there was a way of getting around this, or maybe more quickly and elegantly handling it. I recommend doing the first two tutorials and skipping the rest. You can pick it up as you go - there are pop-up tutorials. But these ""learn to play scenarios"" were some of the more painful things I've experienced in recent years, partly because it's continually resetting your progress.

Lack of map wraparound is disappointing. Your position therefore massively affects balance - the player tends to be plopped in the middle, a precarious situation. I prefer when Civs have more interaction with each other. Please, please add map wraparound so that it [i]feels[/i] like every civ is on a level playing field, even if they're really not.

I feel like the game could do with a bit more fleshing out and development. It feels complete in its current state, but I want more.

Often with games, I know pretty quickly whether I'm going to be sinking my life into them -- if not by the ridiculously-brief hour two, then usually by hour ten. But this game...

Well. TL;DR: Did you ever want Crusader Kings to be more like Civ? Did you ever want Civ to be decidedly limited to the ancient world? Do you like the meatiness of the city-building aspects of Civ 6, but want a bit more freedom? Do you want a tech tree that *forces* you to choose a different path every game? Well, friend, this game still might not be for you. 

Keep in mind, I'm giving this a positive review, and I'll almost certainly be going back to play more with one of my spouses a little later... but. 

Here are the problems, as I see them: 

1)  The maps are painfully tiny. Just -- painfully. Modders have helped with this, but still, these maps are pathetic. If, like me, you like exploring your 4X worlds at a leisurely pace as you build your empires... yeah, no. My spouse -- who handles exploration -- is already bored as hell on the (modded) 'super huge' map and we're only on turn 37. 

2) The goody huts stop working once you reach a certain point, just when you've grown accustomed to the pretty pictures and stories. I see no reason for them *not* to repeat themselves, or at least give us a *message* when they're exposing map tiles or giving us civics hammers. The little *poof* of nothing as a hex of random urbanity appears -- and nothing else -- is wildly disappointing. 

3) The game is imbalanced between leaders when it's not dragged down by RNG. It's ridiculously easy for, say, Nebuchadnezzar to soar ahead early game. At the same time, if you don't save-scum, you might wind up with courtiers who all learned how to do their jobs from Caligula. There ought to be some of that -- it makes the game interesting -- but why on *earth* is it tied to RNG?

4) Immediately get the mod that lets you play the music from the beginning. Just do. It's cute that they linked it to the Drama tech, but that can lead to *hours* of silence as your researchers flounder. Not good. 

5) The Greek and Roman leaders...

...

........

Look, I understand that we see the same Greeks and Romans in every game, and that the devs wanted to go somewhere different, but this is just pathetic and painful. Philip of *Macedon*? *Romulus*? Dressed as an early-Imperial Roman *general*? 

Which brings me to: 

6) Where are the rest of the ancient world civs? Why are they missing? Are y'all really leaving it up to the modding community *this* early? Because that's not just sad; that's effing *racist*. 

7) Bugs, bugs, bugs -- though none game-breaking, as of yet. 

All that said? I like the game. I might even come to love it, if there's ever something to fix the terrible exploration problems so that I can settle in and play with my honey for hours every night, the way we did with Civs 3, 5, and 6. 

It's an absolutely gorgeous game with the best soundtrack for a video game I've ever come across. 

The ability to nerf the game mechanics, your opponents, and the world itself -- or to crank it to insane degrees of difficulty -- is positively awe-inspiring. (Take note, fellow gamers with high blood pressure.)

The *intricacy* of the game is fascinating -- and generally quite well done. They took many of the best parts of Crusader Kings and slotted them quite smoothly into a Civ-like. There's a lot of *there* there; a blooming mass of things to do and tweak and build and meddle in. 

I adore the shrines. That's all. There's so much cool *stuff* there -- well, you'll see if you play. 

Roads, improvements, and wonders are all infinitely less *irritating* to build -- the worker is a powerful force, as opposed to an instrument of torture for the player. 

The writing is, on the whole, gloriously clever, amusing, and generally like settling into a rousing conversation about history with your nerdiest bestie -- excellent work. 

So... there are my thoughts. It is a Good game, and I think most 4X players would like it fine. However, if you need the eXploration to be just as important as the other 3 X's, and if you like taking your time to play *every* nation/civ, then old world has a ways to go. 6 out of 10.",1661731419,1661731419,True,4,0,0.530186653137207031,2,True,False,False

But while it is a 4X game, it really has the spirit of a Grand Strategy game. The specific actions you take every turn might feel quite similar to what you would do in other Civ-like games, but the scope and depth of the interlocking systems transforms this into something that is much greater than the sum of its parts. 

Managing my character and dynasty, my court, the relationships with the noble families, my generals and governors as well as my rivals (or allies), dealing with the intricate production and resource systems, developing my cities, reacting to the game's thousands of beautifully written events and leading my armies, all while keeping my ambitions in check through the ingenious orders system - what an exciting and immersive combination! And the atmospheric setting, graphics and soundtrack are the cherries on top.

But beware - it will take a while until you can really grasp all the details that the game wants you to keep track of. All these systems incur the cost of high complexity. Thankfully, there is a decent tutorial campaign, a fleshed-out nested-tooltip system, an in-game wiki and a very in-depth, entertaining and readable manual to help you through this process. 

The steep learning-curved road you climbed will be forgotten when you mourn over the death of your King or Queen who so dearly cared for their people over the course of the last 50 turns, right before you continue your campaign with their heir who will write a new and different chapter in the history of your nation due to their different skill set and personality.

It's a very special blend of Civ 4 (no need to tell me Soren Johnson designed this) and Crusader Kings 2, where various ancient civilisations vie for supremacy. Superficially it looks like standard 4X fare, but play it and you soon see the difference.

Every system and every resource has a purpose, and the way they interact and mesh together is very clever. Think you can go all out for economy, because you need wood and stone for buildings and iron to arm your troops? That's very true, but be careful or unfortunately you'll be lagging in training, the stuff you also need to build soldiers, to promote them, and to assign powerful generals to lead them into battle. Want to develop a gold rich empire? That's fine, but bear in mind you can't just rush buy your way out of trouble - not without the correct technology, or the correct class of governor of your city, or the correct archetype of leader. Civics for strengthening the laws of your society and building its foundation structures are crucial. Luxuries are needed to keep your aristocratic families happy. Technology keeps your empire competitive, but don't expect to beeline for your personal favourite...

So it goes on, with complex system after complex system interacting in layers, making a game that is pleasantly easy to pick up and dive into but hard to master. Every playthrough teaches me something new. Scrambling to hold on against an unpleasant setback is actually fun. The biggest bonus of all is that the AI is actually very competent, an aspect of 4X gaming so horribly overlooked in Civ 6 or Humankind. This is an excellent value title and I hope Soren keeps making games in this genre.

One thing I miss? Once the game is over, please tell me how my leadership style compared with Dan Quayle - presuming Sid Meier didn't copyright that...

WHAT I LOVE:
-The Orders mechanic is excellent game design. Creates meaningful choices each turn with incredible flexibility.
-Nested tool tips are incredibly helpful.
-Permanent workers that don't run out of build charges <3
-Not all production comes out of the city centre. Specialists build things, so there's a lot of dynamics in how you build your city. You can have more than one thing going on at once in each city.
-Some people criticise the one-sided combat, but I love it. Combat is my least favourite part of any 4X game though...
-The families and leader archetypes allow for a lot strategy (instead of being stuck with just your starting civ)
-I like that there are more granular resources like Growth and Food as separate things. It's not overwhelming or complicated and makes a lot of sense.
-The Laws matrix is awesome and non-linear. Again, meaningful choices abound
-Similarly, the research tree incorporates a bit of chance with it's ""card deck"" mechanic. I like it. Adds randomness so you can't just find the ultimate path and rush techs; you gotta adapt and make choices every time based on what you get. But it's not too random that it's stupid or annoying. Just right. 
-The ambitions system as a victory condition is diverse and makes games highly re-playable. Instead of one path to get science/culture etc victory, you're constantly evolving your priorities to meet different ambitions throughout the game. It's still not perfect, but it does help make late game more fun.

WHAT I DON'T LOVE:
-The Events are an excellent part of this game, but I feel like about 5% of the time, the randomness is too much and creates ridiculous situations that are frustrating and completely out of my control. But the other 95% of the time they are great and immersive. 
-Everything in the game is ""+ yields = good"" EXCEPT for discontent which is ""- yields = good""...why?! This could have been a ""happiness"" stat instead so that everything is ""+ yields = good"". You get used to it eventually, but it's an annoying brain flip when reading options.
-Not enough unique portraits in the game, so you see the same face later on in the same play though. Can be fixed with mods though.",1660181088,1660181088,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have played Civ from 1 to 6, TW series, EL and some other 4x games and this game excels in so many ways.
First of all your actions make sense, you are creating history of your nation by focusing every turn on small achievements to fulfill your destiny. Its not just long term focus to win by any determined statistic, but more likely leading your nation through events and ambitions of your leaders.
Every mechanic and resource management feels to me more natural and immersive than in those other 4x games I have played and to me it does not have an end game problem of repetitiveness and slow turns like Civ does. But of course Civ tells you much wider scale of history and you can use battleships against spearmen.
The storytelling in Old World does not draw true memorable line through the game, it's more like series of events which sometimes follow in a small stories. True story of your nation is still more or less on your imagination.

I beat it on The Strong after several attempts (barely losing the first couple attempts and barely winning on the last).

I love that this game uses ""Orders"" to dictate how many actions you can take each turn and I love that you don't consume workers (Civ feature).  Orders system basically forces you to be very strategic.  If you're going to war, you basically can't upgrade tiles since your military units will soak up the orders.  

Tech research is really done by chance (card system the gets reshuffled each time you finish a tech).  I also love that the tech keeps you in the ""old world"" as opposed to Civilization where someone can make it to the modern area and other players can be stuck with primitive units.  Combat is Civ like with units on tiles so range units are at a premium.  

The Crusader Kings aspect of making decisions adds a nice twist to the game.  Marriage proposals, character development and developing an archetype will dictate how you play. 

Of note, I downloaded a patch and had an issue with game play.  I e-mailed the developer and got a response within 24 hours.  It was a simple fix and the customer service was appreciated.

The many annoyances and dull end game of Civ and Endless (+Humankind) series are gone. There is a focus of warfare, followed by economy management and diplomacy. No world congresses, the game is purely focused on pre-medieval period.

There are many, many points to expand on, but the major one is this: OW is a game where you constantly adapt your strategy to changing circumstances, while Civ is a game where you learn optimal strategies and pick one at the start (at least on harder difficulties). In OW you probably shouldn't rush... but then you just got a Diplomat leader and there's a tribe conveniently surrounding a nearby nation. You pick Rome for a bit of conquering, but the massive mountain range on your land will give you all the wonders. Not so with Civ: if your Rome spawns too far away from rivals, it's restart time.

I like that a lot. I like that I don't need to memorise an optimal build order, or rush a unique unit for a known attack window between turns 55 and 58. I like that I can plan, get thwarted, adapt and try something else. It feels like I'm constantly challenged from all directions by the game, rather than the challenge being owning 3 campuses by turn 36 or it's lost already. No, no fallback to culture or domination wins, it's 36 turns too late for that.

There are a few flaws, to be sure, but mentioning them feels like pointless niggling. Some of the archetypes feel weaker than others, although which ones are seems to depend entirely on the player, so it may well be perfectly balanced. Maybe the main one is that the differences between nations are a bit too subtle and, aside from names, they end up feeling a bit same-y about 30 turns in, but even that is contested.

Old World is a grand and revolutionary game. Buy it, and find the nation with your favourite flavour. Where winning at Civ makes you feel like you won a game of chess, Old World makes you feel like you emerged victorious from an antique epic. There's nothing like force marching magnificently-bearded Akkadian archers out of the woods to turn the tide of battle.",1659115119,1659115119,True,80,1,0.868847846984863281,0,True,False,False

It fixes one of the in my opinion major problems of Civ namely that mid to late game can get pretty boring as you'd have so many units that one turn is taking ages.

Also the fact that you do not advances through the ages but stay in the antiquity is really cool as you can see that they really put some detail in this one specific era. But this is more a personal impression. A slight niggle would be that graphics aren't like top notch. Not that the game doesn't look well, it really does, but you just see that there isn't a huge developer behind this. I still like its realistic style more than the comicy style of Civ 6.

Now, having said that, do I think Old World is better than Civilization VI? No.
Do I think Old World is better than Humankind (and yes, I played that game, too)? Yes.
What are the pros for Old World? Old World is great if you like to have  more variety and random events occur in your game. Old World is great for people who like to role-play with their civilization; there is also a serious domino affect that occurs in this game pretty much from turn 1. What I mean by that is every small decision that you make as a leader will define how the game will turn out. For me, I really enjoy this type of concept, because I like having to really think about my decisions in these types of games.
What are the cons of Old World? For me personally, I think the UI is a little clunky for my liking, I would've liked a much cleaner interface. I also do not like to read in general, so having to read so much text for hours at a time is very off-putting to me. I would have liked an option to be able to just listen to some of the text, or not have to read so much. For other people, I think this game has a much more intricate and complex gameplay to it, that it might not be the game for you, especially if you really enjoy the simplicity of Civilization VI, where you can learn the game at your own pace.

Killed off 2 games simply because we realized we didn't understand some of the mechanics. We're in our 3rd or 4th game and it's going along fairly well. We get to year 67 and suddenly we experience extreme lag. To set the scene: we connect to the same 1GB switch via CAT 6 and the switch is connected to the ISP router via a 1GB connection. Around year 89 or 90 she is having difficulty moving any of her personnel. She tries hitting ""End Year"" and we move forward. It seems to work for this round as she's able to start moving pieces around. She gets about 75% complete when the game refuses to allow anymore moves. I can see her orders decreasing with each attempt but noting happens for her. I had completed all my moves so she hit ""End Year"" again. Year 92 - she can't move anything. We drop out of the game, restart Steam, and restart our computers but nothing fixes it. Suddenly she's allowed to make moves and the story line continues. I notice she's still showing as disconnected but she shows us both connected. I can't progress because the game shows she hasn't made her moves but she moves forward 2 more years. We kill the game and reload from year 67 (the previous night) to continue our game. Only a few scenarios are the same and we're making different decisions based upon different options being presented to us. We get to year 77 when we start noticing sever lag again. Save.  We get to year 81 before she's unable to make moves again. We both close the game and open again. I show her disconnected and she shows me connected. She's able to progress but I can't make any moves. She was disconnected after clicking ""End Year"". We tried several times to reconnect but to no avail.

I've got tens of thousands of hours between Civilization titles, Total War titles, and Europa Universalis 4, so I am in the target audience for this game.

First, the positives:
- Art and graphics are excellent
- Music is amazing
- Names of people, places and etc. all show attention to research of each civilization
- It is NOT a pure sim clone and tries to add some genuinely different ideas to the 4x landscape that Civ hasn't
- Lots of good dials and switches at game creation time to configure a scenario/game to your liking

Now the Negatives:
- the family/dynasty system is too easy to cheese
- Ruling family intrigue is well written but utterly a ""pick from the 3 options which gives you the best bonuses"" affair that seems to slow the game and waste time
- Too few leaders.  After a few playthroughs you'll know the way to beat the game with each leader and victory type
- Too easy to accidentally win.  Without any cheats whatsoever, I won a ""double victory"" in fewer than 75 turns.
- The rules of the city building are clever, but it is too hard to know what buildings you can build where (2 adjacent urban tiles/planning issues)

After about 60 hours, I'm going back to Civ 6 until an expansion or DLC addresses these issues.

It is somewhat unavoidable to contrast it with some of the prominent similar games (That's a lie, here: I played it and it's fun but also a time trap because of how it is fun so sometimes I end up extremely tired.), so here is how I relate to those things:

Comparison with CK and Civ:
Between CK and Civ, OW is much more like Civ. However, it does exactly what I've been missing from all the Civ variants and such after Civ 5: Innovate in interesting new directions. Or, to be fair to the uniqueness of both: They draw from the same well, but OW's well does not taste stale to me yet at all.

The elements with which OW resembles CK do not make me think of it as CK-like at it's core. In a bad musical metaphor: OW is not so much a song from the same genre as CK but a song from OW's (or Civ's) genre, but using some instruments that are more commonly associated with CK's genre, making for a novel and fun mixture. (Specifically: CK is more of (or shines played as) an open-ended story generating-role playing (in the pen and paper sense) type game whereas OW very much has specific game goals aimed at 'winning'.

On the positive side:
[list]
[*] the AI plays competitively (good in tactical combat, focuses on an overall strategy-- Rome focusing on expansion, Greece on building wonders, etc)
[*] resource management is a challenge for the first half of the game (i.e. how can I get stone for building X, wood for unit Y) 
[*] the musical tracks feel authentic to the world
[/list]

So why I am unhappy with Old World?
[olist]
[*] Lack of control over character (ruler) profession/progression. Old World has a popup when a new ruler comes of age to choose between 3 random professions, i.e. Tactician, Delver, Cultivator. The choices may be irrelevant to the player's current strategy and once chosen, cannot be changed for the lifetime of the ruler. While there is randomness in Crusader Kings, including the education trait assigned upon coming of age, the focus system effectively allows the player the ability to choose the profession and plan progression. 
[*] Random tech selection makes it difficult to pursue a tech strategy. This is one of my favorite aspects of Civilization 4: planning longer term tech strategy (a.k.a. bee lining) to gain an edge/pursue a victory condition. By default (without the right leader and without the Oracle) the Old World research choice at each step is between 3 random techs, 1 of those might be a resource bundle/court minister/unit, so the choice is often effectively just between 2 techs. It is difficult to plan how to obtain a tech a few levels deep in the tree with this random draw at each step.
[*] The Ambition Victory does not achieve the goal of a customized, story-driven victory condition. Unlike Crusader Kings, and like Civilization, Old World wants the player to play to win and not play for emergent stories. In Old World, the ambition victory consists of completing a non-deterministic sequence of tasks (i.e. found 4 cities, research a specific 2 technologies). After each task is fulfilled, the player is given a choice (after a few turns delay) between 2 new tasks. But the tasks are not connected to each other, either in logical progression (i.e. the next task clearly does not depend on the fact the player founded 4 cities in the previous task) or in narrative (there is narrative text, but they don't tell a connected story the way Quest Victory works in Endless Legend). One nod to the character driven story is that ambition victory tasks expire when a ruler (character) dies, enabling a different task to be chosen. But the final task (to win the game) does not expire. So if my diplomat ruler selected ""make peace with all factions"" (peace being a more difficult state to achieve than truce), her warlike daughter (and all future descendants) is stuck with that win condition for Ambition Victory.

First and foremost it's a 4x, along the lines of Civilization. The personality system takes clear inspiration from Crusader Kings, but the game plays nothing like it. Like in Civilization, the crux of the gameplay is about exploring, expanding and, ultimately, exterminating. The game is focused more on combat than series like Civilization or Humankind - and make no mistake, war is a big part of Old World.

It's not for the faint of heart. It's a good bit more complex than Civ, but as with all of Soren Johnson's games, there's true depth in there. Here's why:

- The orders system. This is the big one, and it's THE single great innovation Old World brings to the table. The crux of it is that you have a limited number of actions each turn with which to control your units and run your empire. Almost everything you can do in the game takes orders, and if you don't have enough, you'll have to pick and choose which military units you get to move, or which governor you want to assign. If you have enough orders, you can force march units, sending them halfway across the map to do something really important – although this comes at a heavy price. The AI is bound by these rules too, so everything is fair.

- The events system. There are [i]thousands[/i] of events that can give your units, cities and characters all sorts of bonuses and penalties. They’re very well written, and they interact with the game in a healthy way.

- Its resource-based economy. Wood, stone and iron are all required separately to build units and buildings. This economy is supported by a dynamic open market where prices rise and fall, similar to that in Offworld Trading Company. Even city production is split between three other resources that collectively replace the generic production resource from Civ games.

- The working AI. Seriously, it's a good AI, and it works within the parameters of a 1 unit per tile combat system. This is arguably its single most impressive accomplishment. It’ll give you a real challenge.

- The combat system. This is probably the biggest departure the game makes from Civilization. It’ll take some getting used to, and there are a lot of complaints about it, but there’s some real depth there. I think it works considerably better than the current system in Civilization. 

- It's being actively balanced - as of writing, but there's no indication that will change any time soon.

I have one or two minor criticisms – my biggest by far is that higher difficulties are balanced by giving the AI a large head-start, with relatively minor production and science advantages thereafter. This creates a completely different experience from lower difficulties, which feel much more organic, but offer little challenge to experienced players. Also, the documentation is patchy, and there are important concepts hidden underneath layers of UI tooltips that need to be more prominent. This continues to be a work in progress, though, and the devs are very active on the game’s discord. Another work in progress is the game’s performance, which remains sluggish on all but the fastest machines. 

Overall, though, the game is really an exceptional piece of work. Definitely give it a go if you’re into complex strategy games. Soren Johnson is the best strategy game designer out there, for my money. I've sunk hundreds of hours into both Civ4 and Offworld Trading Company; the man knows how to make games.",1657958969,1657958969,True,17,0,0.629696309566497803,0,True,False,False

*Detailed, immersive events
*Specialized ""production"" mechanisms (growth produces workers, training produces units, civics produce projects and specialists)
*Brilliant Orders mechanism (perhaps borrowed from board games where it is a common mechanic) where you have a given number of total orders to make per turn
*Workers construct buildings directly on the map independent from city production making them a more crucial, integral part of the overall game
*Direct relationship to resources (gain units of stone, wood, etc, and expend these units on roads, buildings, etc)
*Play a character who ages and dies and then become the heir
*Family tree screen shows you all of your relatives and the line of descent through characters you've played
*Navigate both international politics and internal politics through individual characters, families, and religions
*Cities, units, and characters belong to one of three noble families of your nation, each family having different benefits (for example, the workers of one of the families can build multiple roads per turn), and also having benefits for units/cities of matching families
*Gain and lose legitimacy for your choices and achievements which impacts how many Orders you earn each turn
*Unusually diverse soundtrack and the ability to disable individual tracks
*Ability to harvest resources directly from the map with units of all kinds (spawning various events)
*Training units is not bounded by gaining experience in battle; units can be trained by spending training or by leaving them at a barracks/range to acquire skill
*Anchor boats at coasts in order to allow any units to convoy
*The game doesn't go up to modern times

[h1]Upsides[/h1]
*Old World gives you a lot of leeway to make any particular thing happen in a turn through the Orders mechanism; Instead of units being capped arbitrarily low in their movement speed (and other similar caps), your overall turn is capped by Orders to spend, meaning that you can combine an expenditure of Orders and Training to bring a single unit across the map in a single turn (potentially at the expense of being able to do much else that turn). This gives you incredible rulership flexibility!
*Characters can become governors or generals, or your ambassador, chancellor, leader, or spymaster, giving their attributes, history, opinion of you, and so forth, different implications depending on their role
*Unusually customizable options for AI difficulty at game start
*Many aspects of 4X games which feel mechanical have been converted into themed events in Old World, including winning the game
*Watch a replay of your game and export the .gif to share with friends
*Highly detailed end-game reports
*By halting prior to modern times, the game stays beautiful throughout. No ugly cars, no concrete buildings, no obnoxious jets, etc. I've always become incredibly sick of Civ games due to the late-game sound effects alone, but Old World takes the gold of playing Civ and cuts out the rest.
*Because Old World is focused on a particular area and time period, the history of this time is much more deeply explored with less-known military concepts and other themes of the time.
*Highly responsive developers who are actually listening to real-time feedback in Discord

[h1]Downsides[/h1]
*Events become more routine and less immersive after 30-45 hours of game play. While Old World boasts over 10,000 events, you're not likely to see 90% of them unless you break out of your preferred play-style and take weird risks. 
*Many of the events come in a strange order (like getting a burial/death event/announcement after already getting all the notifications about the ramifications of said death).
*Further event streamlining is required to give the game a longer-lasting immersive feeling; for example, after being married to a husband who was very much 'in love with' me for fifty or more years, nothing at all special happened when he died. As a player essentially role-playing a character, that felt wrong.
*While I love the portraits of all the characters, this area needs work. The backgrounds are repetitive/identical which seems weird. Some of the same portraits come up in the same game. Worse, I once had two children side-by-side with identical portraits. Furthermore, I found it very odd when two obviously white-looking parents gave birth to a nappy-haired (and very beautiful) daughter. I would have been happy to have this daughter if I'd married a matching father, but as it was it made me look like I was unfaithful!
*Soundtrack may actually be too diverse to sound cohesive to most listeners.
*The tutorial manages to be confusing, too informative, and not informative enough all at once; I would have been happier if I'd skipped most of the tutorial instead of sticking with it all the way to the end.
*The in-game encyclopedia generally doesn't offer you any useful information beyond pop-ups and hover-over information, making it seem generally useless whenever I've tried to seek information from it.
*There isn't any way to customize your units (the way there is in Beyond Earth, Alpha Centari, and Endless Legend).
*Like all 4X games, the end game moves gradually into the territory of tedious and feels anti-climatic.

[h1]Mind-blown Factors[/h1]
*I usually find all story-based RPG games and in-game events tiresome and boring. I click through them. If I wanted a novel, I'd be in my cozy reading place reading a novel (which I do for over an hour every day). When I play a game, I want action. But Old World changed that for me. I've been a serious gamer since I was a child, and I'm a board game creator and publisher in real life, and 4X games are my favorite kind of game. So believe me when I say this is a [i]big deal[/i] for me that Old World is the very first game where I have actually read the events! I was actually so captivated by the events in my first play-through that I was brought to tears twice! (This was, of course, during the honeymoon phase.)
*Playing this game feels like the developers were reading my thoughts over the past twenty-seven years of playing Civilization games (going all the way back to Civ I). Ideas I've had, complaints I've had – they've been taken into account, and I'm impressed. I'm a tough critic, but Old World is really, really good!

[h1]Conclusions[/h1]
*While Old World doesn't rate higher than Endless Legend in my book thus far, it has the potential to with further refinement and expansions. After all, Endless Legend wasn't nearly as awesome prior to the expansions that added water dynamics, winter, and dust eclipses. That said, Old World is really up there, above Beyond Earth in my book, as well as all the other 4X games currently available. I enjoyed Thea, Civilization I-VI, Test of Time, Warlock, Humankind, and others, but Old World really takes the cake right now for it's level of innovation and beauty. (Test of Time, in its day, was perhaps more innovative relative to anything available at the time and I loved the heck out of that game in my early teens.) (Humankind has thus far actually been a disappointment.) More simply put, [b]Old World is currently my second-favorite 4X game of all time, and has the potential to become my favorite with deepening expansions.[/b]
*I will likely continue playing this game for years to come. I'm at around 60 hours of gameplay as I write this and nearing the end of my second game. With each game taking 20 to 45 hours (depending on settings and approach), I foresee me getting around 100 hours of game play out of this game per year for the next three years. (After that, who knows?)
*If Old World releases expansions and/or DLC I will absolutely buy them.",1657843259,1657897978,True,3,0,0.531345129013061523,0,True,False,False

That said, there are important differences that ensure that approaching Old World like a standard game of Civilization will likely end...poorly...

I definitely recommend new players start with at least the first few segments of the tutorial (not going to lie, it got too lengthy eventually and I decided to bail and just learn the rest ""on the fly"" once I thought the basics had been covered. Once begun, allow your 4x skills to go crazy, emphasis on explore and expand!

PROS: Having to appease rival families within your own empire makes for a novel twist. Receiving in-game goals that can contribute to one of several winning scenarios also helps diversify the action and can provide a strategic midgame ""Plan B"" option if you realize, as I did, that your Plan A route to winning suddenly looked murkier than you had anticipated. The abundance of seemingly ""random"" events and choice points that pop up also adds diversity to the game and helps Old World to feel unique within the genre. Personally, I was also a fan of the fact that the game plays faster than Civ (a game can last up to 200 turns, which for me clocked in at roughly 37 hours of game play). The soundtrack was also wonderful, once your civilization has discovered music and it actually begins to play. But it's that sort of little detail that makes the game enjoyable. 

CONS: I may have missed checking a box somewhere, but the map edges are the edges of the world, there is no wrap-around. For my system, admittedly not the top-end of the heap for gaming systems, but also comfortably within all system requirements, the game bogged down and got clunky late when entangling alliances sent 4 nations into a round-robin sort of war and dozens of military units were on the board, even after scaling back graphics quality and sound. Also, despite improvements on Civ, there are still times in that the game can devolve into mindless space bar pressing as units are idled. The later-game ability to automate workers and acolytes helps speed things along, but once automated, good luck finding your units, much less learning what they are up to (as best I can tell, none of my automatons did anything that I would declare harmful or mindless...if anything they may have helped my workers correct some of my newbie mistakes. For the segment of the population that actually cares about public relations and how the other nations feel about you in the game, brace yourself for some frustration as other states' outlooks can vacillate quickly between pleased, angry and upset (even people in your own kingdom can change opinions with startling speed). Sometimes it is obvious what triggered this enmity. Other times you'll find yourself hated with nary an indication of why the sudden swing occurred (this seemed especially the case early in the game and ebbed as time went on). They say religion in the game is important, but I'll be honest...I'm really unclear WHY. Sure, it makes minor impacts on how those of differing religions view you, but it hardly seemed what I would classify as ""important"" when compared to things like, oh, I don't know, developing enough military units to take care of annoying tribes and barbarians or planning your cities well to utilize terrain features. There were also little details about the Spymaster elements of the game that I found annoying...an assassination plot on one ruler continuing beyond their death, beyond the death of their next in line, and finally striking when the target's granddaughter rose to the throne was a surprise...if I ask for a specific person to be killed and they die of natural causes...STOP PLOTTING and let natural causes take the heat! Similarly, if I disrupt a foreign influence attempting to stir rebellion in one of my cities, shouldn't I know WHICH foreign entity it was...because payback is a bi...g necessity!!

Look, I'll be honest with this review...there's probably game elements still lurking that I'm oblivious to because no way does a person cover everything the game has in a single run. That said, having played it through once I will absolutely cannot wait to start a new game and implement the lessons learned from the first attempt and conquering the Old World.

I stand by my original review's critical statements but have found the mechanics enjoyable enough to mess around with that I can't warrant a non-recommendation. That being said in no way can I speak to the balance of this game, it just has a lot of buttons and knobs to twist and that keeps my stupid brain occupied.

This game is a passable entry in the genre, but isn't going to be enjoyable to anyone not a die hard fan of these types of game. It's not a good enough teacher to lead someone to water unless they're thirsty, and it really has very little character through the Art and Music.

---original

It's not user friendly at the least. The tutorials are pedantic and exhaustively boring while somehow not covering enough of the gameplay. It teaches you how to play civilization like you've never touched it before, while simultaneously not teaching you enough about any new systems it introduced. What are all these resources I am generating? The game keeps telling me my my children can get tutored yet there is no way presented to actually do so. 

The F1 key that should open the guide to tutoring opens to a page on ""Dog ownership"" (which has absolutely no information on it and is just the default landing page for the game's beta in game encyclopedia). The one wiki I found outside the game says this is a mission you can send you're courtiers on but none of mine have the option even in a regular game. I went back to the mission section of the in-game guide and there are mission for tutoring, now if only I can access them from a character when sending them on missions. There is clearly confusion because the one redditor asking the question is told that it just happens automatically and that is the full discussion thread.

Look I know I am banging on one example here but I really don't understand what the focus is on. Why are you teaching me how to pan a camera like I haven't played any other game on the face of the earth while not explaining how to tutor my son which comes up in like tutorial 2 or 3.

I'll keep playing the game, but right now I am playing a game of trying to determine how this game works:
- There is no viable wiki source
- Your in game encyclopedia is an honest to god joke in both layout and content, it looks like an alpha feature
- Your tutorials feel like they are there because they were asked to be

Tell you what. When I get to actually playing the game, I'll leave a review about whether I thought the process of learning it was enjoyable enough for the payoff versus the many other entries in this genre. 8 Hours in I expect to not still be struggling with a basic mission.

Beyond usability the game:
- Has average graphics. They are competent but ultimately devoid of any theme or style that makes them anything more than serviceable as placeholders for their real world counterparts.
- Sound is about as inspired as the graphics.
- It really is just civilization + crusader kings. Or to describe it another way it feels like a collection of smart gameplay mechanics from across the grand strategy triple A list. You've got characters and events from CK, along with missions, character opinion management and child rearing. You've got wonders, hexes, workers and resources like Civilization. While I have not played Humankind because I think it needs to bake for a bit I feel like the scouts harvesting resources mechanic likely takes a bit from their tribal wandering mechanic. You've got a tech deck and hand like Stellaris. It's a smart curation but ultimately I am not sure games are just collections of features and this one feels a bit like a greatest hits album and less like Pink Floyd's The Wall or Frank Ocean's Channel Orange. It takes little risk except in mixing themes and I am not sure that's risky enough to make anything great.

Also I feel like this game should be in Early Access given how unpolished the UI and in-game tutorials/guides are. This is actually exactly what I think an early access title should be, competent game with light bugs that needs some polish. Especially a game that isn't really trying anything risky or novel.

--- update 7/8

Post playing, all the my original review above still stands in its criticism, but the game mechanics are quite enjoyable to play around with. Once you get a hang of it the game plays fairly intuitively and frankly better than civ at this point. Not having to utilize the encyclopedia improves the game. 

Holding shift and hitting F1 over bold words opens nothing but whatever random page it decides to pull. In my current play, Archive 3, until i navigate to a different tab then it will be that. The information is still of minimal use. For instance the entry for Tutor:

""Courtier can tutor Royal children at least 10 years old.""

Courtier and Royal are bold in the above entry. When moused over in the encyclopedia Courtier will display the entry in the encyclopedia for itself, which includes the 4 Courtier types. I believe there maybe a bug here where the bold ""type"" has a prefix of Court (so ""Court Scholar"" for instance). These merely return the text for Courtier, so you need to manually search for Scholar.

Within Scholar it only list ""Leader Mission: Tutor Child (as Leader)"" leading me back to assuming that either only Leader Scholars can tutor or only Leader Scholars can tutor in addition to any Courtier.

I am fairly positive the opportunity to tutor a child comes up without a scholar or instruction within the tutorial, though perhaps it is explained later as I frankly couldn't bare to sit through them and was already fairly confused by tutoring and figured it might come out in gameplay. Unfortunately I started as Rome and was equally confused as how to tutor with him. Eventually Babylon gave me the hint I needed.

""We can improve this by also making the mission available when clicking on the Courtier and listing all of the characters that they can tutor""

This was already the case when I finally had a scholar available as a Courtier, though it was not clear only your leader and up to 1 Scholar Courtier can tutor until I attempted to find more scholars.

Hitting F1 in the encyclopedia closes it, and clicking the bold text does nothing for a vast amount of bold text and most of the section on Tutors. I at first thought nothing was hyperlinked but started clicking around and found hyperlinked examples, it is not the rule. So the encyclopedia is simply a sporadically hyperlinked collection of mouse over text. So far the only place F1 has done anything has been clicking on attributes and resource on the overview screen. Clicking it over improvements on the map, units and portraits does nothing nor does it work on the locked mouse over information.

Now this could be a serendipitous trip down a bug hole but it starts in your tutorial making me feel that few if anyone bug tested both the tutorial and the encyclopedia.

Perhaps it also should have been clear that I needed a scholar to tutor, but I really don't feel that a fair assumption being how heavily this borrows from both games it is inspired by. CK allows any lifestyle to tutor and while lifestyle may not be a direct comparison the Courtier type both your concept and theirs heavily borrow from the idea of a ""class"" for your character(s).

I may be too critical, but I kind of expected the individual who created the encyclopedia to have put a bit more effort into communicating the game concepts beyond them simply printing the mouse over text and some sporadic hyperlinking. There isn't even any landing window for the ""categories"" you placed the mouse over content in.",1656432460,1657289714,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has been widely described as a cross between Civilization and Crusader Kings.  I have 2,703 combined hours in Civilization, and 2,013 combined hours in Crusader Kings.  So I am clearly in the target audience, but I was deeply skeptical that they would be able to pull it off.  Let's just say, the bar was set pretty high as far as my expectations went.

They passed with flying colors.  The 4x elements may seem familiar to Civ players on the surface, but under the covers this is a very different game.  The dynastic elements are nowhere as deep as in CK, but in some aspects they actually have more impact on the way you are able to play your empire.  Overall, I am impressed.

The only disappointment, so far, is that there doesn't seem to be a lot of difference in gameplay between the different civilizations.  There is flavor, to be sure, and I'm sure you could roleplay your civilization with regard to things like slavery and so on.  But I am finding that I tend to play each civilization much like any other.

One thing that I really enjoy, versus Civilization, is that it feels like the gloves are off.  There is no whining about grievances or so-called warmongering.  There is no casus belli.    Those who can conquer their neighbors will do so, with no more justification than an expectation of victory.  Be on the right side of that equation, or prepare to get stomped.

Basically keeps all moves meaningful and crushes some busywork creep as game goes by.  No endlessly scouting or building improvements because ""well its better than doing nothing"" -- you always want those orders for something else.  

I found the character system a little annoying at first unitl I started playing my games as ""semesters"" per turn instead of ""years"" -- makes characters live a lot longer, reducing the busy work inherent in the system (and also can make it devastating when your leader dies!)

The combination of internal and external politics makes the building of your empire and dynasty not quite like anything that's come before. But even though this is a solid recommendation, elements of the game feel a little rough.

There's a lot of systems and elements in Old World. As a fairly experienced strategy gamer, this is the first game in a long while where I've had to play the tutorial. Even so, it took me a few aborted games to feel like I got a handle on the various systems but, when it all comes together, Old World is very cool.

There's nothing particularly new in Old World, but it's a neat fusion of various ideas. The concept is great and the execution mostly works, except there are points and times where it feels like all the systems are grinding together unevenly rather than rolling along smoothly. Most of this in fact comes from the combination of the two games where the game tries to juggle the macro-style gameplay of CK2 with the Civ style of micromanagement.

My biggest problem with Old World is the combat system. It might be fine against human players but the AI's habit of spamming dozens of ranged units makes it a slog to play against. So, there's a whole side of the game I did my best not to engage with just because of how un-fun it was to watch everything I fielded get demolished by a dozen archers firing from multiple hexes away. It's kind of the problem of Old World in a nutshell, really -- there's all these combat systems with panic and routing and splash damage, but massed ranged units seem to crush everything without much issue. It's doubly unfortunate because Old World leans much more into being a game of conquest than Civ, Humankind, and others do.

But all in all, I like it. I like the focus on one particular era. I like the internal/external political stuff and how interactions in one can affect the other. The art and music is great. It's just uneven and in need of expansion, or even a sequel. Even so, if you like the sound of a Civ-alike with internal politics and a focus on the ancient and classical eras (and you have time to grapple with the learning curve) then you'll probably enjoy Old World.

Been playing 4X games since 1997 or so, and this one being in my favorite historical era (Ancient) doesn't help. I should like to play as Babylonians, Assyrians, or Romans, but after a couple of hours I just wasn't interested. I literally had to force myself to play half an hour a time and I still didn't want to continue after a while.

Many mechanics just make no sense and are counter-intuitive and unrealistic. Like the ability to have a pool of orders that you can use to multiple times move a unit per turn. O...kay. Weird. So one scout can run around half a map in one turn, sweet. Nonsensical. And then, you can still attack once per turn since the unit is ""on cooldown"". Huh? How an enemy turn is supposed to work? Turns are artificial as they are already, so why make it even more artificial and unrealistic with those order mechanics?

As for other things, I admit I simply lost interest very quickly in playing. The tech tree looks extremely short for a 4X game, for one. This of course means the unit roster is comparatively smaller than you would get in any competitor. Building cities seem like a combination of worst ideas of district management (how I hate those) and field yields. What you can build in cities is... weird? Gimmick, again?

One the one hand, it has a lot of options, and if you love games like Civ or EU4 chances are high that you dig that one too. Then again, some details are off imho: you can not really rush or intercept in the early game, because almost everything depends on action points, namely ""orders"", which are limited, especially in the very beginning. In combination with not being able to pick your research exactly as you need to, make some games a bit liike a lottery ticket. When you are already 1-2 hours into a game, and you get stuck or bleeding substance because of it, whiile fending of an stronger enemy and not really being able to communicate with the other nations and tribes is somewhat annoying at best. Almost everything takes place via orders: military, civilians, building, generals, your council, govs, you name it.

But the thing i like most about this game is the music including the one from the dlc.
I really wish they would give us at least a spotify playlist link for that (if Mohawk Games can't give us the music via album due copyright. Almost every artist and song is available there, like those from Philip Glass, exept for some of your own songs (Yes i mean you, CEO Leyla Johnson.))
That, and the UNDO function ctrl+Z.

Edit: after playing a bit more, i would give that game a 70%. I would not have picked that one on my experience now. The UI for micromanaging is outdated. You always have to click through everything to be informed, it does not offer you all your choices you can make one click away or making it one, two steps too far to be convenient.

You have to manage basic resources (wood, stone, metal, gold, food) which are required for most activities, and 4 kinds of human generated resources (civics, used to pass laws and build civic building, training used to build most military units, growth used to generate new specialists and workers/settlers, culture whose use is rather passive).

Some things are missing : hides resources (used for many old armors), differences between attack and defense values (not that is really would be that important), some better use for the culture ressource.

The gameplay is similar to civilization, but the game is not forgiving ; you can't skip on military units and expect to survive. Barbarians are nasty, and so are your neighbours. Unlike civilization, you don't settle cities where you wish, but you must use a predifined city site, usually already occupied by barbarians whom you have to either convince or forcefully eject.

Cities are improved through varied buildings a la civilzation, and you can also build so called wonders. Unlike civilization, you don't have to actually work the tiles which you improve : they are automatically productive, and this is a point which I regret : your small village could in theory extract resources from a very large region. You just have to send workers to improve the tile. However, you can improve any worked tile (building or countryside) by develipping a citizen there, whic improve that tile output. City buildings have three tiers for specialists, so that they can indeed become very productive.

The game also features a unique mecanism by which you can only give a limited number of orders each turn. This adds a new depth and realistic layer to the game. One of the effect of this system is that it is useless to produce too many workers : you wouldn't have enough orders to command them all. Also, when you're waring, you use most of your orders to manage your army, bring reinfotvements and so on ; in consequence, your civil development may come to a standstill. That's also a very welcome novelty.

Overall, the gameplay is very reminiscent of civilization. However, the varied resource types and very adverse environment makes the game much more enjoyable and challenging. You are always short on one or the other kind of resource, and always wondering wether you military is strong enough.

== IN BRIEF

It's Civ with less content (and slightly better balance) crossed with Crusader Kings with much, much less content and depth. UI is adequate. The AI is utterly nonthreatening unless you massively handicap yourself, but that's par for the course in a 4X.

No one element stands out, in fact nearly every element feels tacked-on and incomplete. There's a character limit for Steam reviews, so I'll only expand on the most hyped and thus most disappointing of these elements, namely:

== THE ORDERS SYSTEM

This was supposed to be a big part of this game's edge. Instead of letting players endlessly micromanage each and every one of their units, orders would be a limited resource, forcing players to use them only for relatively meaningful decisions, and to otherwise let their civilization run itself.

The reality falls short of this goal in at least two ways.

Firstly, the game is *bursting* with micromanagement. Orders are technically finite, but if you play halfway-competently (maintaining a high Legitimacy stat), you'll end most turns with an order surplus. Unless you're waging war on 2+ fronts, maintaining 2+ builders per city, and constantly giving all of your council members assignments, orders simply aren't a bottleneck.

Secondly, there is no management except micromanagement. You can't, say, have a unit besiege a city and expect it to make progress without further input. You can't leave a unit in a blocking position on the Eastern front and while you spend all your orders on high-octane maneuver warfare in the Western front.

A unit without orders isn't a blocker, it's a paperweight. Units literally don't deal damage unless ordered to attack. Or rather, they deal precisely one (utterly negligible) point of counterattack damage, which frankly feels like a vestigial holdover from an earlier version of the game. Workers similarly do absolutely nothing unless you spend orders on them. If orders were ever actually in short supply, I imagine this would get frustrating.

In summation, they're literally worse than Imperial Focus Points, and that's just sad.",1656539712,1656539712,False,9,0,0.580671310424804688,1,True,False,False

The order system is one of the best new ideas introduced. Now almost every action you take consumes orders so instead of mindless micromanagement deciding how to spend your orders now actually becomes an interesting decision and you never have enough order to do everything you want. 

Resources & economy work in an interesting way where production and raw material resources are separated. Productions is also split into 3 different categories depending on what type of category you are building from. There is a total of 13 yields with the addition of strategic and luxury resources giving the game far more depth than you would traditionally expect.  

To top it off the game actually has a good AI that can play competitively and doesn’t just rely on bonuses alone. Coupled with a warfare system that gives units high mobility and favours attacking over defending waging war is a serious business and should not be taken lightly. You can’t just rely on AI suiciding his armies on your well defended position to win. Also due to the limited orders waging war can really halt your economic development. 

Characters and events are another great addition that adds more flavour to the game. Having nations consisting of a collection of people with different personalities that die and get replaced instead of being a homogeneous mass lead by an immortal leader is infinitely more interesting and dynamic. In addition to foreign rulers you will have to manage relations with your noble families, different religions, councillors, governors and generals as well. All this results in a far more interesting diplomacy.  

While tech tree is fairly standard for such a game adding an element of tech draw where you can only choose between a limited set of technologies makes it fair bit more intriguing and can result in interesting decisions when two very important technologies show up at the same time making you forgo the other one for a period of time. One time boosters that are lost forever if you don’t pick them occasionally add additional tough decision points. 

The cherry on top of it all is a truly amazing soundtrack by Cristopher Tin that really evokes the theme of the era well. 

In a lot of ways the game is very similar to Civilization but also very different from it at the same time. So if you like Civilization it’s highly likely that you would enjoy this game as well and it’s fresh enough for even experienced players.

#1 - Civ is less convoluted. I appreciate what Soren was going for, but there's just too much to juggle for most players, probably. All the resources for building basic stuff becomes a lot to micro, and it doesn't pay off that well to put so much effort into building stuff that might only be adding to yields for a few dozen turns. Which gets to the other problems...

#2 - An OW match is just 200 turns or so, often less. Because of how the victory points add up and ambitions play out, a lot of playthroughs only go for 150 to 200 turns. Which means that anything that took 20 turns to build was something that took a whopping 10% of the total turns to construct. This is a huge, huge issue... in Civ, a wonder might take 10% of total played turns to build in a game. Like 40 turns to build a wonder, and you play to 400 maybe, so, cool, whatever. But in this, if you took 10-15 turns to build one unit (which can happen in this), then that unit is 10% of that city's total production for the whole game. This all means that constructing buildings in the late game is pretty much worthless.

#3 - For all the turns and resources to build buildings, they are pretty bad. If I am going to spend 10% of a city's game-long production on a building, it better be powerful. And they just aren't. The pay-off to build buildings is below average, and if you built it on turn 100, you might get a nice 20-50 turns of use out of it. But even if the game went 600 turns like Civ can, the yield from some buildings is so low that you'd *still* not want to waste time building them.

#4 - It's 7 sides (8 with DLC) in only the ancient/classical era. Compare that to Civ, or even Human Kind: HK and Civ both go from ancient to near-future. If OW really made the most of the ancient/classical timeframe, it might work, but it doesn't. It just feels like a Civ game on Marathon that stops if you go beyond the Classical era.

#5 - The difficulty is an issue. On the *third* difficulty level, the CPU players can get *2 or more free CITIES on start*. Sure, it creates a challenge, but it's the worst kind of challenge. With so many difficulty levels, OW really has no need to ramp up the difficulty via such obviously OP freebies to CPUs on just its third difficulty level.

#6 - Can't settle wherever you want. OW is a 3.5X because eXpansion is so limited.


Overall, it's a shame that so much is not that well done, because the combat system is interesting, the tile improvements and wonders are largely fun, and the character traits are a nice addition. But all those good ideas are squandered on a game that feels like a tech demo... it's 200 turns or less, in about 1/5th of the tech tree of Civ or HK.",1655577583,1656313230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really like the idea of anchoring ships between land destinations, in order to transport troops. It brings some more realism to tactics and gives additional challenge.
Big pile of perks to choose from, when improving military units gives us much broader spectrum of specialization and how we want to fight.
Generals actually matter. Matter a lot!
Things that were taken from CK3, like spying, marriages, court plots, etc. which i really missed in original Civilization games.

If, on the other hand, you want something 'more' than civ and humankind didn't quite live up to your hopes and expectations either, give this a go. The game is all round fun and the AI actually poses a serious threat. Diplomacy matters and is generally sensible. 

Building is limited to predefined spots, but this is a good thing. The AI can't abuse its (early) advantage and paint the map with nonsense cities. (Nor can you, obviously.) This puts an effective stop to insane tech advantages or other types of spam. 

The game has an interesting take on the action economy: everything you do costs orders, which are in limited supply. Multiple wars on several fronts are deadly as you will find yourself unable to 'order' all of your troops around, not to mention your civil economy is generally put on hold during conflict. 

You will have to contend with different families and characters. An untimely death or a nasty event can really impact your game, but settings allow one to finetune the possible impact of the 'human factor'. 

Replayability is an issue, sadly. Despite claims to the contrary there are only minor differences between factions that generally don't affect either strategies or tactics. (Won the game on 'glorious' difficulty at least once with every faction.)

For example, I've seen a lot of people criticize certain aspects of war, namely the ability of an opposing unit to run across the map out of nowhere and ambush your units. I completely agree--it's frustrating, I thinking, developing a front line, only to have an opposing unit simply walk around the entire thing and assault your protected units. But, luckily, there is an option to disable ""Force March""--the mechanic allowing this gameplay--in the settings. Problem solved! Others mention frustration over frequent character deaths. While realistic, I personally enjoy building up the stats of my characters over an extended period of time. Luckily, again, there's a setting for this! You can set the character life as ""Long,"" and, beyond that, you can turn the turn scale to semesters, rather than years. By doing this, over the course of 200 turns, it is quite possible you'll only have 2 or 3 rulers. Aside from what I've mentioned, there's a lot more to change in the settings, which, I think, address many complaints I've seen.

I also love the diplomacy of Old World: there are so many ways to make a country love you, hate you, or anything in between. And, more so than Civ, diplomacy is important. In contrast to Civ, early war in Old World usually is not a good idea--it takes awhile to reach the  military might of rival nations. So, to mitigate the chances of untimely war, keeping other countries happy is important. Then, if you frustrate a powerful nation, rarely will they every declare war on you without an option of peace. Rather, seeing that you're weak, they'll demand money, or food, or, if you refuse, war. I love this! For one, it brings constant, weighty decisions to gameplay: do I sacrifice resources to maintain peace, or do I stand my ground? For two, it's much more realistic than having a nation randomly declare war (I'm looking at you, Civ). After all, before marching to Athens, Xerxes commanded food and water from Greek cities in exchange for peace. But if, like Athens and Sparta, you decide to stand your ground against a greater force, then, like Athens and Sparta, you can use diplomacy to gather aid in the coming war. In my last game, for example, I grew sick of sending all my money to Rome, so, naturally, they declared war. I was outmatched, certainly. Not only was their military more advanced, but it outnumbered my own like the Persians in Thermopylae (it's worth mentioning, too, the AI of Old World is fairly decent at battle). Thankfully, I knew the war was coming, and had spent the past few turns building my relations with Greece--a nation surpassing the military might of Rome itself. As soon as Rome declared war on myself, I kindly requested that Greece declare war on Rome, which they accepted, albeit for a price. Within a few turns, Greece had sent troops to my city to aid in the war--a war which we eventually won. Through diplomacy, I've won quite a few games without building a reputable military or conquering cities. Usually, I just make friends with the larger armies and ask them kindly to beat up the bully. 

This review is long, so I'll finish with talking about events, which I love (and, like everything else, they can be tampered with in the settings). Something I've always missed in Civ was the realism of an empire. For example, to start the Persian war (I just read The Histories, how could you tell?), Aristagoras, a disgruntled Persian stationed in Miletus, began an Ionian revolt against the empire with the aid of Athens. Because he recruited Athens, and because Athens assisted in the revolt, Darius (and then Xerxes) decided to lead an army into Greece. Here, we see something common in ancient histories: internal events shaping the course of a nation. In games like Civ, you really miss any internal drama, which, to me, makes the empire feel synthetic. In Old World, however, plenty of interesting events arise to give your nation character. In a recent game, I decided to change the heir of my thrown (I really didn't like the prince in line). As a result, the prince, understandably, became vengeful. Fastforward a bit, and someone is trying to assassinate me, which I have reason to believe is the prince. Here, I have a decision: I could throw him in jail on suspicion, or I could see what happens. I waited it out, and, eventually, he was caught with a knife preparing to kill me. Here, the event-system gives me the choice: I could 1) kill him, 2) exile him, or 3) forgive him. I chose to exile him to a distant city, and for awhile things were fine. I was warring with Rome, had recruited Greece to help, and had honestly forgotten about this dishonorable prince, when, suddenly, he led a revolt. Great. I honest said aloud: ""That b****!"" So, I let the Greeks handle the Romans to the north while I took care of the revolt to the south. And, in that moment, I felt my empire was living. 

Really, there is a lot more I could discuss that I enjoy: wonders, the victory system, the way technology works, the pacing, etc.. But I think I've ran out of space. Honestly, I would give Old World 10/10--it's my favorite strategy game to date.

But it's also a half broken game looking more like Early Access, or what it is in reality, an experimental game. Fans seem blind to the weak points but it's probably a matter of preference.

But the reality is it's not a 4X, it's a 2.5X, eXterminate was mostly removed by penalising heavily wars and conquests, and eXpand is widely restrained by penalising large empires and conquests. 

I can't advise it, but you still get a fun game up to mid game (turn 100/120 on 200) and along 6 or 7 plays past a learning phase to start control enough to ensure a win. And it's definitely a quite efficient AI, more than usual in similar 4X, so it helps for the fun but the AI Still does many idiots thing,

In short the main problems:
- Excessive micro-management past mid game, last 25% turns can be ultra tedious because of that.
- Weak victory systems with only two choices. Ambition Victory requesting make 10 random achievements, but it is badly tuned, and worse AI can't win by ambition which is absurd. Score Victory which is just a culture+wonders score, ridiculous.
- Despite the most noticeable in this game is wars/combats, the whole gameplay is pushing to Pacifist plays with wars penalising too much, and when you capture towns you get weak culture towns no matter how powerful was the town. It results in exploiting an OP diplomacy that allows fully control AI to avoid have them enter in war, or allow one war you choose carefully.
- Lack of strategy diversity, on start it comes from culture win only, and how wars is a penalty hence must be avoided as much than possible, and it's very doable because of an OP diplomacy.
- Replay value is low for a 4X, still it should be ok for 6/8 plays past a first learning phase.
- Performances problems hard to pinpoint, they come and leave for no clear reasons. But also the more a play progress, the longer are AI turns, even 3 minutes per turn is an optimistic evaluation.

One special quote, the game is using global action points used for mostly everything, move workers/civil or war units, attacks, many building actions, more. The problem is it's not suited for an Empire game as are all 4X. It is targeting some specific problems as reduce micro management problems, but later game when you have 100+ action points, no micro management is solved. And at reverse it penalises empire and expansion aspect of 4X, it's a lot because of this system that any war is an heavy penalty. Also it increases micro management for some classics as auto workers and building road that work very weirdly because of the global action points system.

So interesting game, original enough for the fans, more hardcore than civ series and still evokes it in part, alas a half broken game favouring pacifists plays, with bad win conditions, and excessive micro management.",1654462234,1655930081,False,0,0,0.236842110753059387,0,True,False,False

The game does so many things right. It has a great economic system with many different resources. The most important resource is ""Orders"" which limits how much you can do. Different resources are bottlenecks in different phases of the game. The game also includes characters whose opinion is important for the success of your real. The characters can have different ""Archetypes"" which determine how the characters can be used. Some can be governors, others generals and they each have different special skills which must be combined to succeed in the game. Characters have not been overdone but are in my opinion just on the right level for this kind of 4X game (nowhere near the detail of CK III which is focused on characters)
Most 4X games fail in AI. AI is often ery passive or not a worthy opponent. Old World has successfully built an AI which does not cheat and is able to fight wars well. The AI is not as good as human in long term economic development but they are nasty opponents in a war. This makes diplomacy very important - you really do not want a war you cannot win. Allies actively help you attack your enemy instead of just waiting etc. A very refreshing change from passive AI's!

This game is about building a strong enough base to properly wage war, defend against one, or dissuade a rival from engaging through the many diplomatic avenues of the game. It IS NOT akin to CIV or Endless Legend or Humankind in that regard - the pacing and goal is different. Maximizing your war machine is so much more necessary. The combat itself is punishing and rewarding for poor and clever decisions. Wars are about attrition, pitching your productive abilities against the enemies. The winner is often who can output more troops over the course of a very long war. At first this feels poor, then you start to love it.

What I've seen in reviews here is the sentiment that the game grows on you. This is massively true in my experience. I thought that game was fine in my first 10 hours, now 25+ I think it's impossible to put down and hard to stay away from. Easily worth 40$. Good mod base also.

Make no mistake, this is a war game.  This rewards the player who expands into the limited free city spots quickly, takes out a barbarian or tribal city or three, then builds as big a military as can be supported and wipes the rest of the players.  War is easy and without consequence in this game.  Building is hard and without much reward.  The constraints on city creation funnel all players into a single course of action.

Until the game allows city construction at the player's discretion, this will not be anything but a tactical wargame.   Just crank units out and you will win, even with just early level technology.  It's bulk with solid tactics that wins.  The classic elements of most 4x games are not really there because you don't need to do much exploring, you don't really need to do much exploiting, just unit production and war.

But if you like that kind of game, its definitely a winner for you with some unique dynastic and empire/court elements that add some spice to the mix.

I have played a lot of 4X games. Like, probably too many. I played Civ 5 with friends so much that I hosted a day where 8 of us played a LAN game and roleplayed nations. We didn't make it past turn 1 because Civ is broken dogshit, but that is a separate issue. Point being, I know 4X games pretty well.

That said, Old World is easily the pinnacle of the genre. It isn't even close. Old World is landing a space shuttle on mars while Civ is banging two rocks together, and the rocks are uninspired and fucking boring.

The gameplay is the mutant spawn of Crusader Kings, Stellaris, Civ, and Endless Legends. The minute to minute gameplay is Civ (but actually good). Then you click next turn and BOOM, it's Stellaris busting through a wall like the Kool-aid man, he brought a mini storyline with him about how the wonder you built ten turns ago is falling apart and you need to fix it. Your choices will have consequences. Then you realize, you're in a war and you have way more troops but your troops are fighting like the deformed fetuses Sparta threw off the cliff. Crusader Kings sidles up to you on the bench you were sitting on the entire time. He says, hey pal, it looks like you didn't manage your internal politics very well. Your soldiers? Yeah, they belong to one of three noble houses. Somehow, you pissed off all three, so nobody want's to fight for you. Maybe you should politic better, dumbass. So you say, alright that's fine, I'll just spend some gold and bribe those cunts. Suddenly, it's Endless Legends WITH A STEEL CHAIR! He cracks you over the back, but not really, because wrestling is fake. While you're pretending to writhe in pain, he whispers in your ear. Pal, city planning and tile laying is an entire game unto itself, if you can't plan good then you can't economy good, and then you're gonna have a bad day. Elite gamers know how to plan a city and achieve economic satisfaction. Then Stellaris and Crusader Kings both stagedive you from the top of the cage, turns out your daughter hates you because you didn't let her marry the love of your life (he was a commoner and it would tarnish your royal name) and now she is plotting to kill you. Was, plotting to kill you. Because she did it, your dumb ass is dead now and she is the Queen. You are now her. You lost a bunch of legitimacy (turns out assassinating the previous ruler is bad for proving you deserve to be there), the houses still hate you, and you're losing the war. Badly. But hey, at least you're Queen, right?

So how is this game actually board games incarnate? It is a satisfying system of complex, interlocking, overlapping systems. So much thought was put into how every mechanic ""get's on"" every other mechanic. I honestly would not be surprised if this started life as a board game and became a video game later. Almost every facet of the gameplay is reminiscent of the hobbyist board game scene. If Old World launched an overpriced Kickstarter full of minis and stretch goals I would probably still pre-order a copy because they fucking nailed Eurogames. 

Let's look at just one specific example. Orders. Orders are how many things you can do per turn. Every unit movement, attack, construction, etc requires orders. It doesn't matter how many units you have, if you only have 10 Orders you get to do 10 things. Period. You gain Orders mainly through Legitimacy, which is how stronk your claim to the throne is. Doing politics, making noble houses happy, and choosing certain quest options get's you more legitimacy. This already gives the game an entire extra dimension beyond Civ. In Civ, more units means more actions. There is no nuance, there is no alternative. More units = more moves. In OW, you have to play a little CK and make nobles happy, or play a little Stellaris and do a quest, or do some EL and lay tiles real good and this all feeds into your basic ability to do stuff in a single turn. And then, classic hobbyist board games enters the chat. UNUSED ORDERS ARE CONVERTED TO GOLD. So not taking an action is actually taking an economic action because maybe you want to build a road but you also kinda need the gold. Eclipse, move over, because there's a new king of euro war games.

Another great, and incredibly satisfying, improvement?

THE AI DOESN'T CHEAT...

Without your express permission.

During game setup you pick EXACTLY the advantages the AI get's. The stock difficulty settings mainly just have the AI starting with more cities than you, and a stacking discontent debuff for your cities. You can micro manage these metrics to be exactly what you want. No more losing a wonder to an AI, where you played perfectly and could have completed it in 12 turns but Karen Of Paris cheated and has 12,000 production for free (because AI) so she wins, you stupid idiot. You should have known she would cheat. Strategy games.

Oh yeah, and the cherry on the cake is actually two cherries, and they're both lifted from board games.

Cherry the first. The multiplayer actually fucking works. It doesn't crash. It doesn't desync. It doesn't lag. It just fucking works. Civ has been around for like two decades at this point, and the multiplayer is broken fucking dogshit that literally doesn't work. It desyncs constantly, and playing a game with more than two people is the definition of misery. I've played several full games of OW so far, and have had zero desync or crash issues. Zero.

Cherry the second. It takes roughly 4 to 6 hours to finish a game. For me and my buddy, that is two nights of solid gaming. To actually finish a game.

Confession time. I have never finished a game of multiplayer Civ. It literally drags on so long, and is just so tedious and miserable that there is zero point. Everyone knows who won. The game is over. It continues to shuffle along like a lifeless zombie. OW is TIGHT. It stays engaging and punchy, and ends before its' welcome is over. This is another magnificent aspect of modern board games adapted to the video game scene. The best board games offer a complex and satisfying puzzle, but they end before their welcome is overstayed.

Civ is Monopoly. There is basically no nuance to the strategy. There is no actual flavor, no roleplaying, no quests. You roll the dice, move, roll the dice, and move again. It takes 47 hours to finish a game, and by the end everyone hates each other.

OW is board games. It is 7 Wonders Duel, Eclipse, Food Chain Magnate, and Forbidden Stars. It is tight, punchy, and over exactly when it needs to be. It makes your brain feel pleasantly stretchy and begging for more.",1655361909,1655361909,True,33,6,0.646517813205718994,0,True,False,False

- The great house/inter-nation diplomacy
- The production is dependent on various resources instead of just a ""production"" resource which is more interesting and makes for more specialized cities

Cons:
- As some mention, it can get a little laggy in the end game and the AI turns start taking a relatively long time in the end game.

Now understand I have had this game under my wish list for sometime. And I purchased it a day or two after it came out. Played it for about 30 minutes and thought, NOPE this is going to take days to learn. So finally I got the time to play. First, the whole history lesson, with rulers, their inbred family members etc. is a total waste of time. Does absolutely nothing but make you want to stop playing. PLUS! you can turn it off. So I did. I have it on the lowest setting of difficulty and its kicking my butt. Its kicking my butt so profoundly that I was taken aback. Now you have to understand I have played civ 1 all the way until they went to poopville in civ 6. And many many other strat games. And inevitably I get really tired of them because I eventually and always start playing at the most epic level and winning more often then not. 

I really don't know if I want to waste my time playing this game, it is that UNFUN. Usually you play the easiest level to learn how to play but when it kicks your butt. You are kind of like Hmmm. Then take into the absolute ridiculous complexity, which is fine when it is intuitive and fun to learn, its really hard to recommend this game to anyone, except maybe if you were to survive the end of civilization and had nothing else to play. 

If I had to make an analogy. This game is like taking the absolute simplicity of chess rules, cranking up the difficulty to playing Bobby Fisher, Then complicating the Chess Rules with absurdities that do not add to FUN or enjoyment. Then adding more complexity to the game when it did not need it. Then adding more unfun.

So to summarize. If you want a game that is extremely complex, not fun, not fun to learn, and have years to learn how to play it with no satisfaction at all. BUY THIS GAME. If you want a game that is fun, makes intuitive sense, has difficulty levels that make sense etc. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I cant believe the guy who made Civ 4 made this game.

If you like those two things, this is a good mixture of the two things, however there is nothing revolutionary here. This is what in tabletop rpg's we would call a ""Heartbreaker"" type game. It's someone looking at their inspirations and saying ""I can't make something NEW out of this, but I think I can remix it to be BETTER.""

It largely succeeds at that, but lacks the charm of Civilization, and lacks the RNG and event emphasis of CK2 or Stellaris.

It adds a couple really neat twists to a solid Civilization style base, without the ""complexity for the sake of complexity"" that some companies have become famous for.

The first is the concept of ""orders"", which limits how many things you can do each turn (moving units, building things, etc.). This mechanic prevents the micromanagement headache one frequently finds in the late game phase of most 4X games.

Old World also adds a little ""Crusader Kings"" style spice by virtue of the entire game taking place over 200 years (turns) in what Civ players will equate to the Classical era (e.g., Warriors -> Swordsmen). You start as a historical leader (i.e., Romulus in the case of the Roman empire), but you're mortal, so you better spend some time having kids and grooming them to take over your empire. This really added to replayability for me, as did the associated random events that can affect your family members.

But what really sold me on this game was that the AI DOES NOT SUCK at combat. It is really good at retreating its wounded units, using combined arms to good effect, and picking your units off by ganging up on them. I should mention that with respect to combat (and many other 4X game mechanics), Old World doesn't play like Civ 5/6. There isn't a strong ""counter attack"" when you attack, which seems to throw many players coming from Civ. Your opponent does damage on his turn, then you get to do damage on yours (assuming the AI didn't kill that Slinger you cheekily left exposed).  Do yourself a favor and watch a Let's Play (or look at the manual, which is really more of a guide).

In summary, this is a great 4X game from Soren Johnson, the lead designer on Civ IV (and later Offworld Trading Company).

Give it a try!

When 6 units go against 6 similar units, it should be a stalemate, but the attacker always wins in this game. So you can suicide units in knowing full well you win because you attacked first. Not a good mechanic, plus with the force march mechanic you can reinforce from across the map. So as long as you don't engage in combat you'll have a good time. Once you want to war, the quality of your time will deteriorate very quickly. 

My other critique is that around turn 60 the end turns to start taking longer and longer to end and by 120, I'm waiting up to 20 seconds and because of this, I have not gone further than 135 turns.  I have a Ryzen 9 5900X 12 core processor 3.70, 32 GB ram with 3080 Gigabyte. I don't see any reason why my game should be taking at worst 30-60, the worst-case sometimes 90 seconds to finish the turn, at 135 turns.

Edit: More hours in and I've come to hate the combat even more. I have read the developer's ""notes"" all relating to combat, I've listened to people discuss the combat, and I have even listened to the developer talking to FiflthyRobot, a streamer who likes this game. I'm writing this so the reader would understand I really tried, I thought I was too harsh on the game, yet it the more I played the more I realized I wasn't harsh enough. I tried and learned the combat and to ""Like"" it. But combat completely sucks. It's all about the meat grinder.

The developer has this idea that 4 units go against 4 units and they trade blows until one side wins, that the retaliatory damage happens when the player on his turn counter-attack. This is not how combat works. 4 kills 1 of the 3 in the first turn of combat. The 3 seldom can kill 1 of the 4, and loses. There is no defence in this game. So unless you can respond to the attack by a proportional amount of damage that was dealt to you, you will lose the combat and the war, the same goes for the ai. But to deal the same proportional damage that you took, it is a requirement that you would need more units. Some to die and some to counterattack and deal the taken damage back. Or that your units are better. So the weaker party, even if they are slightly weaker, will lose, and they will lose in the first engagement. If you win the first engagement you will win the war. 

But there are more problems with the war. Because when you start one it becomes total war. You must win, or risk falling too far behind because all your cities will have to go on unit production. War is about out meat-grinding your enemy, you must throw 10, 20, and worst case 30 units to win a war, and it's not engaging. You will fall behind, and the only way to get your lead back is if you win. So it all comes down to the first fight. 

Combat is a major part of the 4x genre, I can't just ignore it. Other mechanics that I did like originally, like the family and the ""RPG"" elements are very shallow, with little depth. Worst yet, on my hardware the game end turn takes forever to finish, ( I suspect it's because the AI, with all the city and resources, cheats it gets build nothing but combat unit, which in turn slow the game drastically). No other game slows down like this, and I am not the only one who experiences this. People who say deny the mid-late game lag as ""fine"" like the game too much to put up with the game's beautiful 3-minute end turn, plus the stutters and all the other problems. It has a major optimization problem and I don't think it's gonna get addressed.

Final Conclusion, despite liking this game hugely in the beginning, the combat turned the game sour very quickly. plus the shallowness of all the other mechanics, and the major mid-late game lag I hugely recommend skipping this game, or if you are really adamant about playing it,  wait for the game to be like 15-12 dollars. It's a shame, it could have been a really good game.",1654079701,1654917258,False,17,2,0.604797303676605225,8,True,False,False

Rome, Persia, Hittites, Babylon, Carthage, Greece, Egypt, Assyria

The differences between them:
Each has a different set of 4 families out of the pool of ~10. This keeps things balanced at the cost of no Kingdom feeling unique. You can only have 3 families on each playthrough(the most popular mod removes that restriction). You pick the families that suit the area you have been given, how do you know if they suit the area? you often don't and the only way of knowing is to waste turns scouting which might just reveal that you have been given a really badly matched area.

The highly pushed RPG mechanics:
You are King Romulus, Remus is jealous of you.
Remus is plotting against you.
An attempt was made on your life.
Another attempt was made on your life.
Another attempt was made on your life.
You die to an assassin.
How do you prevent this? simple, you cannot. Your only option at the beginning is ""Influence character"" which is a one time bonus of 40 opinion. You want to Imprison Remus? I'm sorry, you haven't researched that yet.

The RPG mechanics are completely lacklustre and almost entirely just a system of RNG bonuses and penalties to stats. You can pick a path for your children(Philosophy(+1 INT), Politics(+1 CHA), Tactics(+1 Courage), Commerce(+1 Discipline)), this determines their potential ""Class""(this is still RNG, you get 2 of the 4 to pick from when they're 18) which determines which court positions they can hold, whether they can lead an army or govern a city. If they lead an army, a basic barbarian slinger can instantly kill, blind or maim your King regardless of the HP of the unit because RPG and RNG are the same thing in this game.

The historic leaders lend very little flavour, Romulus has Remus trying to kill him and one event referencing Wolves. Philip of Mace-err Greece has Alexander as his heir with high Courage(RNG can kill him in training or just arbitrarily cut down his Courage through repeated).

The historiocity is questionable at best. The game is developed by Scandinavians so the game is preset to Absolute Primogeniture(Oldest child inherits the throne, invented in the 1980s) you have to change it to Agnatic Primogeniture. Also at least half your commanders, heroes and tacticians will be women.

The UU choices for three Kingdoms in particular stand out as a bit off. Egypt is given elite Cavalry, despite Egypt being entirely owned by Greeks and then Romans by the time Cavalry were a thing. Greece is given Hoplite and Phalangite spearmen, but since they're Philip of Macedon's Greece it should be Pikemen and Companion Cavalry. Persia is given elite Horse Archers, which are borderline outside of the time period of the game, presumably because the Hittites have the elite Chariots.

The game also lets you name landmarks you find, mountain ranges, rivers, volcanoes. The problem is the list of pre-generated names has something like a 30% chance of generating a name from a different culture, even cultures you can't play as like Danish names, which is just weird.

In conclusion, I don't feel like this is worth more than £15 and I'm really confident it will get any more substantial updates since it came out over a year ago.",1654870692,1654870692,False,7,1,0.527449607849121094,0,True,False,False

It ends up coming across as unfocused and suffers for it.  You have to manage gold, food, iron, stone, wood, research, civics, training, growth, unrest and culture and then also have to deal with a cast of extremely similar characters on top of that and the characters die before you can even get to know who they are.   The game crams so much into a tiny space and it just doesn't gel. 

It's not a bad game by any means, but I found myself more frustrated by mechanics rather than finding them interesting or engaging; getting constantly screwed by the technology deck or having too many orders or too few.   Tribes are a good idea, but after your first game you'll just murder them for their land because that's better than the hassle of allying with them and if you don't do it your rivals will.

- Action economy system forcing you to decide each turn which units can and cannot take turns. This keeps players from being able to spam units because they won't have enough actions to command them. 

- Internal politics with families and unit/city loyalties to each family. Keeping the families happy is very important as it affects unit and city performance. Great dynamic of internal politics especially from this time period. 

- City settlement sites are predetermined, this seems poor at first, but it really forces the player to combat barbarians and tribes to secure more city sites, and it creates logical places for battles to occur. 

- Tech cards are a great addition. The player can't rush any technology and must choose based on the cards that are pulled. It feels more organic like you don't have ultimate control over what techs your people discover. 

- Combat feels good, but I agree with a few other posters that attackers should take damage. Overextending a unit ends up being instant death without much to show for it; however, I've learned to adjust to this and find it makes scouting the enemy army much more important (which is true to reality). 

Overall this is a fantastic game, and I can't wait to see how it progresses with updates. It brings great new depth to the 4x world. 9/10.",1654780006,1654780006,True,42,0,0.787845194339752197,0,True,False,False

At its core Old World is a Civ-derivative 4X nation builder. One of the selling points, maker of Civ 4 is behind this, cuts straight to the chase here. Old World succeeds at that core concept adequately which is where the problems (and weirdness) starts. The game is just average. Aggressively so. 

Graphically it's a pretty game but those graphics are washed out, nondescript, and bland. Two generations ago I'd have called this gorgeous. Yet here I am squinting to tell if lines are rivers or some other line.

Gameplay this rehashes well trod mechanics yet does so with neither flare or imagination. It's just a pedestrian redo of what has been seen for decades. But the choices made here are all steps back - life cities being forced into narrow, predefined spots (done better with Humankind for example). 

Musically the game is boring with a number of pieces of music lacking flare or blending in well with one another. So much so that I found myself jarred by changes in tracks.

The ""role playing"" is superficial, done better in places like Crusader Kings 3, so doesn't feel like it's adding.

Long story short, there's nothing here to raise this above average, at best. And it's delivered in at a magnificent level that makes it compelling and empty at the same time. It's just weird.

TL;DR - this is a 4x Civilization descendant that delivers a dark ""one more turn"" experience - I found myself asking myself ""Why am I playing one more turn?""

If you see this in the $15-$25 range, I'd say pick it up. But it's not worth $40 as is - unless you want a weirdly empty experience.",1654750984,1654750984,False,28,0,0.548569798469543457,0,True,False,False

Anyway, I'm giving OW a shot and this is my first game review ever. I'm having fun … getting frustrated … having fun … getting frustrated … taking a break … and then having fun. It's only early days but I've realised now that my old Civ V mindset can be the main source of my frustration. Also, interestingly, once I better understand a new OW mechanic, I usually find that it's an improvement. 

For example, I'm used to building a diplomatic relationship with the one abstract leader (George Washington in Classical Antiquity?) that is continuous and consistent for many centuries. But now my political influence has to extend to both the leader and their heir (like in real history). I have to be prepared for … or take advantage of … their internal regime changes (like in real history). And I have to prepare for my own nation's succession (like in real history). All of this initially frustrated me but now I'm having fun with it.

Another example, combat, I'm used to enemy warriors moving only 2 hexes in a 40 year turn and taking retaliatory damage while they attack. But now, in a 1 year turn, an invading warrior can cross my border, move several hexes and attack one of my workers near the capital (like in real history). It's also up to me to retaliate (like in real history). This initially frustrated me but now I'm having fun adapting my military tactics.

Another example, the significant (emotional) investment in armies. I'm used to pumping out units and spacing them out along the border. No problem if I lose a few, I can build some more. But now, I assign my leader, courtiers or family members as generals (like in real history). The units develop using a new training resource. They achieve promotions (like in real history). Now, when I lose an army, I feel the loss. I'm yet to see the Teutoburg Forest on the map but when hordes of raiders descend out of the trees to annihilate three of my armies I want to yell, ""Varus, give me back my legions!"" and then rage quit and rage review on steam … until I take a break and then come back for some more fun. 

I've experienced several other examples of the fun/frustration/fun cycle eg. the orders system, the technology card system and the fixed city sites. But there are other examples of new mechanics where I have had only fun. Expanding borders is interesting with certain events, placing specialists in city improvements and buying tiles allowing expansion to that important resource just outside my territory. Cities being connected by rivers and the ocean is interesting (build a short section of road between the inland sources of two rivers to create a long network). Using different resources (food, iron, stone and wood) to build various items is fantastic. Managing families and courtiers is in enough detail for me to enjoy in a 4X empire building game without the extreme psychology of a CK game.    

OW can be customised in so many different ways. The number of event/decisions can be reduced to minimal if CK is not your style. There is a Colorblind Filter (which helps me) and tooltip sizes can be enlarged (which may help others?). For those wanting an epic Classical Antiquity experience, there is a choice of real Earth regional maps, each turn can be a semester (instead of a year) and the 200 turn limit can be switched off if you want to keep on playing forever. You choose how you want to play  … and I don't even know what mods will do?

Personally, I think the appearance of the map and the artwork is perfect for this type of slower-paced thinking game and I'm finding my way around the UI without any problems. As I say, it's early days for me and there is still so much more to learn, but I wanted to get my first impressions review out early in case other Civ V players (history fans) are experiencing something similar? My suggestion is to have patience. 

I'm happy to give OW a left-hand thumbs up and a right-hand wine glass raise.

Cheers!

As with all 4X games, it offers the basic meat and potatoes that you look for in these games: empire building, exploration, raising armies, conquest and politics. Throw into the mix dynasty and legacy building and a semi-interesting deck system for technologies, and you have an interesting flavor for the 4X genre.

That said, there are some glaring issues that start to become really evident by the mid-to-late game. Firstly, there is a serious performance issue - even with a rig well above the game's recommend requirements (Ryzen 7 3700X with Nvidia 3070TI on 32 gigs), end of turns begin to hang for a good solid 30-60 seconds prior to any AI decisions being made. It completely detracts from the experience and drags the game when you're running a 200 Turn limit campaign. 

But more importantly, there is a serious lack of content as the game reaches that mid-to-late game. About 20 hours and 2 campaigns in, things begin to feel a lot more monotonous than in other 4X games. The dynasty/legacy system with families becomes more a chore with the various events that pop up, and some of the decisions really begin to feel less impactful. Sea travel also is frustrating - anchoring ships and trying to link them from one land mass to another just to allow settlers and the like to move between spaces does not feel satisfying, and is pretty frustrating. 

There are a few other items I could list, but those are some of the more major concerns I have with the game. I've no idea if the game will continue to be worked on.

I'm still learning different ways to synergize different systems from training to religion to culture it's all connected and affects everything else.

The combat system is different to Civ and takes some getting used to.

Expanding is key to victory, and attacking units don't take damage, so the game often revolves around waves and waves of units crashing into each other until one side wins a war of attrition.

I love the idea of adding characters and a ""you"" to this sort of game but what starts out feeling fun becomes a chore once there becomes way too many people. Each turn there is a list of notifications of characters getting a new trait or becoming unhappy or dying or taking over a position. Rewards for some events are even more characters! Maybe with the longer lives option I would grow to care but very early on I stop reading what happens to them. My aunt became greedy and my nephew converted again? Ok, thanks for sharing I guess?

But not only do the characters have feelings toward you that change randomly, the religions do as well! At first I worked for turns and turns to improve my relations with my state religion. And then the head of the religion died, some random character took over and now the religion hates me. So I stopped paying attention to it. 

War! Carthage declared war on me! The Punic wars began! But 10 turns in and I haven't seen a unit of theirs yet. Maybe if I shared a border it would mean something but I had a faction requesting I negotiate a truce before a single battle had happened. When combat does happen it feels like it comes out of nowhere. Units somehow feel like they take forever to move around in peacetime yet in war having enemy units move 3 cities over to gang up on your unit you positioned feels frustrating. Not knowing they had units 3 cities over means I can't make decisions based on enemy positions. This makes combat feel very reactionary. Don't get attached to any one unit because they will move all of their units across the map to take it out before you do the same the next turn to them. More annoyingly, when you get a unit down to almost dead and it nopes right out of combat to 3 cities away.

In truth none of its individual components are overly deep. In other games this might actually be an overall shallowness, but in Old World it is an acceptable modicum of depth because all of the various systems are highly interconnected - and it works well, in sum! Still, I am disappointed.

In my opinion the inheritance and legacy aspect has been oversold. Much has been made of how you need to prepare your successor, but in the end it's really just a short checklist that you go through every generation.
1) Marry a politically convenient wife.
2) Live long enough to have kids.
3) Have someone tutor them - barely matters who, because the results are highly random. Repeat until they're grown up.
4) Give them a job where they get plenty of XP.
I never felt like it was difficult or even required any thought - there are always wives to be had (you're the king after all, the most eligible bachelor of them all), and their random generation rarely produces any candidates that are noticeably good or bad. There are usually tutors to go around, and the choice of tutor only seemed to nudge the odds for which of the child's stats would grow, which isn't terribly important because all stats are useful somehow. If the ruler's personal relationship to his successor matters at all, I never noticed it.

I've never been much of a fan of the distinction many games make between different types of players. Civilizations VS City-States for Civ 5 and following, Civilizations VS Barbarians in all the Civs, Major Regimes and Minor Regimes and Territories in Shadow Empire. Here it's Nations, Tribes and Barbarians. It always felt off to me - what might be seen as one type of polity may at other times or in various places have clearly appeared as a very different type. And in Old World too the distinction, while mechanically clear and presumably sensible as game design, feels thematically strange.

Being able to choose three out of four available families to populate your nation with feels strange. Maybe that's just a quirk of psychology, but ""choose all but one"" has always weirded me out.

Some aspects of the game fail to explain themselves. For instance, I still do not know how Festival projects work. You build them, and then you can build them again, so they're repeatable...but there's also some supposedly permanent component to it? So far, I am confused. Edit: They do work as advertised, but unlike all other projects the permanent festival effect has no icon to represent it.

You can build city walls, but they aren't visible on the map. Shame, really.

The ambition system occasionally offers quests that are the main source of Legitimacy, the most important resource in the game. Unfortunately those quests are usually either trivially easy or wildly unfeasible to accomplish, with the difficulty increasing as the game progresses. The main problem is that any ambition must be completed during the lifetime of the current ruler, or within 20 turns of his death...which is unpredictable and often all too brief. Furthermore, legitimacy is partially lost on a ruler's death. So while I may be doing things wrong, all of my games start out with me quickly making one of my first two rulers famous by completing the easy early ambitions, and then I get into a downward legitimacy spiral as soon as I run into the unrealistic later ambitions or any ruler dies unexpectedly young. I wonder if AI rulers also need to complete ambitions.

The random events in general are a little too much. They go beyond delivering narrative substance or challenging surprises and often turn the game into an unpredictable mess. Yeah, many other games are too predictable and do nothing to shake up your plans, and it's not like Old World throws nuclear curveballs at you that lose you the game, but the events are too frequent and too strong in their numerical impacts on the gameplay, while you end up caring too little about the characters they revolve around because the characters all die and get switched out very rapidly anyways. In short, it ends up being annoying.

The game has a seemingly robust reminder system that will tell you about unexploited opportunities before you end your turn. Unfortunately there are too many edge cases that the system doesn't catch for the player to actually rely on it. It's an ostensible source of comfort that just ends up being a trap - you'll suddenly discover that you ended your last turn with something important not taken care of that the reminders did not know about and that you forgot, because you once again thought that the reminders being clear meant that you could safely end your turn. You keep telling yourself to take your own mental notes, but the mere existence of the reminder system erodes that resolve.

Combat favors attackers to an absurd degree. If you have enough orders (a resources that limits how many actions you can take per turn), you can move units across great distances and then attack with them at the outer edge of their movement radius for full damage, while the defenders will only deal minimal damage in retaliation, if any. This makes combat feel downright unhinged. The design blog for the game states that units have long lines of sight to make combat more predictable by reducing incidents with units appearing out of the fog of war, dogpiling some of your combatants with impunity or running around your frontline, and leaving you to pick up the pieces on the next turn. Unfortunately this doesn't work - unit mobility and the attacker advantage are too great not to facilitate such events. Sure enough, you can also use this against your opponents, but even then it feels too extreme. And while it is true that you need to spend many Orders to execute such offensives, which might force you to neglect some other actions for a turn, it's well worth it to nuke your opponents army before they can react. Perhaps this is balanced on some very high skill level of play where all players are jockeying to perform these maneuvers, but to me as a casual player it just appears as an extremely unpredictable, un-fun game of one-sided speed chess.

And last off, the game doesn't scale well. Whether it's the number of courtiers, cities or units - the order system might limit how many actions you can take per turn, but you still need to actually go through all of the pieces on the board to figure out which ones to move, or which to assign where, or what to build, or whom to interact with, etc. Early on it might feel like you have too little to work with, passing turns just waiting to be able to continue. Then there's a brief sweet spot in which you are busy, but not overworked. And then the game breezes past that spot and drowns you in events, characters, building queue...while the characters all over the board keep dying on you, so you can't even form a consistent mental model of who's who. In the end it's a hassle to play. I have a nagging feeling that the game's fairly short turn limit (200 turns) is also meant to obscure various design and balance issues that become apparent as a game progresses.

I'm really torn on whether or not to recommend Old World. It does a lot of good things, but fails entirely in some aspects and partially in too many others. I keep excitedly starting new runs only to abandon them when the game pulls a fast one on me or gets bogged down in micromanagement. My disappointment exceeds my excitement, unfortunately.

It's not really frustrating, per se, but it's kind of a throw back to Civ 1 or Civ 2 with some cool dynastic management elements thrown in.  So we'll start with what I think are the best elements of the game.

Managing your family is probably the most fun in the game.  Its pretty cool making choices for your family members from when they're school age through adulthood.  Of course the best choices are always the ones where the result will be random and you don't know what you're going to get.  On top of that, choices you make have an outcome on how they will govern, lead militarily, or rule the country and that has an impact on non-natural resource production (and sometimes natural resource production.  I do think the influence system is too forgiving, though.  If a family member dislikes you, influence them twice and you're their friend (well, not really, but they're not going to stab you in the back anymore).  

I also like the fact that exploration gives you more reward than the occasional reward tile (which may or may not reward you depending on what you find... which is cool).  You're rewarded with influence as you explore which helps give more orders which is useful when exploring, expanding and warring.

But that brings me to the bad (to me).  Basically, the game is about war, though I suppose rightfully so if you think on it.  But I'm pretty sure the AI does nothing but produce 2 workers and then just military units in every city.  I suppose not a problem in itself, there are ways to overcome this, like stagger attacks on multiple fronts then sure for peace if you're a weaker nation.  It's just tedious.  You have to have a huge army even if you're trying to play the peace game.  Inevitably, if you're allied with someone a war will break out and 50 units will show up on your doorstep.  

While the game tells you in tutorial that you have different options with tribes (and you do) there is absolutely no reason to do anything other than murder them when you see them.  They're relatively weak, they always hold city centers, the ""benefits"" of peace are useless, and your enemies will always kill them, expanding their empire and leaving you in the dust.  Since the game score is based entirely on culture levels in cities and wonders built, you'll never get a points victory... unless you have a powerful enough military to take over other civilization cities, which you won't because you didn't murder tribes in the beginning to claim city centers like your neighbors did.

Diplomacy, in a way is kinda cool, but at it's roots is a bit of a pain.  Trade negotiations are always random so if you really would like to get metal.... good luck.  You might get it, or you might get offered stone or wood 3 times.  Though after about turn 50 you really don't need trade at all.  It's pretty easy to be self-sustaining.  Alliances are fairly useful but can be difficult to maintain if you're poor so a useful mid game tool but be careful because the game can be cruel and you get embroiled in wars with more powerful civilizations while just minding your own business.  I do appreciate the effort to make diplomacy better than other 4x games, but reality is that you don't actually need it as random events will suit perfectly well.

I kinda wish there was an option in the middle between recommend and not.  I do like the game, I think.  It's better than Humankind, to me, anyway.  But it really depends on how you like to play these games for how fun it is.  I tend to play the culture/economic route in 4x games.  Just what I like.  As such, those aspects are here in Old World, but they won't win the game for you (most ambitions I've gotten to choose from require you to use force though there are some that do not).  So you're kinda stuck with military.  If you're cool with that, this is an awesome game.  If not, it's not impossible to win, but you're really handicapping yourself and some of the tools to become an economic superpower are under developed and in the end, don't matter much anyway.",1654523384,1654523384,False,144,1,0.842308640480041504,3,True,False,False

_____________________________________________________________

One of the things I loved about Civilization 20 years ago was sitting down to an easy-level game and roleplaying my way to victory. Nevermind that it wasn't exactly a challenge, I had a blast playing out numerous scenarios in my head as I spread my empire across the map. Fast forward to my adulthood and I became more engrossed in playing 4X games ""correctly"" to a level of technical competence if not mastery (I could once consistently beat Civ V on Emperor difficulty).

All that said, Old World takes those two parts of my 4X experience and blends them together. It's a game that lets me roleplay *and* make sound gameplay decisions based on that roleplay. I may not always make the perfectly optimal choice, but the emerging narratives allow me to optimize the choices I make. Another obvious influence, the Crusader Kings series, is also a favorite of mine but one that tends to get bogged down in the minutiae of ruling and dealing with vassals that want to rip apart your empire every five minutes. Old World takes that, tones it down, and layers it onto 4X gameplay to give you political scenarios where internal factions are relevant but not a constant specter of destruction looming over your carefully-forged empire.

Old World is not always intuitive, and sometimes I struggle to see what I should do next or how best I could use my remaining Orders (moves). Sometimes fairly important things like assigning a governor or councilor go undone for many turns because the game lacks a reminder prompt for them. This is unfortunate. However, on the plus side, the tutorial campaign is, surprisingly, mostly helpful and will give you what you need to know to start a game and interpret what's happening on-screen 90% of the time. There are times when it's unclear to me what requirement I'm not meeting or why, but usually a little digging fixes that. And this game always lets you pause an emergent situation, buy/sell/read/move/whatever, and then go back to the choice once you've shifted resources around for a better outcome. It's not necessarily easy, but it doesn't pointlessly restrict your options because an event popup happened to cut you off from the marketplace. The combat system is....an adjustment coming from Civ but the AI seems more competent with it to the point where you'll actually want to pay attention when positioning troops rather than just yeeting a doom carpet across the map.

Final note, while the graphics and art style are a bit generic (though not *bad*), the music is incredible. There's a huge soundtrack, it's all good, much of it is haunting and beautiful in ways that remind me of, say, Nier Automata's soundtrack. The soundtrack gets an 11/10.",1654479502,1654479502,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I get this might come across as pedantic, but it should be stated that Crusader Kings gameplay is a lot more sandboxy in comparison.

Every move you make in Old World matters, thanks to the new orders system.  It feels even more like a board game compared to Civilization.  Which I love!  When you are at war with other nations, you have to spend more turns on mobilizing your military units, rather than moving workers around.  Also, as leaders get older, they get more orders, which thematically speaking makes your leaders are getting even a better grip on running the government.  When a young heir takes over, the number of orders will drop to reflect the loss in efficiency.  I get the impression that part of this order system was to help speed up the end game, but I have to admit the end game can still move slowly, but it's not at the same level as trying to manage over 100 units in the modern era of Civilization.  (I'll admit that I have not played the latest version of Civ because I was never able to finish a game in Civ 5, so maybe that has improved).

Lastly, I love the choice of playing in the ancient world.  An era that I love and find fascinating.  While I have not managed it yet, I can't wait to crush Rome with Carthage.",1654471487,1654471487,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

On paper, the mechanics are great - the basic gameplay of Civilization, but enhanced by the interpersonal rivalries and intrigue of Crusader Kings. Only problem is, both buckets of mechanics are under-developed. I never felt like the CK elements mattered at all to what I was doing, and nothing very interesting ever happened from befriending people or making enemies. Most of my choices failed to have much impact on the game too.

Thematically, the choice of the Bronze Age setting was novel, but completely squandered by inserting all kinds of anachronistic elements. An example event is the following: a rival king visits you personally, and brings his son, then they get in an argument and you have to decide whose position to support. This would never happen in the real Bronze Age, since travel was too slow for kings to go galavanting around far-off foreign countries. It would also have been far too risky to put both the king and his heir into the power of a foreign court, since in one fell swoop the entire dynasty could be snuffed out, triggering either foreign invasions or civil wars, or both. So the whole premise was laughable for anyone who takes the setting seriously. The cherry on top is that the whole thing is a set-up for a choice that's kind of silly anyways.

I would recommend Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis for fans of grand strategy. I've fallen out of love with the mainline Civ series, but if you want 4X turn-based goodness, the best game in the entire genre remains Alpha Centauri.",1654470982,1654470982,False,6,1,0.504343271255493164,0,True,False,False

As many have observed, it offers a synthesis of aspects of the Civilization franchise and the Crusader kings franchise. I have been binge-playing it it (27 hours, but have only owned it for 4 days), so I guess one could reasonably conclude that I find it enjoyable. 

I read that one of the developer objectives was to create a Civ game that people ACTUALLY FINISH.

Depending on the (highly customize-able) options, a game can be completed in 4-5 hours. The game has some similarities with Gladius, Relics of War, but in addition to the tactical game aspects, it has more depth in development and of course the whole family and political aspects.

[h1]What makes Old World different?[/h1]
Old World brings a number of new features to the genre:

[b]THE ORDERS SYSTEM[/b]
Orders are required to move all of your units, from builders to warriors. So you'll need to prioritize what you want to do each turn, adding a layer of strategy that most other 4x games lack. Conversely, you can use 'Force March' to use all your orders on a single unit if you wish, giving you some crazy strategic options when you really need them.

[b]CHARACTERS & SUCCESSION[/b]
*YOU* are the main character in this game. There's a great deal of immersion with that. It is you that is ruling your kingdom, and you can choose to govern one of your cities or lead one of your units on the battlefield. And that choice brings various advantages (socioeconomic or militaristic) to your empire.

Eventually, you (your king or queen) will die and you'll continue ruling your kingdom via your heir. And that incentivizes you to think ahead and groom your heir accordingly. It's great fun.

[b]CITY SITES[/b]
Unlike most 4x games, you can't just settle anywhere. You can only build on a group of ""urban"" hexes known as a city site. That might sound too limiting, but it's actually quite refreshing. This is a really nice change in terms of balance – you cannot city spam your way to victory. You need to be strategic.

Most of these city sites are guarded by barbarians or diplomatic tribes (and, of course, other nations). So you'll generally need to fight in order to expand.

And here's a free tip – make sure you leave a scout or military unit behind to ""reserve"" the city site once you've cleared it. That prevents other players from settling it. It also prevents the tribe from eventually reclaiming the site.

[b]FAMILIES[/b]
When you build a city, you must choose which family of nobles will run it. You can choose 3 different families to govern cities in your empire, each with their own advantages.

For example, one family type might offer a bonus to lumber mills and mines, while another provides a culture boost per resource node you've developed. So you have a lot of interesting decisions regarding how to min / max your empire as it grows.

[b]""CIVILOPEDIA"" TOOLTIPS[/b]
While there is a searchable Civilopedia-style help guide in the game, even more useful than that is the ability to shift-click on any keyword (underlined) and you'll get a tooltip. This lets you learn more about any aspect of the game on the fly.

What's more, you can go as deep as you want; shift-click one concept to learn about another, and then click another keyword in that tooltip, and so on. It makes the learning curve more manageable.

[b]NUANCED PRODUCTION[/b]
Many Civ-style games involve a production-style economy, with abstract ""production"" determining how long units and projects take to complete. But Old World does this in a more nuanced way. There are actually three different production-style resources that affect your build times:

• Growth – used to produce settlers, builders, scouts, disciples and caravans
• Training – used to produce military units and sea vessels
• Civics – used to produce citizen-based specialists, walls and other city projects

Some cities will be better growth producers, and thus, much better at churning out builders and settlers. Other cities will be training hubs, churning out your armies. And yet others will focus on civics, allowing you to quickly level up the city with urban and rural specialists.

Your builders can help specialize your cities to the max ... or build up your cities more evenly. The choice is entirely yours and caters well to different play styles.

[h1]What makes Old World so good?[/h1]
For me, it's the overall flavor of the game.

[b]IMMERSION[/b]
True, you adopt the role of a leader in other Civ-style games, but this game makes it feel so much more immersive. YOU are the leader, and your choices as leader directly impact your empire's story and success. Will you marry a spouse from this family or that? Will your child be a tactician or an orator? Will you preserve the peace with this tribe, or send them to oblivion and risk upsetting an ally?

The decisions you make are like hundreds of threads in a complex tapestry; pull on this one and you get X result, pull on this one to get Y result, and this one gets you Z result. The game usually tells you what benefits you'll get from your decisions – but not always. There's just enough randomness to throw you a few curve balls and keep things interesting. And if you prefer true randomness, the game options allow you to play blind (aptly called ""roleplaying"").

[b]A FORGIVING ECONOMY[/b]
I described the production-based resources above – growth, training and civics. In addition to contributing to city production, all of these are important for pushing and pulling various levers in the game. For example, civics are also used to enact laws (which offer one benefit or another to your nation) and training allows you to promote your armies (with skills and bonuses).

But there are also more traditional resources – money, food, wood, stone and iron – and all of these can be traded through a global marketplace at any time, right from the start of the game. How often you and the other players buy or sell a resource will set its market price on  a given turn.

This marketplace grants you a lot of flexibility. Don't have enough wood? Sell that food surplus and you're golden. You can even make strategic buys and sells if you pay close attention to the ever-fluctuating market prices.

[b]DEEP BUT INTUITIVE[/b]
This game is complex, but not obnoxiously so. There's a lot of depth here – but the various concepts aren't so difficult to grasp. Things are, for the most part, very intuitive. The UI may feel overwhelming at first, but I've found you can just go with the flow as your story unfolds.

In other words, you can play more casually as you learn the UI and game-play mechanics, and you'll have a great time in the process.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
If you enjoy the 4x genre, get this game. You won't be sorry.

At the time of this writing, Old World is a year out from being published on the Epic Games platform. The developers have done a wonderful job of patching the game and shoring up its weaknesses.

Simply put, it's great fun. I highly recommend it!

[b]FREE TIP TO NEW PLAYERS[/b] – Stone is the lifeblood of Old World's economy. It's the most essential resource in the mid and late game. So build a ton of quarries (preferably next to mountains). Then, when you think you've built enough, build a ton more. Trust me. ;-)",1653072560,1654285020,True,69,0,0.822943687438964844,1,True,False,False

I'm enjoying it so much and am concerned by some of the feedback coming from the ""20 hour"" crowd.  So here is my War and Peace novel on the first 4X game to really suck me in since Civ6.

Characters:
Its just fun to have to think about your heirs and your spouses and what their attitudes are towards you.  The shock I felt my first game when my daughter assasinated me after several slights was genuine and enjoyable.  I've seen others complain about their characters constantly dying off but I find lifespans to be reasonable and flavorful.  The fact that the attributes of your family and court drive global values is also cool as it gives you a lot of focus and control on what you're doing as your characters level.  Succession planning can actually matter as having high value characters die can have significant impact.  Make sure your heirs are doing something productive, even if they're psychos!

Movement/Orders:
My workers aren't working because I didn't order them to!  Freaking slackers.  What an adjustment to have a cap on the amount of movement/action (orders) across all your units.  In Civ you could dominate by building a few productive cities and spam units.  Don't try that here.  Having a shit ton of warriors doesn't matter if you can only move half of them.  It feels restrictive at first but it really isn't.  It forces you to plan ahead and manage your priorities based on what is happening around you.  As your civilization grows, your legitimacy as a ruler rises and your capacity to multi-task grows as well.  Don't be a zerg.

Combat:
I've seen some complaints about combat and I think it could be better, but it isn't bad once you understand it.  The ability to move several units across the map quickly means isolated units can get ganged up on and if you don't have sufficient force to punish with a counter attack, you can fall behind very quickly.  This is compounded by the fact that when two melee units clash, the defending unit does relatively little damage compared to the offensive unit.  Because of this, in an offensive war, you can't just sally off attacking the first city you see because the counter-attack can crush you.  On defense, you must balance between barbarian attacks on the edges while still maintaining a sufficient central force that can deploy to a threat.  There is a definite ""Battle Brothers"" feel to it.  That said, I do wish promotions and generals mattered a bit more.  It definitely feels bad to have the unit you poured resources into get wiped by 3 or 4 scrub archers and a chariot.

Winning:
4x struggles in the late game.  This is no secret.  Knowing you're going to win but having to complete thousands of meaningless tasks over 2 to 3 hours of game play to get over the finish line can wear you down.  Every Civilization game I've ever played suffers from this.  My general approach is to focus on my win-con, use multi-queuing as much as possible, and try to avoid late game military combat.  

So how does this game stack up?  Well, the late game is tedious.  There's a lot to do.  Your court size increases exponentially, worker spam is back, and the more cities you have, the more queues need to be managed.  Multi-queue and automating workers helps a lot once you're comfortably ahead.  But as others have said, waiting for your next turn on larger maps can get pretty tedious as well.  I honestly think that with some optimization and a better balanced set of win conditions, the late game could improve dramatically.  They definitely have some creative ideas in the win condition realm.  Here are my thoughts on where they stand currently:

Domination Victory: If you try to do this, good luck.  Even if you manage it, you'll probably trigger another victory condition first.  If you don't, call me in 2 months when you finish.

Double Points: This one is actually a bit frustrating on lower levels because it can trigger suddenly.  Basically you earn victory points throughout the game (think Settlers of Catan).  If you double the next highest civ total, the game ends... just when you were starting to have fun.  On higher levels, I doubt this win condition is all that feasible unless you have a God start or do some serious domination.

Complete 10 ambitions:  These are random missions that show-up from time-to-time throughout the game.  The AI doesn't have access to this victory condition so its up to you.  There's an element of chance here because Ambitions vary wildly and they're not always compatible with what you're up to.  In addition, if you select one and don't complete it within a certain amount of time, you get a penalty.  I've won this way but its hard to plan it out.  Usually I just happen to get it finished before I reach a points victory that I probably would have gotten anyway.

Victory Points: There is a victory point number assigned based on the Map you're on.  First person to get to that total wins.  If 200 years pass and no one reaches the total, highest points win (God help you if you have to go 200 turns).  Most efficient way to do this is typically power as many wonders as possible while pouring culture into your cities.  You get points for cities anyway and as their culture increases, the point values become exponential.  This favors highly expansionist play style.  I've had some fun games carving at AI borders and incorporating enough cities to get over the finish line and I definitely like this win condition as a variety of gameplay can contribute to the total.  In a weird sense, it can almost be THE victory condition as you can use numerous play styles to get to it.

Final Thoughts:
There are a lot of things going on in this game that are fun and enjoyable to explore.  Not everything is intuitive and it can take some work to figure things out.  But it is very rewarding and the experience is more personal because of the character element.  You also don't have those jarring moments that you have in Civ where you're just starting to enjoy having knights and now you're moving into the industrial era.  You can really relish the experience and flavor of a full game in one era.  I highly recommend it and am hopeful that new features, world events, balancing, and optimization continue coming from the developers.

Most egregious is combat, which is completely unbalanced. All advantages lies with the attacker, and there is no way to defend yourself, except by attacking. On harder difficulty the only way to play the game is rushing with attacks. 

Also the micromanagement has a way of expanding the number of systems as the game progresses, which is great for a tutorial, but terrible for a 4x game where you end up with nothing to do to begin with and too much to do later.

A lot of people complain about the fact you can only settle in specific spots, but it really isn't that bad. It makes settling more meaningful, and ware with the AI scarier. But their complaints are valid.

There are far less military units in this game than Civ, but after playing around with them, they are a lot more versatile than Civ units. Each unit can level up 5 times. Each level gives 4 randomly chosen traits that you can pick from. And the traits will drastically change the units strengths. The game seems to be more likely to give you an upgraded version of a trait already selected, allowing you to stack a specific trait. You can also assign generals to each unit, which can give additional traits, and significantly boost the base stats of said unit. Different civs leader's, and generals can further change/add stats to your units. In short, Rome's archers could be greatly different than Greece's archers.

The game limits how many actions you can take per turn via a system called ""orders"". It felt very limiting at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will quickly realize that the game gives you plenty of orders to work with. The use of orders does limit your ability to fight a war on multiple fronts, to macro while fighting, etc. However, being limited makes pursuing diplomacy for meaningful, as constantly being at war will begin to hamper your ability to build infrastructure.

The game breaks up Civ's production system into several different forms of ""currency"". You will need to generate ""work"" to make military units, and ""growth"" to make civilian units. This system seems fine. I only add it because the game wasn't very straightforward in telling you this.

My biggest gripe with the game currently is the lack of variance in win conditions. There is only 4. 1. Complete 10 ambitions (essentially 10 quests that become increasingly more difficult. If your leaders dies before completing one, you have 20 turns to finish it before it fails. You have some choice on which ones you accept.) 2. Max out your Victory points. 3. Have more than half of total victory points needed, but double the next highest player. 4. Have the most victory points after 200 turns. You can technically have a domination victory by wiping everyone else out, but you would have victory condition 3 before that would happen.

Overall, the game is pretty good. Its not really a clone of either CK or Civ, but implements some nice elements from those games. If you like 4x games, then you will likely enjoy this game.

For context I have hundreds of hours on Humankind and thousands of hours logged playing civ 5 and 6. Edit: I have also logged almost 50 hours on the epic store version of the game, as detailed below. 

Old World is developed in a way that seems to be attempting to address nonexistent problems in 4X games. The orders system, tech hand and shuffling, random events system, and discontent are all excellent techniques to hold players back from spamming units and abusing 4X mechanics. The problem with them is that they don't scale well at all. The randomness and lack of versatility imposed by these systems is prohibitive and keeps gameplay from feeling natural and free-flowing. 

The single biggest issue I have with this game is the changes that they made during beta sometime after its initiial release on the Epic Games store and now. I put almost 50 hours into this game back when it was publicly released on the Epic store, and things like combat and interfacing with AI competitors was MUCH more streamlined and intuitive. War was straightforward. Unit bonuses were noticeable and directly impactful to combat. Attaching generals to units made them much stronger. Now the combat system feels like there is a 100 lb weight on the AI side of the balance. Its complete b******t. Since these updates, I haven't won a war. Fully promoted units WITH relevant promotions to each battle (i.e. swordsman vs AI horseman with bonuses against generals, mounted units, combat buffs, and bonus against damaged) are getting killed effortlessly. Battles are heavily lopsided in favor of the AI even on the lowest difficulties. No matter how much effort I spend on unit terrain placement, attack buffs, etc., I still get my ass kicked by every single type of military I face. Its unrealistic and asinine. The game wasn't always like this and there has to be a middle ground to make it more playable for causal gamers like myself. Humankind, CIV, etc don't have this issue at all. 

The problem stacks when you constantly have to bend over and accept the relentless demands of AI leaders or else go to war. People on reddit happily inform you that its just part of the game and that you just have to take the punishment. You always have to play nice and allow the AI to take 25% of your gold for 40 turns, or impose their religion on you by force or else be invaded. Not only is this totally unrealistic, its totally overdone. Couple that with the broken combat system in this game and you essentially have a strategy game where you are a giant pushover for the first 100 turns no matter whether you are Romans or Hittites. You can drop all of your military points into building units, promoting them, adding generals, and then having them mowed down at the drop of a hat without any real recourse.

Devs, you are trying too hard to make this game into the Dark Souls of 4X. It was previously much more enjoyable and natural feeling. Now it plays like a game that celebrates a style of gameplay that is out of touch with reality and favors the AI beyond a reasonable point. As it stands I do not recommend the game. If the devs read this and compromise by walking back some of these insane adjustments they've handed the AI, then I'll change my tune.

As with any hex-tile based empire builder, your first question will be: ""How does it compare to Civ?""
In a few words, very well. Old World brings a more complex, character driven approach to the classic Civ formula, that sacrifices variety for depth and quality. 

There's only nine different civilizations to chose from (at least for now), and compared to Civ's first settlements to space race time frame, Old World is laser focused on the Bronze and Iron Ages. If you're someone who never plays the same civ twice, or are attached to playing through later time periods, these could be deal breakers. However, Old World makes up for this with an engaging and complete campaign experience, centered on characters and events. 

Despite the short time frame, the tech tree feels complete and rewarding, in part because it pulls double duty as replacement for Civ's tech and culture trees, as well as a portion of the game's religious mechanics. 
The character and event system is comparable to the ones present in Paradox Interactive titles, particularly Crusader Kings. Balancing relations with different civilizations, barbarian tribes, religions, and prominent political families within your nation, as well as your own dynasty, with succession laws and character attributes, means that the world feels much more alive than a play through of Civ 6, where the average game has one static ""character"" for each civ, which will never change, both over the course of a game and between different games. This gives you more to both read and do on a turn-to-turn basis, and is part of why you'll almost never have a turn where you ""do nothing"", and simply let ongoing projects and unit pathing continue.

The other, much larger part is the game's Orders mechanic, which is probably it's biggest and best innovation in the genre. Unit actions, such as building, moving,  and attacking, as well as character activities, such as appointing governors or tutoring your children, all consume orders, which is a special resource that replenishes each turn. The amount you generate can be increased by certain structures, character attributes, activities, laws, and technologies. This system resolves one of the 4x genres most notorious issues: the end game unit spam and death stacking.  In Old World, a massive army is useless if you don't have enough orders to support it, as most of your units will be unable to move or attack. On the other hand, this also allows individual units to do more, as you can move units beyond their movement range by spending extra orders (as well as an initial 100 points of the military resource). This means that, if you had to, you could take a unit on one side of your empire, and move it all the way to the opposite end in a single turn. Now, it could still only attack once, and doing so will certainly consume a good portion of that turn's orders, but it helps free units from the worst restrictions of a traditional movement system. It's actually possible to have a smaller army that's spread across your borders, as you can quickly move them to where their needed when a threat arises, rather than forcing you to have an army wherever you might need one. This also means military units have an ongoing cost that is directly tied-to how much you use them, in addition to more traditional unit upkeep.

The other major change is the splitting of ""production"" into multiple resources, with different units and projects requiring different resources. The ability of a city to produce workers, spearmen, specialists to work tile improvements, and city projects, are all dictated by different resources, forcing them to specialize. These aren't hard limits, and any city can still (generally) make anything, they will just be less efficient at that role. 

There is also resource management, with Food, Iron, Stone, and Wood being required for various units and improvements. Gold exists as well, and each resource can be bought and sold (with moderate tariffs to encourage a balanced economy). This is particularly useful when an improvement, wonder, or event requires a particular amount of a resource, and you can simply hold alt to buy whatever resources are needed to complete that action.

There are many other aspects I haven't covered, such as interacting with tribal factions, the General system for units, the different political families and how you interact with them, to name a few. However, I think this gives a decent overview of some of Old World's major features and what sets it apart from other entries in the ""Civ-like"" genre.

TL;DR:
Overall I highly recommend the game, particularly for experienced Civ fans looking for a more complex and engaging experience, and I think it's worth the price, given the amount of time I'm expecting to put into it; however, the small number of currently playable factions and limited historical scope may turn off some players.

I'm not qualified to speak on the balance and overall experience of Multiplayer or high-level AI (So far I've only played on Noble difficulty). For a good tutorial guide on learning how to play, I'd recommend the YouTube content of PotatoMcWhiskey, a seasoned veteran of the genre.",1653938036,1653938036,True,8,0,0.562318801879882813,0,True,False,False

It's worth noting that game is deep and complex, with an astonishingly steep learning curve and a very off-putting UI that may make getting into the game difficult, and will likely push away some players who want a lighter or more casual game. 

But once you get into it, the game is fascinating. It's complex, dozens of decisions every turn which cascade into a beautiful symphony of planning. Between the orders system, the fixed-location cities (this has really grown on me), the random events, the random leaders, and the absolutely brilliant tech-card system (managing the deck, planning 2-3 techs ahead, having to adapt on the fly are all great), every game is a labyrinth of trying to plan around the constraints that you find yourself in, and means that even two games with identical starts can end very differently. 

The combat is incredible, you may see mixed reviews of the combat in this reviews area, but trust me it's awesome. It does take some getting used to though, and the strategies you're used to from Civilization simply won't work here. Combat is all about who gets the first strike. Because there's effectively no counter-attack damage and units move fast and hit hard, it's very common in war for each side to take out several enemy units on their turn, only to lose several back on the enemy turn. This means that war comes down to scouting, positioning on a macro and micro level, and timing, as much as it does to production and stats. If you struggled with the combat, I urge you to give it another chance, there's so much to love here once you learn how different the tactics are from what you're used to. 

80 hours in, I still feel like I have so much room to improve at this game, and I'm far from believing I've discovered any truly dominant strategies. I greatly look forward to exploring more of this games options. Speaking of options, there's tons of game-start options to toy with. I'm especially excited about the ""Ruthless AI"" option which obliterated me the first time I tried it. 

I don't claim this is a perfect game though. Some criticisms include:
- The UI is at once too much and too little. It's easy to be overwhelmed (and it's ugly in many places), but there's also info I can't find when I want it (I would especially love a much better breakdown of my upkeep costs)
- The game can get laggy, especially the interface, in the second half of a game.
- The win conditions are anticlimactic, and often come too early in the game. (I'm finding most of my games end around turn 120, well before I've really gotten to play with the higher level techs or laws) I would really appreciate an option to say add X% to the number of victory points or ambitions needed to win, so that the game only ends when one player is really the undisputed ruler of the world.
- The characters, while very mechanically rich, didn't add much of an immersion/roleplaying element to this game. The game is all crunch and very little fluff in my opinion. Also there's not nearly enough portraits (by like a factor of 10). 

I would say that overall, Old World feels like a successful attempt to make a highly game-y 4x game. It will 100% reward every bit of effort you put into becoming more skilled at playing it, and it has enough depth to allow you to continue to improve for hours on end. But if you're looking for a lighter more role-play-y game, or if Crusader Kings is more your jam than Civilization, this probably won't be for you.",1653937837,1653937849,True,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

- Literally Crusader Kings and Civilization. You have to manage political intrigue while building your empire
- excellent resource management you can actually buy resources you're short on...something so small yet so big
- Exploration matters
- Infrastructure is simple yet hyper important
- You can set up long range plans that will go on through your descendants
- Perfect civilization pacing

Cons:
- Combat is meh. Defenders dont counter attack, so its very guerrilla warfare-esque...something definitely not seen in the ancient world
- Not a big fan of the random tech selections
- Not enough musical selection
- Ive never been a fan of only being able to place cities in specific areas.

The premise appeals to me so strongly, a mix of Civ and CKIII, the likes of games I sank thousands of hours into. 

The breakdown of global achievements clearly shows I'm not the only one. If anything, the 20 hours I spent in the game is far longer than most: only 50-some percent players complete the first tutorial mission. That's understandable. There are a lot of new concepts and a lot of great things Old World is trying to do, complex mechanics that need to be explained even to veteran players. The tutorials do a pretty terrible job of that: they take the tell, not show approach with walls of text, overexplaining common 4X tropes, skimming over Old World specifics. 

Even more Old World specifics aren't tutorialized altogether. You just stumble upon mysterious things, and have to navigate byzantine UI in order to figure out what happened, why it happened, and what influenced it.

Which gets me to this game's Achilles heel: its AI. Now, don't get me wrong, the AI is great: smart, challenging, unpredictable. But this AI belongs in something like Old World VI, when your average Old World fan is about as experienced and familiar with the game as the average dev. In this title however, this basically pits folks taking Chess 101 against Deep Blue. This is Dark Souls I pitting you against Margit, the Fell Omen, as soon as exit the starting room.

[b]The Good[/b]:
* Great idea for a mix between tried-and-true Paradox and Firaxis 4X games
* Historically accurate and rich
* Great visuals and ambiance

[b]The Bad[/b]:
* Punishing, learn-as-you-go, lose-hours-of-gameplay difficulty
* Cryptic mechanics, often kept hidden until AI pulls it out of its sleeve to kill yet another playthrough
* Horrid 1990s UI and UX, navigating daisy chains of pop-ups

Right up until you go to war. War is so absolutely horrendously implemented in this game that I really can't overstate just how much it saps the fun out of the game. It pretty much always results in a stalemate with both sides throwing endless hordes of disposable units at the other.

To clarify, the main issue is that the orders system practically allows both the player and the AI to teleport units across the map, and defending units do almost no damage to the attacker (generally, the attacker takes one damage if it's a melee attack unless it's attacking a ranged unit, and no damage otherwise out of 20 hp). This means that every time you hit end turn, you should expect that a big army is going to appear from out of nowhere and destroy at least one of your units for almost no damage in return.

If they make the combat not awful, this becomes absolutely 100% recommended. The game is really good apart from that, the combat is just REALLY bad. And the cramped nature of the maps/settlement system compounds this by making it REALLY necessary because you'll very quickly run out of room to expand. 

And don't get me started on naval combat (it's like the land combat, except there's a promotion that gives a 100% chance to stun the target so it can't do anything on its next turn--remember how defending doesn't do damage?).

UPDATE: Disabling forced march seems to have reduced the problem enough to where the game flows a little better so I'm switching this review to recommended. However, the lack of retaliation damage combined with the vast movement distances in the game still tends to result in units getting wiped out for free, which I think still leaves the combat as the weakest part of the game by far. The combat is more about the number of units you can throw at the enemy than how you use them. Where in civ it's important to leave durable units in front to absorb damage, the nearest equivalent in Old World is to simply have expendable units in range so that when something inevitably dies as soon as you press end turn, it's not something you care about. Naval combat has no such equivalent and will probably remain unequivocally bad so long as the grappler promotion (mentioned above) remains, which is so overpowered that any unit with it can reliably beat any unit without it in a 1 vs 1. The AI seems to recognize this and put it on every ship it can, so if you don't outnumber the AI's navy, just expect to lose any naval engagement no matter how powerful your individual ships may be. 

A smaller issue which emerges from the problems I've outlined above is that unit variation borders on simply being cosmetic. Infantry can travel long distances, rendering cavalry largely irrelevant. Melee units take almost no damage from attacking, while ranged units are nearly as durable, making the differences enough to be noticeable, but minor enough to not especially matter.

POSITIVES

While I've been harping on about the combat system, I would like to stress again that the rest of the game is very fun. Of particular note, the city management is unique and works well. Essentially, your workers/builders build the city while the city center is responsible for creating units. 
While I think the order system as it relates directly to combat is questionable, it works well everywhere else by requiring/rewarding focusing on the most important moves. This means that, while your city centers may not be stretched thin by, for instance, going to war, you may still find your economic development lagging behind as a result. 
The dynasty system is alright. It's very similar to crusader kings, but feels a little more... forgettable? I'm not trying to bash it, because it's overall a fun system, it's just not as big of a deal as it might sound at first. It's not halfway between civ and ck, it's more like civ with a little bit of ck flavor.",1653375318,1653781072,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

1. Enemy units move over your entire vision range in one turn. I've seen elephants from their capital embark go 7 tiles on boat disembark walk 4 tiles and attack. In a single round. Building fronts is just madness.
2. Units that attack take no damage. This is even more absurd. What is this simulating? Game play wise this leads to insane optimal strategies. Since if you are attacked by your western neighbor you should have all you units as far from the front as possible, that you can let them enter deep into your territory and then just kill them with the counterattack taking no damage. What?
This also makes combat incredibly one sided. You either just mop the floor with them or vice versa. 

Edit: After more time i maintain my criticism. The infinite movement is really insane. The enemy is breaking through at the center? Just teleport in 6 units to kill them. Need a unit to finish off an enemy unit? Just teleport a cavalry unit 20 tiles(for three orders over boats btw) and finish off not one but three enemies. 
On the opponents turn you get to watch this from the other side. Fresh spawned Units just walk from Assur to Babylon(500km in rl) in one round and attack. 
The effect is that you essentially just trade off units and combat devolves to a drunken bar fight in a chaos dimension. 

It also devalues a lot of decision making, because mistakes in unit distribution are easily mitigated by just teleporting. There is no possibility to perfectly position your units so you lose nothing in the counterattack because you will be attacked from newly produced units halfway around the world that you obviously could not know about/plan for. Yes if you are inefficient with your orders you pay in the long run. In the context of the war i never ran out of orders for my units (just for everything else at times). 

If you have a slight advantage you just snowball because defensive positions do not exist. (Not even a city wall(and subsequent defensive buildings)/stronghold/citadel building keeps enemies from entering your urban areas)

For me the conclusion is: Tactical combat in old world feels like stepping into a insanity dimension of teleporting bronze-iron age units. If you can accept this it might be worth trying, since it is overall very innovative in every system. I will just mention one and otherwise refer to other reviews: The order mechanic makes alliances incredibly important. If you can get another civ to declare war on a common target and you have 80 orders of your alliance against 40 orders for the target they will loose even if their military would be strong enough to fight both, they just can’t order their troops to fight both. So the setup before the war, the posturing at the border can be genuinely interesting, once the war starts the dice are cast and it gets boring to me. For this reason Multiplayer might be very interesting/stressful. (Though i have not and probably will not try.)",1653002026,1653767291,False,557,13,0.865160822868347168,0,True,False,False

Old World is a really unique blend of Civilization and Crusader Kings. It's got some creative ways to solve some of the problems that the Civilization series has right now, and also tries to solve some of the problems that Crusader Kings has. What you end up with is something in the middle.

This is a very complicated game. If you love the 4X genre, you'll probably like it a lot. You will most likely start out unsure if you even like this game, as I did. Give it a bit more time, the complexities start to shine and it really draws you in. Bonus points: the AI is actually very hard to deal with and so far, the game seems very balanced.

I really liked some aspects, such as the music, the setting, the artwork of the character portraits, the graphics in general. I actually enjoyed the pre-set city aspects, take the rushing like a maniac for a really strategic spot such as can happen in Civ games. I enjoyed the order system once I got my head around it, though clearly I was doing something wrong as my opponents seemed to have at least twice at many as I did at all times. 

What I didn't enjoy is far more substantial. The graphics are good, but they're also weirdly fuzzy and hard to discern - everything kind of looks the same. Civ V, when you highlighted strategic resources, gave very clear sharp icons that made it really easy to recognize what was what on a grounded map. By comparison, in OW you get a tiny font text saying the what you are looking at is dyes. I found it tiring to use, and having to zoom in constnatly to see what was what is kind of annoying. 
I found the almost constant barrage of decisions just got worse and worse as the game went on. I get the dynastic qualities that take from Crusader Kings, but I don't find it enjoyable. Characters die pretty damn fast (which I  gather can be lengthened in the options, but I can't be bothered to run an entirely new game to see how this works out), but in the end, there are so many members of the court and family, and they die off so rapidly, that who cares. Picking a governors can take several minutes looking at the massive lists of bonuses and maluses, and that might be over four or five candidates, and before you know it, they're dead. The last turn I played before quitting, I had seven different pop up decisions to make before I could even move units, build things, etc. By the last few I just clicked what seemed the least damaging decisions.

Speaking of decisions, it doesn't seem to matter what you do regarding opponents, they arbitrarily hate you, or if they love you, their opinion spins on a pin to loathing you - have a ruler of Rome who's your buddy? Well his son is a psychopathic drunk and the years of trade and peace doesn't mean jack anymore and the Roman state despises you. It's not particularly fun in game terms, plus making relationships with the ai seems to boil down to massively bribing them or kowtowing to their demands. I also really hate the ""You must declare war on A to stay at peace with B, or declare was on B to stay at peace with A"" decisions - screw you game, I'm classical Switzerland! Fear my chocolate and clocks! 

But, but, all these, the not great graphical display, the decision fatigue, the crappy diplomacy, the endless seemingly irrelevant choices, the increasingly massive and unwieldy court that becomes a chore to manage, all this is trumped by the one straw that breaks the camel archers back. Combat sucks. I mean, I really really don't like, and it could have redeemed the entire experience for me, but it doesn't, it sweeps the legs and riffles through the pockets of the fallen. And I think I've worked out the most egregious aspects. For me its that there really is no defensive aspect - yes you can build forts, and units take less ranged damage in trees, but that's because to be on the open terrain is suicide. Units take pretty huge damage (sometimes half), but do virtually no retaliatory damage, so you're forced into constant attack. And units die soooo rapidly, I don't know if I'm just not getting some game mechanic (but I can't be the only player) but I hit end turn, the enemy wipe out one of two units, I do virtually no damage back, they retreat their damaged units, then the Mongol Horde of reinforcements suddenly come out of the fog of war. Did I mention that that unit that got wiped out (with its general and five promotions) took 7 turns to build? Maybe 10 for large units, but they die just as fast. So yes, combat feels like a frustrating sloggy mess with a cheaty little bitch of an ai. I don't find it fun, and for me that really hamstrings any fun from the game.

What sets this game apart is the world and character building events- as an avid daydreamer who also loves visual novels, I was HOOKED by this game's style! Text heavy, beautiful art, lovely music, and a complicated system that I always learn more about each time I play. Every run feels different, and the role playing element is easily my favorite aspect of the game. 

As many other reviews mention, if you play other 4X games, combat/war is different due to the nature of the order system. I won't go more into it since I don't even like war in other 4X games -- too many units to manage especially by mid/end game. What I will say is that I am a player who mostly tries to avoid conflict and use diplomacy first, and I have no beef. I honestly didn't consider it a big issue until seeing reviews here, I think the choices made sense due to the way the rest of the game play is designed. 

If combat is your bread and butter in strategy games and you don't like the idea of overwhelming your opponent or getting beat down, maybe this isn't for you.

The real gripe I have is stupid AI occupying stupid City-State tiles so I cannot expand, it's the Civ-equivalent of buying all the houses in Monopoly. It's a perfectly legitmate, completely dominant strategy. Expansion sites are limited, and being able to deny them to other players/forcing them to start a war to expand means they can grow and I can't, so we just end up with a rich-get-richer game and that sucks.

Thank you so much to the team for reaching out and helping me, for making an amazing game, for listening to your playerbase, and I cant wait to play more!

Initial Review:
I want to start by saying I love the game so far and I hate that this is the first review I have ever taken the time to write. It has a massive amount of potential and I am legitimately excited about playing it more and its future.

The main issue is that the game crashes very frequently (whether playing the main campaign or even tutorials) and I happen to have a decent system.

Coming from Civ, AoE, CK, this game manages to pull so many aspects of those together while remaining completely distinct in its approach. A lot of that is helped by the beautiful setting. Very few games approach the Bronze Age + early Classical Age with such vigor, extracting every element of fun design and narrative from it and then putting it into the game. Often times this period is the backdrop for what's to come, the early foundations for your burgeoning empire. But here, in the age of empires, this is it and I don't want anything else.

The tutorial is fairly robust and pretty fun to play, especially compared to some other strategy tutorials. There aren't many scenarios, but I'm currently playing through Carthage's and it's fantastic. Again, this setting puts the spotlight on empires we all have heard of, but haven't gotten their chance to be the main character.

Beyond the usual empire building that you would find in Civ, is a compelling layer of family intrigue and events not unlike Crusader Kings. It does not feel like an add-on in any way. Families are a core part of the gameplay and if you ignore them, you could pay dearly. Alternatively, keeping good relations with them will yield great bonuses. Although not nearly as robust as CK's, it feels very appropriate for what this game wants it to be.

One of my favorite aspects of the game, and something I'm still trying to take full advantage of, is how powerful Orders can be. Instead of meticulously making sure everything in your empire is going at 110% efficiency, you only have a finite number of Orders each turn. And Orders are how you do everything. That means that if 80% of your Orders are put towards a war, your workers may be idle for far longer than you would want. On the flip side, the empire might welcome an economic boon, but also welcome enemies at the gates. This push-and-pull mechanic is great, and reminiscent of some really cool board games.

There are some aspects of the game that appear more hidden than I would want them to be. I wish the UI was a little better so I could navigate things like my trades more effectively. I also wish combat was more upfront in how the numbers impact each other. A little trial-and-error will reveal many things, but there are some moving parts that remain hidden to me.

There are plenty more features you can get into (drawing research cards, promotions + generals, etc.), but to wrap this up, overall, I highly recommend this game. If you love strategy, or the time period, and are waiting for the next installment of Civ, I don't think you will find much better.

Also the soundtrack is sooo good but you can only hear it after you research music - lol.",1653576903,1653576903,True,2,0,0.501420438289642334,0,True,False,False

If you like 4x and want to try something a little different, I think this game can be a lot of fun. But the CK3 comparisons I saw in online reviews were a bit misleading, so maybe try to keep that comparison out of your head.

The succession, tribe, and family house dynamics add a fun layer of complexity that lets you try out strategies you really can't in other 4x games (playing Dido and making nice with the tribes can be *surprisingly* powerful), while making sure you balance priorities like keeping families happy and watching out for stabby bypassed heirs. And the achievements system provides a different way of playing for less warlike play-throughs, which can make a nice change from the usual space-race-style 4x And they've made it pretty mod-friendly, which usually works out pretty well for Steam games.

On the other hand, you really can't expect too much from the leaders/personas, and if you're a CK3 fan trying out your first 4x... maybe don't. While the systems look like they're set up to be nuanced and complex, it really, *really* doesn't compare to CK3, and I don't think it's really meant to. So while I as a CK3 fan get irritated at certain things in the system that just don't make sense to me (e.g. If I'm the King, why can't I arrange my nephew's marriage? Is he going to tell his uncle-king *NO*?), and other things that seem a bit underdeveloped (religions are... there... I guess, but they're basically happiness-/foreign relations-management tools that add nothing really special to the game)... I think these are probably really good things for other players who may have found CK3 to be too overwhelming.

Basically, this game isn't meant to be another uber-complex CK3-style layers-upon-layers kind of game. So if  that's all you're looking for? Not recommended. But if you're looking for a unique 4x experience with some different mechanics that gives some different victory and playthrough options, I think this game is a really fun way to do that.",1653572358,1653572358,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Worried that its just another 4x
or, somewhat contrary to the first
2. Its too much of a hybrid and this has diluted the 4x experience. 

My answer is that Old World succeeds at both staying true to basic 4x principles (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) while also crafting a seamless blending of role play elements (a la Crusader Kings, as often mentioned) into the game itself. I would add a fifth X to this game, Express. Build characters and styles of play for your civilization across time. Creating multiple custom styles of play in a single civilization is a real strength to Old World that is lacking in other games in the genre, in my opinion. 

I think Old World found the goldilocks zone, so to speak, in terms of its hybridization. Yes, the additional mechanics create a different experience, and no, they do not require additional training or know how that can't be found reading the manual. My goodness, check out the manual! Don't give it a read all at once, but absolutely look through. Not only that, play the tutorials! The tutorials are actually fun and instructive, which is something worthwhile to mention given the state of some tutorials in other games. 

And for those still irked by the role play elements, if the role play is not something you are interested in, you can actually turn it off. Not something everyone has mentioned but again, read the manual and voila. 

Also, I just want to say the soundtrack absolutely slaps. I mean, seriously, its great. There is one track I have taken to calling ""Broccoli"". You will know it when you hear it. 

I put  over 2000 hours into Civ 5. I put in only around 100 in Civ 6. If Old World sees more updates, added civilizations, and workshop support, I think Old World will be closer to my Civ 5 experience than Civ 6",1653352116,1653530716,True,68,0,0.841906189918518066,0,True,False,False

I'm finding it very fun and addictive and am really enjoying my time with it. That said, it has a ""first pass at a genre"" feel to it in that there seem to be with a number of areas where it could use some more polish and balance.

The first major addition is citybuilder elements. Cities no longer have abstracted buildings which are the same in all cities. Instead, cities are groups of improvements laid out on a map, and individual improvements have bonuses and restrictions based both on the terrain and on adjacent improvements. This adds a nice little minigame for each city trying to plan a layout. For example, your military and command building benefit from having as much adjacency as possible between military and command; but that requires particular layouts and a fair amount of space and sometimes you might have to sacrifice some efficiency there to leave some good resource spots open. 

The second shift is adding characters in an RPG style. An empire contains a number of ""important people"" with personalities, interests, interactions, and abilities, including your leader. They go through their lives and eventually die and have to be replaced. Your leader's traits produce bonuses or maluses to your entire country. Other people can be placed as generals of military units, governors of cities, or cabinet members, and their traits and preferences will produces bonuses and maluses there. You are presented with frequent choices which can affect the characters - for example, there is a disagreement at a feast where you can support either side; the side you support will like your leader more and the other will like them less. Or, if your leader has the right traits, you can reconcile them and they'll both like you! 

These elements aren't entirely new to 4X ; Conquest of the New World had laid out cities in a 4X way back in 1996 and the 2019 Paradox game Imperator added some similar RPG elements. But I've never seen them combined this way, and they have also been executed rather well; I like them better in Old World than either of those predecessors. The combination of all the element adds a really strong immersive aspect, like being in a complex and interesting novel. 

Still, there are a number of elements I find a bit rough. The early Civilizations (up to 2 and sort of 3) had a problem in that the early game was about creating as large an empire as possible. Some people like that, sure, but I find it repetitive and then running the resulting empire gets pretty tedious. Soren Johnson, the lead designer, was lead designer of Civ 4, the masterpiece that definitively fixed the city spam problem, so I was expecting Old World to have substantial costs to wide expansion - but it doesn't. So the opening of the game is a mad scramble for city sites which reminds me of a game style I haven't played - and haven't missed - for over 15 years. The scramble in Old World is a lot more interesting, because you at least have to contend with some native defenders, and the sites have more ""personality"" because of the citybuilder aspects; but all the same I wish there were more rewards for focusing on a few good cities early. Games are about interesting choices, and wide vs. tall is not a choice early in Old World.

Some of the pacing could use some polish too. For example, there are virtually no buildings available to improve research or development for a long period of the game, and then multiple buildings for both become available at about the same time. The game tries to gate them by city cultural development; but they show up so late they're immediately widely available. Those could have been paced so *some* was available fairly early and *some* was unavailable until very late; but it's not. So there's a long period where you can't do much about those resources, and then a mad scramble to get libraries and courthouses down, and then - back to not much to do. 

In all, though, it's been a fun play so far, and I'm looking forward to future expansions or sequels that can improve the polish and balance, as we've seen through the years with the Civ series.",1653518368,1653518368,True,2,0,0.534161508083343506,0,True,False,False

I follow a Civ youtuber who found the game, and began recommending it highly, going as far as to upload his own play-through of the game. I watched the first episode and was taken back as to how much there was on the screen. Compared to Civ 6 (the game which I will compare it to the most, although graphically it is definitely similar to Civ 4/5), you feel overwhelmed at first, and the amount of options you get can almost be overwhelming. I bit the bullet and bough the game, and I managed to accumulate 22 hours in the last 3 days. This game is unforgiving, and I love that. Learning to balance all of the various groups and peoples in the game is a constant struggle, and when you pair this with the frankly ingenious orders mechanic, you already find yourself with a worthwhile experience. But the game provides more, mainly in the story department. This is a feature sorely lacking in Civ, with the most ""interaction"" being basic requests such as ""don't attack me"" or ""let's go to war"". The amount of characters and dialogue presented helps set the game apart from other 4X titles, and this is all reinforced by intelligent design choices, such as the shuffling tech tree or the open, yet unforgiving environment. All in all, I highly recommend this game to any Civ fan, moreover those who like titles such as Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron. 
My complaints are few, namely I would have liked to have seen some more playable northern characters (Gauls, perhaps), and I dislike the fact that all games are bordered (you will come across an unpassble line at the edge of the map. which may make sense considering the game's desire to 'stick to the script', but really just ends up being an annoyance, or worst case a liability, especially when you spawn in a corner and are immediately blocked off by 1-2 AI players. I also disliked how much I had (and will have) to learn, the barrier of entry is very high for this game. Roads are also useless, units traverse incredibly quickly, and I would recommend a buff to them. Parts of the UI are also quite basic (thinking of the Mod menu and the Save menu).

Let’s get something straight from the beginning: this is not the worst, not the best game ever. And it’s not for everyone. Most likely, the classical player would already be very familiar with Civilization (1,2,3,4,5,6), pre-purchased Humankind and is nostalgic about Heroes III.
Therefore, the game does not aim for graphical supremacy. Is bringing decent graphical features but nothing [i]great[/i]. And music is unimpressive, at best. 

On the good side, it brings a few innovations which most likely will revolutionise the 4X genre and beyond. The “undo” feature, for example, is so much needed in all other games! Again, even if the music is uninspiring – the built-in music player!! Yes!! something everyone would very much like in his/her game, regardless of the genre. Full featured music player is present and you can only wonder – what were all game designers thinking in the past 20 years to miss this… ?! 😊
Thank you, Mohawk!

The entire diplomacy is distinct and innovative. You get closer to your characters, even if it gets out of control pretty soon. And the possibility to influence, to [i]tutor[/i] your next king/queen... Brilliant !...just brilliant!

The flop of the game is subtle. 
It’s not the fact that it doesn’t continue past a certain timeline. I believe as of 2022 there is no great game on the market which is both complex and braids wonderfully Phalanx & Tanks confrontation. The Civ spice/aim, to clash the technical advancement with earlier eras, it never worked beyond the graphics. Mechanics featuring this complexity still fail us in all other 4X present games. So, that the Old World is focusing on a limited timeline is actually a great thing. Simplify. And master your game. Very good! It stays playable up to the end and the studio does not need to hear childish complains and watch rolling eyes about how unbalanced the game gets into the Atomic Era...
Well, it hurts the replay value, yes, but again – that’s not its’ biggest flaw. Just a trade-off.

What really bothers me, what I hate, is the distinct feeling that I’m solving an VIII grade algebra equation. I don’t play a game. I’m only seeing numbers. 6 is better than 5, but -1 is worse than -2 etc.
Too many numbers. Too much information. I’m no longer a math student. I might be an engineer or a programmer, but I want to relax. I want to [b]forget[/b] about it.
The immersion then, gets extremely low. You are overwhelmed with information which other games are struggling so hard to hide. I cannot understand why the hex grid cannot be toggled off…?
Now, don’t get me wrong: all games [b][i]are[/i][/b] an equation. Everything down there is mathematics of course, and I do love mathematics. And when not visible, I dig deep to understand the mechanics and improve my gameplay. But having no dissimulation layer and presenting the numbers upfront – I dunno. Is just disconcerting. 
I am disappointed. 
It feels unfinished. And at the same time, everything must change in order to feel better. You're so surprised when you understand... that's all! You haven't missed anything or waiting for something more. This math is your game. 
And there is no patch or easy fix for this. Obviously, it was a design target, to ensure transparency to the expert player. But in doing so, it stopped being a game.
The entire experience looks like a debug machine. Which is great – if only presented after a you got in love with it and you are looking deep inside the game mechanics, trying to understand why you’re losing to the Egyptians and to improve your score. But when presenting everything upfront – it lacks mirage. It lacks seduction. It lacks that “one more turn” feeling.
And there is no coming back from it.

All we can hope is [b][i]the next[/i][/b] game from Mohawk to be much better. To blow our minds. Because, yes, the Civ franchise has failed to deliver for far too long. 
Their time has set. 
It’s time for a new champion. And the successor of “Old World” might be just that. 

I paid for this product and I'm not sorry. I hope my money will be put to good use.

Pros:
+ Focus on characters works well they are integrated in the mechanics of the game properly
+ The graphics dont look impressive on screenshots but in motion the models are decent and the game properly scales everything to 4K if needed, no small texts or stretched textures that I could see
+ Tribal neutrals concept is promising
+ The idea to tie the start of the in game music to research :)
+ Background music is pretty good and authentic
+ There is no direct penalty per city count morale or other wise (rubber banding for building wide)
+ Old World map is the classical TW EU map that is pretty huge and you can start from the historical location of Rome :)

Cons:
- Tribes are passive on normal - need to turn up their strength to see actual raids and provide some levle of defense to their outposts
- Barbarians dont seem to make sense when there is a more promising system: Tribes already available (if they would be aggressive). There is an option in Advanced setup that switches out barbarians to tribes - highly recommended. The largest authentic map is called Old World - here tribes populate the regions around Rome properly with the above options even if under suboptimal names in some cases
- Character portrait repetition (noticed 3 perfectly identical portraits with Rome up till turn 100)
- Performance issues: reactions to buttons (Resume, Save Game, End Turn) has a noticeable pause before anything seemingly happens - maybe it is already processing in the background and only the UI is slow to react but it increases with the overall turn count so is likely driven b objects on the map in some way
- Bireme needs a remodeling as it didnt seem to work out (though other models are OK)
- Minimap zoom I couldnt find yet so it could not be used once a good portion of the map has been revealed

Overall I like the concept (narrow scope to one era), the particular era, and the graphics (with the exception of the Bireme) but I feel the game needs a little more time in the oven to fill in the character model roster (or optimise the random generator to not reselect past models from the same game) and both tribes and performance needs work so that there is an early game challenge and the late game doesnt fall victim of perf issues",1653502549,1653502549,True,2,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

I have read several comments on these forums complaining about limited orders as though they are something ""unrealistic"" .

Complaints over the distances travelled ignore the timescale of the game where one turn is a year. Eminently reasonable. These complaints often come from die hard Civ fans who see no problem in that game where tanks fight barbarian villages.

Player choice is front and centre of the game design, over 3000 unique story events constantly put dilemmas in front of the player and the developing characters of your Court, Religious community and foreign rivals mean you face a constantly moving target.

At first I was kinda lost with the salad of trying to combine ck game families with civ
its like a snowball
starts slow gets bigger with time and then you enter a twister of action especially if engaged in war
the AI shocked me, it makes sure it gives you a hard time, it focuses down weak areas in the army.
and then comes the random events that occur during battles which are interesting.

some events felt repetitive as the came often in certain conditions.
had one event title appear as incomplete code but that happened just once 
had no crashes or performance issues

if your a civ fan or a ck fan, give this a chance, just keep in mind dont judge it by its first 25 turns
wait till you hit the first 100 turn and see for yourself.

is there room for improvement ? hell yeah this game has beast potential
but it is a full experience as is.
the order mechanic is a twist too, where you have an amount of orders to spend your actions, the higher orders you have the more you can do, and vice versa. so when at war should i build / attack / or retreat to rebuild... if your low on orders you cant do all in the same turn.

hope you do enjoy it as i did

Old World returns to the Old School approach to 4X design: complex, inter-connected systems that interact in meaningful ways to create gameplay that is deep, rewarding and immersive.  Unlike the recent Civ games where core systems seem largely disparate in how they function (eg Culture/tourism being completely disconnected from the loyalty system), here each system naturally feeds into other systems in a way that makes sense and makes your civilization feel like a civilization instead of just a collection of boardgame-esque tokens.

Now, there is one major criticism I have with the game which I've had ever since playing the beta years ago, and that is with performance.  While it has improved, there is a huge amount of optimization still needed to make the game less frustrating to play going into the mid/late game, especially on larger maps.  It's something that recurringly has me shelving the game in hopes it's sorted the next time I pick it up again, and every time I'm disappointed to see there are still huge problems.  

For example, the UI becomes a laggy mess, especially the worker's build options, once reaching the mid-to-late game.  Hovering over a potential improvement renders yield values for all tiles in the area which, while incredibly useful from a gameplay perspective, remains highly unoptimized and chomps on the framerate each time the mouse flies over one of the improvement buttons (which happens a lot, especially when there's a long list you need to scroll through with the mouse wheel).  Beyond that, frame rate is just generally bad unless the camera is zoomed in to an impractical degree.  I have a Ryzen 3900X and 3070gtx but have to put up with 15-20fps for most of the game, which is just no good at all.

The game itself is fantastic which makes this issue all the more frustrating.

game is too complicated for its own good.  Way too many ""resources"" to deal with and the ones that do exist don't feel fun to collect.
CPU cheats... like a LOT.  and blatantly cheats.  Like I'm okay with CPU cheating to make it harder but this is truly next level BS.  For example, computer spawns multiple units out of barb camps or enemy cities on the same turn right before you go to capture.  Another example, computer built a bireme in a lake that I owned that had no connecting waterways to anywhere else, just a stranded lake...with an enemy bireme that had no enemy cities even remotely near it.  Indicates the CPU doesn't ""build"" units, it just gets free unit spawns.  
AI is stupid with its units.
Large scale combat is nearly impossible since movement of enemy units is often far outside your vision range, leading to enemy units that dissapear forever or get supported by massive armies all of a sudden.
Unit options are very basic and not varied enough.  Horseyboys, infantry, and ranged archers. But they don't even do the rock paper scissor thing so they all feel the same long term.  There are siege units but they are end game and not super useful.

Its a weird blend of civ and crusader kings (CK), and as much as i love CK, i dont like the elements of it in this game. I found myself wishing that aspect didnt exist at all. The combat and movement is fubar though. Being able to move your units across continents in one turn is just dumb, and similarly broken as being used by the AI. Basically, I dont like the order system which controls movement and actions, as you can spend your orders on movement to move your army across mountains, hills, forests and rivers in 1 year (1 turn) and attack on that same turn

Research being based on a card game seemed interesting at first but I found myself wishing for the old school approach of just climbing the tech tree

I've gone through the tutorials (I like that they let you play the game and don't limit you to just following a series of instructions), and started a regular game. Yes, it's similar to Civilization with aspects of Crusader Kings 3 (your leader is not immortal; people grow up, grow old, die, and pass their kingdom on to their children, and not always the child you'd want them to pass it on to (because your preferred heir died already)). 

The interface is much better than CK3; all the functionality is readily available, and help/explanations are everywhere.

I like the new mechanisms of ""Legitimacy"" and ""Orders"" (you can't just move everyone all the time). Opinions are a two-edged sword most of the time (just like life--you can't make one group happy without angering another). Likewise dealing with your nation's various families is an interesting balancing act. I wish there were more mechanisms than just ""exert influence"" and ""give luxuries.""

I was in contact with the developer, and he explained me that there is a way to find the information I thought lacking. As for the issue with unbalanced combat, there is a way to find out if you have enough army or not. You can hover the enemy leader, and look for info called (Power:) Which tells you how you compare to their army, as well as (Knowledge:) which does the same but for tech. As for my problem with the information, it was there just hard to see. The developer will contact the art team to see if they can highlight it better. 

With these new developments, I have to say I recommend people try it. Its great fun, and I had a lot of fun with it. I am sure now after I learned this, the fun will only continue. 

Original review: 

I feel a bit bad to give it a thumbs down review, since I had a lot of fun with this game. However the combat is abysmal. I feel like it is truly unbalanced. Perhaps I misunderstand some mechanics, or simply its not explained well enough. I play on the second easiest difficulty, and have been ass-whopped three games in a row now leading to a rage quit. Every time I am seemingly leading and have insane production. Still the computer out damages me with the same units, and can pump them out non-stop once I attack. Also it happens a lot where I attack the units and simply they wont die even though the whole bar is red, indicating they will die. Last game I had an insane amount of units, tech lead and at least 4 more cities than my opponent. Still lost. 

Other than combat, I enjoy the game. But please fix it, since the uncertainty and bad information makes it unenjoyable.",1653324788,1653398139,True,2,0,0.507467746734619141,0,True,False,False

I feel a bit mean gives this a thumbs but ultimately I felt this was a brave attempt that ultimately fell short of the mark. I admire the developer for trying to do something different. And on paper mixing Crusader Kings & Civilisation should be a willing combo. However, both aspects are diluted and not as good as originals. The CK element lack depth and the novelty of this system soon fades away as main characters die one after another and you realise there don`t do very much anyway- other than a few stat boosts and annoying random game events. There were many things I would have liked to do but couldn`t due to not having researched the correct tech or not having a high enough relationship with someone. I didn`t experience any of the immersion or attachment that other reviewers seem to have experienced. I would recommend changing game settings to allow longer lifespan though. 

Playing peacefully, the game can be quite boring. You can only build on very limited number of city sites which are quickly swallowed up by AI. Population grows slowly and city development feels messy and haphazard. Your opponents always seem to have a large number of combat units that should not be sustainable with thier resources levels. Which makes the war option difficult. Worse still is the combat system which does not acknowledge defence. Units move great distances to attack and the defender can inflict any damage until its their turn to counterattack. Surely there should be a penalty for moving cross a mountain range and river in same turn and then attacking Archer unit in a fort on a hill??

The orders system and the fact you have a limited number of them has been praised by many. I thought it was an interesting idea, but it did not make for a better gaming experience than normal Civ. There was no drama from chossing one action over another. Just annoyance- particulary when the AI swarms your land with multiple units and you can`t attack with all your units. I also didn`t like the limited period of history . Just as things start to get interesting you reach the end of the history never to see gunpowder or aircraft. Some people will see that as a good thing but for me it cut short the gaming experience. Being able to attack middle ages units with modern day units was always a highlight for me in these type of games.",1653391549,1653391549,False,8,0,0.532797694206237793,2,True,False,False

And here it is, what I asked for. This game really meets both of those above and delivers. In a preferred time period even. Gameplay is a bit different and has some tweeks (the family and specialists are big add-on).

1- Do I like 4X?
2- Do I like politics and character development?
3- Do I accept a single age in time (rather than progression to information age..) ?

But there is also a lot to learn, so expect at least a few matches to get the hang of things. Pro tip: always tutor your heir! Also, this game came out on the EGS almost a year ago, and the developers have been updating it basically every week since day one. It's well-balanced, and keeps getting better.

Most negative reviews seem to be people thinking Old World will play like Civ (or CK), and getting frustrated when things don't work as they're expecting. It's a different game, and it requires different expectations, approaches and strategies. If you go in to this game expecting to already know it, you will be disappointed. But it's really worth playing, so I recommend going in with an open mind, playing a few games, and then getting totally sucked in.

My main criticism is the performance. It could definitely use some optimization. Everything is great early game, but the game seems to struggle in proportion to the number of units and/or improvements on the map. At the start of a match, I can get >60fps at 1440p high settings; by the end, it's a struggle to get 30fps at 1080p low. Hopefully this is something that will get fixed.

But seriously, buy this game. It may be the best game of its genre ever made (definitely my favorite).",1653321884,1653321884,True,9,0,0.598412215709686279,0,True,False,False

My biggest criticism is the graphics - they're fine but a bit dull.  I'd love a bit of visually interesting 3D like in Humankind.

Old World introduces an ""orders"" system, where you generate a certain number of orders each turn and everything you do (appointing somebody to a role, building a farm, attacking a unit, etc) costs a number of actions.  This limits what you can do and makes everything a proper decision (also also really help balance tall vs wide, since going wide means your orders get spread thinner).  Every game in this genre would be improved by adding such a system.

I also enjoy the combat, which I usually don't in games like these.  It's a bit silly in a way - units have special characteristics, like spears and ballistae penetrate (do a bit of damage to the unit behind the one you attacked) while axes do big slashes and hurt units to either side of the target, and so on.  Silly, at the unit scale (rather than the individual scale), but definitely fun!

The last big thing that differentiates this game is the RPG element - all the little decisions you make that shape how you and the people around you develop.  It's not as deep or impactful as Crusader Kings but it's fun, interesting, and really makes you feel like you're making decisions in the world.

Oh, actually there is one other big things - the scale of the game.  It's just the ancient era and is limited to 200 turns.  There are a few ways to win and it can be really tense towards the end.  I don't know how I feel about the limited time scale.  On the one hand I like seeing how my civ develops through the ages in other games, but on the other hand the start of those games is always my favourite part...

To summarise, this is my favourite civ-like game.  I've already bought it for two other people as gifts!

The only way to properly win is to never, ever engage in warfare with another nation. Or at the very least, wait until they've just finished fighting another nation and wiped out most of their military forces first. Because you'll find yourself leading an army of 5-10 units in a siege of a city.. And all of a sudden 6 enemy troops come from half way across the map, annihilate 3 of your troops, mostly get killed off in the next round, just for another 6 enemy troops to suddenly appear again and murder the rest of your army.

With only having 200 years to play in I understand needing to have high mobility for troops... But it's ridiculous just how quickly you can move massive troop forces and how the AI just seems to always have more available.

The family concept and events sounded fun at first. Seemed like a good way to engage. But most of your rulers will be in their 40's when they take over and will die in their 60's. By the time I got halfway through my first game I stopped caring about the characters except for what benefits they gave. There's no proper depth to them and a lot of times you'll be buggered by RNG anyways. Got a super promising prince set up to take over leadership? Oh no! He got into a fight at school and now he's wounded. And now he's dead. That's okay, you had a daughter second in line! But her tutor is a bit strange.. And now she's a lunatic. That's okay though, a neighboring nation that you've been just barely avoiding war with has decided they want to marry a son to her anyways. Your two prospects? Shitty and shitty. Rejecting them though? Insults the nation and incites them to war.

The whole ambitions for victory thing also just strikes me as weird and kinda shallow. Why would the other nations care that your dynasty managed to reach some milestone of ambitions? Your culture isn't that amazing. You aren't that technologically advanced. And you sure as hell didn't defeat them in combat and conquer them. But dang. You did happen to make five improvements a total of 10 times!

As I said though, the game does show promise. I like the diversity of the nations. There's a lot of map types. The graphics aren't bad. The improvement system is nicely done. The city development needs a lot more to it I feel, more in line with how you develop cities in civ, but it's got bones to develop on.

+Orders Mechanic (You now must weigh and prioritize your decisions)

+Unrivaled Soundtrack (includes tracks from Christopher Tin and Chad Lawson!)
+True Empire Builder and Story Creator (You really get a sense of the glory days of 4X where you are building an empire and creating your own personal stories)

[u]CONS[/u]
If I had to list one, it would be that the game is such a 4X disrupter that some may feel at odds with the new mechanics.  

You have to ""unlearn"" the gameplay, approach, and expectations that Civilization has conditioned us all to have towards 4X games.  To many people, including me, this is actually a PRO not a CON.

Edit:  One improvement to the game would be that addition of a Strategic Map, one that shows the ""Big Picture"" view of Unit and City Locations.

For a 4X game you are simply the victim of too much RNG. Every turn there are multiple events to respond to that range from ""What minor improvement would you like this character to have?"" to ""Shits fucked and you're fucked and there is nothing you can do about it, all you get to do is choose if you how you get fucked"".

There is a tech tree, but you are given just a small selection of techs to pick each time. So if you are trying to get a tech you really need to pull your strategy together or overcome a particular challenge, you can get fucked yet again as you are given a list of useless shit and just have to suffer while you research poetry or some shit while you get wrecked by cavalry and can't research spears.

The thing that finally tipped me over the edge and made me rage quit was the AI cheating. The AI is clearly coded to purposefully screw with you. All the AI will, in a very coordinated manner, constantly and aggressively forward settle you. They are not written to simulate a series of opponents and rivals to defeat, pacify, avoid or ally with. Instead it is just everyone trying the very best to keep you down. And even if you do somehow manage to stay on their good side (Which is really hard due to all the random events as many give you a choice between making the AI hate you even more, or causing massive turmoil within your own empire so you're getting hurt and set back all the time. Or choosing which AI will hate you more. Seriously, just because I get a choice in how I get fucked doesn't mean it's a fun decision to make when I have to do it every turn) some random event will pop up and make you go to war with them whether you like it or not. 

Speaking of war, the AI absolutely cheats its tits off and will spawn units in unviewed tiles and zerg rush you with them. And it's not even subtle about it, I am talking about a dozen or so units coming pouring out of a tiny corner of their empire. The AI will struggle to defeat a small barbarian camp with 2 units, but the instant they go to war with you a mongol horde comes tearing across the world to fuck your shit up. I get it, you need to give the AI a little help to keep them competitive in 4X games due to their limitation. But is it really so much to ask that it not be blatantly in your face?

The devs had a great idea going at first, I did enjoy my first hours of this game as I explored the mechanics. But they clearly didn't know when to stop and cranked all their new ideas up to 11, so the *constant* random events you get flooded with every turn just burn you out.

The combat feels very biased towards a defender - I could easily ward off a majority of attacks from stronger units by just whittling them down with 2-3 entry-level infantry militia and a slightly stronger unit, but the moment I go on the offense the AI just whips out 4-5 hidden units that require me to dedicate multiple turns to produce, but they seemingly churn them out with no consequences to their empire's technology or infrastructure. I was never into Civ's combat and usually never pursued a military victory in the games I'd play, but when combat is much more of a necessity here, it just feels odd almost always being at the disadvantage of who the game marks as your ""rival.""

I just had the constant feeling that the AI was ""smart"" in less of an ""actually adapting to the current game's situations and environments"" kind of way, and more of a strategy that is intended to explicitly target the player instead of emulating someone who is playing the game normally. None of them seemed very efficient at attacking each other like when I allied with a Scythian tribe that had 12 settlements surrounding my enemy Persia, then did absolutely nothing when I coerced them into going to war with Persia. However, a few turns later, the Scythians now randomly decided to declare war on me and sent all their units towards my cities despite having none of that vigor when fighting Persia with many of their settlements being even closer to Persia's cities than mine.

As mentioned in the first paragraph, the AI also had a tendency to sit on the designated urban foundation tiles that are required to create new cities almost immediately when the game started - when I was playing, I'd have to sacrifice using my scouts to explore the map and instead camp them on these tiles to prevent the AI from settling first, or have my damaged warrior that just cleared out a barbarian camp sit on the newly-liberated urban tiles instead of going back to friendly territory to heal. This would cause the issue of where the AI and my units were locked into a stalemate of sleeping on the same set of urban tiles to prevent the other from forming a city there, which is a bigger issue for you than the AI most of the time.

I'm pretty disappointed since the concept is a fresh one to Civ-likes, but the overall AI and portions of the game which turn into absolutely nothing to do between turns really bogs down the whole experience. It reminds me of Humankind where they went all in on the primary ""unique"" gimmick of the game that they let a lot of the secondary features go undercooked.

Don´t get me wrong, this is not a bad game or a bad concept. It is more a mixed bag of yays and nays...

It is actually quite refreshing to see Civ with new concepts, of course you need to like them. For example: random research tree looks like a nice idea, but to be honest it feels...like either you are in luck drawing good cards or your have to live with the penality of having bad choices only. Planing to develop in certain style which is needed for your strategy is not possible. Of course this looks at frist swesome, because adopting to this uncertain changes is nice, but it gets really quick annoying.

Also the idea of having a dynasty (more rudimentary as in CK or so) and those families (like Imperator) is awesome, but it feels shallow and does not fit well or only is another thing...

Looking at the more...not so awesome concepts. I don´t understand why someone likes the fixed city positions. Yes it fixes issues, but is also reducing the options. Of course this is a thing of liking or not liking, but I find it awesome if you can optimise thing. And planing where you place cities is something to achieve advantages is somethign I like.

Having only a certain amount of orders to move units and take decisions is limiting, but feels actually really well. It makes planing valuable.

Bad things: performance is an issue. Of course, lategame is always much to calculate, but Old World seems to use even more computing power. Not sure why, looks like it can use some optimisation. But, it is a game that is available scince over a year. So I expect that this is already done.

And here lies the reason for my thumbs down (no, not the performance issue). This game is available since over a year. It is old wine. It should be good, things should have worked out. But to be honest this game need polishing. It feels like okayish developed and released, which would be more then you can see about a lot of games today, but now you need ti finish it. To bad that this is not a game just released...

There's UI improvements here I haven't seen in other AAA games like the colorblindness filters and other accessibility features- and so far all of the text, tooltips, prompts, menus, etc, has been legible (looking at you, Civ6 tiny font demons)! Game customization options seem a little more restrictive than Civ6 but I haven't found that an obstacle yet.

But let's talk about the real OP here: the Undo feature. 

How many times in Civ6 have I accidentally ordered the wrong unit halfway across the world bc I clicked the wrong tile or something? No more. If I accidentally send my worker into a battle zone instead of my fresh troops I can just undo it! Amazing.

Couple of hiccupy issues so far like tooltips blocking command buttons and text strings reading strangely on a few ""event"" dialogues but nothing crazy.

Unlike Civ 5 and, especially, Civ 6, I don't find any of the nations boring to play or try out. They are each similar enough but also different enough to make all of them enjoyable. This is a good thing, considering there's only 8, but quality IS better than quantity.

There's also multiple scenarios you can do, and it looks like you need to beat the first in a group to do the next. I haven't tried that out yet but excited to one day.

Though after the purchase, I have to admit that this game has a brilliant reviews at first place, but after more hour's experience, there are too many non-sense, fix-needed and tasteless features in this game. Maybe developer still can save this game by providing more DLCs or expansions. But after 3 games I played, I don't expect to play another one.
Basically. it's very featured game at my first 3.5 hours experience. But after that, it's only routines and routines in this game and more bugs show up when the game comes to late period.

[h1]1.military unit moves like non-sense[/h1]
This game has Orders rates and Training rates features. they make AIs and Player can use the rate to trade the ability of the unit movement, which is already too over-powered. This feature over-expanded the area a land or an ocean unit is able to move, and lead to a fatal disadvantage for a human player take wars with AIs. The military units of AI can even use this feature to fulfill the attacking plan in the island area, by only buying the movement with Orders rates and Training rates (or maybe they had never to buy them since this kind of game always let AI cheat to debuff player), to move there huge army (about 10 land or ocean units) within one turn, from their nearest city to beach landing my country and kill all my coastal defenses then surrounding my capital. This feature make ZOC in this game like a joke. I cannot image how unbelievable when playing Multiplayer.
It's just my opinion: Since you had already defined the movement ability of an unit ingame ""move until fatigued"", what's the reason why you didn't make a debuff to an unit who over-moved? i.g. every point of the fatigue will cause military unit's attack and defense debuff for 5%. And when AI or player use ""Force March"", there will be an additional 10% debuff for the unit. So that it should curb the intention of the ancient Over-horizon beach landing and blitzkrieg like a motorized unit. I didn't have a chance to enjoy such kind of speed even in HOI4.

[h2]2.useless city defensive improvement[/h2]
In Civ series, it's ultimostly inportant for militry defense by building and upgrading the wall. In Civ6, they even add military district to allow players having 2 spot to cover each other and defend their land. It make the game like real world which defend side in the war has  huge advantage then attack side. And in Humankind, the whole city and its area will be protected by the wall, the enemy units will be physically blocked outside the wall. While the defend side stay smart and take the high ground, basically there's no way for an attacker to conquer a city without any casualties. However in Old World, I cannot figure out what is the difference when I upgrade the wall except make a city live longer for 1 turn. Besides the city will not auto-defending, it seems no different for a melee unit inside the wall and take any advantage when facing the enemy army which has urban attack bonus. And outside the wall, my military units are like naked and trying to block the blitzkrieg from enemy. Even Barrack, Stronghold or Fortess cannot make them live longer when AIs have greater artillery fire and high-speed surrounding strategy. I cannot understand: Since you had already distinguished the urban and non-urban area, why don't you add more actual benefit for the city defense improvement upgrade ingame?

[h3]3.All dead, or over blossom[/h3]
I played as realistic age mode because I agree like a person live in ancient should be dead about 30 years. But due to the random of the event about hiring courtiers, give a birth and death, it make the game hard to control. I played rome, I had more than 5 childred, lot of relatives and 10 or more courtier in early period. In that time I cannot choose where I can put then so I even let them unemployed until they died. But when it comes to mid-period, because of consistantly assassin event, lot of near-age brothers and sisters, and lackage of new courtier event, my country only have me and my wife. But in late game, there are keeping giving birth childred and lot of foreign courtier join my country again. I'm not sure what will happen if the boold of my dynasty vanished. But I hope developer can balance this system.

[h1]4.Over-powered artillery unit, useless ranged unit[/h1]
In late game, even when I upgrade my ranged unit to longbowmen, there are only 11 point damage when we fully promoted with combat. Also, the longbowmen have only 3 teils of attack range, which impacted them when player try to deploy them. In the other side, Mangonel share almost same attack point, but they have AOE damages and 3-5 teils of attack range. That's means deploy Mangonel is way more beneficial than deploy longbowmen. In the late game, I only use Swordmen and Spearmen for block enemy and use great numbers of Mangonel to attack enemy like a self-propelled artillery. I think artillery unit should have debuff when attack land units, or ranged units will be no use in late game.

[h2]5.Unfulfillable Ambition[/h2]
Ambition in this game is like diplomatic VP in Civ series, amd its the safest way for play to win a game by fulfill 10 times of ambition. But I cannot agree with the ambition changes with technologies when I am doing it, especially when it turns out that I cannot fulfill it anymore. When I played Rome, I had a ambition which is ""Control 20 military units, 5 of them are Chariot"", It's not a problem for me and I start to build Chariot. However when I finish Land Consolidation tech, the ambition changed to """"Control 20 military units, 5 of them are Cataphract"". Cataphract should be late period unit of mounteds. It's not possible for me to fulfill the ambition with 30 turns when I am only in mid-period of the game. So I chose to lose 5 Legitimacy. It's not a big deal for the legitimacy, but it make me very angry about unfulfillable ambition.

[h1]6.Events like routines[/h1]
Troughout the game, I cannot find out any similarity of the event diversity like CK series. I feel cool when first 50 turns about events, but when it comes to 200 turns. Same content of the events, which only changes names make me bored. Though there still have different decision when player has or don't have the abilities or characters. But it didn't change the fact that there is no meaningful event chain, but only unrelated, unconnected event popped up.

[h2]7.unclear and fickle building advises[/h2]
When player controls workers, system will advise player to build what building on the teil is the most beneficial. However, when the late game, the system fail to determine which building is the most beneficial for a teil. i.g. I was building a barrack on the edge of a island because system had told me to do it, and I did it. But when it finished, the system advised me to dismantle the Barrack and build Warm Bath. Okay fine, I just need to reduce some discontent. But when Warm Bath was finished, the system advise me again to dismantle the Warm Bath again and build University. If the system doesn't know what to do, how can a player learn what to do in the game?

[h3]8.Let me promote it, please![/h3]
I'm not sure if it's because there is too many units in late game or not. There is a bug that when player click ""next unit"" to choose military unit, player cannot successfully promote their unit. If the unit is able to promote because they gain enough experience, unless player choose ""pass"" or move the unit until they fatigued to end the turn, or we cannot end the turn by click the button in down-left to next year. It will cause huge inconvenience when we have a war with other countries.",1653165168,1653192585,False,8,0,0.444792568683624268,0,True,False,False

The event system, combined with the characters and dynasties, as well as the smaller time and geography scale, make for a layer of story telling that Civ doesn't have. The orders system solves the tedious and snowballing end game 4X often have, and also make wars much more tactical. The card deck for technologies make you think every time you pick a tech, instead of being on rails after a few games.

It's a blast to play.

The game itself is awesome and I would enjoy it if it didn't have terrible performance issues. And it's not a computer issue - I had about 2 hours of gameplay in tutorial 4 when everything worked as it should and there wasn't a noticeable lag, so clearly, it can run well on my PC - only it doesn't.

Civilization meets Crusader Kings lite in the classical era. I have countless hours on Civ 4, and Soren Johnson's (director of that game) influence is very noticeable. 

In terms of the difficulty curve of this game, I would say it's a bit harder to learn than Civ IV/V, but way easier than CK2. They have also added a new tutorial which does a good job of teaching you the basics. 

Pros: 
+ Beautiful 2D artwork, decent 3D graphics. 
+ Excellent soundtrack that really immerses you in the era.
+ Orders system leads to strategic decisions.
+ I have had better performance on Steam compared to when I played the game earlier on Epic. 
+ Building a family dynasty is interesting and not as punishing as Crusader Kings. The RPG elements fit in surprisingly well to the civ like gameplay. 
+ Multiple victory paths. 
++++ AI Is not braindead and diplomacy is actually useful (huge issue in modern 4X games). 

Cons
- The AI is competent and has a lot of advantages on higher difficulty levels, which can lead to frustration with early expansion and warfare. 
- The tech tree is not super interesting, and the late game techs and units do not feel powerful enough. This is probably to avoid snowballing, but yeah. 
- I wish the nations had some more unique buildings and/or mechanics. They do have differences, like unique units and bonuses, but it would be nice to explore this a bit more. 
- The events can get a bit repetitive once you play enough times. 
- Late game becomes a slog, but this is ultimately what happens in most 4X games, it just seems to be the nature of the genre. 

Overall if you are like me, a huge 4X game fan, then I highly recommend Old World. I feel like the genre has gotten stale, but Old World takes the tried and true foundations of 4X games and successfully adds newer mechanics that feel fresh and interesting. I hope more games learn from it!

[b] Things Old World does right [/b]

[b] Old world does sprawling cities very well. [/b] Building up the cities in old world really feels engaging and it feels like you are actually [b] expanding [/b] them. In civ it always felt to me like districts were too separate from the city. The feeling in old world is totally different. 

[b] The orders mechanic  [/b] The orders system is just genius in my opinion. You can only move troops/ build improvements if you have enough orders. You can spend multiple orders on a single unit to move them multiple times per turn, or spend orders on many different things throughout your nation. This makes the game much more flexible than CIV in my opinion. 

[b] The character system  [/b]
Characters in old world marry, give birth, die etc. As your children grow older you can tutor them and really transform them into the person you want to rule your kingdom. Different characters have different traits and opinions of people, they can really change how you play your nation. 

[b] The production system  [/b]
In old world there isn't just one singular production value. There are 3, one for producing civilian units, one for producing military and one for producing specific buildings. I really love this mechanic tbh. Along with the families mechanic this works very well. 

[b] Tribes [/b] Unlike in civ which has city states, old world has tribes. Tribes don't just consist of one location on the map, they have multiple camps/outposts throughout the map. You can marry into the tribes, have peace/truce with them, get them to attack other players, go to war with them. It all works very well. 

[b] Things Old World doesn't get quite right [/b]

[b] City Sites [/b] In old world you can't just build cities anywhere you want, you need to build them on specific city sites located throughout the map. Now, I understand why this was done the way it has. It's better for balance etc. I get all that but I still think I would prefer if I could settle anywhere. Having an option to disable the city sites would be great, although I don't know if that would be possible. 


[b] One suggestion I have [/b]

Lots of people compare Old World to Civilization and Crusader Kings. Okay, yes, it looks like those games. And yes, it has some similar gameplay features. But if you try to play Old World like you play Civ or CK, you'll lose - because Old World isn't either of those games. Old World is Old World. It is a fresh mix of new ideas and old ideas, all brilliantly woven together into a tasty new game.

The best contrast is with Humankind. The Humankind devs made huge claims, and created a visually stunning game - with clunky, unbalanced, unfun gameplay. Humankind was clearly rushed, and released far too soon. 

Old World is polished to a diamond-like sparkle. Soren Johnson and the Mohawk team held this game in early access for years, balancing and polishing and optimizing - and all that love totally paid off. Old World is, right now, with no DLC or patching, the one of the most beautifully designed strategy games that I've ever played. Every choice matters, every choice is interesting, and there are always many routes to victory. Replayability out the wazoo.

The only thing missing is scope. There are no trains, planes, or nukes. It is just the 'old world' of classic western-ish civilization, but it is that old world done right - and I'll take quality over quantity any day.

Old World is a great new game. Far ahead of Civ 6 or Humankind. Props to Soren Johnson and Mohawk! You nailed this!

For me the orders system, the events, the way culture is necessary for certain buildings, the need to train troops and the separate resources for buildings and units, the family system and the way it interacts with diplomacy and tribes (kinda city states from civ) as well as and other new ideas and mechanics are a breath of fresh air in the genre, but I imagine a lot of people will not like them which will lead to mixed reviews. 

I personally find the limitations on city placement and orders system to be limiting in an effective way so far. They add a whole another layer of strategy and thinking to the game. 

I disagree with comparing this to CK2 or 3. If you go in thinking its like those games you will be disapointed. Likewise if you go in thinking this is a 'civ killer', you will also be disapointed. Its not trying to be either of those things anyway.
A closer comparison imo is the older Koei games like ROTK 11. The way there is a character system, the separate game mode with historical missions, and the heavy focus on combat all remind me of that game. 

My only real issue is the learning curve is quite high despite a decent in game wiki and tutorials.

I played CIV 1-3, CIV 6, Alpha Centauri, Beyond Earth, and Total War, and all of them had that ""just one more turn"" fun factor. This game does not.  Those other games also had that ""easy to learn, harder to master"" appeal.  This game does not.

Old World is not as complicated as the comparable Paradox games, but it is complicated enough to make a new player feel overwhelmed in the beginning, even after going through the tutorials. I put in over 12 hours, so it's too late for a refund, and I just kept hoping to find the fun in it.

I really hate the 'Orders' movement system.  Just let me move each of my units x number of spaces!  With 'Next Unit' turned on the game still goes to units even when there are no orders/moves left, and I can't do anything with them.

I also hate that I can't settle anywhere I want - only on designated tiles.  The 'Family' system is confusing, and I have no idea why families hate me even though I put them in charge of cities.  The 'Heir' system is OK, but Oriental Empires did that and combat better.

The good:
Graphics look and run great even on old RX470, atmosphere is great, the game world feels real enough for you to get immersed, effects are great, especially wood chopping effects and musket clouds and bullet trails, it's the little things that matter
Action combat feels good, weapons are cool and unique, while some complain there isn't enough weapons, they fail to consider each weapon is essentially a character class, there's just enough weapons to not feel overwhelming and there's more coming
No pay to win (for now) not even exp boosts

Now that we're done with the less important eye candy, let's get into the real gameplay, aka
The bad
Graphical design masks infinitely copypasted content, playing this game, you will get used to the feeling of Deja vu, ""wait, have I seen this exact rock formation and attached scaffolding before just without snow?"" ""I've been in this city before"" ""I've fought this exact enemy with the exact moves and scripted pattern before, just it wasn't a Lion but a wolf""

Combat, especially pvp, is just broken on different levels, gear isn't doing what it tells you it should do, same for gear perks, abilities and ability perks are typically broken, sometimes near useless, sometimes absolutely overpowered, large part of the game is client authoritative which itself causes massive issues, we'll get back to that later

Crafting, when it works, is just bad, materials require massive amounts of lower tier materials to refine in order to be used (which in turn require exponentially more materials of it's respective lower tier), many materials necessary to craft certain items do not exist in the game, some crafting professions can't craft their respective endgame items

Economy is in the gutter, firstly, the game was dealing with deflation, which is really really bad for an mmo, to the point where the fee for repairing gear is percieved to be too expensive to be worth it, unless the gear is BiS or crafted endgame piece, where you don't really have a choice, furthermore the economy was infused with massive amounts of duped items and gold and despite the developers claiming they removed 80% of it by banning offenders (which is nonsense and most likely a PR lie, not the first one either), dupes are still working, whats more, these dupes are all based on the same mechanics that were ""fixed"" multiple times already, according to the devs at least

The dev team is oblivious to basic game mechanics and industry practices, for instance making the massively multiplayer pvp game client authoritative (which they lied about in a PR devblog once it became public knowledge), making html based chat without doing anything at all to prevent players to run commands in chat, resulting in infinite amounts of gold and exp summoned from thin air, targeted or public game crash attacks, screen obfuscation and posting of sausage images in chat

Let me repeat that, they made an entire blogpost LYING about the game not being client authoritative after it was proved beyond doubt that integral parts (player health, damage immunity, player gold, inventory and quest rewards) are in fact client authoritative, which is what it means for a game to be defined as such, and to add insult to injury, the blogpost was written by someone who doesn't even understand how the game itself works.

Last but most important, character names are censored in completely stupid way where you can't even use ""beer"" in a name, despite beer and other alcohol references being present in the game both in name and appearance

It features a lot of new systems and ideas that I haven't seen before in other 4X games, and I'm excited to see how they pan out in a full playthrough.

Like many 4X games, the amount of information on-screen can at first be overwhelming, but the tutorials do an excellent job of gradually exposing you to all of the systems and elements in the UI. The tutorials also don't just hold your hand and tell you exactly which buttons to push (except for the very first one), but rather let you explore the world and the UI for yourself while completing certain goals. This is all to say PLAY THE TUTORIALS; they are very well-constructed and informative. Also, they take about 4-6 hours (if you're really taking time to explore and read), so I wouldn't trust any review with less playtime than that.

As for the new systems, I LOVE the character-driven aspects of the game. Having unique characters whose personalities, strengths and weaknesses develop over time and whose needs you have to consider and work with when making important decisions is an amazing new addition to the genre. The dynasty system -- the fact that leaders actually live and die (of totally natural causes haha it wasn't me) instead of being immortal -- is also a great addition. Finally, the fact that orders are a resource and you don't necessarily get to move every unit every turn adds a new, very realistic layer of strategy. While I do like this system and want it to stay, it does tie in to my one major complaint.

The combat system. The review from Doug_Dimmadome says it all pretty well. Each unit can fly across the map and attack in the same turn, and defending units basically don't deal damage to their attacker. This means that at any moment an empire's entire army can rush to their border and wipe out your forces while taking negligible damage. I think the first problem stems from the fact that even when a unit is out of moves you can ""force march"" at the cost of some resources to force them to move again as many times as you want. The second problem I think is just a poor design choice, but in a game that's trying a whole host of new ideas -- most of which are fantastic -- it's understandable if some of them don't pan out. That being said, I do hope the combat system gets a major overhaul to reflect the combat we've seen in previous 4X games.

Overall, I think it's worth the money and I have faith that the developers will rebalance the things that don't work and continue to improve the things that do.

TLDR: Yes, if you are a hardcore 4x fan (and I mean REALLY hardcore!)

- It plays almost exactly like Civ6, with a few enhancements and added features like more resources, fixed city sites, slightly different combat, etc.

- Layered on top of that are Crusader King elements; family succession, politics, marrying your enemies etc. Although this is a very simplified version of it, it does add some interesting complexity to the game

- However, fundamentally, the game inherits all the flaws of the great 4x games of the past; slow gameplay in the late game and tedious management. Because its a combination of Civ and CK, the problems are further compounded. 

- To the developer's credit, they tried to streamline late game as much as they could, but the truth is, the complex nature of 4x games means added layers equal added tedium.

- Hardcore fans with time to spare would love this though; it will definitely take the hours away from you!",1653050729,1653050829,True,1,0,0.478887468576431274,0,True,False,False

597180,115726013,76561198030467427,0,53,9957,0,349,1700894827,"I've been playing this game on Epic since it was released in EA so have a few hundred hours in the game before it came to Steam. But I took some time to play through 50-60 turns of a game on Steam to make sure it's still as good as it was.

This game is one of the best 4X games I've ever played. Folks inevitably are going to draw comparisons with both Civ and CK because this game has many similarities with both but is something quite different. The character interactions are pretty deep and have a great deal of influence on each game and how it plays out but it's not a character system like CK - just that it is similar in scope. Likewise, the game only covers 200 years in the ancient era so it's not like Civ where you guide your civ through from the dawn of civilization to our present day. It's better than both those games.

The Orders system is going to freak some folks out completely, both in a good and a bad way. You cannot do everything you want in a single turn so you will have to decide what you want to accomplish each turn and forget about the rest unttil the orders are free to allow it. This system does allow you to move your units a great distance in a single turn but be warned that the AI can do so too. I've seen at least one person who hates that the AI can pull armies out of the fog of war and feel that there's no control. There is - a lot but you have to become familiar with the new system before you can manage it.

Exploration in this game is excellent and you shouldn't overlook it because it really helps you with your early game economy. When you firts reveal a resource tile from the FoW, you receive a small quantity of that resource. You can send a scout to the resource hex and 'harvest' a quantity and several turns later you can harvest it again. The Persians in particular get a boost to their early game economy because they get 50% more from harvesting. It's a simple mechanic but you'll soon find yourself assigning scouts to harvesting particularly rich areas of the map. Your scouts will also discover landmarks which will increase your ruler's legitimacy a little but it all adds up and your legitimacy affects the number of orders your ruler generates each turn.

you can also choose to complete certain 'ambitions' in the game for your character which, when completed award you more legitimacy. You can also get legitimacy from building pastures (horse and elephant tiles) as well as building tile improvements like garrisons, strongholds and citadels. And certain families will award you some per turn too.

There are so many little but important features in this game like that - your Civ's unique units are not unlocked by tech but rather from having a high culture level in that city and the appropriate improvement built there (Strongholds for tier 1 and Citadels for tier 2). You also need to have a number of active laws as well to build them and in some cases, access to the appropriate resources like elephants or horses.

You can't plonk a city down anywhere you like either - cities can only be built on special sites of which there are a limited (but good) number of on the map. there are a couple of vacant sites for you to find at the start but otherwise, you're going to have to clear them of barbarians or tribes and later, other civs. But once built, you can expand your borders in a number of different ways, most often you'll build an urban improvement near the border or a specialist on a resource tile which will exand your borders.  But there are many ways for you to grow your borders and bring resources under your control.

I could go on about how cities have three building methods, growth, training and civics which affect how quickly you can build units or improvements with them.Or how your characters have particular traits which affect how they perform in the roles you might want to assign to them. Or your four families of which you can only choose three in any one game- or the four temple types which your civ can build. Or how each family has a certain speciality which may allow you to build urban or rural specialists twice as quickly and maybe enable them to yield science or culture. There are so many little features that all mesh together so well to produce a game where each turn has many decisions for you to make.

I've played it more substantially prior to it coming to Steam, but this version is a lot more polished.  The basics are extremely familiar for 4X games of this sort, which is of course welcome.  Both my wife and I found it straightforward to get into.

For my wife, she particularly was enjoying the family/court dynasty elements of the game.  In games like Civ, she has always really liked the way that the other leaders have personality and are interactive, but had wanted more.  This gives more, and does so in a way that feels fresh and interesting.  

There's a ton of events and things that can happen, and while there is some randomness to it... it makes sense?  It feels like... the story of a nation over time.  It doesn't cross the line into feeling like you don't have control, but at the same time your nation is more than just a puppet you wiggle around on your fingers.  I think of those elements almost like a colony simulator, and from that perspective it's really tame but still quite enjoyable.  It blends really well with the 4X core.

For me, one of the things I find most enjoyable is the new currency of ""orders.""  Essentially, rather than being able to just move every unit every turn, but only move them once... you have a supply of orders that you can use to move one unit multiple times (it does get tired if you do it too much), or move a lot of units, but not quite all of them if you've spammed the map.  For really big late game situations, this is great because it keeps things moving.

But more than that, this really changes the whole flow of the game from a normal Civ-like 4X.  I can see why a few other players have found that a bit hard to adjust to, but I think most people will just adapt to it without even thinking about it.  The upside is that one unit can really make a huge amount of movement in a single turn, which can lead to surprise attacks (from you or against you), but whenever anyone does that, they're sacrificing other things they could be doing with those orders.  It's an opportunity cost.

I've never encountered a spot where the long-chain of orders felt unfair against me or when I used it, it just felt like... more freedom to customize how things happen.  It does take some adjustment if you're really really steeped in classic Civ-like 4X games, but... I mean, come on, do we really want the exact same game over and over again?  Kind of like the stacking versus no-stacking debate, there are pros and cons to both approaches, and this one is novel and interesting and creates new situations you don't see in other similar games.  I think it works really well.

The focus on just a single time period doesn't make the game feel any smaller than Civ, to me.  If anything, it makes it feel more robust in the area that it's exploring.  Civ is great, but having to rush through the entirety of human history really shouldn't be a prerequisite for games in this genre.

I think the metacritic score at 80 is criminally low for what this game does, but if you look at how indie games and strategy games are often rated, an 80 on a game like this is more like a 90-something for a AAA action game.  So I guess that's consistent at least, even if it's lower than it should be.

If you're on the fence, the tutorials are great and you can easily do enough of them in the refund window to know if it's your cup of tea.  They are slightly wordy, but just skim and move on.  By the third tutorial, it was really clear this was something special, when I was first playing it.",1653012226,1653012226,True,44,0,0.728436172008514404,3,True,False,False

This IS the game I have waited on for years.  A super deep strategy game that combines all the great parts of Civ with the really interesting parts of Crusader Kings.  Obviously not as deep as CK but enough of that story telling and building that really makes this game interesting.

You'll watch other civilizations outpace you and then intimidate you into giving up what little iron you have left. But as you hover your mouse over brilliant nested tool tips, you'll quickly learn how these systems interlock to form a brilliant and rewarding strategy game. Unlike other 4xs, you'll make an interesting or engaging decision about every round. And in time you'll laugh at other civs who have failed to adequately plan for the future, thereby consigning themselves to be footnote in the history books.

But the strategy aspect of Old World is not its crown jewel. No, that's the family system. As Dom Toretto the Wise opined in his opus work, nothing is more important than family. The rise of your civilization will ultimately be told through wonderful vignettes about your family that flow from the game play. For example, an impotent leader has no heirs, and so he adopts a wayward vagrant to be his son and heir. This results in scandal and the stress of it all leaves this newly adopted son insane. And so he grows up to become a blood thirsty tyrant who executed all who questioned him. Yet he gives birth to a thoughtful young woman who rejected her father's violence and commits herself to the study of science. Through this passion for science she is able to complete a number of ambitions and win the game.

I would be hard pressed to recall a game of Civ a few hours after I finished it, but I played Old World for dozens of hours on Epic and can recall a number of deeply human stories that will stay with me. Learning the systems of Old World can be a challenge. It's easy to learn the ""how"" of Old World, but much harder to learn the ""why"". However, this game is more than the sum of its parts and has left other 4x games feel hollow and empty.

About 3 Years ago I'd been really hyped for humankind, hoping it would shake up the genre a little, as most games of this kind play rather similar. I left the game quite early, as it felt 'shallow' somehow, especcially in its City-managment aspects, which, at least to me, quickly became boring, cause you just spam every building possible without thinking. Moreover Humankind promised a lot of complexity regarding civics, religion and battle, where it just couldn't live up to my expectations, as most of the systems were either irrelevant (religion) or they never felt like they at up to a coherent experience (AI-personalitys, Civics, Climate change).

The command-point-system really feels fresh and interesting so far, as there is no real feeling of an optimal play. Just to explain this quickly: Every turn you have a certain amount of 'action points' which you need to spent for basically everything (moving. building etc) - the clue here is: You always feel like you have to little to achive everything you plan to do within a turn. This 'restriction' leads to interesting dilemmas, making you think a lot. Should I move my army, or sent my builder to build a mine and boost my infrastructure?) This together with the light roleplay aspects which lay in building up a dinasty, add a whole new layer of complexity, making you really feel involved into a match mentally, as there is a lot to consider. In comparison to humankind however, Old World feels really organic and the different gameplay-aspects fit well together (first impression). This is why I can recommend this to anyone, who wants to find a fresh take on 4x-gaming.

Side note: People compare this to crusader kings and I get where they are coming from. I can only tell you, that I have never really gotten into paradoxes grand strategy titles, as they always felt 'dry' to me (abstract, presentationwise). This game does really feel lively however, so if you are hasitating because of the CK3 comparisons, don't worry, this feels really more civ-like. At the same time, you have to read a lot though, as it feels different enough, to let you learn how to play this games from the start. There are a lot of mechanics I havent even looked into so far and the UI can feel overwhelming.",1652980668,1652980942,True,5,0,0.563720226287841797,2,True,False,False

Overall, this game beats Civilization mainly in the area of immersion and realism. No longer does one play a disembodied god, but instead an actual dynasty, the game borrows some concepts and mechanics from Crusader Kings. Similarly, as any real ancient ruler, players in Old World are confined by the number of orders they can give per turn - an empire that exceeds it's ""administrative"" capacity isn't viable or has to choose very carefully how to place a given order. Here as elswhere we see historical circumstances getting translated into an interesting gameplay mechanic, balancing wide- and tall-play. Another great boost to immersion is offered by the confined time period, which allows you to really dive into this epoch of civilization-building in a way Civilization never really did. In general, this game is able to capitalise one some of the strengths of Paradox-Titles (intricate diplomacy, historical accuracy, mechanical breadth) and pairs it with the extremly enjoyable and addictive 4X-gameplay of the Civilization-series.

But it's basically CIV with some ""dynastic"" elements strapped on to the side of it.
What you should take from that is that when you found a new city, you have the option to grant it to another family (of the 4 available) within your nation.

Gameplay wise this is marginally impactful. There doesn't seem to be any real need to do this. 
You still control the city completely.
There certainly isn't the level of interaction of CK here.
Characters are born and die. Marriages happen. People get sick but realistically it's all just names in the background. 
All interactions happen through event pop ups. And while that can be interesting, it's just not that interesting.

I just can't recommend it as to me it feel like just another CIV clone.

The game is absolutely worth the price.
Each nation has its differences which are not just cosmetic, but their play style differs a lot. But at the end it always depends on you and your heir, how you ""groom"" him/her.
Game combines great things of older Civilization games (especially Civ 4) and event system with characters with their stats like in Crusader Kings.
Relatively robust event system, all the relations with your family, other noble families, heads of religions, governors, spies, ambassadors, other nations and tribes, great combat system and empire management cause that in Old World there are almost never ""empty turns"" where you just wait for something to be finished like in other similar games. On the contrary the most precious resource are ""Orders"" (which allows you to do all the stuff from moving and building with your worker to promoting your archers) and you will find out that you could do more in every single turn, but you are out of Orders. It brings planning to another level, especially in wars, where you need to divide your orders to empire management and waging the war.",1652959395,1652959497,True,32,0,0.630569279193878174,0,True,False,False

It has a beautiful art and I enjoyed endgame every time so far. Level of details might be overwhelming at first, but there's a great tutorial. This game really should get much more recognition.
