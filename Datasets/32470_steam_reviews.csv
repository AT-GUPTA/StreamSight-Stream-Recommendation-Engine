Vanilla Game:
-Gameplay Awesome
-Campaign & Story Very good
-Graphics for todays standard's logically not that good
(Didn't play the Forces of corruption campaign yet.)

Modded Game:
TL DR: With mods like Thrawn's revenge, Age of the rebellion, Fall of the republic, etc. This game is a must play!!!

The mods I mentioned above are complete overhauls which give you
improved graphics, new factions, campaigns, storys, eras(like the clone wars) maps, planets, ships, heroes, ground forces, mechanics and add a new time system. The Economy system also gets improved with some mods (Thrawn's revenge for example)

There's one mod called Empire at War: Remastered that's dedicated to lift up the games graphics to today's standard's. And it does that amazingly well!

And the best is: The devs love what the modding community does with the game and they still update the game to give the mod devs more possibilities to change the game.

I sunk hundreds of hours into it throughout out junior high and high school and it was my only PC game for a long time after I bought the Gold Pack from Walmart when PC games didn't all need Steam or whatever the other ones are.

The base game is pretty well balanced and every unit has its place and time as you progress through the tech tree. No unit ever feels OP and newer ones replace old ones at a fair pace. 
The two factions are designed to play differently and uniquely with minimal extra mechanics. The AI does seem to cheat a little as it often seems to have a suspicious amount of money but that's probably an attempt to make up how predictable the AI is. Micromanaging units will often counteract the massive fleets of hundreds of Rebel ships with ease but it will take time to learn how to properly use your units.

The space battles are definitely better than the land battles. Land battles aren't bad but the terrain and unit pathing can cause units to get stuck or try to take unreasonably long routes to a point on the map or even get stuck driving back and forth in the same spot.

The expansion on the other hand adds a third faction that has all their units and heroes available from the start, one of which can destroy the Death Star from the galactic map out of nowhere with no warning. Some units like Vader's TIE fighter are bugged and locked to the wrong plane in skirmish battles making it impossible for him to dogfight enemy fighters and in Galactic Conquest he is a Super Stardestroyer that sometimes takes up a third of the map and can solo the average sized AI fleets almost every time even on higher difficulties.

The Consortium is also extremely annoying to play against as they cover the map in a fart gas that lets them blow up your bases with money and reveals your fleets to them as well as crippling your defenses. Since the AI seems to have an excessive amount of money an AI Consortium will quickly cover half the map in an ugly green color and will often blow up base buildings on planets that aren't even close to them or important. It can often be predicted what planets they will sabotage as the all three AI have fixation on certain planets like Eriadu for no apparent reason.

The expansion adds lots of units that are useless like 2 out of the 3 Darktroopers or the Consortium's anti-air missile launcher that can't kill aircraft, bugged like Vader and Luke as starfighters, or wildly overpowered like the B-Wing and Skipray Blastboat. The expansion is also a step down from the base game visually as parts of buildings and space stations that were previously animated are no longer and some textures look off somehow.

The modding scene is generally pretty impressive but also full of large scale projects that were too big and have long been dropped.",1517971426,1707851990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A long time ago, back when Steam wasn't a thing, I remember playing [i]Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds[/i] and the [i]Clone Campaigns[/i] expansion. It's basically [i]Age of Empires[/i] with a [i]Star Wars[/i] skin. However, it was missing one crucial element:

[i]""Where are the massive space battles? And no, battles on the surface of 'asteroids' do not count.""[/i]

So when I saw first-look promotional screenshots of [i]Star Wars: Empire at War[/i] and how they included space battles with every size of ship imaginable from nimble X-Wings to the intimidating Imperial Star Destroyers, I knew I had to play it. It helps that Petroglyph, the developers, already had experience with real-time strategy games before...under the former Westwood Studios, before they moved out and started their new studio after the Electronic Arts acquisition.

Anyway, I convinced a local Internet gaming cafe to install the game on their PCs a month or so after release, and I spent hours upon hours playing both Imperial and Rebel campaigns. However, that Internet gaming cafe would close its doors around 2007 before I got the chance to play the expansion, [i]Forces of Corruption[/i]. It would take nearly 12 years, the introduction of Steam, getting and upgrading a decent 2010s PC, and getting the game on sale before I could finally experience the exploits of Tyber Zann and his Consortium. (Tyber Zann? More like Tyber Chad, am I right?)

After seeing Disney's acquisition of the [i]Star Wars[/i] franchise and this game (along with [i]Republic Commando[/i] and many other [i]Expanded Universe[/i] series) being thrown into the [i]Star Wars: Legends[/i] bin, and Electronic Arts making a pathetically paltry amount of feature-incomplete and deliberately grindy live-service [i]Star Wars[/i] games (and the [i]Souls[/i]-like [i]Star Wars: Jedi[/i] series), I'm still glad that I have [i]Empire at War[/i] as an option. And the modding community has done a great deal to keep this game aging like a well-blended Scotch whisky.

[b][i][u]Star Wars Empire at War: Gold Pack (Empire at War + Forces of Corruption) - The Good, Bad and Ugly[/u][/i][/b]

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*] Fulfills the classic strategy geek fantasy of commanding squadrons of Rebel X-Wings + Y-Wings or a fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers in space battles. (Or blowing planets up with the Galactic Empire's Death Stars. Or becoming rich and powerful through crime with the Zann Consortium.) Though come for the ISD spam, stay to learn proper combined arms/combined fleet tactics (and screw the Tarkin Doctrine).
[*] Three engaging (for its time) single-player story campaigns (Rebel Alliance, Galactic Empire, and the expansion's Zann Consortium) that introduce the player to the basic gameplay premise as well as each faction's playstyle and units. 
[*] A Galactic Conquest mode where the only objectives are the ones you set (plus what new planets are revealed) and the ultimate goal of ruling/liberating/corrupting the galaxy, with challenges like the ""Single-planet start"".
[*] The re-enabled multiplayer, many years after the old GameSpy servers shut down.
[*] A nice throwback to the old [i]Star Wars Expanded Universe[/i] (a.k.a.: [i]Legends[/i]) continuity with references galore, back when there's still fun to be had in new [i]Star Wars[/i] games and less ""live-service"" elements (if not none).
[*] Petroglyph's dedication to keeping the game updated [b][i]17 years[/i][/b] after release (recently getting a 64-bit update in November of 2023). On a similar note...
[*] Their support for the modding community.
[*] And of course, the aforementioned modding community that extends the game's longevity beyond its 2006(!) vintage. From mods that keep the feel of the old vanilla game yet add new units ([i]Absolute Corruption Mod[/i]) and dive into other time periods of [i]Star Wars[/i] like the Clone Wars ([i]Republic at War[/i]), to mods that ramp up the challenge like a [i]Souls[/i] game ([i]Awakening of the Rebellion[/i]), to more ambitious total expansion mods (Empire at War Expanded's [i]Thrawn's Revenge[/i], [i]Fall of the Republic[/i], and the upcoming [i]Revan's Revenge[/i]) that basically adds planetary management/political influence mechanics akin to what you'd usually see in 4X games like the [i]Total War[/i] series, to a very ambitious remake ([i]Empire at War Remake[/i]) that vastly improves the graphics from 2006 and updates it for the 2020s (sadly not for Potato PCs).
[/list]

[b]The Bad and Ugly:[/b]
[list]
[*] Considering this is an older RTS game, there are times where unit pathfinding can be a problem. Even with your best RTS micromanagement skills, the unit pathfinding sometimes goes all over the place, except the spot where you want the unit(s) to be. (Also exposes how clumsy and lumbering the AT-AT platform is, even if its turbolasers shred most ground units and structures.)
[*] Arbitrary unit/population cap--space battles. Thank goodness for mods that increase the popcap even a little to replicate the epic, large-scale space battles seen in the Original and Prequel Trilogies plus the [i]Expanded Universe[/i].
[*] Arbitrary unit/population cap--land battles. And in vanilla, you have to push towards other landing zones with sometimes limited forces to increase your popcap, though you'll hit the unit limit pretty quickly. Defending is much easier if you have multiple unit-producing structures that spit out free garrison units. But if you don't have enough or only have three building slots on the planet and an anemic actual garrison stationed there, you're screwed.
[*] Conquering a small portion of a planet to establish planetary control kinda breaks immersion, but understandable. It keeps the ground battles much shorter and (relatively) less grindy than it already is.
[*] Somewhat basic selection of units that run on tactical rock-paper-scissors, both on land and in space (some of the units being Petroglyph homebrews). Again, game mods add new units referenced in either the [i]Expanded Universe[/i] works or (part of) the new Disney canon.
[*] Somewhat limited variety of planets/land maps, though that's mostly because of the rather limited assets of the land map editor. Some improvements on the land map editor and additional assets (buildings/doodads) referencing other places in the galaxy (both from Disney Canon and old [i]Expanded Universe[/i]) will go a long way keeping this game enjoyable.
[*] ""Space"" is mainly 2-D space, albeit with different layers/depths for capital ships, cruisers, frigates, missile cruisers, anti-fighter corvettes and fighters/bombers. (I know, not every RTS with a space combat element can be like [i]Homeworld[/i].)
[*] Somewhat dated graphics, though mods like the aforementioned [i]Empire at War Remake[/i] give it a much-needed makeover.
[/list]

[b][i]The Verdict/TL;DR:[/i][/b]
- [i]Empire at War[/i]'s graphics may not hold up as well today as it did back in the simpler times of 2006, but this game's passionate and dedicated modding community (with the tacit support of Petroglyph) has kept it alive and kicking for the past 17 years (and counting). At a time when newer [i]Star Wars[/i] games are usually live-service (""modern"" [i]Battlefront[/i]) or mobile dreck with predatory microtransactions, and single-player experiences are rare (the [i]Souls[/i]-like [i]Star Wars: Jedi[/i] series), older [i]Star Wars[/i] games like [i]Empire at War[/i], [i]Republic Commando[/i], the classic [i]Battlefront[/i] games and even the old [i]Galactic Battlegrounds[/i] (to name a few) become nostalgic priceless treasures--or oases in the midst of a rapidly expanding desert.

Empire At War is exactly what I want from a Star Wars game: unit variation, charm, strategy, and epic space battles with amazing ships. Let's be honest, we play for the space battles. The campaign, galactic conquest, and multiplayer are all top notch. Galactic conquest and multiplayer, in particular, are my choice. 

Having EAW available on Steam is great. I must give a shout-out to Petroglyph for having recently patching the game to improve multiplayer stability. THANK YOU, PETROGLYPH!  Multiplayer is now enjoyable and provides a great time with friends either against each other or teaming up against the computer AI.
 
The modding community has continually added unique assortments over the years. I love playing the base game, but some of the mods take it to a whole other level. Massive selection of fleet units to build, more specialized units, and heavy star destroyers, super star destroyers! What's not to love about this? Thank you to the modding community for expanding the game to include so much more.

However, in 2024 it has aged immensely when compared to other RTS/Strategy-type games. After 10+ hours of really trying to like this game, I just can't do it and have lost all desire to continue. 

My biggest gripe is probably the lack of base building actually in-game, as opposed to being done on the star map. This is exacerbated by the constant 'Battle Commencing' pop-up that never ends, as the opposing faction invades your planets space and then planet surface. 

You literally spend hours building ships and troops to counter-act the endless tug-of-war match that is taking place as you fight for planets. I got to a point where I was still losing plants with ~100 supply worth of space ships and ~100 supply worth of ground troops (my supply count was around 230 combined) ... and still losing space battles and/or planets... only to have to rebuild and then do it all over again... and then again. 

Go ahead and throw down the learn to play, skill issues, etc. That's fine. Not going to dedicate my free time to mastering a game that is nearly 20 years old. I was looking for a causal experience and some light-hearted Star Wars RTS. It's kinda here... but the overall game style mechanics of this game is just simply not fun to me. 

Maybe mods offer a lot of new things, but I don't even need to bother with them because I already know it is just all more of the same, if not even harder difficulty from what I've read. 

I play games in my free time to relax and unwind. Not to be stressed or feel like I have a list of chores.

I had some fun with the base game especially learning how to use units effectively. Space battles become very similar and repetitive. The AI doesn't know how to deal with bombing runs in combination with the sensor ping ability making ground battle very easy for Rebels. The story is a simple retelling of events that lead to Star Wars: A New Hope from both the Rebel and Empire side that stay true to legends continuity pretty well.

Forces of Corruption: It's DLC expansion Forces of Corruption is a more well-rounded than base game. It adds a lot of added complexity to the gameplay. It adds a new Campaign for a new faction the Zann Consortium plus new units and heroes to existing factions. I enjoyed this DLC very much. The AI is more aggressive compared to the base game, which address many issue I had with the base game's AI. The story gets very fan fic despite this I did enjoy the references to classic Legends content: Dark Forces, The Thrawn trilogy, Shadow of the Empire, Therefore I Am, and Tie Fighter (video game). Although, it is very silly that Tyber Zann is able to outsmart Jabba, Xizor, Vader, and Thrawn. The DLC story ends on a cliffhanger that is never resolved. 

Issues/fixes: The final level on Kaut for Forces of Corruption is prone to crashes. so save often. Also, the DLC can only be launch in the steam launcher, not the shortcut.

I recommend picking it up for 10 bucks or less on steam. The base game is good but flawed and it's DLC is great.",1677022571,1705264764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a longtime fan of both the Star Wars franchise and real-time strategy games, this title exceeded all my expectations and delivered an unforgettable journey across the galaxy.

From the moment I launched the game, I was captivated by the stunning graphics and attention to detail. The visual representation of iconic Star Wars planets, starships, and ground units is nothing short of breathtaking. The developers truly went above and beyond to recreate the essence of the Star Wars universe, and it felt like I was commanding my own fleet in the midst of epic space battles or leading ground forces to conquer planets.

The Gold Pack's inclusion of both the base game and the Forces of Corruption expansion is a stroke of genius. It adds a whole new layer to the gameplay, introducing the criminal underworld and allowing players to experience the Star Wars saga from a different perspective. The diversity of factions, units, and strategies available kept me engaged and excited throughout my entire playthrough.

The strategic depth of Empire at War is commendable. Managing resources, constructing fleets, and strategically deploying forces are all crucial aspects of the game that require thoughtful planning. The balance between space and ground battles is exceptionally well-executed, ensuring that each aspect contributes to the overall immersive experience.

One of the standout features is the galactic conquest mode, where players can wage epic campaigns for control of the galaxy. This mode provides a sandbox-like experience, allowing for a high level of replayability as players can experiment with different strategies and explore alternate storylines. It truly feels like you're shaping the fate of the Star Wars galaxy with every decision you make.

The sound design deserves special mention, as it perfectly complements the visuals to create an authentic Star Wars atmosphere. The iconic music, voiceovers, and sound effects transport players into the heart of the action, enhancing the overall sense of immersion.

In conclusion, Star Wars: Empire at War Gold Pack is a must-have for any fan of the Star Wars franchise or strategy gaming enthusiast. It successfully marries the beloved Star Wars universe with engaging gameplay, resulting in a gaming experience that is nothing short of legendary.

Empire at War is kept alive to this day by talented mod developers that create ""total conversion"" mods that completely overhaul how the game is played and how the game looks. Workshop integration was the best thing to have happened to Empire at War, hands down.

Performance works far better, I have less tinkering to maximise 1-2 of my CPU cores to get this to run better now. I look forward to see if they release a sequel.

Petroglyph could also do a possible proper Official Remaster/Remake of EAW and the FoC expansion (taking Inspiration from some the mods), it would be most welcomed by the community.

The space combat is pretty easy to pick up and, more importantly, feels very Star Wars. It's an old game but there is still an active modding community that keeps things pretty fresh. The developers also support this game even to this day with very recent patches bringing the aging game into 64 bit and fixing a long-standing save game bug. Given the current trend of remaking classic games, I wouldn't be surprised if this was an attempt to show interest in doing so and it would totally deserve it. 

Now it isn't without flaws, to be clear. The land combat is very forgettable and obnoxious at times, despite the stellar space combat. The galaxy management in galactic conquest is pretty shallow, though it generally does what it needs to in my opinion and would probably not benefit from too much more tacked on.

The standard edition is a little buggy and hasn't aged as well as it should but the forces of corruption expansion is INCREDIBLE.

I basically grew up with this game before discovering it on steam, the modding community is INSANE stretching from adding the ENTIRE CLONE WARS to even adding after endor death star explosion content. I enjoy basic RTS games yet feel overwhelmed sometimes by games such as supreme commander or age of empires, this game feels like a perfect introduction to the genre and lets you play at your own pace. The community for a game this old is steady strong and not backing down.

The base game alone on FOC has you play as a pirate lord slowly corrupting the galaxy as well as lets you simulate endless scenarios in skrimish and conquest battles.

If you install a mod that removes the unit cap you can literally have large scale hundreds/thousands unit battles and live your Star Wars fantasy.

FOC is only about the campaign which was a genius idea, the game itself is pretty unbalanced... But thanks to the FOC community mods, it is what keeps both games alive up until now.
The FOC mods are pretty fanboyish, it is just immersion and nothing else.

If a new Star Wars strategy game is in plan, Empire at War should be the model, except figuring out a way to design it without the heroes. They hold some type of gameplay purpose in the Skirmish, without them it'd be very dull, but I don't know what is it specifically.

In the first mission you have to let CP30 and R2D2 hack somewhere which takes 2 minutes. In the meanwhile you're attacked by ~10 AT-AT (those big machines). 

The best that you can create are ""light tanks"" which are extremely underwhelming. It takes like 30 hits from a tank to kill a single soldier! Imagine how useless these vehicles are! While the AT-AT can do some serious damage to your tanks and soldiers.

Your tanks can be taken out in a single shot by the enemy's anti-vehicle turret.

I constructed an ""anti-vehicle"" turret. It couldn't even scratch the AT-ATs. 4 AT-ATs took out the anti-vehicle turret. Amazing!

Why must land and space battles be such a pathetic difficulty? You're always put up like 1:10 against enemies. On top of this the enemies are also extremely overpowered (I was playing at ""easy"" difficulty BTW).

The chaos and balance of space combat, the coordinated sound of Turbolasers and ordinance, and everything falling into place is what keeps me playing this game. Most of my time has been modded playthroughs, as the community has found what works and expands on it to the best of their abilities.

To the many people who have worked on this game for the past many years, weaving a collection of mechanics into place to create some of the most satisfying combat I've seen in my life, some of the largest scale I've seen (seriously, an SSD doesn't take up the whole screen, fighters are micro sized in most mods), as well as gotten me into the expansive works of SW Legends, thanks.",1701751251,1701751251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bad optimization for newer hardware Such as a 3060, Granted the game is from 2006, Although it does end up leading into unstable FPS along with sometimes crashing when alt tabing and other cases.

One plus is the graphics hold up quite well still, and the gameplay is still good to this day.

Mod the game tho. Also, they're still updating it although it is just bug fixes. there are 2 different ways to launch the game which are gold edition and forces of corruption, so it's a bit tricky finding out which one to use for a mod.

Would recommend buying on sale

i have over 700hrs on a copy that i ""downloaded"" and plus 239 via steam. this game was the very first RTS i ever played and i loved it, it introduced new ways to star wars that i never ever saw or could conceve from the movies. the abilty to build up massive fleets and complety reck the AI because there pretty crap on easy and meduim unless if u choose hard which they just become a harsment. mods are very good with this game and there are many out there ethier moding the ye olde graphics and AI to blazing new units, ships and planets, and even mods that completely change what universe the game is set and based on, eg. star trek, halo ect.   


over all this game, with flaws. still is a blast to play even without mutiplayer, i still enjoy playing it time to time but never like the ye olde days of 8 hours a day. all that i wish for now is a sequal which i know is never going to happen but still or a group of modders say remake the game, fix its flaws with the knogledge that more recent RTS has found and perfected and restore the glory of this game to what it use to be, that which is a star wars RTS know as Star Wars - Empire At War",1370649321,1700950850,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Thrawns Revenge
Remake
Fall of the Republic
Republic at war.

every few months, one gets an itch. and there are very few if any games like this. 
Sure, there are better 4x games, sure there are better RTS games. But for a game whose sandbox is its own campaign, combing both grand and real time strategy, its a wonder why noone has tried something similar.

In the various overhaul mods, dont fool yourself. The AI is mean, and it will out produce and hit you from all fronts. You need to be astute in your decision making, conservative with your forces for they are hard to replace or can be lost entirely like hero units in some mods. Do you focus on early aggression, before your enemy has time to dig in, but with the limited forces at your disposal? Do you play defensive, trying to hold on all fronts? Do you play economic, giving nonessential worlds whilst taking valuable ones, whilst simultaneously investing in your economy and hanging on for dear life until its up and running?

All are viable, all can be done. But its how you choose.

This game is regularly on sale and for pretty cheap. The game is still supported by the developers as well, and this game is what nearly 20 years old, with a recent patch to make her 64bit + other changes.

A long long time ago in this very galaxy LucasArts made a game called ""Star Wars: Rebellion"". It was a RTS game that was released under Windows 95. While this game was VERY fun, it did have a lot of flaws built into it. (one example would be an overuse of windows). The fans liked the game anyways, and demanded Rebellion 2. LucasArts developed Star Wars: Empire at War (originally called Rebellion 2) 



Review:



This game is a must have for any Star Wars fan, but in reality, it is not the game that Petroglyph wanted to make. Unfortunately, LucasArts tended to be fairly impatient with the release of the games and would rush games to the stores before they were even really ready. While a lot of the errors can be seen if you know what to look for, and the AI will cheat (the higher the difficulty, the more the AI will cheat. The only real way it gets ""more difficult"" is by having things there is no way it should have. The tactics the computer uses aginst you is always the same), it is still a very fun game. I have spent many a hour playing this game. The graphics are good, the sound is what you would expect from a Star Wars game, and the voice acting is very good.

Continuous support for Empire at War over the years (nearly decades) is crazy. The developers at Petroglyph have continued to keep this game up to date for years, previously reviving the defunct online multiplayer, to the recent x64 update which has significantly expanded the game's potential, taking the scale of the battlefield to the limits of your pc (and ability to mod the unit limit per battle).

Three unique factions with their own play-style.

 The 2 games have a nice Campaign to familiarize players with the tactical and strategic layers of the game. A galactic conquest mode to allow players to take the galaxy by force as their chosen faction and a skirmish mode for a more focused experience.

 This is an older game that is well worth it to any Star Wars fan or those who love strategic games; Even being an older game the developers have been updating this game many years after its release, fixing bugs and even recently upgrading the game to a 64 bit program.

The gameplay is virtually flawless.  Controlling planet's planetary and space production to research new technology, build facilities and defenses, contol fleets, build units, spy on enemies, and launch attacks to take over the universe.

The graphics are obvioulsy dated (the game was released in 2006) but even by today's standards are great.

I think it's too bad the online servers were cut, but you can still play with friends through LAN.
Real Time Strategy game.

The online is back!  It's a miracle!  And now with mod support, this community is really coming back.  It's great!  All the old things I loved, plus online support, plus mods?  How much better could it get!

The Rebels are a little OP with their stealing of technology and ability to raid with every single unit as long as you don't have more than 3-6 units per stack, the Empire snowballs pretty quickly with their later tech giving a lot of broken and OP units and heroes, and the Consortium is a hot mess to play against when fighting their corruption (like it's NON STOP CORRUPTION no matter what you do, no matter how many defilers you neutralize or how much corruption you remove), but I still enjoy playing it because it's a very unique game, and while yes some games seem to have the same style, no modern game has replicated an experience like this for Star Wars (Stellaris is close, but you don't play as the Empire or Rebels unless you use a mod).

In addition to what I have previously said, I would like to bring to attention just a small handful of the great mods that this game has that completely change the base game as a whole. (These are in random order, this is not my personal ranking or preference, all are equally awesome in their own rights)


Awakening of the Rebellion (AoTR): Created by the Steiner Modding Group (SMG dev team), AoTR is a complete revamp of the base game that drastically changes the gameplay of the Empire, Rebellion, and Black Sun (Renamed and recently revamped Consortium in 2.10) into an entirely new game in some aspects. Based on the pc game Star Wars: Rebellion, this mod adds many features from this game and other titles, including a more in-depth mission system, tech system, and many new units. AoTR also improves tactical combat in space, ground and galactic combat, and substantially improves the graphics of the base game. Also, if you play as the rebel alliance, be sure to say hello to the Captain of the Liberation for me, he's a great guy ;-)
(***NOTE***: This mod is not super well suited to newcomers to EaW or the mod, expect it to be difficult, I advise starting a small campaign on the lowest difficulty to learn the mechanics before jumping into a long and hard campaign).

EDIT: 2.11 has recently been announced, which is a total rework of the maps and some improvements across the board.


Empire At War Expanded Mods (EaWX): EaWX is a list of mods that completely change the base game into one of four Legends eras- Post-Endor (Thrawn's Revenge), Clone Wars (Fall of The Republic), Old Republic (Revan's Revenge), and Galactic Civil War (Imperial Reign). In addition to adding in new units and factions, there are several new mechanics in each mod that greatly improve the game and bring it into the modern world. New mechanics include resources (Food, Parts, Planetary Influence, Ship Crews, and Trade Ports), Imperial Legitimacy, Allied Factions in some mods, the ability to choose your heads-of-state and command staff, and many other smaller and bigger changes with their own uses throughout your campaign. For fans of canon, there is a submod that adds in the MC-75, Sphyrna-class Corvette (Hammerhead Corvette), and Starhawk-class. There is also a submod that allows for torpedoes and missiles to penetrate shields, but the standard EaWX mods have all weapons only hit shields until they can be brought offline, so if you dislike AoTR's ability to take out the engines of retreating enemy forces (or hate losing your own capitals like Home One to 2 bomber squadrons even with full shields), then this is a mod for you. There is so much more to these mods that I cannot even fully explain here, as I have too little space to write about them, so I'm going to tell you to try it for yourself. I would say these are probably some of the best mods for fans of EaW who want to challenge themselves. (***NOTE***: At the time of writing this, only Fall of The Republic and Thrawn's Revenge have been launched, with Revan's Revenge launching sometime between 2023-2024 and Imperial Reign being possibly 2+ years off from launching)

Empire At War Remake: Empire at War if it was launched in modern times instead of 2006, not only are there new models and even new units, there are new mechanics and new factions to play as. I personally have little experience with this mod, and as such I will not try to explain things that I do not 100% know, but I have heard entirely great reviews of it, and I advise you to check it out. (***WARNING***: make sure your computer can handle graphics really well, because this mod is REALLY laggy if your computer is a potato like my own)

EDIT: I have managed to acquire a computer that can actually run this mod, and I can wholeheartedly say I love it


Other mods include the Clone Wars extravaganza that is Republic at War (RaW), the ultimate meme- ***cough cough*** sorry, (force of habit) the EXPANSIVE and ACTION-PACKED Yoden Mod, and the thrilling and detailed Phoenix Rising mod, among the hundreds of others not mentioned here. There's something for everyone in the workshop!

Before I end this, I would like to shout out several content creators who I advise watching if you find yourself interested in any of these mods but want to find out more before trying them yourself. There's so many I could never list every single one here, but these are my personal favorites for EaW:

Coreyloses- EaWX developer, has several older and ongoing campaigns on the current and upcoming updates of the different EaWX mods.
The XPGamers (Captain Shack)- The YouTuber who actually brought EaW into my world, Shack has several AoTR, EaWX, and a handful of other mod playthroughs that I highly advise checking out if you find yourself interested in any mods listed.
GenesisKing- Another YouTuber that is another great choice for checking out mods. Very similar to Shack, Genesis King has many AoTR, EaWX, and other mod playthroughs.
Andrew Hester- An underrated YouTuber that definitely needs more subscribers, check him out for all sorts of mods and that are not even listed here. While you're there, say hello to Perkins ;-)",1682204442,1700609135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is actually made up of 2 games, the original Empire at War and its later sequel, Forces of Corruption. I can't say much about the original Empire at War other than that it seems like it had some balancing and combat issues, where units would not die quick enough and there wasn't much contrast in power between vehicles and infantry. There were also power scaling issues in space combat as well. Forces of Corruption fixed all of these issues and added more maps, more characters and units, more mechanics, and an entirely new faction called the Zann Consortium, a criminal underworld faction.

The main differences between the two games thematically are that the original game is set prior and a bit during the events of A New Hope, and Forces of Corruption is set after The Empire Strikes Back. Each of these games has a story-driven campaign involving each of the major factions. The original Empire at War has two campaigns, one for the Empire and one for the Rebels, whereas Forces of Corruption only has one for the Zann Consortium. One of the drawbacks of this game is that you can't actually play all three campaigns in Forces of Corruption, only the one for the Zann Consortium. There may be a mod to do that, but I'm not quite sure.

Speaking of the Zann Consortium, during any Galactic Conquest runthrough, they are incredibly unfun and annoying to deal with. They can corrupt star systems and allow them to steal daily income or bypass territory completely with fleets, and it costs money to get rid of corruption. Lots of their units seem to be incredibly overpowered and needlessly difficult to deal with as well given the nature of the game's rock paper scissors mechanics. There's also the Rebels' plex troopers which are good at killing almost literally everything.

Overall despite the lackluster ground combat and balance issues, this is a really really fun RTS. There's all sorts of fun mechanics like building structures on ground and space stations to produce units, individual unit abilities, heroes, tech upgrades, smuggling, bounty hunting, and territorial bonuses.

If you for whatever reason don't like the way the base game is, there's a massive amount of mods online and on the Steam Workshop which modify the game in various ways. One of the most popular mods is a total conversion Clone Wars mod called Republic at War.

If you like Star Wars and you like RTS games, I highly recommend this one.",1698453857,1698453857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are plenty planets featured from the movie and you'll be even able to see how Alderaan looked like before it was destroyed (;_;) 

Without mods, you can only play in era of Episode 4-6 as Rebels, Empire and as Zann's Consortium (some kind of space mafia faction roughly summarized). Zann's Consortium can also be disabled which I honestly prefer. I prefer the classic storyline of Empire and Rebels. The victory outro for both is really satisfying by the way.

Firstly, this is a game I got from a school catalogue which I think came with some magazine or something, I don't entirely remember what. I was at the time mourning losing my Battlefront 2 disc, which had incredible nostalgia for me as well but this game helped me cope with that. At first I barely knew how to do anything I think I loaded up a Skirmish on Naboo as the Empire with a bunch of allies on both sides, and I just used the fee units since I had no idea how to click on the buildings apparently. This was my very first RTS however so my sillyness can be forgiven. :P

But that was my first fond memories. I have many many fond memories, this game ran well on my laptop so it was my go too game on roadtrips and in many situations. I played on easy mpst of the time since AI scares me. On easy it feels like you almost become a sadistic torturer of your enemies toying with them. Which I certainly played into as the Empire. But the question is... What does this say about the game? Well aside from the fact I have played this game for countless hours on disc on to of what I have on Steam and how fomd of this game I am... Not too much.

Gamemodes:
Tutorial
Campaign
Galactic Conquest
Skirmish (land)
Skirmish (space)
Skirmish (land control)

I honestly haven't played land control much. I would honestly like to try but most of my experience is split between the other modes so I will talk about my dislikes for each. Which isn't to say I am saying it's bad, it's just that asking me to say what exactly I like about this game is like asking someone why they love a song. I don't know I just like it. There is many reasons which I simply couldn't articulate. So I will focus on dislikes because there is a few key things I feel is missing.

TUTORIAL:

Well, what is there to say? Play them! :P

Notably if you ever wish to play the Campaign for Forces of Corruption please do play the FoC specifc Tutorials because it includes what I would call the prologue. The game files call it that at least. Don't miss out on them! 

CAMPAIGN:

For the camapigns, I have very little against them. They are great, and I don't remember having too many issues with them. However the one thing I do dislike is the fact that you can't play the Non-DLC camapigns in FoC. It makes sense why ofc, but I think it would be cool if you could play them still. But luckily you can by just... Opening the non-DLC game. Which I argue has a better title screen by far.

GALACTIC CONQUEST:

In the non-FoC version of this, there is occasionally missions you can get from the various military leaders. I think that they are sorely missed in FoC. Especially because it has cool voice acting. It honestly baffles me and has forever bothered me that they were taken out in FoC.

The Consortium... This will become a trend but the  Consortium in Galactic Conquest feels... Cheesey. I love the additions in FoC, but I honestly wish there was a way to customise the galacy a bit more in regards ro spawns. There is already a bunch of presets, but honestly I wish there was something like Equal Footing but... Incredibly inequal. Like this around the time of tESB to RotJ, so it makes sense the Rebels don't have like two planets, but I would like the Consortium to mostly be consolidated around Hutt and Mandalorian space. Meaning that the most OP faction by far is in the weakest position galaxy wise. I also wish there was an option to turn the Consortium off. Yes I know there is mods which fix all of these problems... But it wouldn't be a very proper review of the game if I included things which players have done to it. (Which mods certainly do fix a lot of issues, and create a bunch of new ones)

SKIRMISH LAND:

Skirmish is interesting but I will include land based objections in here too. EaW is a departure from traditional style RTS's when it comes to base building. As in everyone starts off with two forts with equal footing against each other. You can make it so you have to construct the buoldings but it's a lot more like you all just got bombed and need to rebuild for war asap. You get free units if you so choose which is just two units of infantry which probably contain either two or three squads each. I think the main issue of land battles in Empire at War is mainly down to the fact that Galactic Conquest kinda corrupt peoples opinions on land battles. Because in GC you can just spam something and win. But I don't think I am aware of a strategy game wjich doesn't have that same issue... Well maybe some but horde tactics tend to work in most RTS's. Skirmish land is a better experience than land in GC for sure. And any mods which try to ""fix"" land battles basically turn it into a giant spectle slug match where the strongest unit wins and the weakest losses. Perhaps I am a little attached. But what I am not attached to is the fact that the Consortium has extremely overpowered turrets. And well most of their things are. Playing the consortium is basically playing the galaxies largest Troll compilation video. Legend says that under the mask of a defiler you will find a Troll face straight from 2012. Why? Defilers got trained by the IRA. And using IRA like tactics is incredibly easy when... You have cloaking technology. I haven't even mentioned Ewok Handlers. Like I ain't hating on the Consortium because I think it's an overpowered faction... I hate the consortium when I am not playing as them. Lol

SKIRMISH SPACE:

Space! The final fron... Sorry, wrong universe. But I think there is a mod for that.

Space is the bread and butter of this game. In fact it is so much so that the most annoying land unit in the game behaves like one! (DAMN YOU GARM!!)

I struggle to really find anything I dislike about space battles. I think it's sad Darth Vader doesn't have his Super Star Destroyer like he does in GC... But I entirely understand why. Speaking of which, I wish GC FoC Luke appeared in skirmish battles on space he has a unique X-Wing which is is pretty strong but tbh I also think it would be OP. The Skywalkers are too strong... That's why they must not had included Leia... :(

Which reminds me I dislike how neither Lando or Leia made it in the game. Very sadge... :(

I would like to say tho, the Consortium in space is far more balanced than their land counterpart. Like for instance their superweapon is mounted on the station. I kinda forgot to mention superweapons but oh well. The Empire has the best one by far tho. On both land and in space.

SKIRMISH LAND CONTROL:

I already said I wouldn't talk about this but just adding it to say, it would be nice if there was a space version of this mode. Or even a GC mode which functioned based on controlling certain planets for a certain amount of time. It would be very chaotic and fun.

CONCLUSION:

I am not a very good reviewer. But I just spent an hour typing about a game I love. I guess you could call it... A love letter... Ey? No? Oh okay.

Regardless, this game has imprinted itself into my mind and the most memorable thing for me is when pilots are screaming and dying mostly because I sent them to their deaths for not very effective tactical faints. Also...

WE'VE JUST LOST OUR LAND BAYS! WE'VE JUST LOST OUR SHIELD GENERATOR! THEY'RE TOO MANY OF TH-ARRRGGGGHHHHH! ANYONE ELSE SEE THEM!

Oh and of course the screaming roar of TIE Fighters. All burnt into my brain. Just like the Forces of Corruption title music. :P

Random Steam user who read this, I sincerely apologise for subjecting you to this rant. Now please do go and enjoy this game. And I swear by Akbar that if Disney doesn't allow Petroglyph to make a sequel... I will recreate Disneyworld in the editor and blow it all up with Defilers! And maybe also Ewok Handlers...

The game is great, there are 3 campaign stories between the base game and expansion, there is still multiplayer, people are still making new mods for the game, there's a galactic conquest, skirmish mode, there is still so much for this game all these years later. To play the campaigns you'll have to boot up different versions as steam treats them differently.

There are issues with the game.

If you save during a battle and try to load it later it can have issues loading. it isn't so bad at first but for very large battles or for battles in a galactic conquests that's gone on for a while it's unreliable. it's not an issue outside of combat so you'll be fine just doing that.

There is also a problem with saves in multiplayer where you'r save won't show up, I don't have a fix for this and don't know if there is one but that only effects galactic conquest in multiplayer.

Its a very cinematic game, allowing you to see the POV of a star destroyer or even a star fighter.
The game-play isn't that great for modern standards, as the controls are a bit weird and you can't change them (from my experience). 
Ground battles are the weakest part of the game by a long shot.
The modding community is fantastic, the work they put in completely remake the game, and after playing some campaings in vanilla, you *definitely* should mod it!

8.9/10 great game, worth every penny.

Released in 2006, this classic title allows you to command the forces of the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance in epic space and ground battles. As a longtime fan of the Star Wars franchise, I'm excited to share my detailed review of this beloved strategy gem.

Gameplay (9/10):
Empire at War offers a compelling mix of real-time strategy and tactical combat. Players can engage in both space and ground battles, each with its own set of units, tactics, and objectives. The game allows for the construction of fleets and armies, the management of resources, and the development of planets. The galactic map provides strategic depth as you vie for control of star systems. The gameplay is accessible to newcomers while offering depth and complexity for strategy enthusiasts.

Storytelling (8/10):
Empire at War provides an engaging narrative set in the Star Wars universe during the Galactic Civil War. The game's campaign mode presents the conflict from the perspectives of both the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. While the story doesn't deviate significantly from the established lore, it allows players to participate in key events and make strategic decisions that impact the outcome of the war. The inclusion of iconic characters and voice acting adds to the immersion.

Galactic Conflict (9/10):
The heart of Empire at War lies in its depiction of the ongoing struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. The galactic map is the battleground, and players must make strategic choices about which planets to conquer, defend, or invest in. The dynamic nature of the conflict ensures that no two campaigns play out the same way. The ability to engage in both space and ground battles adds variety and depth to the strategic gameplay.

Graphics and Sound (7/10):
Considering its release in 2006, Empire at War's graphics have aged reasonably well. The space battles are visually impressive, with detailed ship models and engaging combat animations. Ground battles, while less polished, still capture the essence of Star Wars battles. The game features iconic Star Wars sound effects and music, immersing players in the familiar audio landscape of the franchise.

Modding Community (10/10):
One of Empire at War's enduring strengths is its robust modding community. The game's modding tools and support for user-generated content have led to the creation of countless mods that enhance and expand the game. From total conversions that transport players to different eras of the Star Wars universe to smaller enhancements, the modding community has breathed new life into Empire at War, ensuring its continued relevance.

STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack, while not as well-known as some other Star Wars games, has a dedicated fanbase and has demonstrated the potential for strategy games set in the Star Wars universe. Its influence can be seen in subsequent Star Wars titles that explore similar gameplay mechanics.

My time with Empire at War has been a journey through the Star Wars universe, commanding fleets, conquering planets, and reliving iconic battles. The game's modding community has kept the experience fresh and exciting, allowing me to explore alternate Star Wars scenarios and eras. Empire at War remains a cherished part of my gaming collection.

STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack is a strategy classic that invites players to immerse themselves in the epic conflict of the Star Wars universe. Its engaging gameplay, dynamic galactic conflict, and enduring modding community ensure its place in the hearts of Star Wars fans and strategy enthusiasts alike. Whether you're leading the Empire to dominance or fighting for the Rebel Alliance, Empire at War offers an unforgettable journey through a galaxy far, far away.",1602060205,1696063896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is old and dated, even moreso than other older rts'. The learning curve is insane, and while the tutorial does a decent enough job of teaching you the basics, it hardly  teaches you enough to play this game and succeed. The difficulty is also insane. the lowest difficulty feels like it should be the hardest in any other game, and i dread to think what the higher difficulties are like. It drops you into a galaxy where you are underarmed and undersupplied, not nearly having enough troops to fend for yourself in the long term. and sure, you can make more, but the game never teaches you how to do so in a sustainable manner. The enemy AI is relentless, and not in a good way. You will be constantly assaulted by humongous ass fleets while yours is nowhere near the others level, so all you can do is retreat your forces away, and thats if the game even lets you. Sure you might take a planet or two here and there, but for every one step forward you take its 4 steps backwards. It feels like whenever im finished running away from or getting my ass kicked in a battle the game starts yelling in my face about ANOTHER massive fleet thats invading another system. Its insane, borderline unplayable. If there were mods that reduced the INSANE difficulty of this game then maybe id recommend it, and if there are feel free to let me know, but as the game is, i can try to learn how the fuck to manage it, but i wouldnt recommend anyone else doing so.",1694658238,1694658238,False,0,3,0.476190477609634399,3,True,False,False

Don't buy the idea that mods save the game.  It can, but it's not something to bet your cash on.  Does the game hold up by itself?
Short answer, no.
But it does do alright as a platform for other things.


Ok, I wanted to love this game I really did.  Ok First things first.  Yes it's a big galaxy strategy game of Star wars, you can build fleets and armies, have land and space battles, build star destroyers etc, it's all there.
BUT: When I'm playing it I'm thinking, for every thing the game does well, there's two things that crop up that make me think, 'rebellion did this better six years earlier'.
1)You get limited 'command points' so that the biggest battle you get is about 5 star destroyers... if you have 20, fine, they come in one at a time as reinforcements.
2) Ships repair automatically, so if you cripple a ship in a hit and fade mission, eg, you play as rebels, fly in blast a big star destroyer, fly out then your main fleet comes in just after, literally 1 second can transpire, which represents maybe 1/12 of a galactic day, and that ship will be completely fixed.  So anything you don't destroy is immediately repaired.  That seems like basic logic has gone WAY out the window.
3) You can not sabotage anything, you can only steal technology as the rebels, so usig spec forces or whatever doesn't come into it all.
4) Ground battles are  alittle repetitive, and if for eg, you take over a planet, you can't build defences on the ground level until a battle starts... WHAT THE HELL! So eg you can build BIG things like Ion cannons or shields for the planet, but little 'build pads' for local defences to help you shoot down AT-AT's or whatever can't be built until an invading army arrives... what was my army doing for the six months I held that planet, just standing there? Then they go.. 'oh right, the enemy is landing, maybe we shouldn't have been just giving each other piggy back rides this whole time...'

These might sound niggly as problems, and  they are, but they and a few more I wont mention REALLy pile up to hold the game back from being great. 
The story is paper thin, leads up to the destruction of the 1st death star in star wars 1977.

THE EXPANSION PACK:
In short, it fixes about three little problems, much improved story campaign, you can now sabotage and do things like that BUT ONLY WITH THE NEW TEAM, but the issues above are still largely present.
And when you play games with all 3 teams (ie NOT the campaign) You can see how balance was not an issue for the developers.
The new team, the pirates are SO overpowered and will absolutely cripple the rebs and imps, so play as them or get angry, that's your choices.

So overall, yes I do recommend it, you can see by my hours played that I still gave it a go, and the expansion definitely improves the game enough to give it some reply value. ( I got a MOD with some maps, so I could play the expansion on old maps WITHOUT the new pirate team, thus it wasn't so unabalanced, but could play with the new features, ships etc)

Flying into battle with the Death Star II and Vader's super star destroyer with another 4/5 star destroyers is still very enjoyable. So worth a play, but beware its drawbacks.",1463215811,1694170201,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

In my opinion the base game with expansion is quite solid with decent enough graphics and gameplay, fun combat and a also decent amount of variety to immerse yourself in this Star Wars RTS. However once again I must come back to the mods of this game, Awakening of the Rebellion, Imperial civil War, The Remake mod, Republic at War (Etc..). this game stands at an entirely different level if you decide to explore what the modding community has to offer.

A winning combo in my humble opinion :P In addition to fighting real time battles over planets and in space, there is a campaign mode with a map where the player can plan which planet to attack, which production structures to build, and planetary defences. Planets have natives allied to the different sides that will help that side in any battle there (Rebellion/Empire/Zhan Consortion) and also provide unique bonuses for whoever controls them.

The bundle also comes with 3 full campaigns, the third culminating in the player controlling a Eclipse-class super star destroyer complete with it's very own anti-ship superlaser. Not to mention that the Empire can build the Death Star itself and use it to destroy enemy planets.

Also, X-wings, lightsabers, and Darth Vader.

Imagine you are in a huge battle in Return of the Jedi. You are playing as the rebels and you are getting destroyed by the Empire. You've tried everything else. The X-Wings and all the way up to the Mid-size frigate. But then, you get the last upgrade to your command center. You can now spawn a full blown battleship that can take on a Star Destroyer. It's satisfying.
Game also has ground battles. To me, those are less interesting, but you get to storm a rebel base with a company of Stormtroopers. Or rebels. Take your pick. Heroes also exist. They are characters that can only have one of each on the field. They include Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, Luke, Leia, Han, and Chebacca. Some of these also get ships in space battles.

From the original empire at war playing as the pesky Rebels fighting against the domination of the Empire. the ""3rd"" faction the pirates give a buffer like effect between you and the opposing faction. Now forces of corruption introduces the official 3rd faction the Zahn Consortium, a pirate/underworld faction. The introduction of this factions introduces the player to new mechanics such as a multi-choice corruption mechanic and the corruption missions that come with it. These corruption missions are fairly easy and can span from kidnapping, piracy, and intimidation. Now the interesting thing about this mechanic that it adds perks such as bribery, which disables the ""neutral"" or ""civilian"" forces from aiding against you, to racketeering which can give you a more than decent income bump. To the considered to be over powered revolt which when the player attempts to remove the corruption instead of it going away the planet ""revolts"" and becomes neutral, either Empire or Rebels. Now the last two mechanics really add something for me, the slavery and piracy. There are certain planets that can allow you to enslave the locals and make like in the games terms ""cannon-fodder"" army. Piracy depending on which planet it is can add units of either Rebel or Empire to your roster such as A wings to an Acclamator cruiser. Now for the down sides. The vanilla games after a couple play throughs can get a little stale and unit death stacks (strategy which can be OP) can ruin the experience. Path finding as seen in most real time strategy games can be a little infuriating especially in space combat. But the biggest one i've seen that i forgot to mention is the sabotage mechanic which pay a few credits and unit sacrifice can make a multi defense structured planet be broken down to a single structure. Besides other bugs and mishaps the biggest bonus of this game is the modding community. I along with hundreds of other players can agree that the modding community has gotten so much better since its addition of the steam workshop. Mods such as Thrawns Revenge and the Empire at War Remake mods completely convert from the base game and in a way become a whole new game in its self. From the mods to the gameplay its self, and to the usually really cheap price tag. The game is a must buy for any Star Wars fan or an RTS buff who wants a new challenge. This game has brought me hours upon hours of fun and i really hope someone else can find the same excitement and enjoyment from a must buy, cult classic game!

amazing game, runs on anything, hours and hours of content and if somehow u got bored or you can't stand a lil retro look - just throw the Workshop at it till you struggle to run it anymore![/b]

[b]Amazing game, tons of fun.[/b] I'm not an RTS person, but I am a Star Wars person and defnitely a Star Wars Legends person and this game hits the spot very nicely. There is a vibe to this game, especially with the Forces of Corruption (FoC) DLC that is very Star Wars Legends, some ships, maps, SFX, voice acting, characters and trivia about planets will make every Star Wars nerd happy!

On top of that it's just a very good game, good looking (for 2006 ofc), [b]great performance with tons and tons of way to play with just vanilla and FoC DLC content[/b] - 3 factions, tons of planets, tons of unique planetary battle locations, tons of unit types ([i]you can enslave Ewoks and make them into kamikaze bombs, which is... uhh[/i]), game types, etc. 

But it can get repetetive after almost 70h of this... [b]which is where the Workshop comes in![/b]
Not enough Star Destroyers on your screen? Triple your unit cap! F*** it, make it infinite, till there's no more room for calling in reinforcements!
Wanna make your game look 10x more modern? Sure! There's some graphical mods that will make your PC cry!
But where's the fun in just looks and more units? Want 5 times the unit types? Complicated tech trees? A galaxy with 200 planets instead 50? Mechanics that requires reading a wiki or two? A whole new campaign story? 10 whole new campaign stories? Complicated tech trees? New factions? How about ditching those old 70-80s Rebels and Empire stuff for old people (im kidding obviously) and pitting some roger-roger-ahh Battle Droids against The Clone Army? [i]Did I mention complicated and tech trees?[/i]
Just go to the Workshop, sort by most popular and subscribe away! You got bored with that? Yeah sure, like I'll believe that- but, just go check again, one of the 5 complete overhaul mods you just downloaded just probably got a massive update with 15 new unit types, new mechanics and probably like 5 new factions (those people work hard on those mods!).",1690574100,1690574263,True,5,4,0.586466193199157715,0,True,False,False

That being said, this game is not without its flaws. It's fairly dated and not as complex as compared to PC RTSs today. 

Campaigns:
-Rebellion: Great faction...with their Raid ability. Testing one's capability to work with little to take a lot.
-Empire: Awesome faction. Bigger is better. Don't let the tiny X-wing main character scare you.
-Zann Consortium: Interesting faction. Bottom line? Make ALL the money. You won't be able to pay for all those nice shiny ships and toys without an Emperor's ransom.

Multiplayer:
-If you can find another willing to play, great. Though, I hear the Consortium is overpowered in multiplayer. ;)

Overall, I give this game a 9/10. Dated, but still enjoyable to new and experienced RTS players, plus.... it's Star Wars, before the Disney takeover.",1497331535,1690304337,True,0,0,0.401459872722625732,0,True,False,False

As the rebels, it is nearly impossible unless you blitzkrieg the empire right away, if you don't the consortium will take over the empire nearly completely in about 40 ""game days"".

They are perfect with how smart they are and the DLC actually learns your tactics which is pretty cool but the zann consortium was definetely made wayyyy too strong.

Some things I really like:
-You can rename ships by editing a text file
-You can use the old C&C style mouse controls with a single tickbox
-You can run over infantry with vehicles, ala C&C
-Mods like Fall of the Republic and Rise of the Mandalorians

I can't think of many things to critique, though adjusting to the 4X/TW formula is a bit much. You should also know that the overview map isn't turn based, all RTS all the time.

UPDATE: Now that I've completed all 3 campaigns, and am most of the way through my first FoC Galactic Conquest, I have some notes:
-Instead of making the Emperor run around to purge corruption, it would've been nice to instead have ""ant-Corruption"" units, like ISB Agents for the Empire.
-Most hyperlanes are invisible, which can cause stratagem problems. A simple solution is just to have trade lanes be double lines, and normal lanes single (or dotted and solid, respectively)
-Hero unit spam. So far, half my encounters with Alliance space forces and nearly every invasion have involved enemy Hero units (I've literally lost count of how many times I've blown up Home One). Gunning down Heroes should be hard, but permanent, imo. Bounty Hunters could simply function as-is, but if a Hero is lost, it's permanent.
--Sub-note: FoC Heroes need attention. Tarkin, Sundered Heart, and Obi-Wan are all dead at this point and need replacements. You can kind of squint and give Boba a pass, but the others are 100% not usable.
-The Corrupt Militia Corruption option is a great nuisance, and not much else. No suggestions for a replacement.
-It would be nice if you could set Galaxy Map filters as a persistent setting, as well as saving scout unit placements.
-The Empire feels a bit like playing on a harder game mode, allow me to explain:
--The Alliance gets airspeeders at Tech 1 or 2, for which the Empire has a single counter for (turret pads) until Tech 4. The Alliance can also just ignore space combat and land some pretty hefty units directly on the planet.
--The Consortium has counters for airspeeders with their MDUs, and can basically shop for planet bonuses, instead of having to clear every planet (though GC probably won't count that as a ""win"", Zann's functionally won).
--By comparison, the Empire has to clear every planet, do every fight, and deal with hard counters to a lot of their stuff until Tech 4. Their only advantage is one-button Tech upgrades and ""space carriers"" (everything from the Acclamator up doubles as a carrier, iirc).",1687098252,1689455156,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Question he popped to me on my way homes to from school oh probably around 2007. Fast-forward to 2023 when I picked it up after 16 years THE GAME  STILL HOLDS!!!

Played through the campaign (without mods) and the unit choice is pretty good, each thing has a hard counter to each while if you wanted to invade a planet with just StromTroopers and a AT-AT you very much can. The Rebel Campaign was tough for me as a kid but now a adult I just needed to have patience for a few missions. Hero and Villain selection is all the iconic OG Trilogy Movies (i.e. Darth Vader, Luke, Leia, and even C3PO & R2-D2) a few have their own Flagship or Squadron's when they are space but I will let you figure that out don't want to ruin the fun.

Now if you read this far here is my reasoning for coming back, Captain Shack or XPGGamer from Youtube has been covering this game for years, showing off the hardcore modders that keep this game running for YEARS cannot undersell that, they have brought ever era to this game even brought other franchises if you look hard enough (Star Terk, Halo, etc) if you are looking for a good test of your wits and strats then look for the Awakening of the Rebellion or the Fall of the Republic mods. Both are in my opinion the way the game should've been and is the reasoning for myself picking this game up again. So what side will you pick?

With its three captivating campaigns, a dozen turn-based conquest modes, and classic skirmish battles, this game offers an incredible amount of content that will keep you engaged for hours on end. The longevity it offers is truly impressive, ensuring that every penny spent on this game is worth it.

Now, as an experienced RTS fan, I understand the importance of a balanced and precise gameplay experience. While the ground battles in Empire at War may have their shortcomings in terms of unit controls and balance, the real star of the show lies in its magnificent space battles. Here, the game truly shines, providing an awe-inspiring galactic-scale RTS experience that is second to none.

The attention to detail in the space battles is remarkable. Each class of ship serves a purpose, and the expanded Ship limit allows for grand, strategic maneuvers that will leave you breathless. Whether you're commanding iconic vessels from the movies or exploring the depths of the Star Wars lore and comics with lesser-known ships and races, the variety and depth of the space combat are simply outstanding.

Furthermore, Empire at War opens up a world of possibilities beyond the vanilla game with its vibrant modding community. Projects like Revenge of Thrawn and Republic at War introduce a plethora of new units that will delight even the most die-hard Star Wars fans. These mods breathe new life into the game, offering fresh experiences and expanding the already vast content available.

While some may argue that the graphics have aged, I assure you that it's a minor concern. In space combat, where the action primarily takes place, the visuals are more than satisfactory. The level of detail on planets is commendable, and it holds its own when compared to modern RTS games. The solid game engine and the immense fun factor quickly overshadow any visual shortcomings.

What sets Empire at War apart from other games in the genre is its accessibility. The learning curve is relatively low, allowing both casual players and hardcore RTS enthusiasts to jump right into the action. As you progress, you'll find yourself devising complex conquest plans on the galactic map, strategizing and conquering with ease.

The game's space combat mechanics are particularly impressive, offering unique features like Hardpoints and Unit Abilities. Targeting specific systems adds a layer of tactical depth, allowing you to disable enemy ships strategically. Unit Abilities provide opportunities to gain the upper hand in combat, adding excitement and variety to each engagement.

I must admit that the base game's ground combat may not be as captivating, with limited units and visually uninteresting elements.

In conclusion, STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack is an exceptional game that immerses you in the vastness of the Star Wars universe. Despite its age, it remains a timeless classic, providing endless hours of entertainment. The space combat alone is worth the investment, and with the addition of mods, the game reaches new heights. If you're a Star Wars fan or an RTS enthusiast looking for an addictive and captivating experience, this game is an absolute must-play.

If you're a casual or hardcore Star Wars fan and dream of commanding your own fleets and channelling your inner-Admiral Thrawn, please pick up this game. 

Its described as an RTS but it ain't as stressful as say Starcraft. You can turn this game into a casual Star Wars power fantasy, or you can recreate the same stress Palpatine had after hearing about the Death Star's destruction. I will say though...space battles are just 10x better than ground battles. Now lets talk mods.

EAW: Remake 4.0 is the most graphically impressive of the bunch. IMO its the most immersive of the significant mods you'll find. The space battles are grandiose and the scale of your ships from star-fighters to dreadnoughts is fantastic. You can even download EAW: Remake 3.5 Revisited if you want the fidelity of 4.0 without the ground battles of 4.0. However, this mod is DEFINITELY easier than the other significant mods. When you get the hang of the game and start bum-rushing planets, your power snowballs in the endgame. By this point, the AI won't not stand a chance against you unless you AFK for while, and even then. 

Thrawn's Revenge fixes this snowball effect with Cruel AI while also providing more complex mechanics. However, the mod trades these things with graphical fidelity. I mean, the mod is still gorgeous but when you play Remake first you kind of miss the textures.

I can't say anything for Awakening of the Rebellion, Fall of the Republic, or Yoden, but I heard those were good mods as well.

Overall, HIGHLY recommend the game.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Ted Morris and his dev team in Petroglyph for taking time to issue the latest update in Nov 2022 for a 2005 game. The update solved my long loading screen problem. Their commitment towards improving the game after all those years is commendable.

Hopefully, Petroglyph will be making SW: Empire at War 2. Please try this game if are a classic Star Wars and RTS fan. You will like it.

May this Game be with you....always.

STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack is an RTS game that allows us to experience the events of the Original Trilogy in space and on planetary surfaces as one of three factions; Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance and Zann Consortium.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Before starting the campaign, we have two modes to choose from; story campaign for each of the factions mentioned above, and the main sanbox mode, allowing us to play freely on many maps, representing different scenarios. Each faction has different gameplay styles, heroes, units, and buildings. We start our campaign on the galactic map, where we decide on the expansion of buildings on our planets, and on the construction of space stations, which allows us to develop the economy, army and navy. The game is not overwhelming and has enough content to enjoy without getting tired, and the main enjoyment are of course the space battles which are truly epic and well done. Battles on planetary surfaces are pretty unimpressive though. The buildings are quite sparse, the units feel wooden and a bit unresponsive, and the maps themselves are quite small. Not to mention that for Star Wars battles, enemy units are often painstaking damage sponges. It could be better, but it's not bad. The gameplay is certainly not revolutionary, however, it is still a lot of fun.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
The game is stable and I haven't had any problems with it. As for the music, it's from the Original Trilogy, so of course it's top notch. However, moving on to the graphics, it's bad by today's standards, the textures either have a strange resolution, poor quality or are just strangely blurry. The visual effects aren't the best either, but at least they're decent, especially in space. And I would like to point out the voice actors who I think are quite meh. For the most part, I feel like they've been mismatched, plus with poor audio reception and transmission, the characters sound pretty weird.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
A very good game that, although not very deep and revolutionary, is a really good source of fun, and I hope there will be more such games based on the Star Wars universe. This is definitely one of those games that respects your time, which is a really rare phenomenon these days.

The game strikes a fantastic balance between ground and space battles, each featuring a unique set of mechanics and units that provide a well-rounded experience. The strategic layer is complex, yet intuitive, allowing you to move your forces across the galaxy and expand your empire.

The graphics, while not state-of-the-art, have aged well, maintaining a nostalgic aesthetic that brings players back to the mid-2000s. The sound design, which incorporates classic Star Wars music and sound effects, truly makes you feel as though you're directing the fate of a galaxy far, far away.

One thing to be aware of is that AI can be quite challenging, even in lower difficulty settings. While this does make for engaging and stimulating gameplay, less experienced players may find this frustrating.

The modding community surrounding this game is incredibly dedicated, and the availability of mods adds tremendous replay value. From total conversions that introduce new eras and factions to smaller mods that enhance the gameplay and graphics, there's no shortage of ways to customize and expand your Empire at War experience.

Solid strategy mechanics, engaging campaigns, and that unmistakable Star Wars charm. Despite showing its age in certain areas, I recommend Empire at War to both Star Wars fans and RTS enthusiasts. It's an experience that every RTS lover should try at least once.

Between the original CD copy, the steam release, and the multitude of excellent community mods I've put an ungodly amount of time into the game and I don't think I'll ever stop playing. This game was released during the peak of Star Wars video games coming out close to Battlefront 2, Republic Commando, and KOTOR 2. While all those games are excellent, to me this is the ultimate Star Wars experience. It captures the scale of the universe like no other game has ever attempted. To be honest, I don't think I'd be a Star Wars fan without it.

The gameplay is asymmetric and each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, and all of them can be staggeringly strong in the right situations. In the best format: galactic conquest you will be fighting in space and on land to control planets in the galaxy. The galactic map aspect feels more like a streamlined 4x game where you build structures and space stations which are used to build troops and research technology. Then you use the fleets and armies you've created to attack an enemy planet in a real time strategy battle. You can only use the units you've actually sent into the system in these battles giving a real sense of place to the entire game. Each faction has their own fully fleshed out single player campaign, but galactic conquest can also be played in multiplayer with 2 players (or 3 if you are using a mod) for a one-of-a-kind experience with friends. Watch Bokoen's Empire at War videos to get a sense of what this will be like. Everyone playing is going to have a fun time with unlikely victories, agonizing losses, and WTF moments. The game has so much soul to it and it's clear the developers poured their love of Star Wars into it. Even the tutorials have a fun little narrative! That's how much care and attention was put into this game.

The modding scene for this game is very active and there are a lot of high profile total conversion mods to bring the game into the clone wars, the post-endor period, and some mods which even remake the game with new mechanics. The amount of graphical fidelity and gameplay enhancements these mods are able to make based on a game from 2006 is truly mind boggling. I'd estimate that half my total time with this game was spent solely on Thrawn's Revenge.

For $20 (or less since old Star Wars games frequently go on sale) there is a monstrous amount of fun to be had here, and it's easy to learn as well. In a climate where game releases are frequently expensive, buggy, and very corporate feeling there's never been a better time to take a look back and try an old classic. If anything in this review has sounded interesting, I think you should at least take a closer look and seriously consider it.

They were developed by genuine Star Wars fans who deeply understand the essence of the Star Wars universe.

There's a few reasons why I have 1000+ hours in this game, two of the main ones being its replayability and it's easy to learn mechanics. I have trouble getting into Real Time Strategy games as their game mechanics are often complicated and hard to get the hang of. Not here. It's extremely easy to get into for people who have never played one before, me included, and you get to command Star Destroyers, AT-ATs, and even the Death Star which is both capable of destroying planets and larger ships in a space battle. Even if you’re new to Star Wars, its dictionary of planets as you invade them and its description of ships, infantry, and vehicles will more than help you learn. Just by playing this game I quickly knew more about Star Wars than many of my friends who got me into it in middle school.

The length you can mod the game is amongst the best I’ve ever seen, right up there with Garry’s Mod and Minecraft. Have you gotten bored of the vanilla campaign? Pick one of the 329 mods in the workshop to turn the game into a new experience. With how easy it is to mod the game, you can even easily tweak mods to fit the experience you want. You can even mix-match mods together if you wanted to, even to the point of basically making your own without any programming or 3D modeling knowledge.

The game was a cult classic from the moment it came out. With an average playtime on Steam per player being 237 hours, 97% positive reviews, and an average of 2,500 players online at all times, it’s needless to say this game is loved to this day despite being 17 years old. Over time, a loyal community revolving around modding formed, to the point where the original developers updated the game a few times between 2019 and 2021. Around that time, the now united community around it had started doing everything from holding tournaments to collaborating with the creators of the most popular mods to help improve them. To this very day, fans of the game pester Disney with a remake as much as they can, and even got in contact with the original developers who said they’d be more than happy to if it got greenlit. 

The game can be laggy sometimes, but that's what happens when you use modern hardware on a game from 2006. With how good the immersion is despite its age, you won't really notice it once you're hooked into a campaign. You can also practice in small spurts by doing just a space battle or just a land battle that ends when one side wins, allowing you to replay it over and over again before you jump into a Galactic Conquest campaign, my favorite aspect of the game, period.

I picked it up years ago as a kid when I got a $20 Steam card for Christmas, and it was on sale for $5, as well as a bunch of other games. From the ease of access to new players, the easy to use modding support, to the huge community that still exists around it, I've never once regretted buying it. The community loves the 17 year old game so much that we've been pestering Disney for a remake for years now, and all of us await that day patiently. You won't regret picking it up during a sale, I guarantee it. You’ll enjoy every minute of it.

I don’t really do reviews on Steam, but I love this game enough to add to that 97% of positive user reviews.

As someone who’s played this game nearly since release, I count myself among them! 

Gameplay wise it’s still a solid experience that certainly stands the test of time, with a unique grand strategy galactic conquest mode that much like Battlefront’s ground to space combat has yet to be replicated. Recently as well multiplayer has been restored back to the game and is fully playable, and is still a blast if you can get people together. With that this game is also host to a very active modding scene, both on Moddb and the Workshop, which has helped keep this game alive all these years, from simple reskins to total overhauls for both canon and legends material. Though I won’t lie and say there are no problems at all with this game; expect crashes, a lot of desync in multiplayer, and not so great AI - plus a lot of the overhaul mods can be confusing to fully grasp with their plethora of core gameplay changes, but it’s not all too terrible so long as you have patience. 

Now to the story! While that in the base game isn’t much to write home about, the DLC (Forces of Corruption) offers in my opinion one of the best Star Wars stories told yet, where you rebuild a once great criminal empire during the final hours of the Empire. It features a new way of play, and while the faction can be overpowered the expansion feels like a breath of fresh air in content and a plot that while connected to the overall story, decides to do something on its own. Sadly however, it seems that the game was almost forgotten about in the greater legends universe, and combined with the fact that there were no further expansions or sequel, the story started and ended here, which is even more of a shame given the cliffhanger ending [spoiler](and even more given its connections to KOTOR)[/spoiler]. 

Overall I would highly recommend grabbing this game, but on sale as $22 (CDN) is wayy too much for a game nearly two decades old. This is a must have for any Star Wars fan or RTS enthusiast!",1685129282,1685129282,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

1) Clone Wars 
2) Thrawn's Revenge 
3) Empire-era mods 
4) (Non-corrupted by Disney) Extended lore mods 
5) etc. etc. etc. 

Heck, there's even a Halo mod for this game! <which wasn't ruined by 343 :(> 

It's truly incredible what these gaming developers were able to do in this game. SPACE AND GROUND COMBAT OVER AN ENTIRE GALAXY!! We're not talking about just any movie goer's planet either; we're talking about obscure planets in the Star Wars franchise as well. 

This game gets an S+++++ (Best RTS game I have EVER played, and I have played A LOT of RTS games!!) 

If you like Star Wars, and you like RTS, this is the game for you! 

Don't even get me started about the campaign because it has incredible G'd Dam' writing for and RTS game. Heck, you should buy this game alone for the campaign and the lore of the Zann Consortium.

Peace is a lie, There is only Passion,
Through Passion I gain Strength,
Through Strength I gain Power,
Through Power I gain Victory,
Through Victory My Chains are Broken,
The Force shall set me free...

There is no Peace There is Anger,
There is no Fear There is power,
There is no Death, There is immortality,
There is no Weakness, There is the Dark Side...

I am the heart of the Darkness,
I know no Fear,
I instill Fear in my Enemy's,
I am the Destroyer of Worlds,
I feel the power of the Dark Side.
I am the fire of hate,

All the Universe bows before me...
I pledge Myself to the Darkness,
I have found True life In the death of the Light,
I know the true Power of the Dark Side,

[h1]Emerge yourself in the Star Wars galaxy![/h1]
Empire at War is an RTS based strategy game where your goal is to take control of either the Empire or the Rebel alliance in order to try and either dominate or free the universe. You can gain control over planets by placing your fleet in their orbit, followed by landing your troops in order to take full control.

If a planet is occupied or already under the control of your enemies then a battle will start: either in space or on the ground.

[b]It's RTS, but not as we know it ;)[/b]
When people mention RTS they often refer to [i]base building games[/i] that usually also involve resource gathering. Although 'Empire' also uses those game mechanics they don't apply during a fight: instead of relying on troop generation you instead rely on [i]reinforcements[/i] which you need to hold back at first in space because you can only have a certain amount of active units on the planet. If you can manage to occupy more so called reinforcement points then this unit cap will increase which will allow you to bring more forces into the fight. 
 
However, if you're on defense then the structures on the planet, like the barracks, will sporadically provide you with new units to command. 

In other words: there is a bit of base building involved, but that only happens outside of battles, then you'll need to decide what structures and troops to build.

[h1]The atmosphere is [i]mind blowing[/i], even today![/h1]
As one could expect from an RTS-type game your troops will say specific lines when you select them and/or give them orders. And to me it never gets old when I ask Darth Vader to use the force to destroy an incoming enemy ground vehicle and he tells me ""All too easy..."". 

But what I appreciate the most is that it gives you a much better impression of the real strength of both the Imperial and Alliance fleets alike. In the movies we get the impression that the Imperial fleet is Star Destroyers only and well.. they don't seem [i]that[/i] tough, do they?  So when you start playing as the Empire you may be a bit disappointed that: no star destroyers yet, but other ships which are also deadly themselves.

And then it happens: you unlock a higher tech tree and can now get a Star Destroyer and omg... you'll realize soon enough where it got that name from ;)  But at that same time you will probably also quickly learn to appreciate all the great achievements the Alliance manages to achieve with the little resources that they have available.

Then there's the story line.. here you follow the path of either the Empire or Alliance as it's plaid out between the original movies. And I [i]really[/i] enjoyed to experience the obvious tension that's building between Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin as the story goes on..   Tarkin almost mocking Vader for his pursue of some space pirates who ""obviously pose no threat to the Empire"" ;)

Of course.. you don't have to play things that way. You can also go for a total free for all where your only goal is to conquer or free the entire galaxy.

All in all I can highly recommend this title, even all the way in 2023. This is a classic.",1684250019,1684250019,True,28,1,0.752527952194213867,0,True,False,False

I do recommend playing the base game a few times just to get the jist of the gameplay and also wrap your head around the galaxy map. It should be quick and after that if you'd like, Go and play many of the amazing mods this game has! I highly recommend: Thrawns Revenge, and Fall of the Republic made by Correy Loses.

You know, many years ago there was a similar game called ""Star Wars - Rebelllion"". Of course it didn't have the swanky graphics but in terms of gameplay.... You see, that game had everything that Empire at War is missing and added a LOT more atmosphere. 
Empire at War is a decent enough RTS game but also weirdly boring, leaving me thinking ""Is that all?"".

The campaigns are alright. Skirmishes are amazing but get repetitive. Galactic Conquest is (imo) the best gamemode by far, as you command your own galactic power without constraints in terms of the galaxy's lore.

90% of this game is played through the mods. The vanilla experience + FOC is a great experience, and despite the graphics holds up alright today. You will however notice small bits of the game that stick out like they shouldn't be there like the fighter size and planets in the background being incredibly tiny due to the game's age.

However, these issues are fixed and remidied by the game's amazing mod community. There are so many mods that bring unique takes, renewed graphics and gameplay and a new perspective on the game which makes playing it over and over again worth it.

In my opinion, this game is 100% worth it from a modern day standpoint. I've sunk many hours into this game, and ill sink many more.

TLDR: Basegame is alright, experience is enhanced tremendously by the expansive mod community the game has. Great game that holds up to this day.",1526231627,1681058978,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Its 2023

No regular computer CPU is like that anymore. 

Now yes they still do exist and heres a small bit of how it works. So the Core count of your CPU is what matters most, most nowdays are multicore, like 4+ cores. youd think the game runs better? no absolutely not. the game engine can really only use two at most and that because of how old the game is, and the tech they had at the time to work with. so if we say... idk that the old dual cores equal per core 10000 for example, and new cpus are 5000 per core. yes 2 x 10k and 4 X 5000 give 20K and both should be equally be capable of running the game, but if your computer can only harness 2 cores you really only get 10000 from that, and your left with half of what the computer is really needing to run the game smoothly. now that just a pisspoor example, its not accurate by any means, but thats how i can explain it and be able to sleep tonight. NOW there are some cpus that are designed to have stronger core ratings, so for those this game might run completely fine, but with a standard run of the mill Cpu that you bought for newer games? no nonono this game will crash and burn or just be frames per minute. its an amazing game and i love it so much but theres just so many issues that someone needs to go and remaster the game badly.

Gameplay and mechanics of all the mods, the love and the commitment to good gaming plus blowing up large star destroyers like a badass and conquering the galaxy? 20/10

the game running on my system? 0/10

Pros:
++ Star Wars license with a lot of vehicles and characters you will recognize
++ Space combat is fun and engaging
+ You can pause the game any time and give commands to your units (mostly, see cons)
++ Extending your territory and improving your planets and army is fun
+ Campaigns are interesting to play and try to follow the original movies plot, you might want to start with the empire one though as it is easier in my opinion

Cons:
-- Land based combat is not good, as your units / army is very limited in the beginning of every mission / planet map and the AI throws endless spawning units at you from the beginning if you are the attacker
- Unit path finding / behavior is not good
- You can pause in galaxy map mode but commanding units from A to B is not possible

However, the mods for this game are insane. EAW remake and Thrawn's Revenge... (Chef's kiss)

If you like Star Wars, this game is for you. Even if you just like Grand Strategy (C'mon Hoi4 players), this game is for you. If you like a really good challenge, God above, you will love this.

However, if you are not the kind of guy whose idea of relaxing is sweating like crazy watching your incredibly expensive Super Star Destroyer get annihilated by pathetic little star-fighters because you did not build corvettes in time, then you probably should skip over this one.

But it's my favorite Star Wars Game... in the world. The mods are made better than most game devs could, the base game is respectable, and all the mods are free and could be considered sequels to this game.

I couldn't stop playing this game back when Windows XP was still supported even back then, this game was simply mindblowing on PC, an RTC on your favorite franchise... Man, those were the days.

When this game was brought into Steam, it was certainly an interesting choice, but it made modding tedious and for the most part, difficult to get mods like Republic At War to work around that period.

But sometime in 2015. Empire at War received one of the best updates most games back then would've never gotten. Multiplayer being completely re-patched, not needing Gamespy anymore, and making the game support the Steam Workshop.

This update alone has brought Empire at War out of its decaying state and became one of the most popular Lucasfilm games to mod, with mods like Thrawn's Revenge and Empire at War Remake, and many more that made Empire at War the amazing RTC game it is today.


If you're going to try this game out, be sure to experience it within the first 2 hours, then install a mod of your liking.

The best parts about it are the capabilities of having both land and space battles in a conquest mode.
Some units, especially in space have health points, which after being destroyed can weaken enemy or your own ships, which is an excellent concept also executed well. This makes larger ships suceptible to targeted attacks making units for any task needed, like fighter screening, bombers and even the basic heavy weaponry.
This with a simple currency system for building buildings and spaceships, increasing pop cap is just the main game. The sheer amount of creative ideas, although it's a relative old game, combined with simple elements makes it competable with the most modern of games.

[list]
    [*] The campain mode is good, galactic conquest is far better.
    [*] Forces of corruption is a complete meme fest.
    [*] It comes with the gold pack for free.
    [*] Its very entertaining seeing everything fight and duke it out.
    [*] Factions are completely broken in their own ways. There isn't a reason behind this, they're all just absurd.
    [*] The Galaxy map looks good.
    [*] Space Battles look good.
    [*] Hero's have just as much plot armor as in the movies.
    [*] Voice Acting is all over the place, 10/10.

Lets go over its [i]short comings[/i]
[list]
    [*] Balancing is a dead act.
    [*] There is no galactic conquest co-op mode.
[/list]

If there was a Galactic Conquest multiplayer mode this game would be better. It's a solid RTS that holds up today and its quite the light show, Mods make the game much better and unique but any RTS fan should pick this up because it is fun and looks amazing.

I suggest getting this game because its fun, its enjoyable, and throughout my childhood and even now I've spent a few thousand hours playing this game when my dad first introduced it to me when he Pirated it. Now i bought it because i love this game, it still holds up even today. It's also still updated because Petroglyph thinks its funny to fix and balance the game randomly.",1317534105,1674055202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

battles can be waged both on the ground and in space, you can build buildings that grant you additional units per planet and usually the AI is doing a decent job at putting up a fight.

theres also a campaign for the rebels and empire, that follows around the time of the construction till the death of the first deathstar and there are plenty of hero units that are tough to kill and can turn the tide of battles - and changin on where they are in the battle they can either be in a vehicle if its space battles or on the ground personally in ground battles

mods that i personally can recommend are:
THRAWNS REVENGE
REPUBLIC AT WAR
ABSOLUTE ENHANCMENT MOD\ABSOLUTE CHAOS MOD

also the game is easily modded, so if you find the unit limits a bit stifening, want to field more units in general or want to have more money, there are tutorials how the bypass and change these- just keep in mind that applies to you and the AI

The modding community for this is one of the best I have ever seen and what they've been able to accomplish is a feat on its own.  But with that this game isn’t all that easy either when ramping up the difficulty whether you are playing a story driven campaign or choosing one of the factions to try and take over the galaxy. You’ll have to manage  your army and your planets to ensure victory. But really this is a Star Wars game so if you like Star Wars with their big battles and lightsabers or love RTS games I would recommend this game.

Star Wars: Empire at War is a real-time strategy (RTS) game developed by Petroglyph Games and published by LucasArts. It was released in 2006 and is set in the Star Wars universe during the time of the Galactic Civil War. The game has gained a high status among RTS fans and is widely regarded as a must-play for fans of the genre.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
In Empire at War, players can choose to control either the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire in a campaign mode or in skirmishes against the AI or other players. The gameplay consists of building and managing bases, producing units and structures, and battling enemies on land and in space. The controls are responsive and intuitive, and the gameplay is fast-paced and enjoyable.

One unique feature of Empire at War is the ability to control space battles. Players can build and customize their own fleets, and then engage in epic space battles against enemy ships. This adds an extra layer of strategy and excitement to the game.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
The story of Empire at War follows the events of the Galactic Civil War, with players choosing to align with either the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire. The story is told through cutscenes and missions, and is faithful to the Star Wars universe. The characters are well-developed and the pacing of the story is well-done, keeping the player engaged throughout the campaign.

[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]
While the graphics of Empire at War are showing their age, they are still impressive for a game that is over 15 years old. The visual style is true to the Star Wars universe and the cutscenes are especially well-done. The sound design is also top-notch, with the music, sound effects, and voice acting all being excellent.

[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]
Empire at War has a high replay value thanks to its campaign mode and skirmish mode, as well as its multiplayer capabilities. There are also unlockable units and structures that can be unlocked through progression, which adds an extra layer of depth to the game.

In addition to the base game, the Forces of Corruption expansion pack adds even more replay value to Empire at War. The expansion adds a new campaign and a third faction, the Zenn Consortium, which allows for even more varied gameplay. It also adds new units, structures, and features, making it feel like almost an entirely new game in and of itself.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Overall, Star Wars: Empire at War is an excellent RTS game that is a must-play for fans of the genre. Its campaign mode, skirmish mode, and multiplayer capabilities give it a high replay value, and the Forces of Corruption expansion pack adds even more content and depth to the game. The sound design is top-notch, and the story is faithful to the Star Wars universe. While the graphics may be showing their age, they are still impressive for a game that is over 15 years old. Overall, Empire at War is a game that any RTS fan should check out.",1637843006,1672601183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Strategic, Learning about Units, Star Wars History etc. Without Modders the Graphics, Updates and more are outdated and the Game would be more likely DEAD, so a BIG Thanks to them. Favourite Mod is Thrawns Revenge from Corey Loses. Still a minus even with modders is the pathfinding + in Space Battels units are turning away without order, so you loose it, firepower. Kind Frustrating.

2 Biggest PRO: 

1st - No Forced to be permanently connected to the Internet.

2nd - Not made by fucking greedy EA. Go fuck yourself!

last but not least: Give it a try and go through the many Mods made and updated by the trustworthy Community.
defently You will find one to your liking.

I highly recommend the thing.

The gameplay is top tier as I've stated, although the Campaigns in Base-Game aren't anything revolutionary in terms of Star Wars stories, but Forces of Corruption shakes it up a bit with the Corruption Mechanics and all the criminal underworld shit. Jabba be damned!

The campaigns are well and good but at the heart of it is Galactic Conquest, where you fight for control of the system and work towards a goal, like stopping the Empire or Building the Deathstar, buuut ummm I usually just play skirmishes so I'm not exactly an expert on it, however that brings me to my favorite part:

Skirmishes!
Skirmishes are essentially isolated single battles you can play against AI or your friends if ya got sum. Its all very tight gameplay wise but certain maps are better than others and I find space battles more enjoyable than land battles generally.

Campaign- in between missions, you are able to build whatever units you like and invade some other planets, so there's no challenge.

On the ground level, you generally need all your troops to be together so they don't get crushed, and there's a variety of enemy types, so your only response is to have one of each soldier type, so there's not really any strategy there. There's also no terrain, so really all you do is send your stack of units towards the enemy, and there's not much strategy involved.

As a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise, I was thrilled to be able to experience the story of the Empire and the Rebel Alliance from a different perspective, as the leader of a criminal organization known as the Zann Consortium.

One of the things I loved most about this game was the depth of strategy and planning that was required to succeed. The game features a robust and complex gameplay system that allows players to manage their resources, build their armies, and plan their attacks in order to conquer their enemies and expand their territory.

The graphics and visuals in the game are stunning, and the attention to detail is impressive. The game's environments and characters are incredibly realistic, and the cutscenes and voice acting are top-notch. I was thoroughly engrossed in the game's story and found myself completely invested in the lives and struggles of the characters.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Star Wars: Empire at War: Force of Corruption to any fans of the Star Wars franchise or strategy games. The game offers hours of engaging gameplay and a thrilling story that will keep players coming back for more. I can't wait to see what the future holds for the Zann Consortium and the Star Wars universe.

Disney's management of Star Wars is questionable (they are garbage imo, or rather EA is garbage since we are talking about games here), but I respect the revival of BFII and EaW multiplayer a lot. If you didn't know, they released a update to fix the broken multiplayer function caused by Gamespy closing about a year ago. A wonderful thing, and they added Steam Workshop which allows easy access to mods which this game is not short of. Previously Moddb was the main site for mods and still is very active. Due to this revival I do have -one small amount of respect for Disney, and I hold Petroyglyph in high regard and sincerely hope they get to make a new ""EaW II"" some day which they have showed interest in.

The game
A extremely fun SW RTS game with no equal. The graphics may not be up to today's standards but the gameplay is as good as ever. Fight battles on land and space. Either in small single-game skirmishes, or in the Galactic Conquest where you fight over the entire (or a part) of the Galaxy with or without other objectives and goals. The game also comes with 3 campaigns: Empire, Rebels and Connsortium. The third only being in FoC, so you can't start the Empire or Rebel compaign in FoC. Likewise you cant start the Connsortium campaign in EaW.  

The units are fun and you can find most of the vehicles and troops found in the original trilogy with other fun additions for a even larger amount of variety, balance and enjoyment. Rebel/Stormtrooper infantry, AT-ATs, AT-STs, Speeders, Hoovercraft, Snow Speeders and of course Hero units. Equiped with unique abilities, enhanced weapons or even lightsabers and the force. How, or if to use these is entirely up to you.

The game is OK... some Galactic map inaccuracies... but the mods... the mods make this game a masterpiece, and I will get some from Corey Loses and Republic at war mod :) ...as soon as I free some space on the PC :)) For now, I will play the normal campaigns of this great RTS.

So... ya I recommend this game, get it on a discount on May the 4th :) if you want... or whenever :) and have a good time :)

I will update this review at a later time :)  technical problems and so on :))

There are 5 major mods that most people will play, those 5 being;
1. Thrawn's Revenge (Post-Endor, Pre-Disney fucking up the EU)
2. Republic at War (Clone Wars)
3. Fall of the Republic (A replacement for RaW ~kinda)
4. Empire at War Remake (Think Thrawn's Revenge but movies 4, 5, 6 with a heavy focus on visuals and graphics)
5. Awakening of the Rebellion (For the people who play the wrong faction)

if you plan on playing a modded Galactic conquest, give up.
If you plan on playing a modded skirmish (or non-modded even), have a good internet connection, and stick to space. Do not play land-control.

Play like a turtle and win. Auto-resolve is not your friend, and mapping WASD back to movement is probably for the best. 
Having the DLC is mandatory, as most mods need it and it allows for auto-casting of abilities.

The campaigns of the base game offer certain tidbits of lore (for example, how the Alliance brought X-wings into their fleets) and the characterization is handled well (Tarkin is appropriately menacing, noting that if half of a force of captured Wookiee slaves is wiped out, ""the survivors will work twice as hard"") but the overall plot is pretty barebones. Galactic Battlegrounds did that part better, although this game was somewhat hindered by the larger scope in that regard. The original music for this game complements the Williams tracks well, and is composed by Frank Klepacki, a legend in the industry whose contributions include the scores of Red Alert 2 and the weird (and underappreciated) Blade Runner game. 

 When building the Death Star, the original marketing for this game from 2006 comes to mind: ""Will you repeat Star Wars history or change it forever?""",1660282328,1668333643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember watching YouTube videos of its vanilla campaign when I was 10-12, and finally started playing in 2019. The modding community is EXCELLENT, especially Corey's team who make Thrawn's Revenge and its spinoffs.

I have played dozens of hours with almost all of the factions in Thrawn's Revenge, and it keeps bringing me back. Can't wait for 3.3!

The base gameplay is fun but the restrictions on the base game when compared to the mods that are possible with the Forces of Corruption DLC make it harder to enjoy when the alternatives are just one click away.

I highly recommend this game to any Star Wars fan (plenty of juicy Legends content in many of the best mods!) and to anyone who enjoys RTS combat that's not heavy on micromanagement. The galactic layer is incredible, and the large-scale conquest and war on multiple fronts styles of gameplay is endlessly engaging.

this game is an example of how a strategy game should be done.it has all the right elements that compliment each other very well.the  game is easy to pickup but hard to get good at.learning what unit counters what and how to put your ships or troops in the right position can be really hard but that what makes it fun! this game is endless fun as there are infinite scenarios due to the modding community.you have mods from every part of the star wars timeline.for a game made in 2006 it is perfect.you can really see that the developers put their work into this to make  it as good as possible so if you have the money to buy it please do.it is reasonably priced and you can play this game for days on end and still have a lot to do.i would like this game to get remastered or remade completely by petroglyph.

The only real annoyance you might find with this product is the ridiculously long Saving and Quitting times, but that's really it!",1660575000,1660575000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

7/10
I love this game so why 7/10? Let me tell you... Corruption!!! Why isn't there some kind of tech or whatever to help control this super annoying feature? Many fan boys have complained about this and yet nothing was ever done. Two: No one is faster than the computer so why can't the player start to move their units on the campaign map in pause or during the start of a battle? I find some times I go from battle to battle to battle to battel without being able to react to anything on the campaign map. Just give me 1/2 a second to move my units. Good Lord! And, this is a big one, multiplayer isn't supported anymore!!!! WTF!?!?

Well, that was my two cents. Oh and don't expect updates with any of Petroglyph or LucasArts' games. Won't ever happen because they don't think they make money from fixing released games. Yet they still sell them and at full price almost ***6 YEARS*** later! humm? Shame on you!!

The games scope is pretty large with the galactic conquest mode, and its skirmish mode can just take you straight into the combat if you don't want to sink in the time for galactic conquest. By far one of the best features is the cinematic camera that the game has built into it, the camera does a pretty good shot of showing you the action of large scale and small scale battles almost as if you where watching it in theaters.

It should go without say that some degree of skill is required for this game, while its not necessary it can give you an edge in a battle even though a fleet of star destroyers could thrash most things thrown at it a good use of star fighters can really cripple said star destroyer fleet. The game does a good job at balancing there's enough ship variety in each faction where simply spamming one ship wont win you the game, on top of that star fighters while small do make a difference in battle having bombers and your enemy being unable to defend against them can really turn around a battle by hitting key sections of a ship such as the engines, hanger and shield generator.

1.) I remember this from when I was a kid. 10/10
2.)Haha, Star Wars! Pew pew. Dun dun dun doo de dun doo de dun. 11/9.
3.) The mods are great! 999/0.01

This game, you want to like it. I know! I'm right there with ya, but it just isn't there. The A.I cheats to a shocking degree. I had my suspicions when the rebels were consistently losing but still had 15 capital ships to throw at me, but when I played the conquest mode on medium and had Chewbacca and Han Solo, plus another Chewbacca and Han Solo, in their attack force, well, that just put a sour taste in my mouth.

The campaign is disgusting in that it pretends to involve choice and strategy but, in the very first mission I tried to play and the enemy is pulling whole armies out of its backside whenever I complete objectives...yeah, no. We aren't doing this, darling.

Finally, just trying to play the game I encounter weird issues in gameplay, with my forces not following my commands, control groups overwriting each other without my input and even going so far as to have the mouse cursor disappear. Not become invisible, outright disappear, forcing me to go to enter and leave the escape menu to resume commanding my forces in this so-called strategy game.

As for mods...I'm just saying here, if they are why you play this game, that's fine...but it isn't the developer's work that made it happen. Some guys, in their spare time, are doing a better job than the developers. That's problematic...

I know, everyone. Star Wars just begs to have a good RTS made out of it, but this isn't it. Avoid it, ignore it, shun it, even put it out of its misery and bury it in a pinewood box out in the desert, but absolutely do not pay money for it.",1652562116,1656261977,False,2,1,0.405516624450683594,0,True,False,False

I want to like it, it tries to do something very cool with a galaxy conquest thing, but unfortunately it makes no sense to actually play the maps in most cases if you wan to efficiently win a campaign. 

Just auto battle everything with the largest stack of units you can make and then remake units and keep auto battling. You could elect to actually manually play the battles, but it would take much longer and even if you get a better kill ratio it doesn't matter, just spam more units. 

Imagine you play an RPG with many tiers of equipment, but at the start there are weapons that will one hit kill anything in the game and you can buy them in any shop.

It is always good to see parts of the Star Wars galaxy that did not appear in the movies, created so vividly like this. The planets and their unique weather and inhabitants create an impression of a vast galaxy that it very difficult to get bored with, and the style the game uses to portray space combat is something I had never seen anything like - an absolute must for any RTS gamer. I originally did not recommend this game because of difficulty trying to progress through the Rebel campaign on medium (the Imperial Fleet is very strong and persistent about where it wants to attack). I later managed to beat the Rebel campaign by winning at the strategic level rather than obsessing over specific results of battles (you can pick which planets to launch offensives on), capturing where the enemy is weak rather than meeting them directly, and trying to cut the Empire's fleets off from reinforcement along hyperspace routes. This way, the Empire's powerful fleets are allowed to win their battles, but they are not decisive victories, and eventually the Rebels can return to finish these fleets off after securing more resources and forces. The Imperial campaign was very easy and there didn't seem to be much to it; their forces are just more durable and just positioning a small fleet in a good formation seems to usually result in the Rebels all dying, provided the enemy hangar is also sniped by missile cruisers to deny them reinforcements. I never figured out the planet-based ion cannon option for the Rebels to stun enemy ships and only noticed they could do this when I was playing as the Empire, so this may be part of why I struggled as the Rebels.",1653515279,1655243595,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

I have played this since release before I ever had it on steam. Loved it so much when I saw it on steam it was an instant buy. This game is amazing. The campaign's story is actually fun. Ships and characters are depicted beautifully. And even after the hours upon hours of campaign/skirmish/galactic conquest play it still gets better! Now that its on steam workshop its easier than ever before to mod. Just click and its there. Also till this day there are still fresh new and updated mods!

First, while it may look old and maybe even boring, this game is a joy to play with the large modding community. Second, I would recommend that you play the base game first so you get a hang of it before trying mods. The mods are what make the game so interesting in today's modern ""great graphics"" society. Finally, one warning before you get it, its going to be hard at first. When I first started it felt almost like a waste of money because there will be times where you go ""damn, this is kinda hard"". I mean, it is a strategy game. Then when you realize that your fighting a 16 year-old AI, you feel dumb. That's why they have skirmish. You have to use. learn what combinations work and which don't. how to overpower capital ships with small ships. Its a part of the game that you need in order to progress.
