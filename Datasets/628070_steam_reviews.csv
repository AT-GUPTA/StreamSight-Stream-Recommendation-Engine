Instructions unclear, menus a maze,
Leaving players dazed in a bewildered haze.

With every release, they leave us perplexed,
Lost in a sea of gibberish, utterly vexed.
English? Oh, that's just a foreign notion,
Koei prefers to create their own language potion.

But fear not, dear fanbase, for you shine,
With your dedication, oh so divine.
Blessed are the fans who take the lead,
Fixing Koei's mess, filling the translation need.

So here's to Koei, the masters of confusion,
Throwing players into a state of disillusion.
Their lack of English, a comedic goldmine,
Prompting us to question if they even tried

Roses may be red, violets may be blue,
As for Koei's translation? A joke, it's true.
But thanks to the fans, with their sharp wit and grace,
We find laughter amidst Koei's disgrace.

PS. Dear Koei, this thumbs up is meant for the players who've done YOUR job by releasing an unofficial translation patch.

[u][i]''Do the unexpected, attack the unprepared'' [/i][/u]

Arguably the best Koei Grand Strategy.

XI is my favourite Romance of the Three Kingdoms by far. The music the art style and the gameplay are just so good.

I am disappointed in Koei not releasing all the ROTTK on Steam in English as I would have bought them all, I would have even paid a premiuim for XI with a full translation.

Now I have the DVD release from 2008 in English but the PUK was never released to the West. I understand that but neglecting the Western fans is really sad. I really believe Koei need to lean into their Western audience more like Sega did. Not only did Sega release Yakuza to PC all in English translation. Subtitles only we dont like Dubs. They even made Total War:Three Kingdoms which as a Three Kingdoms lover I also loved and play that often too.

Using Terror of Deaths translation patch and removing the modded files I have now got this running the base game near enough perfectly. There are some translation issues but I will get over it. 

I'm happy to be playing XI again.

I am very much looking forward to the VIII update that is coming next year and Dynasty Warriors 10 which is rumoured to be late '24. Come one Koei don't mess these two up. Lets get back to winning ways

个人认为，三国11是最佳战棋策略游戏，没有之一。原因如下：

1. 策略游戏要深。
它的系统要博大，让你以自己的方式学习系统，形成你的策略，从而获得胜利。而不是一眼看穿。机制层面应该有多层多领域相互影响。三11集全局策略，区域策略，遭遇战策略，外交策略，经济策略，等等，形成了一个庞大的系统，你可以在每个层面有自己的战术，而后再转化成另一层面战略优势。不同时期，不同层面，视角不同，战术战略都不同。既要有大局观，又要有局部战术。金角银边草包肚皮，围棋精髓亦有体现。放弃中原城池，让群雄互掐抢鹿，若刘备入蜀，此等大局发展观，颇有身在茅庐指点天下之感。层层叠叠，不一而足。

2. 系统机制要直。
系统深奥并不代表系统难懂。恰恰相反，系统和机制应该简单明了让人容易理解。P社游戏往往深是深了，但是太绕不易理解。三11机制和奖惩反馈简单易懂。每个机制的组成部分都简单，而合成的整体系统相对复杂。让人容易上手，又有深度可挖。是为佳作。

3. 策略游戏要难。
策略爱好者皆善思者也。没挑战，无斗志。不历风雨，不叹彩虹。苦尽之甘才是最甜。三11常常在局部会发生很多艰难的挑战，即使区域占优，往往也有更小层面艰辛挑战。局部胜利之后，又有区域困境让人眉头紧锁。区域危机解除，大局可能又颇不如意。挑战无处不在。

4. 策略系统要变。
一成不变的系统很快会被人琢磨透，而动态调整的系统时刻跟着态势变化，才会造成更多的挑战。三足鼎立闷声发大财深挖洞广积粮缓称王，古人诚不我欺。三11淋漓尽致。

5. 策略游戏要爽。
太难光受虐不是乐趣。太简单很快也会索然无味。当你形成自己的策略，克服重重困难，最终取得胜利之时，才会心怀大畅。三11这点上非常优秀：当你对系统理解之后，千奇百怪花式虐电脑，俨然武侯再世孙武复生。堵门堵口，晕人推火，落石投石，周旋断粮，万人烧，诸多战术，只有想不到，没有做不到。让人觉得，我的胜利是由我的英明决定而获得的。此一哲学，方策略游戏之精华。

6. 策略游戏要乐。
什么？马腾大军压境，已经进入谷口，兵锋之强远非我等小城可守？
什么？董卓也来了？
什么？马腾董卓先打了起来？
什么？刘璋大军也从栈道偷袭而来？谷口竟然可以修阵？对，给我轮番修阵，我军饿了回城吃饭，刘军饿了……给他们闻闻饭香。

7. 策略游戏要美。水墨画风，琴声悠悠，美轮美奂，无出其右。",1642886126,1642886328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Have been playing for 10 years. I hope 14 can combine the 1 on 1 for both fight and discussion. But make it more complicated. For example, in 1 on 1 fight, I only use attack in super level because the other 2 won’t help you win especially if your have lower ability of attack.  But I suggest that if if you keep defending, there should have a system of fight back in defence. For example, if both of us have similar attack ability, the higher one will have the first hand which means if we both choose attack, he will get first attack in first turn 100% and have higher ratio to attack in the next. So I should choose defense and wait for the good timing. If my opponent is out of “PATIENT”, I can fight back in Defence position without losing too much blood but I can give a big big deal. Therefore, he should choose the fight spirits to avoid being out of patient and use heavy attack more quickly. If he choose the fight spirit, then it’s my turn to attack. And due to he can have more chance to attack if we both choose, he will switch back to it again. Meanwhile, attack get least fight spirit, then defense get more.  And the fight spirit gets most. And for the 1 on 1 discussion, I think you should remove the fury just keep calm. And add a super level for each class, story, reason, and trans. The super level can conquer sophistry but still be defeated by roar. I really hope you guys can add this into 14. I am a loyal 3 kingdoms player of this company but it looks like you are getting worse. And that’s why I am still play 11. My promotions of this system is not complex, if you have any concern, I am really willing provide my idea. I have a bunch of ideas but I think this is 1 on 1 system what I most eager to see in 14, or 15, if you want to create a whole new one.",1594863284,1594863284,True,5,1,0.541375160217285156,0,True,False,False

until I figured out that I could not save the game, which is really fatal for a strategy game. 

When I restarted the game, I also found out that all my Final Battle Mode processes are gone! 

I hope that KT would release an update to fix these problems. That's why I would say ""not recommended"". 

I really love this game, but this steam version just seems not working at all. It's a shame. 

For those of you who would like to try, at least wait till this damn save bug is fixed.

== March Update ==

Okay, ROTK 11 PK has updated the Traditional Chinese version in late Feb, 2018, I guess, 

and to my greatest surprise, the save bug is fixed in Traditional Chinese version!! 

I am not an IT expert so I don't know why, but anyway the game runs normally in TC, not JP. 

Now I can save my game, so I am gonna recommend it, 

but I still think that an English version would please more gamers all over the world. 

PS // Running the game in JAPANESE seems to be the problem of the save bug, 

so maybe you can try some English patch for the game that had been made. 

I don't know if they have any, since I am a Korean user who has only tried a Korean patch(which worked).",1516530582,1521291457,True,8,0,0.624286770820617676,8,True,False,False
628070,40661394,76561198020047624,0,7,340,0,57,1595703484,"The following is the amateur fan-review of the game I wrote ten+ years ago, edited for this re-release.

Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI (San Guo Zhi 11) is Koei's eleventh installment in its long-running historical simulation turn-based strategy games. Combining a revamped graphics engine and new tactical gameplay, San Guo 11 is by far the best in the series. 

Set in historical China, the game follows the epic story of the Three Kingdoms era. Players can choose to conquer China from the perspectives of various warlords, play specific scenarios and famous historical battles, or even create their own generals and officers to introduce into the dramatic saga. If you've played any of these games before, however, you'll know that those features are pretty much staples of the San Guo series. What sets San Guo 11 apart from its predecessors is its stylized graphics engine, and the introduction of new units, tactics, and general strategy. Add that to streamlined gameplay and engaging tactical battles, and Koei has really created the best San Guo game in a decade.

Like its predecessors, San Guo 11 has gameplay that is basically separated into two parts: managing one's cities and managing battlefields. City Management this time around is now much more similar to Age of Empires, where specific buildings need to be constructed in order to provide cities with various resources. For example, markets are needed to provide cities with income, while farms are needed to supply food and rations. Build a barracks to recruit troops, build a blacksmith to forge various weapons, and build a shipyard to allow for sea travel. This new take on city management is much more appealing than in the previous versions of the game, where you basically assigned officers to improve ""invisible"" aspects of each city. Amidst all the construction, you also have to take into consideration the level of unrest in your city, train your troops, and manage your officers' loyalty. All these factors really force you to plan out your strategy for defeating enemies - Are you going to spend that last reserve of gold for more troops? Or will you spend it on building more markets to increase income in the future?

In terms of combat, San Guo's turn-based battles have been hit and miss in the past. 11 is definitely a hit. There are three main types of troops you can deploy, who share a rock-paper-scissors relationship. Spearmen defeat Cavalry, while Cavalry defeat Axemen, and Axemen defeat Spearmen. Further, there are various other units including archers, battering rams, trebuchets, all of which have their own set of unique tactics that can be used on the battlefield. Not only that, but each unit type can eventually be upgraded to have even more abilities. For example, Cavalry can be upgraded to be able to equip bows, making for a deadly combination of speed and range. Spearmen can learn to steal enemy rations when attacking, decreasing morale. Add to that the option of using subterfuge and the ability to have your generals duke it out in one-on-one duels, this game is littered with strategic options and depth. Well planned out manuevers are extremely satisfying, as you watch your forces push back significantly larger armies with special tactics and carefully positioned strikes.

The series' greatest weakness has always been its graphics, but San Guo 11 has broken through the stereotype by having a very appealing and stylized presentation. The interface is easily accessible and appropriately themed. Further, the game uses a cel-shaded graphics engine that manages to suit the atmosphere very well. The battles are suitably awe-inspiring as you watch hundreds of little cavalry and spearman units charging at each other. Duels and Debates in the game are similarly impressive stylistically. Rather than the static sprites or bland art from the previous series, San Guo 11 opted to flesh out its cel-designs to have detailed armor and animations for these specific battles. The end result is impressive and cinematic for its time.

Sound is standard. The music is fitting, with sweeping orchestral melodies during times of peace that switch to pounding and tense drums during war. As the player conquers more and more of China, the overland tune becomes more and more dramatic and invigorating.

The main core of the story is taken from the actual San Guo novels, but the execution here is very well done. Each scenario is preceded by a nice cinematic, and players have the option of watching actual events in the novels unfold during gameplay. Stand back and watch as the tyrannical Dong Zhuo is betrayed by his most powerful general, the insidious Lu Bu. Watch as the blood-brothers Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei court the most revered of tacticians, Zhuge Liang. Regardless of which warlord you play as, events unfold as you begin to establish a major foothold in China. Choose to either support the last of the Han Dynasty, or to crush it and establish a new empire of your own. Form alliances with like-minded warlords, or break them to seize new territory. However you choose to conquer China - As the people's liberator or the merciless dictator - your name will be forever etched in the minds of all its citizens.

San Guo 11 exceeded my expectations for the series by a huge leap. Its one weakness is inherent to all San Guo games - the length. It takes a long time to conquer China, and if you don't have the patience to sit down and spend a good chunk of your life to do it, you probably shouldn't waste your time trying. This is not for the casual player. But for those of you who enjoy deep and engrossing tactical gameplay, I can not recommend this enough to you.",1520534211,1520534211,True,6,0,0.559106647968292236,0,True,False,False
