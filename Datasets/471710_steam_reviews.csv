I think this game is overlooked by some people but if you spend some time inside you it becomes a real Gem.
I notice on vrlfg website that there are more players online around the clock than most multiplayer VR games.
It has been under continous development improving more and more every month.
When you first start the game there is a computer where you can add all your steam friends.
With your wrist watch you can easily change games servers, invite friends etc.
My favorites: Paintball, Jumbotron Quest and Lounge room.
Rise of the Jumbotron Quest: The asthetics of lighting color and sound are the best of any vr game I have seen. It is challenging, but I did beat it 3 times ðŸ˜Š
Paintball: Endless fun. Lounge room: So fun with friends, tell jokes on stage, draw things with the 3d marker, play cards whatever best for private gatherings.

This is the reason why Rec Room should add warning of segregation on the dorm room just like sexual harassment. Additionally, it's not easy to kick them with the voting system.
One of my japanese friend did stop playing Rec Room because these kinds of problems.

The makers of this game just seem to get VR and keep making silly fun VR content.

The new co-op quest mode is by far the most fun Iâ€™ve had on the VR yet. It provides my need for co-op content and skill based shooter in one very fun game mode. 

And thatâ€™s just one mode! If you want more PvP then the bunch of fun skill based games they have can provide you with a very fun and active VR gaming experience.  If you want casual fun then they have that to!

Cheers guys!

Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to ""tell 'em coach sent ya"". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.

Meeting cool people in VR (But also having the option to turn off your and others voices)

Dodgeball is also really good
Graphics are pleazing
3D charades is a nice social game (You have to talk to play it)
Paddle Ball is a fun, quick game
Also you can film INSIDE THE GAME
Shield soccer is also pretty fun
Don't forget you can play basketball, ping pong. and MORE in the lobby!
you can also play cards with people IN VR?!?
