- I believe that in a game at this level, there should be serious weather conditions. Rain, snowstorms should occur and affect the experience.

- Everywhere is too clean; there should be dusty roads and paths.

- Some cities, like Germany, France, Spain, should be designed much larger, with more detailed roads and paths on those maps. For example, we should be able to get stuck in narrow streets.",1708788271,1708788271,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like to turn the volume down in game and listen to my Sturgill Simpson playlist on Spotify (Sound & Fury is the best album for trucking). It is a relaxing game that you can let your mind wander to or even passively meditate to.

I am playing this simulator since early 2019, and I've been driving almost every night ever since! I find it very relaxing! On the Mac (macOS 10.12 Sierra) there is the unescapable limitation of being forced to use OpenGL as graphic engine, which – compared to DX on Windows OS –  is quite limitating and slower, but all in all the Sim is fascinating and keeps its incredible grace and beauty thanks to the developers who never stopped working (hence releasing updates) even for a single week!!
Definitely recommended to almost everyone who likes driving in the most relaxed way!
Happy trucking! :)

I had just finished a 500 mile stretch and really felt like I had a full bladder. So I stopped at a TA and went to take a piss. Well when I walk into the bathroom every urinal is full, and the middle one is taken by an ultimate chad, 6'4, jawline could cut glass. This dude was pissing so hard it probably left a groove in the back of the urinal. Like you could hear the piss bouncing off of the urinal hard as fuck. And it was a steady steam. Usually I wouldn't piss in a urinal because my bladder is beta as fuck and doesn't like to pee unless I have privacy, but I had to piss so bad that as soon as one opened I went for it. I knew of course that I was going to piss mog everyone in there because my bladder was full and I can probably keep a soft stream for a minute and a half with a full bladder (something I pride myself on). Of course the urinal that opened was right next to chad. So at least I was happy that since he had been pissing for at least 30 seconds since I walked in there to the time that the urinal next to him was clear, that I would be able to piss mog the shit out of him. Well I unzip and try my hardest to start peeing, but my beta bladder only let out like three embarrassing spurts. I could tell he kinda looked at me too, like, having trouble there bud? So I held my breath cause I know that helps jump start a shy bladder. Well my face was red as fuck cause I was straining so hard to pee and holding my breath. I was literally seeing spots. Then my beta fucking lower intestine lets out a queef sounding fart cause I'm straining so hard. I swear Chad almost chuckled before letting out the longest, deepest sounding fart I'd ever heard. So not bad enough to piss mog me, he has to fart mog me too. All the while without a single break in the hardest pressured stream I've ever heard. For at least a minute so far since I'd walked in. Finally I get my stream started and it's slow as fuck cause I'm straining so hard just to pee. So I'm like okay, this dudes been pissing hard enough to cut concrete for a minute straight, no way he's gonna piss longer than me. This fucking ultimate Chad continues pissing hard enough to spray civil rights protesters for another minute after that, while I pitifully spurt out beta puffs of clear piss. I'm sure his was a nuclear orange color from STDs, liquor, and testosterone. So this man CNC water jet cuts into this urinal for 2 minutes straight that I witnessed, not counting however long he was pissing before I walked in there, while im spurt spurting clear piss that barely reaches the lip of the urinal. Meanwhile he has a complete unbroken stream even with a ripping alpha baritone fart. Then, I shit you not, this motherfucker proceeds to sneeze. Without. Breaking. Stream. I literally did not know that was possibly. But this man sneezes and doesn't break stream. I'm pretty sure he kept his eyes open while he sneezed too, but I couldn't tell because his hunter eyes were already such small slits with no visible upper eyelid. Then, I'm like well I have at least 30-45 seconds of solid stream left. I'm literally counting down the seconds. Feeling my bladder get lower and lower, and In the silent room all I can hear is the sound of a rushing dam of water slamming against his urinal. There's literally a line forming to the urinals, everyone else that was pissing had already cycled out and washed hands and left, it's just me and Chad and 4 new guys pissing, and I'm praying the whole time like please God this man was pissing before I even walked in here please don't make me run out before him. Well of course I run out and zip up in shame as he continues to Bull Connor the fuck out of that urinal like it was a black man in the 60s. Then I shamefully turn to wash my hands as another beta rushes into my spot at the urinal. Literally not even any of the fresh pissers were peeing as hard as chad. And the bathroom had a full size mirror above the sinks, and Chad with his fucking hunter eyes and grin is knowingly staring into my soul through the mirror while I wash my hands. So I can't really make eye contact with myself either in a mirror, so I just intensely focused on my hands while I washed them. Then I start the blow dryer, and meanwhile 4 guys have cycled in and out of the urinals and Chad is still pissing. I swear to god I could hear that fire hose stream over the blow dryer. And it wasn't a normal dryer, it was one of those jet ones that puts a dent in your skin while you use it. I shamefully walked out with my head down and as the door swung shut I could still hear him pissing. I walked around and got a drink, some ibuprofen (high blood pressure from straining to piss give me a headache) and put diesel on the pump. This dude finally walks out of the bathroom, hands dry and long sleeves still down (no need to wash hands when you're chad), as I'm leaving the store. Then this dude proceeds to the trucker section if the truck stop and climbs into the biggest meanest looking peterbuilt I've ever seen, pulling doubles, and back the doubles up into a tight parking spot without even getting out to look . Meanwhile I'm pulling a tiny little automatic semi with a short trailer and I was too scared to try and fit into a parking spot so I just drove until I found a rest area that had a pull through open. Fucking Chad absolutely humiliated me at the only thing I'm good at and I can't forget about it.",1708403112,1708403112,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The DLC ""Heart of Russia"" has been announced 3 years ago, but the dev team of this game is definitely mixing gaming and politics, and removing all questions related to when the developm of this DLC will finally stopped being ignored.

They announce many new regions since then, and when we question why those new regions (Nordic being the latest announcement, despite Scandinavia DLC being already out and purchased) get worked on when old awaited ones are frozen, the question gets deleted from the forum.

UPDATE: Got banned from their forum for a month as I wrote in forum that I don't want to hear about political reasons as an excuse for ""Heart of Russia"" expansion not being worked on (was announced 3 years ago, and other DLCs are worked on, released since). Justification of the ban : ""Political baiting"" when i was specifically mentioning myself that I don't want to see political baiting used as an excuse..

I have pver 20 DLCs for this game already, over 2000 games on Steam platform, and it makes me regret I send my money to peoples who mix politics and gaming.

You can take it as serious or as chill as you want. With mods you can fully customise anything you want about the game, from visuals, to maps, to truck specs, to fully custom vehicles and game-play. There is a massive community of people who constantly improve and increase the mods library with any mod you can think of, or you can find mods online (although those aren't updated for newer versions as often and sometimes not at all). Works beautifully on modern and relatively old machines with and without mods. I personally always have at least 50 active and are able to run it on both my pc and laptop. I have played on keyboard and mouse and with a sim setup, and both are amazing (although a wheel and pedals are recommended for the best experience). Friends who I have recommended it too also love this game. Only issue is that sometimes on certain parts of the map the game crashes, however I am 99% certain it's due to a faulty mod. Loading times do also increase with the addition of mods, especially physics and visual ones. But the game is generally very stable.

Also there's updates and new region DLCs which expand the map even further. Awesome game if you are a fan of simulations.

I had seen it advertised often enough and figured ""trucks are cool, I may as well give it a shot, what can go wrong for 5$"". I had no idea the extent this and ATS would have me enamoured to. 

Now, with over 1k hours in each game I can safely say this has effectively taken a prime spot in my gaming hobby. SCS is one of those game companies in the minority of which you can trust to do what they can for the game, not their pocket book. From the shout out to old school simming on the baseline in-game tires company called ""Dynamix"", to the daunting live representation of a living breathing world which they constantly innovate and keep current, you can see their commitment to this games integrity.

I know many people that play with a full sim setup with an H-shifter, steering wheel, multiple screens etc. But I can play casually with a controller and still have the realistic trucking experience just as easily. I won't go too in detail about the workings of the game, but if you like semi trucks in any way shape or form, this game and/or it's sister American Truck Sim are for you. Have enjoyed 4+ years of watching this game develop and participating in the various live in-game events they do for holidays and new DLC. Looking forward to more realistic features they have been experimenting with as well, such as the possibility of adding a fully seasonal celestial cycle complete with the appropriate weather simulation.

Your driver is a picture
You have no visible hands
You can never leave the cabin
You need to sleep, but not eat
Your company drivers are pictures
You can not put your company name on your trucks
And you never see your company trucks on the road
You can not hire who you like when you like, as the driver pool rotate
You can not buy what you want when you want, as it is level locked
All the trucks are old. Even the ""new"" trucks are NOS (new old stock)
You can not drive a rigid, dump, box car or pick up trucks
There are no exhaust smoke, visible damage or dirt
You ALWAYS get stopped at customs
The GPS is in dire need of updating
The economy is broken
Weight limits are broken
Physics are very broken
The AI is severely broken and the list goes on and on and on.

The game is in many ways a joke, but it does have some redeeming features, so the negativity is actually for the greedy developers that really are a joke and not the game itself.

The base game is as bare bones as possible so they can sell a DLC for every little thing, such as a flag in your window, a paint job, new tires, complete Steam achievements and of course a new map. 

ETS 2 have 4 complete and 2 partial countries out of the 44 that is Europe in the base game.
The rest is only available if you give them your credit card.
ATS only have 3 of the 50 states and every DLC for a state / country cost more than the game
It does not help that there are over 100 of them available for both games, and every time they get less content and worse quality.
Or when the Ukraine war started they heavily promoted the Ukrainian skin pack, and put the Heart of Russia DLC that was scheduled to come on indefinite hold.
It does not help that there are no real life brands in the game to avoid paying for copyrights, but there are real life advertisements, since SCS get paid to put them in either.
Or that every state / country are made from the same copy / pasted roads, buildings and scenery, rearranged to look more similar to what ever place they are making, with some newly made street signs and a couple of non copyrighted landmarks before they call it a day
Or that the most famous landmarks such as the Eiffel tower are missing.

""Those landmarks are not included by design. It was a hard decision, made as a result of due to discussing that case in details in past, especially while creating previous DLC Vive La France, where as you may notice, there is Eiffel Tower not included.
As the game includes ""Truck"" in the name, we made the decision, to show the city from truck driver perspective. Trucks are not allowed to enter city centers, and mentioned landmarks are neither super high nor located on the hills, to be visible from industrial areas. So that they are not visible in the game."" piotr  [developer] Posted: 6 Dec, 2017

If that is true, why is it only copyrighted landmarks that are not included ?

SCS is NOT a small indie company either as some like you to believe. 
They have 400 employees and had over 50 million USD in assets and 13 million USD in net income in 2019.
They are just another greedy company that even EA would be proud of.


However 

Even though it is not a simulator, you can drive for hours upon hours without interruptions.
That part is absolutely superb.
It also serves as a good base for mods, and there are a lot of insanely talented mod makers out there making it a great driving game instead of some mediocre money grabbing machine.

I don't care about cars or trucks and have no interest in anything related to them. Yet somehow I am absolutely drawn to playing this game.

What's do I like about it? Endless driving on the European highways exploring the country. Somehow it is extremely cathartic and relaxing to zone out and drive while listening to the radio. The way it can be a super chill out game took my completely by surprise. The convoy multiplayer system only adds more fun to the game as I drive down the highways with my friend.

The only knock I have with it is the UK is amusingly tiny and not that fun to drive around on. However, I had read and seen many times that the devs do have plans to rework the UK.

I like trucking and I like to truck

If you don't like trucking, tough luck!

On the road, you must be brave and tireless
On the road, you can listen to the wireless
On the road, you eat café food with pride
You can throw it up outside

The greatest kick in trucking comes from knocking down a biker
Or swinging off a roundabout and picking up a hiker
You're chatting up that piece of skirt who's sitting by your side
Then pop the crucial question - a ride for a ride?

I like trucking, I like trucking
I like trucking and I like to truck
I like trucking, I like trucking
If you don't likе trucking, tough luck!

Perhaps the greatеst laugh of all, that makes this life worthwhile
Is waving on the car behind, giving him a smile
With glasses and with gratitude, he revs his little load
And meets another trucking truck, a-trucking down the road

On the road, you must be tough and ruthless
And the rumours that we're gay are truthless
On the road, you can wear your shirtsleeves rolled
You eat chocolate when it's cold

From behind, we like to sneak up on you from behind
Never mind, if you hit 'em, never mind

We like trucking, we like trucking
We like trucking and we like to truck
We like trucking, we like trucking
If you don't like trucking, tough luck!

Yeah the graphics aren't the best especially in certain areas and  they are a little dated. But don't get me wrong that are not bad what so ever and have held up pretty well for how old this game is. This is a game that is for those who truly love a realistic driving experience and just have a passion for driving in general, It is so soothing and relaxing that if your tired and not careful you might fall asleep XD. But this game truly is one of th best of all time and is a game to give you needed breaks from other games. Finally there is also multiplayer to so you can convoy with your friends and it is truly a blast. There is also tons of mods and things to explore dlc wise. the base game comes with a fair amount of road and area already but i highly do suggest atleast getting the going east pack with the game if you want to explore longer routes and new regions. SCS really is a company that has listend to it's fans and makes a good quality game. I love listening to my music while driving if im not convoying with friends. I rate this a 10/10 game.

Розроблена SCS Software, гра привертає увагу своїм унікальним підходом до симуляції вантажівочного транспорту та дозволяє гравцеві відчути атмосферу дорожнього перевезення в Європі.

Однією з ключових переваг гри є реалістична фізика руху та величезна кількість деталей відтворених вантажівок і доріг. Водіння великих тягачів по реальних європейських містах та трасах надає відчуття справжньої професійної діяльності водія вантажівки. Відмінною особливістю є можливість вибору різних моделей вантажівок та їх налаштувань, що робить гру ще більш персоналізованою.

Гра також вражає своєю величезною кількістю доступних місій та завдань, які охоплюють різноманітні аспекти вантажоперевезень: від міських доставок до міжнародних перевезень великого вантажу. Це додає грі різноманітності та стимулює гравця до розвитку свого власного транспортного бізнесу.

Невід'ємною частиною ""Euro Truck Simulator 2"" є реалістична графіка та деталізовані міські пейзажі, які надають гравцеві враження від подорожі по різноманітним європейським локаціям. Режим віртуального реалізму, включаючи відобразження погоди та циклічність дня і ночі, створює ще більше іммерсії.

Однак, можливо, деяким гравцям може здатися, що в грі трошки монотонно, особливо на початкових етапах розвитку кар'єри водія. Тим не менше, для шанувальників симуляторів та тих, хто цінує відчуття великої відстані та відповідальності, ""Euro Truck Simulator 2"" стане захоплюючим віртуальним водійським досвідом.",1584442985,1706645938,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But then the devs do things that makes me not wanting to support them.

Like not adding half of northern Europe (but every other part is important).
Show importance each October with pink trucks.
But completely ignores November (prostate cancer is more common and at least equally important if you have to push that stuff in a game).

Getting banned for pointing out things.
Them changing the reason for the ban, implying things that never happened to make it sound more reasonable.

All in all, there's more reasons for me to not recommend the game.

EDIT;
Now they're adding the rest of the Nordic countries, in yet another DLC.
This means, to drive from northern Norway to Finland (regular transports irl), you have to buy 3 different DLC's. They really aren't making me want to change my opinion.",1679623258,1706619420,False,1,0,0.527559041976928711,10,True,False,False

Well, after several years they still haven't done anything to increase the maximum of 8 players. Not only that, but the convoy session system is a complete joke, both the sessions created with the game and the dedicated server sessions. They have not fixed the known bugs in the game, such as the fact that you can join a WOT route with your own trailer without hooking it up and being in a distant city, which forces everyone to cancel the route, or that you go to the workshop and have to leave the repair area and re-enter so that the checkpoint in the mechanic's menu is activated, or that you can configure a truck at the dealership without having spaces to buy it and that it does not tell you at least one warning when starting the purchase configuration, etc Instead of fixing what's important, they start making paid DLCs for people to buy. They are losing players because of that, they are working on things to get people to spend money on the game and they are kicking out all the players.

As an avid fan of simulation games, I found ETS2 to be a captivating blend of realism, meticulous attention to detail, and a surprisingly therapeutic gaming experience.

One of the standout features of ETS2 is its meticulously crafted world. The game recreates the European landscape with remarkable accuracy, showcasing iconic landmarks, diverse cities, and picturesque countryside. From the bustling streets of Paris to the serene landscapes of Scandinavia, each location feels unique and adds a layer of authenticity to the overall gaming experience. The attention to detail is commendable, making every journey a visual delight.

The driving mechanics in ETS2 are both realistic and accessible. The weight and handling of the trucks are accurately simulated, providing a satisfying sense of control for those seeking a true-to-life experience. However, the game also caters to players of varying skill levels, offering adjustable difficulty settings and customizable controls. This balance makes ETS2 accessible to both simulation enthusiasts and casual gamers looking for a relaxing experience.

One of the game's strengths is its economic simulation aspect. Starting with a small trucking company, players must manage finances, expand their fleet, and take on various jobs to turn a profit. The strategic decision-making involved in choosing routes, managing fuel costs, and upgrading vehicles adds a layer of complexity that keeps the gameplay engaging and rewarding.

ETS2 also boasts a vibrant modding community that continually enhances the game's content. From additional truck models to realistic weather mods, the community contributions extend the longevity and replayability of the game, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences.

The sound design in ETS2 deserves special mention. The engine sounds, ambient noises, and radio stations contribute to the immersive atmosphere, enhancing the sense of actually being on the road. The radio stations, featuring a diverse range of music genres and entertaining discussions, add a touch of realism and provide a welcome companion during long drives.

While ETS2 excels in many areas, it's not without its minor flaws. The AI of other vehicles on the road can occasionally be erratic, and the absence of real-time traffic updates might seem like a missed opportunity. However, these issues are minor in comparison to the overall excellence of the game.

In conclusion, European Truck Simulator 2 is a triumph in the simulation genre. Its attention to detail, realistic gameplay mechanics, and the sheer joy of exploring Europe behind the wheel of a truck make it a must-play for fans of simulation games. Whether you're a truck enthusiast or someone looking for a unique and relaxing gaming experience, ETS2 delivers an unforgettable journey across the beautiful landscapes of Europe.",1706220998,1706220998,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game provides a realistic and immersive trucking experience, allowing players to navigate the vast landscapes of Europe while hauling cargo across different cities. The realistic physics and detailed environments make it feel as if you're actually behind the wheel of a big rig.

One of the most impressive aspects of Euro Truck Simulator 2 is its sheer size and scope. The game covers a vast area of Europe, with over 60 cities to explore. The developers have put a lot of effort into making each location feel unique and authentic, from the bustling streets of London to the quaint villages of the countryside.

In addition to the main game, Euro Truck Simulator 2 has a large number of downloadable content (DLC) expansions. These expansions add new maps, trucks, cargo types, and other features to the game. This means that there is always something new to explore and experience, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Overall, I found Euro Truck Simulator 2 to be a well-crafted and enjoyable game. It's a great choice for fans of driving simulators or anyone looking for a relaxing and immersive experience.

Here are some of the most popular Euro Truck Simulator 2 DLC expansions:

* **Scandinavia:** This expansion adds Sweden, Norway, and Denmark to the game, giving players a chance to explore the stunning landscapes of the Nordic countries.

* **Vive La France!:** This expansion adds France to the game, with detailed recreations of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.

* **Beyond the Baltic Sea:** This expansion adds Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the game, offering players a chance to experience the Baltic states' rich history and culture.

* **Italy:** This expansion adds Italy to the game, with stunning recreations of Rome, Florence, and Venice.

* **Going East!:** This expansion adds Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to the game, providing players with a chance to explore the heart of Central Europe.

* **High Power Cargo Pack:** This expansion adds new cargo types to the game, such as oversized loads and dangerous goods.


If you're looking for a relaxing and immersive driving simulator, I highly recommend Euro Truck Simulator 2. With its vast map, realistic physics, and numerous DLC expansions, there's something for everyone to enjoy.",1706181805,1706181805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Uncheck the map expansion DLC in game preferences and play the game on the base map to get achievements like discover 100% of the map (Pathfinder).

The controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both simulation enthusiasts and casual gamers. The learning curve is gentle, allowing players to focus on the joy of the journey rather than wrestling with complex mechanics.

The heart of Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the vast and beautifully rendered open-world map of Europe.

This game has captivated players worldwide with its attention to detail, expansive virtual world, and an immersive driving experience that transcends the mundane. As someone who has delved into the world of ETS2, I can confidently say that it's not just a game; it's a joyous journey through meticulously crafted landscapes and a celebration of the art of trucking.

One of the most striking aspects of Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the sheer authenticity embedded in every pixel of its virtual world. From the meticulously recreated trucks to the diverse landscapes spanning across Europe, the game sets a new standard for realism in the simulation genre. The attention to detail is awe-inspiring, with accurately modeled cities, realistic weather conditions, and a day-night cycle that adds an extra layer of immersion.

The variety of trucks available in ETS2 is a truck enthusiast's dream come true. Each vehicle is meticulously designed, showcasing the unique characteristics of different manufacturers. Whether you're navigating the winding roads of the Alps or cruising down the autobahn, the sensation of being behind the wheel of a powerful truck is remarkably well-captured. The realistic physics engine further enhances the driving experience, making every turn, acceleration, and braking maneuver feel authentic.

The game's expansive map, featuring a vast network of roads connecting cities and countries, adds a sense of grandeur to the overall experience. From the bustling urban landscapes to the serene countryside, ETS2 offers a diverse range of environments to explore. The attention to detail in recreating iconic landmarks and landscapes is commendable, making each journey a visual treat. As you traverse through the various regions, the game seamlessly transitions between different terrains, creating a dynamic and engaging driving experience.

One of the most appealing aspects of Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the level of customization it offers to players. From choosing your truck's make and model to customizing its appearance and performance, the game allows you to create a personalized virtual trucking experience. The extensive array of tuning options and accessories ensures that each player can tailor their vehicle to suit their preferences, adding a layer of personalization that enhances the sense of ownership.

Started in Poland and was absolutely shocked how hideous the visuals are compared to ATS - what a first impression to the impressive vistas in the USA, disgusting! Where is the sense of scale, too - they haven't balanced density for that visceral experience! The environments, too, look so artificial as asset sets, they're rather 'PS2' tier in quality! Maybe it's redeemed in modding, or it use to be high to people's standards, but it's horribly outdated currently - quality seems inconsistent everywhere and so evidently needs a reboot from the GROUND UP.

This obviously needs a reboot or fundamental redesign, I don't think users should depend on modding to salvage an increasingly obsolete experience.

Sometimes they follow traffic rules religiously and sometimes.......are you sure they arent drink driving?????????

Their lane shows they have to give way but they dont, they just zip past drive right across in front of me, forcing me to stop when I have the right of way.

The even better bug? Driving right beside them on the highway and they just turn on their signal and turn right straight into your lane. WHAT THE HELL, USE UR EYES MATE, BRAIN, WHATEVER HECK YOU HAVE USE THEM AND SEE MY BIG A$$ TRUCK DRIVING BESIDE YOU!!!!!

Look, I know many drivers do this in real life where the moment they turn on their signal they immediately change lane, that is after they have checked their surroundings is clear. This a game, cant you guys do something about this?

The best part of this game? Turn on your favourite music and cruise on the highway, it is relaxing, calming until these maniacs, rogues destroy your experience and turn it into road rage.

You gotta love driving 100km/hr and straight into these maniacs/rogues for revenge and then reloading the save xD

There is too much problem in this game, here you have a truck that slows down to 10km/hr just to exit a really really straight exit off the main road?!?!?!?!? Btw this is called road hogging, it is an offence here in my country fyi, not even kidding you get demerit points for that during test.

80km/hr speed limit and we have AI trucks idk speeding 85, 90km/hr? I am already on 83, 84 and still I cant catch up to them, this completely destroys the realism of the game.

Tailgating between 2 trucks. seriously? There is less than half a car length for god's sake!!!! Even I dont even have balls of steel to tailgate the AI that close lol.

You still can have fun with this game but the AI is way too inconsistent with their driving, it is kind of frustrating.

I am not done here btw, next the AI train, OI stop messing about mate!!!!!! Just please I beg you even jesus and the hall of gods are BEGGING YOU TO MOVE SO THE HOLY GATES OF HEAVEN CAN BE OPENED!!!!!! The gates are closed with both sides of the traffic having come to a complete stop so why arent you moving????? Why are you stopping before the gates????? 

Way way too many bugs in this game, it is starting to break the enjoyable relaxing simulation side of this game. FIX ALL OF THEM",1432657096,1705680202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

- Very easy to run on older laptops. (Ex. 60 FPS on i7-6600U integrated)
- Huge map, with well worth DLC if on sale
- Relaxing game play that stays fun for hours at a time
- Mods add more to the game, and constant updates from devs keep things fresh

Cons:

- THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE: There is very little action or competitiveness, and slow progression. This is both to the games detriment and its success
- Outdated graphics (Easy to run but show their age)
- 70% of the map is payed DLC (The DLC is 100% worth it, but still)
- Not enough variation in game play. Its almost the same every time (However this is intentional)

Verdict:

85 / 100

(- 7 Graphics)
(- 2 Game play)
(- 6 Map DLC)",1705606350,1705606350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

Realistic Driving Experience: Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) provides a remarkably realistic driving experience, capturing the nuances of long-haul trucking. The attention to detail in vehicle physics, road dynamics, and weather effects contributes to an immersive simulation.

Expansive Map and Scenic Routes: The game features a vast and meticulously crafted map, offering scenic routes through various European landscapes. The attention to detail in city layouts, landmarks, and countryside visuals adds to the authenticity of the driving experience.

Vehicle Customization: ETS2 allows players to customize and upgrade their trucks, from aesthetic elements like paint and accessories to performance-enhancing modifications. This adds a personal touch to the gameplay and allows players to tailor their trucks to their preferences.

Relaxing Gameplay: The laid-back nature of the game makes it a unique and relaxing experience. The absence of time pressure and the option to enjoy the journey at one's own pace contribute to a therapeutic and stress-free gameplay environment.

Diverse Cargo and Jobs: The game offers a wide variety of cargo types and job contracts, providing players with the opportunity to explore different facets of the trucking industry. From transporting delicate goods to oversized loads, the diverse missions add depth to the gameplay.

Cons:

Limited Interaction Outside the Truck: While the focus is on the driving experience, some players may find the lack of meaningful interaction outside the truck limiting. More detailed depots, rest areas, or exploration elements could enhance the overall immersion.

Repetitive Tasks: The core gameplay loop involves driving from point A to point B, and some players may find the tasks repetitive over time. Additional mission variety or dynamic events on the road could mitigate this aspect.

Graphics and Animation Quality: While the graphics are generally good, ETS2's visuals might feel somewhat dated compared to more recent simulation games. Improvements in graphics and animations could further elevate the overall presentation.

Learning Curve for Beginners: For players unfamiliar with truck simulation games, the initial learning curve can be steep. A more comprehensive and interactive tutorial system might help newcomers ease into the complexities of truck driving and management.

Conclusion:

Euro Truck Simulator 2 delivers a serene and authentic trucking experience that caters to a niche audience seeking a laid-back simulation. The game's realistic driving mechanics, expansive map, and customizable trucks contribute to its charm. While some may find the gameplay repetitive, ETS2's unique appeal lies in its tranquil atmosphere and the joy of exploring the open road. For those looking to unwind with a leisurely virtual road trip, Euro Truck Simulator 2 remains a standout choice in the simulation genre.",1705401789,1705401789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]TLDR: [b]Euro Truck Simulator 2[/b] - start off with a basic truck, but as you complete more deliveries, you earn money to upgrade your truck or even buy new ones, and later you manage your own delivery business. Euro Truck Simulator 2 takes you behind the wheel of a colossal rig, where slow burns and meticulous maneuvers reign supreme. This game isn't about adrenaline; it's about mastery, precision, and feeling the satisfying rumble of a 40-ton beast beneath your fingertips.[/i]

Euro Truck Simulator 2, developed by SCS Software, is more than just a driving game; it's a virtual exploration of European roads with a business management twist. This game offers an immersive experience for anyone who dreams of commanding an 18-wheeler through the diverse landscapes of Europe.

[b]Gameplay and Mechanics[/b]

You begin with a modest truck, earning your keep by delivering goods. Each successful delivery adds to your wallet, allowing you to upgrade your truck or buy new ones. But it's not just about driving – you're also in charge of your own delivery business. It's a slow but rewarding process, turning your one-man operation into a thriving logistics empire.

The game stands out for its attention to detail. Driving feels real – every truck has its unique handling, and the weight of your cargo affects your driving experience. It's about mastering the gears, understanding the power of air brakes, and handling every turn and stop with precision.

The game's control system is quite versatile: you can opt for a simple keyboard and mouse setup or go for a full-blown steering wheel and pedal setup for a more authentic experience. The game also supports head-tracking devices, which add to the immersion. I've mostly used an Xbox controller with a webcam for headtracking.

ETS2 is also about managing your trucking business. You can take bank loans, purchase trucks, hire drivers, and eventually build your own logistics company. The economic aspect is well-designed, providing a gradual progression from a lone driver to a business mogul. 

[b]Graphics and Sound[/b]

ETS2 offers stunning and accurately represented landscapes, cityscapes, and famous landmarks. The level of detail in the environmental design is impressive. Weather effects like rain and fog are not only visually impactful but also affect driving conditions, adding to the realism. Textures for roads, buildings, and vegetation still look good, creating a sense of authenticity. 

The day and night cycle, along with dynamic weather, ensures that no two journeys are the same. Driving through the misty mornings of the English countryside or the sun-drenched highways of Italy, each journey offers a unique visual treat.

While Euro Truck Simulator 2 might not boast cutting-edge graphics of the latest AAA titles, it excels in creating a cohesive and realistic atmosphere through a blend of detailed environments, dynamic weather, and immersive sound design. There are some limitations like jagged edges and low-poly models in some areas.

Trucks feature unique and realistic engine sounds that vary depending on engine type, load, and driving conditions. The rumble of the engine becomes an integral part of the gameplay experience. Wind, rain, and bird calls create a dynamic soundscape that adds to the immersion. Changing road surfaces like gravel or cobblestone have distinct audio cues. The radio offers a diverse selection of licenced music with various genres.

[b]Customisation[/b]

Customisation is another strong point of the game. You can customise your trucks extensively, from engines to paint jobs. Truck customisation options are quite extensive, allowing you to showcase your unique style and preferences.

You can choose from a wide range of colours and designs, including solid colours, metallic finishes, and more intricate designs. Some designs are inspired by real-world truck livery, while others are unique to the game. You can apply decals, decorate the cab interior with toys or devices like laptops and customise dashboards.

Adding auxiliary lights, such as roof-mounted spotlights or LED strips, enhances the truck's appearance and improves visibility during night driving. Different styles and colours of headlights not only change the appearance of the truck but also affect visibility in different weather conditions.

Upgrading the engine can improve speed, acceleration, and overall performance. This is particularly useful for hauling heavier loads or improving fuel efficiency. Customising the transmission can affect how the truck handles different terrains and loads, offering a balance between power and fuel economy. Changing the chassis can alter the truck's turning radius, stability, and ability to handle different types of cargo.

Finally, you can upgrade accessories - custom wheels, tires, hubcaps, exhausts, front grills, light bars, and more. You can modify trucks to look more rugged, sleek, or even flashy.

[b]Content and Modding[/b]

The modding community and the integration of Steam Workshop play a crucial role in enhancing and expanding the sim's capabilities, with thousands of mods available to customise your gameplay.

The game's developer has released a variety of DLCs since the game's launch, each bringing unique features and content. Expansion packs add new territories, cargo and trailer types, and paint jobs and customisations. The regional expansions not only add new geography but also include regional changes in traffic rules, road types and tolls, ferry transport, and more, enhancing the authenticity of the experience. The base game map has received updates and improvements over time, while some older DLCs are being reworked to match the newer standards. Keep an eye out for updates and news from the developers to get the most out of your experience.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]

The multiplayer aspect is hugely popular. It allows you to convoy with friends or strangers, adding a social element to the long hauls. Multiplayer extends beyond simple cruising. Join forces with your crew to tackle challenging contracts together. Combine resources, strategise deliveries, and witness your collective company rise to new heights.

You can spice up your trucking experience with community-organised events and races. Test your skills against other drivers in coast-to-coast contests, participate in themed convoys like ""Neon Trucks at Night,"" and discover new ways to enjoy the game with others.

Stage #1 

- Plays on a crappy old laptop, barely able to run it with 30 fps, all settings on minimum, 720p is a luxury, handles the truck with keyboard only, crashes a lot, doesn't take career any seriously, Shifts and everything else is automated as the game was on easy difficulty, doesn't use any mods. Probably between 10-50 hours of playtime.

Stage #2

- Plays on a mid-tier PC, is able to run the game on 1080p with constant 60 fps on high settings, handles the truck with keyboard and mouse, tries his best to not crash or violate any traffic laws, and takes career somewhat seriously. Shifts and most truck-related settings are set to manual, and uses a few Workshop mods. Probably between 50-150 hours of playtime.

Stage #3

- Plays on high-end PC, is able to run the game on 2K or 4K with constant 120 fps on ultra settings, handles the truck with a real force-feedback wheel like Logitech or Thrustmaster, almost never makes any mistakes during delivery. All truck-related settings are manual for him, uses as many Workshop mods as it makes sense, and the mods folder is loaded with ProMods files. Probably between 150-250 hours of playtime.

Stage #4

- Plays on god-tier PC, doesn't use flatscreen monitors anymore, uses one of the best VR headsets available on the market, handles the truck with a force-feedback wheel and a manual gear shifter as well. His settings are the result of carefully curated settings that been put together by years of ETS2 experience, all the mods are pushing the game to it's possible limits for truck driving simulation, and inside the headset the game looks as sharp and fluid with a high framerate that it makes the user forget reality. Probably between 250-1500 hours of playtime.

Stage #5

- Gives up on virtual reality truck driving, sells his house and belongings, leaves job and wife, buys a truck and becomes a real-life truck driver. Probably between 1500-lifetime hours of real life.

Me between stage #3 and #4

Unstable running on native Linux.

Will most likely crash on opening and going through customisation of your truck. It crashes so often in that menu that the game tells me it is likely due to mods, with none installed.

Will also crash at random while driving but this is unlikely and doesn't happen often. Just often enough to be noticeable and annoying.

I have found I can brute force customisation, by running the game in Proton 8, compatibility settings. Though regular game-play will crash the game in anywhere from 10-30 minutes time later.

I drove about for a while and got to grips with manoeuvring my vehicle, delivering plenty of loads. But after a while I got bored. In fact, I fell asleep at the wheel. This was so dangerous that I decided to be an honourable citizen and uninstall the game in case I caused another accident!

Coming back to the game over a year later it's been improved but I think the settings interfaces are cluttered. If you like flight simulators with every conceivable control then this is for you. I prefer a straightforward driving experience with a good amount of settings but not innumerable options. Also these juggernauts are a bit too wide for many roads in my view, especially when turning right at lights with traffic about. I used a gamepad with keyboard but could not get an accurate steering setting. Often turning was too slow and laboured whereas on other roads it was too severe (under the same setting that is). I got fed up changing the dozens of settings after a time.

I only played it on a controller because I don't own a driving setup, but the controller support is great and in combination with Steam Input, my DualSense worked flawlessly.

I would recommend to absolutely anyone to install the ProMods and RusMap modifications to make the drivable map bigger and better quality.

The performance isn't the best because the engine doesn't use the newest rendering technologies, but that should be coming in the 1.50 update, so I'm looking forward to that.

The gameplay is dynamic and you always have to drive from point A to point B, passing beautiful scenery and going through cities and small towns. However after some time the game may get a bit boring and repetitive. Thankfully there are many map and job DLCs, and mods. Multiplayer is there too, making the game more lively.

The devs are always working to improve, and add new features & content to the game. There's a unique calming effect this game has on you cruising from country to country delivering goods. As long as you don't try to yeet your truck off a bridge, the economy is very forgiving and easy to grow in.

There are also a lot of settings you can tweak to personalize your experience more, for example road events like detours can be increased or decreased to fit your preference of difficulty. You can also increase the chances of rain if you enjoy driving in it, you likewise can decrease it if you dislike driving in in-climate weather.

Just recently I got myself a steering wheel and bought a few bangers to go with it, whilst downloading them I decided to give this another try seeing as I now had the wheel, absolutely 0 regrets.

Cruising through lanes in different countries across Europe with the steering wheel is genuinely the most laid-back fun I've had in all my years of gaming, the wheel was super easy to set up and aside from having to set a few buttons and having to switch a few game settings (I'd recommend turning off the truck speed limiter AND allowing time zones), everything else can be left untouched.

Right off the bat the game has you working as a sub-contractor for other companies, by the time you've done your first few missions the bank will make available to you a higher loan arrangement which will cover you for a garage upgrade, a couple of trucks and a potential new employee. From here you can get your company started up and there's honestly nothing complicated about it, the whole process is pretty straight forward and barely needs any explaining.

Online play is jokes and all, I've had some right shits and giggles doing contracts with mates, unfortunately you can't share contracts with friends if the contracts require skills they don't have, keep this in mind for anyone looking to play with their mates online.

The map in general is pretty bless, being a literal truck simulator game you can probably imagine that you're going to spend a lot of time on the open road where there's going to be a lot of open fields and foresty areas, but dotted around there's actually some really nice scenic locations that are so nice to drive around.

One thing I would say is that I'm not a fan of the big signs that are put up all over roads to prevent the player from going out of bounds, don't get me wrong I understand that the devs don't want to spend time working on an irrelevant area of the game, but when I'm on the road swinging about on a truck, one of the last things that I want to see is a big fuck off from all of the devs reminding me that I can't just go wherever I want, these signs can be a bit much at times and make the experience feel rather linear (although I promise it's not, the map is actually quite large and diverse and there is a lot to explore).

As of the time of me writing this review I don't have any of the DLC so I don't know if this is just an issue with the old map content, but to say the very least cities do a pretty convincing job of looking impressive on the way into them and then fall completely short the moment you're driving through them, once you're actually inside of a city you realise that just like much of the map there's only a few directions to go and it's not exactly like you can just wander off and ""explore"" a city. A good example of this is London, on your way up there it looks bustling, by the time you're driving through it you realise it's not long before you're out of London again.

For just short of £30 for the base game and all DLC I really can't see any reason as to why I wouldn't recommend this game, for how a truck simulator could go this is pretty fucking on point, pull out penjamin and get a few blinkers down the hatch and next thing you know you're speeding through Germany.",1701937035,1704756600,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It's so immersive, especially with the tons of mods you can run. From time to time, it can get a bit repititave, but I just take breaks, and the next day, I'm just excited to embark on a journey again, get fined for speeding, crash and go repair, get sleepy, and find a place to park, rest, and tank. Not to mention, I loved the fact that the world has my home town, and it's so nice to drive on the same streets, which I usually use to get to work almost every day. I would recommend this game all day, every day, hands down. It does take a little bit of time to get used to it, but it's so worth it and fulfilling after a certain point.

Pro tip: find the weirdest radio station possible and haul some crap your whole evening while listening to it - very meditative, trust me. I don't recommend playing this game with keyboard and mouse, if possible - buy a steering wheel with pedals. 
Also, have to mention that some cities are way too small and underdeveloped (yeah you won't see any trucks in a city center, but come on some capital cities have merely 3 buildings, while tiny towns are fully equipped with infrastructure). Game definitely lacks some ""events"" while on the road, such as: random tire blowouts, random engine/ABS lights turning on or other annoying mechanical issues. Would also be cool to do some tedious documents at shippers and/or receivers. Anyways, game's a 10/10, try it out, especially when on sale!",1700929642,1704551935,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[b]What is it about?[/b] The game is about to make an simulation of driving an truck. You drive around the Europe and deliver. Most of the time you spend making money or costumising truck. It's really good game only if you like trucks. There are truck companies such as Scania, Volvo, Man, Mercedes, Iveco.

[b]What about mods?[/b]
The game has mods. There are 2. options how to get mods. 1. You will download then from the workshop, and the 2nd way is to download them from the internet and paste them into the mods folder.

[b]Price[/b]
The price is probably normal price for game. If you don't want to spend 20$ wait till there will be an sale. When is sale all of the DLC's and the price of the game will get down. Then it's sale it cost 5$.

This is probably all from the game. And now let's get to the things that I like and don't like.

[b]Thing that I like:[/b]
1. Big map even if it has no DLC's
2. Alot of costumisations for a truck. (I recommend to buy an DLC's for tuck costumisation.)
3. You can choose what truck you want.
4. It's multiplayer so you can play with your friend's.
5. Very good looking map.
6. Alot of cities and countries.

Now the thing that I don't like:
1. Not so much realistic without a gaming wheel or mod's
2. Weather is not that brutal.
3. You cannot get out of the truck and connect trailer by yourself.

If you like trucking or trucks then you can't beat either game ETS2 or ATS. I do find ETS2 a bit more boring because the so far the speed limit I've come across is 80 KPH and that is to slow for me lol that's like 50 MPH and I find it very boring to drive that slow. I turned off traffic fines and now I do the car speed limit that's usually 100 or 120 KPH that's more of a speed I like and no I'm not a truck driver IRL nor have I ever towed a trailer IRL. Also for americans don't go through yellow stop lights I got a big fine at the very start of my game because a light turned yellow and then red immediately so basically there is no warning to stop it's green yellow for a second then red so slam on all your brakes if you see yellow.,1704515365,1704515365,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

But I have to admit, with a little patience and perseverance, one can quickly master the basics and move onto more advanced challenges. I don't have the fastest latest gaming PC, but that hasn't marred the overall average 70 fps gameplay and quiet realistic immersive graphics quality.

It's has an easy to use UI and clear narration throughout the initial game & profile setup, explaining jobs and operator tasks is also easy for a noob like me to follow. I can't offer much in the way of input about the game, as I haven't played it long enough to form a constructive opinion either way, with only an hour or so behind the wheel.

Obviously, there's not much more than the title here - you drive truck, earn money, get better truck, then go into some management of your company via employees and truck beds, but really, you just wanna keep driving truck. Truck can become cooler-looking, but you still drive truck.
Similarly obvious is that it gets repetitive relatively quick, but that's the case with a lot of games that are good still. You just have to find your own pace, to find periods of time to let a game sit still, then come back to it fresh and intrigued, even for a couple of hours at a time.

Pros: 
- Relaxing
- Variety of trucks and places
- A lot of mods
- Beautiful landscapes

Cons:
- Map is very small
- Can get very boring sometimes
- Mods can be incompatible on new updates making them obsolete
- Lots of DLC that are very expensive when buying all (I personally only bought the Iberia  and France DLC but i may buy the Balkans one since its new and nice)

As a general review, I think the game is worth it if you´re looking for it specifically, but if you´re not putting any time into the game, It´s not very worth it. I have bought it because I have seen a lot of people play it. 

About wheel support: Wheel support is amazing on windows but on Mac is confusing. You have to invert pedals and there is no option for Force Feedback. I play in G920 which is the best budget wheel.

The game itself is very relaxing and since it´s a simulator, feels realistic.

[h3]Pros: [/h3] [b]🚚 Drive Trucks in Europe[/b] Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a simulation game where players deliver important cargo by driving trucks in Europe.

Greetings, fellow gamers and denizens of the icy HowlStrom! I'm Scootaloo, a 19-year-old school-age Pegasus pony, who's been gaming all my life. Living with the ice wolf clan under the guidance of Kiba Snowpaw, I've embarked on a virtual journey through Europe in the driver's seat of ""Euro Truck Simulator 2"" by SCS Software. Let me share with you my detailed critique and experience.

[h2]Setting off on the European Roads[/h2]
""Euro Truck Simulator 2"" offers an open-road experience that mirrors the freedom I feel soaring above HowlStrom. As a Pegasus accustomed to the thrill of flight, the transition to ruling the roads as a trucker was an unexpected yet engaging shift.

[h3]Gameplay: A Symphony of Driving Dynamics[/h3]
The game's core lies in its realistic simulation of truck driving across Europe. Each city, from the UK to Poland, presents unique challenges and landscapes, akin to the diverse terrains of HowlStrom. The attention to detail in the truck's mechanics and the strategic planning required for successful deliveries resonated with my adventurous spirit.

[i]Strengths[/i]:
- The immersive driving experience, offering a sense of control and freedom
- Extensive customization options, allowing for a personal touch to each truck
- A vast network of roads and cities, providing endless exploration opportunities
- Regular updates and expansions, keeping the game fresh and engaging

[i]Weaknesses[/i]:
- Occasionally repetitive gameplay, which can feel like traversing the same snow-covered paths of HowlStrom
- A steep learning curve for beginners, much like learning to navigate the icy winds of my homeland

[h3]Visuals and Ambiance[/h3]
The game's graphics bring Europe to life with stunning realism. From bustling city streets to serene countryside, the visuals are a feast for the eyes, much like the majestic views of HowlStrom. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add to the immersive experience.

[h3]Community and Multiplayer[/h3]
The addition of the Convoy multiplayer mode creates a sense of camaraderie among players, reminiscent of the pack mentality in HowlStrom. Sharing the road with friends enhances the gameplay, making each journey a shared adventure.

[h3]Scootaloo's Final Verdict[/h3]
""Euro Truck Simulator 2"" is a captivating escape into the life of a trucker, offering a blend of relaxation and challenge. It's a testament to the joys of virtual exploration and the satisfaction of a job well done.

[b]Rating[/b]: [i]8.5 out of 10 HowlStrom Stars[/i]

In conclusion, ""Euro Truck Simulator 2"" is a game that offers a unique and engaging experience. It might not match the thrill of flying through HowlStrom, but it provides its own kind of adventure on the open roads of Europe.

For example, the cities in the game is poorly designed. You cannot enter the city centre and explore it, you can only see the landmarks from a distance. If you expect this game to have detailed cities then this game is not for you. (games like fernbus coach simulator has much better cities that you can actually explore, more landmarks and better looking textures). 

Plus the game feels very dead, there aren't much pedestrians on street and you would always have this strange feel of emptiness and awkwardness.

Thoughts racing through your head? 
Can't focus?
Just need to turn the brain off for a bit?

If you answered ""yes"" to more than one of these questions, this game might be just for you.
This game is quite relaxing and calming as you barrel down the roads across the Europe, hauling anything from used packaging to heavy machinery (with appropriate DLC) and dry goods between locations.

The gameplay loop is quite satisfying and there is just something strangely ""zen"" about the landscapes and the vistas around the Europe (somewhat scaled down).

The game was released after American Truck Simulator, but the differences are not major. The main difference in the game is that the scenery is much more detailed and the roads are more narrow and challenging and there is less monotony. In some areas there are a lot of toll booths and security checkpoints which is a little annoying but they become routine eventually.

The game is a little bit DLC-heavy, but aside form map packs and cargo packs that allow more cargo types, they are not really required. The map DLCs cover most of the EU, with plans to cover the entire EU. I believe so there will be plenty more to explore in the future.

Would I recommend buying this full price? Maybe.
On a sale? Definitely, with a few map expansions.",1703961573,1703961573,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Plusy:
Można fajnie spędzić czas z znajomymi
Zwiedza się różnorakie kraje
Odświeżają stare tereny, więc może w końcu dostaniemy rework przepięknej Polski <3 
Ładnie odwzorowane ciężarówki i miasta (które dostały reworka więc nie wszystkie)
Oryginalne naczepy (niestety DLC trzeba)


Minusy:
Dużo DLC, i żeby był FUN trzeba niestety wydać trochę pieniędzy na dodatki
Niektóre tereny chyba pozostały zapomniane przez twórców nie mowa tu tylko o Polsce ale również o Czechy, Słowację czy Wielką Brytanię. 

Ale gierka ogólnie godna polecenia, pozdrawiam z rodziną

I started to play back at launch I always tipped over the truck every quick job 🙃 
I bought my first truck (It really sucked)
I couldn't even carry small load.

The roads and landscapes are based on real locations, and the traffic and weather are dynamic and unpredictable. You have to follow the rules of the road, such as speed limits, traffic lights, and tolls, and you have to manage your fuel, fatigue, and damage. You also have to deal with the challenges of parking, loading, and unloading your trailer.

You can choose from different types of jobs, such as quick jobs, freight market, or external contracts, and earn money and experience. You can use your money to buy new trucks, upgrade them, or customize them with paint jobs, accessories, and decals. You can also buy garages, hire drivers, and assign them to trucks and jobs. You can improve your skills and reputation by completing different types of deliveries, such as urgent, long distance, fragile, or eco-friendly, and unlock new perks and rewards.

The game is also very mod-friendly, with a lot of community-made content available to download and enhance your experience. You can find mods that add new trucks, trailers, maps, traffic, weather, sounds, and more. You can also join online multiplayer servers and interact with other players.

Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game that will appeal to anyone who enjoys driving, simulation, or management games.

This is [u] not the game for everyone [/u] it it for those who like something that is monotonic. I find this game meditative. I am not looking for the simulation reality. I have limited knowledge for autos in general, so it is out of my bounds of comprehension. What I can say that it has a decent graphics, great ideas for a gameplay, great settings for a little bit ease down the gameplay for some guys like me, who do not care much of the simulation reality, and (as I get it) for someone who whants more simulation like manually using the transmission system.

[h2] The labor of love so to say [/h2]

You can add about 300+ hours to my score in this account since I remember playing on my dad's PC in my school years. It is astonishing that after quite many years (regarding the game dev industry) updates are still going and not just small updates for bug fixing but the whole new things in the game.

It's insane. The ammount of accuracy,and situations is so good for a game. I bought Road to the black sea dlc last week,and it's the most realistic dlc out of all since i live in Romania. They literally got everything right from the roads to the houses and enviroment. Even the plants are accurate to real life. its honestly insane.

This is a very legit open-world game, for one, spanning much of Europe, especially if you've collected all the DLC.  ETS2 also offers the chance to become a trucking tycoon of sorts - with the ability to bring on new garages, employees, trucks, trailers, and more.  

The game's economic layer, with banking and loans to repay, adds an enjoyable challenge and lends depth that a pure-play driving simulator would struggle to attain.  Repairing, restoring, customizing, and upgrading your trucks is also a real treat, with physical effects on driving (e.g.  maximum freight/cargo weight, acceleration, hill traversal, maneuverability, etc.) that often make the expense quite worthwhile.

Driving itself is a heady mix of beauty (the HD skyboxes are often gorgeous), challenge, relaxation, and time management.  There's plenty of variety in the job market, which only expands further as you open up new skills, locations, and even your own trailers.

Capsule review: addictive, beautiful, relaxing (although it can be tense at times), challenging, and rewarding.   Highly recommended.

The big problem is that it lags a little bit when driving. And for my suggestion is, this game needs to have forward collision warning, which trucks will use an audible sound to detect the driver to the oncoming collision. If the driver fails to take action, the automatic emergency braking system is activated in order to prevent the collision to vehicles.

It's a must-have for all truck enthusiasts but also for people who enjoy just casually cruising on the roads. The base game itself is worth it, but for the full experience, I recommend buying at least one of the DLC bundles (they're always 15% off). I recommend playing with either a steering wheel, or if you don't have one, a controller. Even with a very low-spec PC you'll be able to run the game smoothly and the graphics won't be that bad.

Some of the more important in-game aspects that need to be considered though are:
1. The traffic AI can get messed up sometimes and it can be a real pain to navigate the roads.
2. This only happened to me once, but the highway was blocked because of a huge accident and I got rerouted, but since there weren't any roads nearby, the GPS kept sending me in circles.
3. As I mentioned before, the base-game is really just Germany, Switzerland, northern Italy, northern France, and UK.
4. As mentioned before, mouse and keyboard are okay, but they're definitely not the best. A controller is the minimum to a smooth, non-problematic, and easy gameplay.

Altogether, I highly recommend the game, even with its little flaws. If you're looking for a relatively affordable, fun, easy to learn game (which involves driving around), then Euro Truck Simulator 2 is perfect for you.",1703500032,1703500032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Perhaps this game can get boring at a long term because it has no variation other than the places you go through, but it always has the capacity of entertaining me a few hours those boring days in which you don't have anything else to do.
It is visually very good though you can improve the graphics with mods, and the AI is sometimes annoying but acceptable over all.
I highly recommend the use of mods, the purchase of certain DLC's (in sale if possible) and playing online to improve your experience exponentially.

I mean, of course, you could do that if you wanted to, but I believe that many people play this game just because of how it makes them feel.
Free. Open. Liberated.
A game worth cherishing if you've got no competition in mind and just want to spend your time peacefully carrying trailers from one city to another, passing through countless forests and iconic landmarks that some major cities offer (some through DLC packs). Unlike games like Grand Theft Auto, for example, which would let you rush through the map with fast, exquisite vehicles, this focuses more on the follow-the-rules mechanism where you would drive your truck how you would in real life, following traffic laws and catching up with delivery deadlines. You keep track of your sleep and fuel that you can replenish at any one of the numerous gas stations that you can find across the map. Gives you a sense of realism and the slow-paced atmosphere of the game helps you soothe your mind and give it some time to relax.

It has decent graphics that don't turn your PC into an oven but still help you cherish the realism using good shadow and lightning effects. You can install mods from the amazing creations posted by community members on the Steam Workshop to customize your truck and trailer even further, making them look like your own. 

The only complaint I have with the game is that sometimes the freeways are very monotonous, with the shrubbery and the trees around you looking almost identical almost everywhere. Sure, there are mountainous regions and other different environments to drive in but most of the freeways are the same with very minimal change in the setting. A little more variety would've made me and others who think so, satisfied. 

Overall an amazing game with a lot of support from the devs and somewhat frequent updates with fixes and new content. The DLCs are worth getting and quite reasonably priced for what they offer.

If I see any other simulator games like this in the future, they'll always remind me of ETS2. :D",1703350419,1703350419,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now for this game i have a lot of things to say, i like trucks since i was in kindergarten so i'm kinda bias to reviewing this game, the models and graphic of the trucks is so detailed not just the outside but even on the inside, i like the driving physics as well because it gives me the sense of driving a real semi-truck (i never drive one in real life), i like how the cab lean and how the wheels bounce according to the surfaces of the road, i also like the raining physics it makes me feel like i'm driving in real-life too. The customization is very good, there's so many things to change to fit our taste and needs, not just the semi-truck itself but the trailer is also customizable. The settings of the game is pretty vast, not just the controls, audio, video settings but you can also fiddle with the gameplay settings like traffic density, weather variable, how fast the time of the day goes by, and bunch of other things to change to fit into your playstyle. I also appreciate the effort that they put to this game, like the cities and countries from Europe is as detailed as they are in real-life, the roads and the traffic lights and the building and the bridges.

In conclusion this game is worth it for you and those who likes stuff about trucks and all, this game i obviously is not an off-road truck driving but it's about logistic truck driving, you deliver stuff to the destination on time or even before the predicted expected time, you can play this game and relax you don't need to rush everything, just choose the mission with the time range that suits your capability, that way you can relax and really enjoy the game as you drive and progress trough it.",1703300508,1703300508,True,1,0,0.530303001403808594,0,True,False,False

Everybody knows it is as big as a world, it's made with fantastic attention to detail and with the latest lighting engine it looks better than anything demanding barely half of your PC's hardware power even if you forget to upgrade it for the last 10 years. It has a lot of trucks, trailers and loads for them so you will never be bored.

What else?

Everybody knows it has bugged speed limit that is prone to jump up and down without any proper signage causing police to charge you while you are not guilty. You will also be charged for every crash the AI car makes and who cares it's not your fault as you are probably guilty for driving in this game at the first place. 

The local AI is a legend in itself still doing strange things despite being 10 years in development and keeping the well-earned title 'Artificial Idiot'. It knows nothing about traffic rules, it yields when it should go and attacks you when it should stand still. It drives on red and stays on green, it can completely block the traffic on a 6-lane highway just to let a single car to pull out of a gas station. It is written by people who don't drive and the reason why almost nobody complains is the majority of players doesn't have a real life driving experience too.

Trucks galore is an illusion as at least half of them are unusable because of awful sound. I'm not talking aestetics, the engine noise contains very loud and unpleasant low frequency leftovers just physically unbearable to listen. How could anyone be so unprofessional? What went wrong? Deaf sound engineer? Maybe. Cheap headphones? Who knows. It is made as it was made by some chap within the small SCS team and nobody will return to revise it. 

SCS is a group of amateurs happened to be in their own niche making their niche product as good as they can. The game has more problems than many other titles and would probably fail if only there was at least one more contender... But there are none.

So.

Verdict: Euro truck simulator 2 is the best truck simulator at the moment. Number one out of... one.

P.S. There're no truck enthusiasts in SCS so if you are this type of person be prepared for the worse: incorrect badging, fictional options, missing parts and of course made-up chassis with unrealistic wheelbases. Trucks are just toys here.",1666803849,1703187105,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] PROS: [/h1]
Endless truck customization, especially if you use mods
Works with most steering wheels, super fun with force feedback
Stream real life radio stations in game
Great GPS navigation including voice
Lots of little things like ability to adjust mirrors and roll down windows
You can choose how realistic you want it to be, many settings can be changed.

[h1] CONS: [/h1]
The way tickets are given by police isn't very realistic (they just instantly take your money, you don't get ""pulled over"" or anything like that.
DLC areas have some significant framerate drops especially around the towns
AI traffic is a little too friendly and isn't all that realistic but there are mods to fix that
The modding rabbit hole goes deep. I play with like 27 mods active including things like weather and sound effect changes, interior decorations and many more which can lead to issues, but is hard to resist.

Weather effects are lovely. I even aquaplaned in the rain. The game has so many surprises.

A few bugs/issues, like traffic driving through road accidents and even crashing into them while the police stand around ignoring the pile up of new cars/coaches. Some rubber banding around accidents and busy graphical areas even though it says my FPS is 80+. Car drivers of course. Some road blocks can get you running around in circles and of course when you are late you get fined..Grrr!. Fined for cars driving into me...Grrr!.

1. While I'm fascinated with open world games, I haven't ever played a game of this scale. Let's take GTA V for example. The open world in that game is huge but only focused on one city. You might argue it's comparing apples to oranges, and that would be apt because the designers of that game have focused a lot more on details than say, ETS2 or ATS, for example. Fair point. But sometimes I want to travel large distances and see many different architectures, sights and significant changes in scenery over several days or nights without loading screens in between; kind of like a road trip. You can't do that in GTA V because it's confined to one city and you can go from coast to coast in a sportscar in under 4 minutes flat. Not the same kinda vibe. ATS and especially, ETS2 takes it to a new level. You just seamlessly transition from one country to another and witness the change in your surroundings in real time.

2. I'm a quiet, introverted person who likes to play games by myself but I'm unfortunately surrounded by extroverts who love talking my ear off, either on the phone or at work. I can't afford to play games that require significant attention investment when they're telling me their mundane bullshit; truck sims are great for playing while ""listening"" to them (or anything really, like even a podcast) because they don't require your full attention and intensive hand-eye coordination. You can also play them when you just want to smoke weed, eat pizza and chill with some relaxing music playing in the background.

But now it's got to a point where I find myself desperately trying to find something to listen to because the itch to play the game is there even when I don't have something else to do alongside.

Oh and just a heads up- I found ETS2's economy much harder than ATS':

- Garages cost more in ETS2 than in ATS

- Trucks cost more in ETS2 than in ATS

- Payouts are shittier with all DLCs in ETS2 than in ATS without any DLCs (with the all skills maxed out in both games)

- Vehicle insurances are a thing in ATS and for a small one time fee, you're covered for all damage for life whereas in ETS2, you break the bank everytime some dumbass scratches your truck

- Employees are more likely to turn up empty handed in ETS2 than in ATS

- Employees have negligible to negative income in ETS2 than in ATS

Believe it or not, there are people that do this, and they tell themselves that their lives are fulfilling. The rest of us know that work makes you free, and we buy DLC so that we can do imaginary work for even longer periods of time.

The main premise is simple: drive trucks. However, within this seemingly straightforward concept lies a world of enjoyment. The game offers a wide variety of trucks to choose from, and the thrill of unlocking numerous upgrades at different levels keeps you engaged and eager to progress.

One of the standout features is the sheer number of deliveries available, spanning various distances and locations. The sense of satisfaction from successfully completing these deliveries is oddly rewarding.

One minor downside, though, is that the map can feel a bit limited without all the available DLCs. However, even without the additional content, the game manages to offer an enjoyable experience.

What sets Euro Truck Simulator apart is its relaxing nature. It's not an action-packed behemoth; rather, it's a game that lets you unwind and enjoy the simplicity of driving through scenic routes.

Admittedly, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those seeking a more laid-back gaming experience, Euro Truck Simulator hits the mark. I liked it.",1702503973,1702503973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In my subjective opinion the game is great, it allows me to relax, get away from everyday worries, recharge my batteries, and after all, that's what it's all about.

Euro Truck Simulator 2 is constantly updated and, what is not common in games, it gets better every time. The developers really listen to the community, the interaction between the players and the developers is amazing. The community events, for which you can get items for your steam inventory, are interesting. Some of the community events are mirrored in events that happened in real life. As for the items you can get, they are truck/trailer paintings, interior decoration items, or the main menu background.

The physics of the trucks are not simulation, which may bother some, but for the most part I think it is enjoyable. The vehicles are easy to drive on the keyboard (especially with mouse steering), the game pad, but the most fun is with the steering wheel. The game allows you to choose the type of parking, for those who don't want to stress unnecessarily, you can choose to park easily or even skip it altogether. Of course, the truck needs to be refuelled and it is worth remembering that the vehicle and parts wear out from driving, or get damaged from accidents. Unfortunately, this damage is not visual.

The game has a company economy, where vehicles can be purchased, modified and employees can be hired to use the trucks purchased. The economy is not complicated or challenging, which can be a plus for beginners. The option to buy garages in European cities makes it easier to expand the company and provides space for the truck collection.

A game definitely worth buying, even more so because of the quality and quantity of content compared to the price. The DLCs extending the possibilities to explore the map of Europe are well worth the price, they add hours of additional entertainment and, despite the scaling of the map, are rich in detail, familiar buildings and monuments and, above all, made with commitment and love. Additions like the Italia DLC or the newly added Balkan areas are downright beautiful.

It is worth adding that the game has an official multiplayer mode, but there is also a huge TruckersMP mod that is supported by the game's developers.

TLDR it's worth buying, the game is often on promotion and provides many hours of gaming and relaxation.",1543084188,1702477849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll start with the cons to show its flaws first:
-It doesn't feel like a full simulator but more like an arcade. Buying the game for pure realism is a false hope. For example its missing features like dirt, scratches or different factors that should be done by nature. The resting periods aren't realistic and the money system feels to easy. You get way to much money, while in real life you earn €0.75 to €1.25 per km you'll get already €5-10 per km in the starting phase of your career. 
-It's missing some features like a full blockade of the highway and realistic traffic jams .
-The rain is very unrealistic. Taking pictures or just drivng around during rain looks bad as the rain looks more like little lazers than actual rain drops.
-There are to many dlcs. Starting with the many, many paint jobs which mostly aren't necesary as you get better options through mods. Then you have to many brand dlc without enough content. You can buy alot of truck and trailer addons but they lack of content. When installing 1 or 2 mods (SISL interior/Signs for trucks) you'll get more addons for the trucks than when buying the dlcs.
-They make to many different map addons. For example, there shouldn't be a greek dlc after selling the west balkans for 20€. And while working on the greek dlc, they are also putting work into supposable 11 more map dlcs(https://youtu.be/1og9xeh3n50?si=wkbIWOu2qBy_qZa6). I think its great that they're trying to expand the map but they should focus on rebuilding the older parts on the map and max. one new project at a time, as for example the west balkans feel badly optimized especially for low/mid-range pcs.
-The ingame performance is really bad. On some points of the map you'll get easily max fps (v-sync turned on) while on others you'll have ~20 and lags with the same graphic settings.
-The convoy mode is really bad. While it's hard to get it working in the first place, it it harder to join one as it has problems like, not showing the convoy of other people, being very laggy and having low fps. Also the AI has troubles with the convoy mode as they are driving on different rules (feels like driving in a polish city) in there.
-Another problem with AI is that they often forget you exist this problems often occurs with highway entrys as they seem to have not listened during driving school and just drive onto the highway at the end of the interweaving lane and just drive into your side. Also sometimes the AI just crashes into eachother and isn't able to sort it out getting stuck in the middle of the road, blocking the traffic leading to more AI crashes.
-Some added features feel badly done, e.g. the used truck dealer is to expensiv making it a bad alternative to the regular dealer. Also the new repair system is very unclear especially for new players and looks bad.
-The map editor is way to hard to obtain and is hard to understand and needs alot of knowledge before being usable.

These are in my opionion the biggest problems with the game. Some of them fall away if you e.g. dont want pure realism and just like to drive around.

My pros for the game would be that:
-You can always play the game, whenever you're bored you can just switch to ets2 and build new trucks, explore the roads, or have fun with mods.
-It's very easy to understand for new players, playing the game for 20-30 minutes is enough to understand the basics.
-The driving is done well, don't have a wheel? Just use a controller. DOn't have a controller or any battery? Just use your keyboard and mouse, it might feels weird in the  beginning but for simple driving its enough.
-The game can be modified really easy. You can download many good mods in the workshop but also using third party websites for mods is no problem.
-The fanbase is very friendly, unlike in other games the players are nice and open to help and play with you.
-The graphics can be astonishing just mind you that you'll need a highend pc for that. 
-The graphics are easy to adjust for low end pcs so you can get okayish graphics with a potato.
-SCS focuses on their games and keeps them as they are instead of releasing new games every year with barely any new content.
-SCS does listen to their fanbase and work more on stuff that their current players want instead of generating simple money.

Even tho I named a lot of cons, you musn't forget that they are my cons and you could have different views of whats important. If you want simple driving and something to do when bored you should buy it. If you're looking for pure realism it can be a options but you should look at different games like Alaskan road trucker or snow runner. Also you should expect that it can get expensive over time if you're buying a dlc sometimes. I personally love the game and couldn't live without it.

Took me a while to get it right but once you know what you are doing you are away.
There's something oddly satisfying about driving a truck, I cannot put it into words but all I can say is to give it a try and like myself you could fall in love with it.
They also allow mods to tinker/ experiment with which is new to me and I absolutely love it, but you must ensure the mods are compatible with the latest updates.
The gaming industry for me recently has been a bit of a let down but boy truck simulator soon changed that for me, I have not felt this attached to a game in years and would 100% recomend.

I come home from school and then play this game with my friend and I enjoy it. I think this game is more targeted at people who obviously like driving but are also more relaxed about when they play games. This game is very good on its own but it is a lot better with the DLCs. I recommend just buying them all when they are all on sale (that's what I did) because the game can get a little bit boring with the same jobs all the time. The only annoying thing about this game is that the DLCs are really expensive and the AI. Oh my gosh the AI is so annoying. You will have your indicator on and be switching lanes and it is all clear and then a police car out of nowhere catches you for not having your headlights on. Or you brake and then an AI car runs in the back of you giving you trailer damage, a crash offence which is normally around £200.

I love the way you can customize your truck and have to work your way up from ground zero. You start off working for a company, and eventually you buy your own truck and work for yourself. Then eventually you hire some people, buy trucks and expand your empire. This game is the most fun whilst playing with friends or using TruckersMP.

when I politely asked on steam discussion if anybody has a fix because I cant refund anymore I was told it is my computer and not the game by a moderator named Wolfgang.

I explained the game minimises to desktop every cca 10 min (from the log it actually looks like the autosave is causing it) and keeps running in the background so I always crash the truck and I tried window mode, real time priority in program manager and all things that were advised by devs to other people with this issue and for nobody they worked, thats why I came to the game discussion to ask if anybody by any chance knows a fix.

the discussion moderator was insisting it is not a game problem but my pc, that 'some program is asking for my attention' and thats why the game keeps minimising.

I tried to explain that no game should allow some invisible program to minimise out of full screen and throw you to desktop and in 17 years of gaming probably thousands of games on different computers I have never had this kind of issue. I must add I wasnt rude, I even added I like the game a lot but it is unplayable due to a frustration of never knowing when the game minimises and before you can maximise it, you hit your truck in full speed because its still running in the background. the moderator got angry and told me that I am too clever if I know more than devs and that correlation doesnt mean causation to which I told him I believe he didnt take enough covid boosters and if he could go away as he clearly cant help me and I dont need to argue with him, thats not the point of my thread. I was asking if somebody pls know a fix for this issue. I didnt ask anybody to start defending the game and accusing me of being the problem.

in the meantime somebody, I dont know if a dev or a modder joined the discussion and asked me for a game log. I posted the game log for the kind person who was trying to help but the sour moderator locked the thread so I cant get help.

now I am stuck with a game that doesnt work and I paid a lot of money for it because I bought all the main dlcs",1702242952,1702242952,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,2,True,False,False

Edit: Found a fix in the form of a mod posted in SCS Software forum. it is Temporal Anti Aliasing/DLSS/DLAA by snowymoon. There's also another fix by using Nvidia Profile Inspector posted in Roextended forum but for some reason it won't work for any resolution between (but not including) 720p and 1080p.

While those fixes help fixing the anti aliasing issue, i'd rather have a graphics option that is properly tested and implemented in the game by the devs rather than an external workaround that will probably stop working the second a new game update comes out.

Besides that, the game is amazing and is one of the best games in the simulator genre. It's continuously getting updated and have good quality DLCs but besides that it also have plenty of mods to customize the game. Highly recommend trying it out but i advise you to use the anti aliasing fix because otherwise the jagged edges will ruin your experience.",1701964905,1702011405,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It just keeps you hooked in for hours and hours and for those who are looking for a title that feels like doing something productive with gaming this is that game. Best part for me is that at first you will work for other people but after some work you can save enough money to buy your own truck and then lets you hire others to work for you. This means this is a game that shows you how you can build a business With noo money. Tac,1701665154,1701665154,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is very amazing. You can play together with other people or friends through convoy sections.
What makes it even more good? No one can tell you how you play your game. Play it how you want; with traffic, without traffic. Want to be fined or not? Go ahead! You can also turn of speed limits.

I really enjoy this game. I just wish more people in my friendlist would try out this game. It might just be 'silly driving around' for them, but for me it is more than just that. It gives me an understanding perspective of a truck driver and the 'blind spots' it has when you don't use the 3rd player cam.

Graphics: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) boasts stunning graphics that immerse players in a realistic and visually captivating trucking experience. The attention to detail in the landscapes, cities, and the trucks themselves is exceptional. The dynamic weather system adds an extra layer of realism, with raindrops trickling down the windshield and the sun casting long shadows across the highways. From bustling cityscapes to serene countryside, the graphics in ETS2 contribute significantly to the overall enjoyment of the game.

Truck Variety: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

One of ETS2's standout features is its extensive collection of meticulously modeled trucks from various manufacturers. Whether you're a fan of Volvo, Scania, Mercedes-Benz, or others, the game offers a diverse selection of vehicles, each with its own unique characteristics. The attention to detail extends beyond the exterior, encompassing the interior cabins and controls, providing an authentic feel for players who appreciate the nuances of different truck models.

Realistic Driving Physics: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

ETS2 excels in delivering a realistic driving experience. The physics engine accurately simulates the weight and handling of the trucks, requiring players to navigate turns, slopes, and varied road conditions with precision. The inclusion of features like trailer sway and realistic braking further enhances the immersion, making each journey feel like a genuine trucking adventure.

Open World Exploration: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The open-world design of ETS2 is expansive and richly detailed, offering a vast European landscape for players to explore. From major cities to scenic countryside, the game captures the essence of trucking across diverse terrains. The freedom to choose routes, explore hidden gems, and take on different jobs adds depth to the gameplay, providing a sense of freedom and discovery.

Career Progression: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

ETS2's career progression system is both engaging and rewarding. As players complete deliveries, they earn experience points and money, allowing them to unlock new trucks, upgrades, and access to more challenging and lucrative jobs. The sense of achievement and progression keeps players invested in the long haul, making every delivery feel like a step forward in their virtual trucking career.

Multiplayer Experience (Truckers MP): ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

For those seeking a social dimension, Euro Truck Simulator 2 supports multiplayer through a third-party program called Truckers MP. This feature enables players to convoy with friends, interact with others in the virtual trucking community, and engage in collaborative journeys. Coordinating deliveries, forming virtual trucking companies, and sharing the road with fellow players enhance the overall experience, turning a solo adventure into a dynamic and enjoyable journey.

In conclusion, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a masterclass in the simulation genre, offering a meticulously crafted world, realistic driving mechanics, and a wealth of content to keep players engaged. Whether you're a trucking enthusiast or a gamer seeking a unique and immersive experience, ETS2, along with Truckers MP, delivers on all fronts, earning its place as a must-play title.",1701534962,1701534962,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Seen the game develop with the Dev's looking at what the Mod community has done and adding features to the game.  

Convoy's are great fun with friends playing. (Even if they mocked you for buying it and now all have a copy).

Amazing game, 100% recommend! 

Pick up dlc's on sales as there are plenty and and the add up if your buying full price.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

1. Break eggs into a bowl, add salt and sugar. Mix with a whisk or fork until smooth (no whisking required).

2. Pour about 200 ml of milk into the eggs and stir.

3. Add flour and stir until smooth (the consistency of the dough is like thick sour cream).

4. Pour in the remaining milk (about 300 ml), stir. The dough should be liquid and easy to pour.

5. Pour in vegetable oil. Mix the dough and let stand for 15-20 minutes.

6. Heat a pan for pancakes (preferably cast iron) and grease it with a thin layer of vegetable oil.

7. Pour half a scoop or scoop of dough into the center of the frying pan (depending on the diameter of the frying pan) and quickly spread it over the entire surface in a thin layer, turning the pan slightly.

8. When the edges of the dough begin to dry out and slightly brown, lift the pancake with a thin wide spatula and carefully turn it over. Let the pancake brown a little on the other side.

9. Using a spatula, remove the finished pancakes from the pan, transfer to a plate and generously grease with melted butter.",1701441695,1701441695,True,1,0,0.514018714427947998,0,True,False,False

I'm enjoying it very much, it is always getting better and better with every and each expansion, bundle and update.

I only have three sugestions to do: first, in one of your next updates to the game, add to the Trucks (ex: Volvo; Mercedes; etc.) the Automatic Emergency Brake System ( only to those who have it in real life, of course); second, in one of the next map expansions, include Portugal and Spain ( and also their/its islands if possible); third, in one of the next expansions or bundles or updates, add more ""tuning"" accessories to truck brands like Volvo, Mercedes and Scania like you did with/in DAF trucks.

Thank you for creating and developing this wonderful game!
You are doing a nice and great job!

Overall, a very good game where you have to relax and just drive around. There is always a convoy where you can meet different personalities and ride with them. This game is aimed more at multiplayer, for example using the same mod, but the convoys work great too. True DLC is expensive and extremely necessary, but you can buy everything for 1500 rubles, if you're Russian and now discounts, and so it will cost a lot. I recommend buying this game and many hours of sessions, because you have to get used to it and find the meaning - and then you'll figure it out for yourself.",1669381329,1701184076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Never let us down. The latest updates are really promising and I was desperately in need of this server thing for a long time and finally, we have it. So, I can play with my local friends. The best thing that keeps me alive with you is your update feature without forcing us to buy the same game (as you know some… others 😂 just changing the year on the title) again and again.

Planning to buy all the DLCs in the future (Tons of DLCs)😁. Anyhow it’s necessary to keep the growth of this game right.

Hope that you are having plans on adding some cool features (which make us feel more realistic) to the game in upcoming updates and develop current requests from the players. As an engineer wish you the best of luck with your development on both ETS and ATS.
